   <p>In April of last year the Legislature of the State of Illinois instructed the representatives of Illinois in Congress to support their colleague, Congressman Lundin, in a motion for an old-age pension law, similar to the many European pension laws now in force. As a result of this motion a committee of seven members was appointed to investigate and study the European pension laws and to make a report of their findings not later than January 1, 1911.</p>
   <p>This is a very important matter, and the United States as a civilized country, should adopt a pension system for the aged, similar to the pension laws in force throughout Europe.</p>
   <p>It is true that the pension system for the aged is a new idea, but it really has been tried out before, and with great success, in several countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Denmark made the first attempt; England, France, and Austria followed. Germany and other nations are also experimenting.</p>
   <p>The Danish system pays a pension to all workers of sixty years of age or over. The amount of the pension is based on the place of residence, the state of health, and various other stipulations.</p>
   <p>New Zealand adopted a pension system in 1897. This system has been constantly improved until in 1908 it was pronounced sufficient. It provides that all workers attaining the age of sixty-eight shall be eligible to the pension provided they can prove twenty-five years of residence and that they have never been convicted of a major crime. The amount of the pension is $2.50 per week. All persons in the country must contribute to the general fund, and the amount which each one contributes is so small that it is almost negligible. But to the thousands of old people these pensions are a lifesaver. Although the amount of the pension is small, it is enough to provide them with the bare necessities of <span class="page-break">\3</span>life. They do not have to depend on their children or upon charity for their support.</p>
   <p>Comfortable homes with beautiful surroundings have been established for these old people. Here for ten dollars a month they can live in comfort and moderate luxury.</p>
   <p>Belgium established a pension in 1900; Italy, France, and Austria-Hungary have had a pension system for some time. It is being improved from year to year. Only recently they have decided to extend the pension privilege to all classes of people and to all the states in the country.</p>
   <p>Australia, after many trials, has finally established a pension law which went into effect July 1, 1909. This law provides that all women attaining the are of sixty and all men of sixty-five or over shall receive a pension of $2.50 per week.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The American consul at New Castle, New South Wales, writes that the establishment of the pension law was received with great praise. It is a necessary and forward step in the economic life of the people. I have watched about four hundred old people receive their pensions. It was a touching sight, and it more than ever convinced me of the need of similar legislation in the United States.</p>
   <p>England established a pension system only recently, and in comparison with other countries the amount to be received by the old people is very meager. It provides for a pension of 25 cents to 1.25 per week to all who have attained the age of seventy. We understand that Canada has adopted the same system. Norway and Sweden are now working out a pension system. In Germany a pension system was established in 1891 and another in 1899, but they were similar to the Italian and Austro-Hungarian pension systems, which applied only to a certain class of people and affected only about twenty-five per cent of the total population. Russia, Turkey, Spain, and Portugal have no pension system as yet and <span class="page-break">\5</span>are not very progressive. The United States and South America are also without any pension system.</p>
   <p>Congress should pass a pension law. We as a progressive country should hang our heads in shame. We are now classed with the most backward and unprogressive nations. Vast sums of money are spent for all manner of welfare work in the United States. Hospitals, shelters, orphan homes, homes for the aged, homes for the blind and for the crippled and many others are scattered throughout the country, financed by public funds, by private donations, and by charitable organizations.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless many people die of hunger, cold and disease. A meager pension of $2.50 a week would eliminate a great deal of this suffering among those unable to work because of old age.</p>
   <p>Many corporations are establishing pension systems for their employes; the railroads are doing likewise.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance at its last convention decided to build a home for the aged and crippled and is determined to find a way by which the death benefits will be payable in whole or in part in case the beneficiary is crippled for life.</p>
