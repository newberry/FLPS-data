   <p>The second party of Polish volunteers left for the training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake yesterday. Our brave boys departed, determined to teach the Kaiser a lesson and to avenge all the wrongs Germany has done Poland. They left with smiles on their faces, cheered by thousands of friends and relatives in the Polish neighborhoods and downtown.</p>
   <p>At about 10:15 in the morning, the volunteers gathered at St. Mary of the Angels Church. Mass for the departing soldiers was first celebrated by the Reverend F. Gordon, pastor of the parish, after which he delivered a very inspiring sermon that moved those in the church to tears. Reverend Gordon was assisted at mass by Reverends Tarasiuk and Stoinski.</p>
   <p>In his sermon, Father Gordon spoke of the heroic deeds of Polish arms, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>deeds of our great forefathers. He then passed on to present times and spoke of the task that rests upon the shoulders of the Polish Army volunteers who are going to battle for a free, independent, and United Poland. He spoke of the glorious dawn of freedom that will light up the Polish horizon, and his words were filled with a great love for Poland and the Polish cause. His words were listened to with great attention by everyone in the church.</p>
   <p>After the church services were concluded, the volunteers were taken to the parish hall, where a breakfast had been prepared for them. About three hundred volunteers and numerous invited guests and representatives of organizations participated. During the course of the breakfast, addresses were delivered by the following:</p>
   <p>Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, Mrs. A. Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, the Reverend Francis Gordon, pastor <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of St. Mary of the Angels Parish, the Reverend Sobieszczyk, Lieutenant W. N. Skarzynski, Polish Army recruiting officer for the Chicago area, and W. Szrojda, member of the Citizens' Committee.</p>
   <p>It was about 1:30 in the afternoon when the volunteers issued from the parish hall, each man presented by Father Gordon with a small black leather case containing a sacred picture, a prayer, and a crucifix. They then boarded street cars, ten of which had been chartered by the Citizens' Committee, which took them downtown for the parade through the Loop streets. They boarded the street cars to the strains of Przybylski's orchestra, while Polish and American flags waved, and left at about 1:45 down Ashland Avenue to North, North Avenue to Noble, and Noble Street to Milwaukee, where the street cars stopped for a few minutes. They then proceeded down Milwaukee Avenue to Clinton and Randolph, where the parade was to begin.</p>
   <p>Parade through Loop Streets <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Under command of Lieutenant Skarzynski, who was ably assisted by the members of the Citizens' Committee, ranks were quickly formed. The parade was headed by Polish scouts as standard bearers, followed by men and women Falcons, the Citizens' Committee, representatives of Polish organizations, and finally, the volunteers, under command of their officers. They marched to the strains of two bands--Przybylski's and a Scotch orchestra.</p>
   <p>The parade moved down Randolph to State Street, State to Madison, Madison Street to La Salle, La Salle Street to Jackson, Jackson Boulevard to Michigan, Michigan Avenue to Sixth, Sixth back to State, and State Street to Polk and the railroad station. Our volunteers were cheered constantly by the throngs that lined the streets during the whole course of the parade.</p>
   <p>They arrived at the railroad station at about four o'clock in the afternoon. Here farewell scenes between the families and friends of the departing defenders of Poland took place.</p>

   <p>Finally, at about 4:40, the train pulled out of the station amid tremendous cheers for the Polish Army and its brave soldiers. Gradually, the last coaches disappeared from view, followed by the hearts and thoughts of those who were left behind.</p>
