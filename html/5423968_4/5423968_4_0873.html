   <p>A war between the United States and Mexico is imminent and almost at hand. The starry flag of Washington and Lincoln must be without a stain, it must remain as clean and as beautiful as it was when bestowed upon this country by its great presidents. The time of patient waiting has elapsed. The haughty and arrogant president-bandit, Huerta, must yield to the must demands of our government.</p>
   <p>The American army must enter Mexico, and it should not rest there until the star spangled banner shall wave forever, in the capital city of that turbulent country. The aim of this war is not to acquire material and territorial gains, but to defend the honor of the American flag, which has recently been insulted by Huerta, and to which every righteous and true soldier owes his life. Of such most righteous and noble character, were our Polish who with golden letters carried their names on bloody battlefields of their own and other countries, whenever the liberty of the country or its soldierly honor were at stake. Now again, the Pole stands ready for the call to arms. May God help, him win the highest praise and glory.</p>

   <p>The Polish soldiers serving under the starry banner, should remember that their forefathers are looking upon them, and are calling them to heroic fight. A Pole, when marching to the battlefield in Mexico, should remember that he is a citizen of the United States and a descendant of a nation out of which came Kosciuszko. Pulaski, and other heroes. He should be the first and the best, to demonstrate to the American people, that Polish emigration gave this country not only common laborers but also the bravest defenders of the starry banner.</p>
   <p>Go, therefore, and win - and although your columns will decimated, they will be decorated with laurels of victory for the heroic death of their comrades.</p>
