   <p>A few bitter words which, if turned into action, might be blessed.</p>
   <p>It is with bitterness that we report that for some time the number of recruits to the Polish Army from Chicago has fallen to merely a few daily. If it were not for the suburban communities, in which recruiting activities are considerably livelier, it would be impossible to send a weekly transport of any size to the training camp. And this is happening in that same city of Chicago which at first was sending three hundred and more recruits to Kosciusko Camp weekly, which for a long time stood at the head of the recruiting movement, setting an example that awakened action in other Polish communities all over the United States.</p>
   
   <p>Today, that same Chicago, the center of American Polonia, has been left behind to such a degree that While Detroit, for example, sends three hundred recruits, Chicago sends a mere handful.</p>
   <p>We are not writing this with the intention of placing any blame upon the officers in charge of recruiting in Chicago. Indeed, we acknowledge the anti-like activity of all those engaged in recruiting in Chicago. Recruiting Officer A. i as well as the organizers are doing everything in their power to give the movement impetus...so as to make up the losses caused by the stagnation of the last few weeks. The fault is not to be sought here, then, but elsewhere entirely.</p>
   <p>It must be confirmed first of all that although the Polish people of Chicago are as highly patriotic as ever before, the best example of which is the last demonstration at the Coliseum, their enthusiasm lacks practical direction, while in the general activity, there is no program by which all the Poles of Chicago could, without exception, guide themselves. There is beginning to be too much of empty phrases and demonstrations among us. We hold mass meetings, but for the most part they end in mere rhetoric. We hold parades and manifestations, numerously attended, perhaps, but only that is a peacock, we might admire our colorful plumage. In all of our work there appears to be a lack of substance, a lack of real effort toward a predetermined good. We make slogans but do not live up to them.</p>
   <p>At our mass meetings, we call for sacrifices worthy of every Pole; by rising, fathers and mothers pledge themselves to send their sons to the Polish Army; girls make vows that they will not even look at "slackers"; men with dependents promise to avoid contact with cowards. We pledge ourselves, only to forget those pledges once we have left the hall. Even in Falcon nests and military societies a definite stand has rarely been taken; as for example: a motion to expel from the Falcon ranks all those young cowards who, having no dependents, do not join the Polish Army:</p>
   <p>We ought to fulfill the abovementioned duties at every step. After all, Poland is at war today, and this the most terrible war that any nation was ever involved in. We are not fighting merely for some piece of land or some economic advantage, we are fighting for the life of our nation, for the existence or non-existence of our children, of the natural wealth of our homeland. If then, nations fighting for only a part of what we are fighting for, or for a principle only, as with America, are instituting universal and compulsory military service, then how much greater is the justification of compulsory military service among us, the Poles?</p>
   <p>But true, with us, the obligation is simply a moral one, for we have no gendarmes or police who would take the obstinate and the cowards into the Polish Army by force. Should not, however, our moral obligation be stronger than the club or bayonet of a policeman or gendarme in view of the possibility of a free, united, and independent Poland? Can we not, after all, change this moral obligation to a real one even though we have only moral means by which to do so?</p>
   <p>Definitely yes! And we ought to make use of those moral means. We ought to be our own gendarmes and police, whom we lack. A father should look to his son, a brother to his brother, that he enlist in the Polish Army. Mothers should see that their daughters,and sisters that their sisters, contribute part of their efforts for the Polish Army's benefit. Let us organize our girls and bind them with the sacred vow that they will hold in contempt all Polish "slackers." Let us expel from our organizations all those who, having no dependents, want to enjoy life in America while others go to shed their blood for them. Every Pole who cannot enlist in the Polish Army should report to the recruiting station the name and address of every young man who, having no dependents, still does not enlist. He should bring in the name of every single man up to forty-five years of age who, while he could be of use to the Polish Army, does not join it. Let our great duty to Poland, to the future generations be our policeman, our conscience, which will later kill us if we do not fulfill the duty that rests with every Pole.</p>
   <p>In this way, we will effect a draft registration in Chicago for the Polish Army, and we will find that there is no truth in our evasions that we lack material for volunteers. It will be so great an untruth, such a challenging one, that shame will cover us and we will help the recruiting center and the Citizens' Committee to enlist those registered so that they will not disgrace our community.</p>
   <p>Let us begin this action today, immediately, without delay. For the good of the cause, let us all be policemen of our consciences and then there will be no more such reports that put us to shame, as when Detroit supplied several hundred recruits to the few score from Chicago, a city nearly five times as large as Detroit.</p>
