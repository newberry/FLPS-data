   <p>A few days ago, a certain Polish woman came into my office to ask if it is a good thing to buy government bonds, that is, Liberty bonds, adding that she has saved up a few hundred dollars, which she keeps hidden away in some private bank. She said that if she were sure that her money would not be lost, she would draw it out of this private bank and use it to purchase Liberty bonds. A certain Pole, again, told me that he has three thousand dollars in a safe deposit box with which he would buy Liberty bonds if he were sure that his money will not be lost.</p>
   <p>There are many women such as the one I mentioned, who have money in private banks, banks often owned by Jews, who do not give any guarantee. There are also many people who do not have confidence in any bank and so keep their money in safe deposit boxes or in safes. Naturally, not only does their <span class="page-break">2</span>money not earn any interest, but they must pay rent for a place to keep it. And there are also many people who keep their money at home--in mattresses, in stoves, in all sorts of holes. Often there are accidents, and their money is stolen or burned.</p>
   <p>Are United States Government bonds safe? Will not money invested in these bonds be lost?</p>
   <p>It would seem that anyone seriously asking such questions should be regarded as a candidate for the insane asylum, but unfortunately there are many who do. There are also people who regard the money spent to purchase Liberty bonds as a contribution to the government toward covering the expense of the war, and that it will never be given back.</p>
   <p>This is also nonsense.</p>
   <p>Money spent for the purchase of government bonds is nothing more than a loan <span class="page-break">3</span>to the whole American nation, and has the same guarantee as paper money; for paper money is nothing more than a guarantee by the government of value to a specific sum, with this difference that the government paper used as money pays no interest, while bonds pay three and one-half per cent--one-half per cent more than the banks pay.</p>
   <p>In view of these facts, I think Poles ought to take the greatest possible advantage of this occasion. Whoever has fifty dollars or more saved up can buy one or more bonds. Money invested in these bonds cannot be lost, unless the world should turn upside down.</p>
   <p>Since the money from the sale of these bonds will be used by the government to conduct the war against Germany, our eternal enemy, every Pole, even the poorest, ought to take it upon himself to purchase at least one bond, at fifty dollars. After all, he will not lose, but gain by it.</p>
   <p>America declared war against Prussian autocracy which, just as before--when <span class="page-break">4</span>it occupied a part of Poland, a part of France and Denmark, and invaded other countries which it holds in slavery by brute strength--tends toward driving the entire world into slavery. America has declared war against these modern barbaric Huns to protect not only its own land against Prussian rapacity, but to free other nations, among them Poland, of the Prussian yoke. President Wilson has plainly declared that Poland must be free and self-governing.</p>
   <p>Thus, in fighting against the Germans, America is fighting for Poland. What a pleasant feeling, to every son and daughter of Poland, it is to know that this great, powerful, and broadminded American nation was chosen by Providence to avenge the wrongs against Poland!</p>
   <p>Every Pole fighting in the American Army is fighting for America and for Poland. In the face of this fact, it ought to be the duty of every Polish man and woman to lend every effort to help the American government crush that Prussian brute strength and free the Polish nation from the yoke of slavery.</p>

   <p>Let us enlist in the army, let us not wait until we are taken under compulsion; let us buy Liberty bonds. Next Friday [June 15] is the last day on which these bonds may be purchased.</p>
   <p>Apply to the Polish banks, and there you will find someone to explain what needs to be done. You do not have to pay until July without losing the interest.</p>
   <p>By the purchase of a great number of bonds from Polish banks, we Polish people can give proof that we are loyal citizens of this country. Let us also join the Red Cross.</p>
