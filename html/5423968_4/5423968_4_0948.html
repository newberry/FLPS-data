   <p>Working conditions are becoming more disagreeable in this wealthy free America. The building of more factories, splendid bank structures, business houses, and residences of the privileged, means greater suffering among the millions crowded in rooms unfit for animals, poorly clothed, and starving. Such poor unfortunates can be seen toiling hard in mines, steel mills, in the dark woods of Wisconsin and Michigan, and wherever wealth is created for the use of a few privileged persons. But the most disagreeable fate is that of the textile workers in the New England States. Working there at hard labor are men, women, and underaged children, destroying their health and strength, and going prematurely to their graves. Looking at these youngsters, one gets the impression that they are small adults, for in their faces is stamped already the marks of physical exertion. Most of those children are compelled to work in textile factories, as their fathers' salaries are insufficient to support their families.</p>
   
   <p>Wives and mothers are torn away from home to help their husbands by working in textile mills. The children, instead of attending school, are compelled to work, because it is difficult to support them on their parents' income. Father, mother and children file to work every morning, returning to their humble homes in the evening, tired, weakened, and exhausted. The smaller children, remaining, without protection, wander away from home often meeting with serious accidents. The interior of the factory is an actual hell: dust, bad odors and lack of ventilation. The noise of the machines, transmission belts, gears, pulleys and unguarded fly-wheels are a menace to the life and health of these workers. Such working conditions and small pay exhaust the patience of these humble toilers, who for the most part are aliens.</p>
   <p>The readers are familiar with the struggle for bread put up by the textile workers of Lawrence, Mass. These workers were clubbed by the police, shot at as if they were dangerous animals, thrown into jails; and even small starving children were abused by not permitting them to leave for other towns to be fed by charitable workers. After a few months of bitter struggle they won a slight increase in pay. They returned to work, and this is what happened:</p>
   
   <p>The manufacturers refused to reinstate those who demanded higher wages and better working conditions, or those who were active in the union. This aggravated the situation, and workers threatened to strike again unless all former strikers were unconditionally reinstated.</p>
   <p>In Clinton, Mass., a strike begun in March is still going on. Presently the manufacturers have opened their shops, and are operating with strike-breakers, even advertising for help. We caution our countrymen not to seek work there, for that would constitute an act unworthy of any honest workman. There the poor are fighting for bread and better working conditions; therefore, one would be a vile traitor to them if one were to accept a job as strikebreaker. Strike-breakers are treated with scorn, and more than often incur the hate of the workers, who have to contend not only with their exploiters but also with these wreckers of organized labor, who take from their mouths their last piece of bread and retard the progress of labor in this country. The strikers jobs were taken over by a large number of worthless men, who thereby delayed the strikers' victory. Our people should not become scabs, and interfere with those fighting for bread, because the strikers' cause is the common cause of all working people.</p>
