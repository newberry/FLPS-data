   <p>The gangrene poisoning our social system is crooked politics. If the so called democratic system of government inevitably leads to such a corruption as we have here, the old Europe should abolish that system without any regret. There is no other country where crooked politicians would rule the entire nation without any protest. When vacanies in the public offices have to be filled, ability and merit mean nothing and are not taken into consideration. Only political pull is required; the stronger the pull, the better the position that can be obtained.</p>
   <p>A large percentage of high offices in our administration is filled by men with no ability and knowledge of their duties. All this favoritism and crooked patronage is leading only to graft and corruption, killing all morality of the whole system, and it will cause disaster and anarchy.</p>
