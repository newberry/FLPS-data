   <p>In the strife between capital and labor, there is one outstanding factor which is more important than the interests of either of the two, and that is the interests of society in general. Therefore, a discussion of the labor problem may prove invaluable. The public is interested in the progress of production as well as in the welfare of the working classes engaged in this production, but in the end the welfare of society as a whole is most important.</p>
   <p>It is anticipated that the demands of neither the employers nor the workers can be fully satisfied. Nevertheless, they are not being ignored or restricted for the benefit of one side or the other, but for the benefit of society as a whole. The welfare of society should act as a guide to which all individual efforts should be made to conform, and within these boundaries all can be assured of the best conditions. However, the needs of society come first. Under such conditions, society will be enabled to ponder over the problems of labor, as it does over its other economic problems. In the end it is powerful enough to enforce its will upon all concerned, because the stand taken by it is usually real and reasonable, and can lead only to peace.</p>
   <p>Many of the minor issues prove easy to solve, but some of the more weighty and technical problems of the two large economic groups prove difficult and troublesome. However, we should not forget that, practically speaking, the conflicts between capital and labor do not break out over trivial matters, but involve the forces of both groups, and involve both important and minor issues. The solution of these problems does not involve great difficulty. One more solved is one less to be coped with, and the possibility of another conflict is minimized. In this manner all friction, all hatred and antagonism are eradicated, to the benefit of both capital and labor, and of society in general.</p>
   
   <p>With this aim in view, it will first be necessary to guard and maintain all of the basic principles of the present order, but a practical road to the enactment of reform and the supplying the people with new means of solving their problems will lead to a very high state of social development. And yet, social welfare is not wholly dependent upon its public servants, but in a great measure upon legal, ethical, and civilizational conditions. Therefore, when faced with the solution of almost any economic problem, society must evolve such methods as will satisfy all of these demands.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, society must discard all of those demands the solution of which would necessitate a change in its basic structure, that is, such as the abridgement of the rights of property and personal freedom, or making impossible the attainment of aims considered socially important and more profitable than those of the administration.</p>
   <p>Naturally social views can change, and can change to a point that a supposed state of perfection of today will have to be improved upon tomorrow, and matters of great importance be rendered insignificant. Our whole social and political development is subject to these changes which are altering some of the old limitations and are opening to those interested in public affairs new fields to develop. As long as reforms are not brought about, some of the reasons and conditions mentioned above are retarding them. Finally, when the general view does change, the whole situation will be summarized not as to what kind of a change has taken place, but how great a change has taken place; and then proceed to make restrictions and social reforms to comply to the demands of the existing order, whose aims are considered more flexible and important.</p>
   <p>Application of these principles to the labor question is not suggestive of a very important task. The requirements and desires of one group or the other should be fulfilled as quickly as possible, if they stand for the good of society in general; or they should be unconditionally discarded, if they clash with it. Therefore, conditions favorable to society, but discriminatory to either the working classes or the employer, should be immediately changed, and the rights of both groups should be equalized.</p>
   <p>In determining the utility of proposed reforms, and deciding upon them favorably we must take into consideration the preponderance of either the material or moral benefit that is to be derived therefrom. In this way society can limit itself on its responsibility in the labor disputes. It is also well to remember that in the United States no individual or agency is as capable of bringing about the many necessary reforms, and peace between capital and labor, as society itself.</p>
   <p>Society understands best the issues involved in the many controversies. Therefore, it is most capable of bringing about peace and the necessary reforms without strife and bloodshed.</p>
