   <p>According to the decision of County Judge Owens, women can now vote for county commissioners in addition to candidates for which the right to vote has already been granted them.</p>
   <p>Polish women, let us not disregard this privilege. Let us take advantage of this law to show that Polish women are intelligent and understand the advantages to be gained by voting. It should be especially important to us Polish women to help our brother Poles in every way possible to elect capable candidates, candidates having the best possible qualifications for specific offices.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Polish women, do not fail to register on Tuesday, October 13. Prove that you understand your duties as citizens as well as your national duties.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Anna Neuman</p>
