   <p>On May 4 the period of time set by the United States government for the raising of three billion dollars through the sale of Third Liberty Loan bonds comes to an end. To us, the Poles, the few days left to that period are extremely important. Our ambition ought to be to outstrip all other nationalities in the race to purchase Third Liberty Loan bonds and put ourselves in first place. At present, we are in second place in the Chicago district, although, just a few days ago, we were in fourth. The Germans are still in first place, having purchased bonds to the sum of $2,106,650, while the Poles have bought one million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth.</p>
   <p>Let us beat the Germans! We have outstripped the Jews and the Czechs, but our duty is to beat the Germans. Of the immigrant nationalities in the United States, we ought not to allow the Germans to lead. For political reasons at least, we <span class="page-break">2</span>ought to see to it that the Poles, not the Germans, hold first place in the sale of Third Liberty Loan bonds. When we have achieved that first place, not only will we stand high in the eyes of the patriotic American public but, in addition, we will have the full right to call upon that American public for aid to Poland. Furthermore, we will have gained the complete confidence of the American people, which in the present times--what with rising nationalistic antagonism--is extremely important.</p>
   <p>Beyond the general duty of Poles to purchase Third Liberty Loan bonds, we members of the Polish National Alliance have a special duty, namely, to purchase these bonds through the Polish National Alliance, which has special applications for this purpose from Washington. In connection with this matter, an appeal from the central administration of the Polish National Alliance appears in an adjoining column which every Alliance member should not only read but act upon. As members of the Alliance, it should be our concern that through us, our organization should gain recognition and influence. We are convinced that <span class="page-break">3</span>Alliance members have purchased or will purchase nearly a million dollars' worth of bonds. At the present time, however, that action is scattered, and the credit which the Polish National Alliance deserves for the loyalty of its members to the United States is lost, for it is impossible to show the exact sum for which Alliance members have subscribed to the Third Liberty Loan, although they were probably among the first to answer the appeal. In order that this should not be so in the future, the central administration has made it possible for members to purchase their bonds through the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>We call upon all members of the Polish National Alliance to act upon the appeal that has been issued, for in this way they will help not only their organization but themselves as well. The Alliance, having received credit for the sale of several million dollars', or at least a single million dollars' worth of bonds, will immediately come to the fore of those loyal institutions that hasten with the greatest aid to the government. It is understood that as a result, the <span class="page-break">4</span>Alliance would gain the influence it deserves, which it could then use for the benefit of its members in more ways than one.</p>
   <p>Let us buy Liberty bonds then, but let us buy them through the Polish National Alliance in order to achieve first place not only for the Poles but for our organization also.</p>
