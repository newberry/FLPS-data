   <p>Europe now is in the midst of unforeseen events....Our hearts beat faster at the thought that, after the suppression of the Prussian pride, better days will come.</p>
   <p>What should we do? We should wait quietly, with our arms ready, until the deciding moment comes. In the meantime, we should place every penny we can save on the altar of resurrected Poland.</p>
   <p>Let the world see that Poland has not given up hope, that she has not forgotten the wrongs done to her, wrongs for which she will demand redress when the time for this comes.</p>
   <p>It is fifty years ago today that the last member of the National Government of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>1863 and our last dictator Romuald Traugut were executed at the citadel of Warsaw. Today our hope is greater than ever before, because the Prussian power will be crushed into dust.</p>
   <p>We have been waiting a long time for the moment when our enemies and erstwhile friends, robbers of Polish soil, should quarrel among themselves. This moment is now at hand. Two of them are aligned on one side, the third on the other. Only at the side of the third is victory assured, because all Europe is behind it and allied with it. What to do--we know.</p>
