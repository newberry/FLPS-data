   <p>A meeting was held the day before yesterday at Mr. J. Kuszewski's hall, corner of Noble and Division Streets, on the matter of government land in Oklahoma, which is now being auctioned. Mr. Mazurkiewicz, who already has bought some land there, called the meeting together, but very few people came--only about eight. Although those present eulogized life on the farm, no concrete decisions were made.</p>
