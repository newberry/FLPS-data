   <p>A meeting of stockholders of the Associated Polish Traders' and Importers' Corporation was held on Monday, August 19, 1918, at eight o'clock in the evening, in the Polish Women's Alliance Hall.</p>
   <p>The stockholders, informed in advance by mail and by the newspapers of the forth-coming meeting, began to gather even before half past seven. The attendance was so large that by eight o'clock nearly all the seats were already occupied.</p>
   <p>The meeting was formally opened by the president of the corporation, Mr. Z. Ulanowski. He presented the charter granted to the corporation. He made a brief report on the present condition of the corporation and spoke of the great task that the organized shareholders have before them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Eugene Monczynski, the financial secretary, was called upon to give a report on the present condition of the treasury. He gave an itemized report of receipts <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and expenses. The number of shareholders still delinquent in their dues was also reported by the financial secretary. He urged those now in arrears to pay up their contracted debt to the corporation because the administration contemplates opening a wholesale grocery warehouse sometime in September. The report further disclosed that the corporation to date numbers 417 Polish grocers and bakers who have bought shares in this Polish merchants' corporation.</p>
   <p>Messrs. A. Busch, J. Sejud, and S. Cielak, members of the revision committee, confirmed the financial secretary's report.</p>
   <p>After this report questions were asked. The secretary and the president gave satisfactory answers to all the questions put to them.</p>
   <p>The organizer, Mr. Stanley Jakiel, was called upon to give a report of his activities. He gave a detailed account of what has been accomplished. The members accepted the report with great enthusiasm and satisfaction. Following this the president issued certificates to those who have paid in full for their shares.</p>

   <p>The shareholders held a lively discussion on the site of the wholesale warehouse. They considered the propositions suggested by the directors. The arguments were settled when a motion was made and carried to leave the matter to the disposition of the directors.</p>
   <p>A motion was made by one of the shareholders to discuss the matter of the Polish convention held in Detroit. A proposition that the corporation should send a delegate to this convention received due consideration.</p>
   <p>It was finally decided that no delegate be sent by the corporation, but the directorate was to send a congratulatory telegram to the convention.</p>
   <p>When the matter of Polish business was being considered, Mr. M. Golinowski made a motion to adopt a resolution calling all Poles to active work in the field of promoting Polish trade and commerce.</p>
   <p>The resolution was summarily prepared and read to the members. It was adopted <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>unanimously, and it was recommended that it be published in all the Polish newspapers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Polish businessmen as well as private persons who have already purchased shares in this desirable and well-guaranteed enterprise, the wholesale grocery ware-house, express their appreciation to those who understand the needs of our people, and who organize for the purpose of forming greater business undertakings. These shareholders urge the co-operation of those who have thus far remained in different or neglectful of their own welfare and the betterment of Polish business conditions. Such businessmen take money from our Polish working people but turn it over to non-Polish wholesale houses. This may be attributed to the fact that there have been no Polish concerns to deal with. But on the other hand such businessmen are also to blame because in their failure to support the Associated Polish Traders' and Importers' Corporation they are hindering the good work already started.</p>
   <p>Upon the completion of all business the president adjourned the meeting. The <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>members left the hall with this encouraging thought in mind, that better times are in sight for our Polish businessmen. They felt that although not all our people are as yet active in promoting Polish business, nevertheless those who support the movement contribute to the productive work of Polish enterprise. It is sincerely hoped that there will be more and more of such patriotically minded Poles.</p>
