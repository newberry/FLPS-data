   <p>The Polish district on the Northwest Side, including the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Wards, is extremely busy, according to the latest figures. More than three hundred thousand dollars' worth of Liberty bonds have been purchased by the Poles in this district, reports W. S. Zwiefka, chairman for the district.</p>
   <p>A Polish woman applied at one of the banks in a Polish community to purchase five thousand dollars' worth of Liberty bonds. She brought her money in a bag containing gold pieces, currency, and even dimes, nickels, and pennies.</p>
   <p>Joseph Ruszkiewicz, assistant city treasurer, has charge of the campaign in the Seventeenth Ward, where the sale of bonds is reaching even greater proportions. "Up to this time," says Ruszkiewicz, "we have sold more than seventy thousand dollars' worth of bonds. You may be sure that the Seventeenth Ward will be a leader in the campaign for 'pills for the Kaiser'. For you may <span class="page-break">2</span>be sure that every dollar spent for a Liberty bond is a poisonous pill for the Kaiser."</p>
