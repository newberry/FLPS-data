   <p>My dear Brothers: An unexpected guest has visited the confines of St. Hedwing Parish. This undesirable visitor is Smallpox, which threatens your lives and the lives of your children.</p>
   <p>Only inoculation against this disease will safeguard your health. Vaccination and other sanitary measures are the only methods by which this plague can be stamped out.</p>
   <p>Therefore for the good of all parishioners, through the efforts of Dr. Garrott, the local Board of Health has set up a vaccination office at the St. Hedwig Parish School under my permission. This service will be rendered free of charge.</p>
   <p>On Monday and Tuesday, August 19 and 20, doctors appointed by the Board of <span class="page-break">2</span>Health will be in charge of the inoculations. Everyone, both young and old, are requested to take advantage of this free service.</p>
   <p>I appeal to all of you to come and be vaccinated on the designated days. The mothers should make sure to bring their children. In this way you will be safeguarding your health as well as that of others.</p>
   <p>Yours in Christ,</p>
   <p>Reverend John Piechowski,</p>
   <p>Pastor of St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
