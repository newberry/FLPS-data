   <p>Our Polish lawyers have decided to form an organization which is intended to end many of the existing feuds, encountered in the practice of law. This organization is to be allied with Orzel Bialy, and will be the first alliance of Polish professional men's associations.</p>
   <p>It is anticipated that other Polish professional organizations, such as the Physicians and Pharmacists, will eventually consolidate with this same alliance. This is a splendid project and is expected to become a grand reality.</p>
   <p>There are now twenty-six Polish lawyers in Chicago, and over twenty Polish students of law in the different local schools and universities. Some of these have already received their degrees in law and are waiting only for State examinations.</p>
