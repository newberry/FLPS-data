   <p>At an annual meeting of stockholders of the Alliance National Bank, most of whom were from Holy Innocents', St. Stephen's, St. Helen's and St. John Cantius' parishes, held at the bank headquarters yesterday afternoon, changes were decided upon in the administration. Besides this, plans and problems for the good of the organization were discussed.</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the directors who were on the board during 1927, reports were introduced. In the absence of Clayton F. Smith, chairman of the board of directors, who is in Washington on an important mission, Leon S. Mallek, president of the bank, gave a comprehensive report on the bank's business, administrators, and personnel. A table or index was given to every stockholder present, which showed the qualification of the directors.</p>
   <p>The results of yesterday's elections showed that the following were chosen as directors:</p>
