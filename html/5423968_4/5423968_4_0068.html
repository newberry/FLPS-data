   <p>For the past several months the city of Chicago has been the field of action of official murderers. In a short space of time there were five instances in which the police, mostly dressed in civilian clothing, shot at people totally innocent of any crime. These officers usually shoot with greater accuracy than do the uniformed police when shooting at real bandits. The late Dubinski was shot by three detectives who rushed on him from the side of a house. Mistaking them for thieves, this peaceful passer-by started to flee and was shot by the three officers. This is but one instance of the numerously repeated abuses of official authority. In none of these instances were the guilty of murder punished. The chief of police of Chicago gave orders to shoot to kill, but surely he did not issue any order that policemen are permitted to shoot at will or whenever an urge moves them to do so. In spite of this, in every instance the order of the chief of police covered the guilt of the killer, and the entire incident ended in a statement that "an error had occurred."</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the zeal of the police has not reduced in the least the number of assaults, robberies, and murders that are committed in our city. Long accounts of robberies constantly find their way into the newspapers. Every day we learn that some citizen has been murdered by thieves, but the entire incident terminates at that point. Almost none of the culprits have been thus far apprehended, with the exception of one who walked inadvertently into the arms of the police.</p>
   <p>The indifference with which the American daily newspapers edited in Chicago treat these murderous experiments of our guardians of peace and order mystifies us. We can only explain this in these terms: Thus far the victims of the police have been people none of whom were worth (to use the vernacular) more than a thousand dollars. If instead of the poor worker Dubinski, or the poor tailor Rudnik, the victim had been some prosperous businessman worth several hundred thousand dollars, it is certain that all the American newspapers would have made an unheard-of din. The guilty parties would have been incarcerated, and the chief of police, together with the mayor of the city, would have fallen into difficulties from which it wouldn't have been so easy to scrape out.</p>
   <p>But it is exactly such conditions that should disturb nine-tenths of the residents of Chicago who walk upon the streets because they are unable to own automobiles, for at any time one can walk into the line of fire of the plainclothes police, who will then vindicate their action by the term "shot by error." Something should be done about this, or else society as a whole will be guilty of the death of those people who might in the future perish in place of the actual thieves and murderers.</p>
   <p>That there will be new victims was verified by the assistant to the chief of police in an interview with newspaper reporters.</p>
   <p>"Similar instances will occur in the future," said the assistant, "and I know of no means to put an end to this. It is deplorable that some police officers lose their self-restraint and shoot unnecessarily. No one feels this more greatly than I. The policemen on duty are themselves the judges of the circumstances, and if they lose their head and shoot, and even injure or kill unnecessarily, I cannot see what their superiors could do in this instance."</p>
   <p>Well, if the assistant to the chief of police states that nothing can be done about this, then it is high time for the people to do their own thinking and find some way to prevent the repetition of occurrences of this type. In the first place, the court authorities should become interested in this. The mere fact that someone is a policeman does not exclude him from being under the authority of the prosecutor, the grand jury, and the entire court machine. And if there are policemen in the service of the city of Chicago who lose their heads at a time when they should keep it, we have a mayor of the city whose duty is to dismiss these weak-headed heroes. A policeman should possess not only a strong fist but also a strong head capable of holding more good things than the head of an average citizen. Moreover, his head should contain a brain at least of such caliber as every employer demands from his employee, regardless of the amount of remuneration paid for services rendered.</p>
   <p>Why, for example, is the police of England--the best in the world, wise, polite, sober, dignified--able to master every situation without "errors" in a city such as London, where the worse elements of England gather? The police of Paris, a city which is the center of all scum, not only from France but from the entire world, does not shoot at anyone, and yet it protects three million people a great deal better than does the chief of police of Chicago. Even in Berlin, despite the inherent brutality of the Prussians, the police do not fire at people as if they were hunted animals. In Warsaw and in the capital of Russia, whenever the police has the desire to shoot, a formal declaration of a state of war is announced to all residents that they might be prepared to meet the worst if the warning is not heeded.</p>
   <p>But even in other large cities of America such abuse of police power as that practiced in Chicago is unheard of. The root of evil lies in the so-called political corruption. The chief of police here is a serf of the mayor, who hires, fires, and rehires him at will. These two dignitaries are more concerned with political influences, with building their own machine, with future elections than with the life and welfare of the citizens who pay for their salaries.</p>
   <p>In many other cities, the chiefs of police are business people, independent of politics and not afraid of losing their position, regardless of who the mayor might be. In localities of that type the police also performs its duties and does not shoot "by mistake" at peaceful citizens. It is high time for the people of Chicago to make every effort to regulate this department of municipal government and do away with such barbarian disorders.</p>
