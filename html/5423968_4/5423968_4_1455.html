   <p>We wish to inform our esteemed public that we have organized and opened a new law firm under the name of Beilman, Czarnecki, and Koralewski.</p>
   <p>Having long been convinced that there is a need for a Polish law firm that will serve the interests of the Poles, the undersigned have undertaken to establish a firm of this kind, patterned after the best American law firms which have built up a clientele through their business reputations. Under these principles we wish to serve our esteemed public.</p>
   <p>Realizing that there is no Polish law firm in existence and being convinced that a group of lawyers can better serve the interests of the public, we anticipate that the public will seek our counsel, the counsel of a group and not of an individual.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We invite the esteemed public to support our new business enterprise, and we promise to do our utmost to serve their interests.</p>
   <p>John J. Bielman,</p>
   <p>C. B. Czarnecki,</p>
   <p>F. N. Koralewski.</p>
   <p>Offices are located at Room 501, 153-155 LaSalle Street, and at 604 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
