   <p>Among many Polish building and loan associations, the Polish Union Building Association holds undoubtedly the first place.</p>
   <p>It was established in the year 1916 by a few influential local men who wished to help those countrymen who intended to build their own homes. The first members of this association were A. Lublinski, Ig. Lazarski, Wl.Przybylinski, W. Rembwiecki, J. Nowicki, A. Krajewski and N. Janicki.</p>
   <p>During its useful existence this association rendered great service to those who still own their homes.</p>
   <p>The rapid growth of this association is due to the support of the Poles of South Chicago and also to energetic management of its officers. The office is located at 8307 S. Shore Drive.</p>
