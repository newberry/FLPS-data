   <p>A Baptist pastor, John Roach Straton, in his Sunday sermon asserted that Governor Smith, a member of the Roman-Catholic faith, and a Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United States, is one of the greatest enemies of moral progress and true political wisdom in America.</p>
   <p>When Governor Smith learned about that accusation from The New York Times, he challenged the pastor to a public debate, the place of which was set at Madison Square Garden in New York.</p>
   <p>We think Smith got himself into a trap from which he will not be able to free himself. There is no doubt that Rev. Straton in his arguments will prove that Smith, as a loyal Roman-Catholic, cannot serve both the pope and the United States.</p>
   <p>When President Wilson, as a member of the Reformed Church, visited the pope, the latter ran out into the hall end heartily shook hands with <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the great and free American. But if Smith, as President of the United States, were he to visit the Vatican would have to kiss the pope's feet.</p>
   <p>At any rate, we are pretty sure the papal servants will not allow Smith to appear at the forthcoming public dispute.</p>
