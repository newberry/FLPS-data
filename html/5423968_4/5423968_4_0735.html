   <p>Saturday, Dec. 5, at a banquet of the Irish Fellowship Club in the Hotel La Salle, city attorney Mr. N. L. Piotrowski gave a splendid talk about Poland. He spoke for one hour and a quarter, and the guests with strained interest listened to him and swallowed almost every word. When the speaker ended, and before the applause was silenced, attorney Mr. Joseph O'Donnell rose and made a notion that the Club should give Mr. L. Piotrowski for such a beautiful speech a rising vote of thanks, which was done. After that the members of the Club and guests pressed themselves toward Mr. Piotrowski so as to shake his hand.</p>
   <p>The opinion among members of the club, expressed unanimously, was that this was the best speech that was ever heard in the Club.</p>
   <p>In the beginning; the speaker compared Poland and her suffering with those of Ireland and her sufferings; the life of the Irish nation and the perseverance in her sufferings, which did not let itself be destroyed through 700 years of terrible persecutions, with the life of the Polish nation and her perseverance.</p>

   <p>After that the speaker in short but concise and exceptionally interesting manner, ran through the whole history of Poland, her greatness, her power, her fall, her suffering, and her future.</p>
   <p>Speaking about her future the speaker expressed himself thus: "In the promises by the governments of the three conquering nations, Russia, Germany, and Austria, given at the beginning of this war, we do not place much faith. Experience has taught us that these governments have no scruples at all and not only fail to keep their promises, but break their most solemn treaties, as in the case of Belgian when the neutrality treaty was violated a few months ago. At the same time we believe that Polish independence will be returned to Poland because a nation having twenty-five million people, its own language highly perfected, rich literature, its own customs and a brilliant past history, such a nation cannot be lost.</p>
   <p>"The states of those illegitimate possessors promise to return freedom to Poland; with this very thing they gave proof as to the necessity of the independence <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the Polish nation as a state, free and independent. She ought not to have as a king either any from the family of the Romanoffs, Hohenzollerns, or the Hapsburgs. Poland was a republic long ago, and so ought to be a republic now, but reorganized on the order of the United States."</p>
   <p>Mr. Piotrowski expressed the hope that the United States, at the Peace Conference at the end of the war, will through its representative, demand that liberty and independence should not only be returned but the form of government should be republican with an elective president at the head of the government- and who can only be a Pole.</p>
   <p>Among the Poles present at the banquet we noticed the following: Judge La Buy, Dr. Sass, Messrs. Derpa, S. Adamkiewicz, L. Palczynski, Julian Piotrowski, Attorneys Alex Smietanka and Z. Kadow, and Dr. Stupinski.</p>
