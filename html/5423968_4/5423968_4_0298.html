   <p>There is no doubt that the Third Liberty Loan of the United States will be subscribed in the designated period of time, with the same excess of willing purchasers as in the First and Second Liberty Loans. In truth, the latest reports show that the demand for bonds is smaller than it should be, but the same condition was observed in the last two campaigns. Only in the final days of the campaigns did the demand increase to such an extent that not only was the quota filled but there was a substantial oversubscription.</p>
   <p>The same will be true of this Third Liberty Loan, for certainly everyone knows that the bonds of such a power as the United States are perhaps the best and safest investment in the world. It is no wonder that business concerns, banks, and financial institutions of all kinds are investing great sums of money in Liberty bonds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>True, the purchase of bonds is none too great in the first stages of the campaign; it is the best opportunity for us Poles to obtain them and thus not only make a good investment but help in winning the war, which is not only a war for the United States but for us, for Poland; for this is undoubtedly our last war for independence. It is, perhaps, even more the duty of the Poles to buy Liberty bonds than of Americans, for every bond purchased by a Pole is one step further toward our [Poland's] freedom; while for the free, powerful, and independent United States, the purchase of a bond is merely a step toward the triumph of democracy, for which this country has undertaken to fight.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, buy bonds now, while there is still an opportunity for the less wealthy, before large capital begins to move. In addition, the eyes of the American Government are upon us, for that government has undertaken this war primarily in defense of the oppressed peoples, and among these, the Poles. In order to have proof of the extent to which we Poles are trying to help America, and by the same token, Poland, to win the war, the Government <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the United States has granted the request of Polish representatives that applications made by Poles for Liberty bonds bear the words "Polish Branch," thus signifying the purchase of bonds by Poles. Our duty, certainly, is to give proof of our loyalty to this country, and not only to help this country with all the strength we possess, not only to give our blood, but to aid with our money in the work the United States has undertaken; for money, money, and yet more money is necessary to insure victory. Let us give that money, then, not as a tax, not as a gift, for the wealthy United States does not need our gifts, but as a loan, on good interest and on the safest terms in the world.</p>
   <p>We held a prominent place in the campaigns for the first two Loans, but we had no proof of the extent to which the Poles placed their savings into Liberty bonds. At present, thanks to the Polish section and appropriately-marked application blanks, we have such proof. Unfortunately, on the list of foreign national groups purchasing bonds in Chicago we are not in first place as we ought to be. From the latest reports, the Bohemians, Jews, and Germans are ahead of us. In the ten days of the campaign, the Bohemians purchased bonds <span class="page-break">\4</span>for $850,000, the Jews for $800,000, and the Germans for $700,000. We are in fourth place, having subscribed to the loan to the sum of $650,000. This is not bad in view of the fact that all three of these national groups are, as groups, wealthier than we are. But on the other hand, we are more numerous, and by the very number of small purchases we should top the wealthier groups of other nationalities. This should be our ambition today, and during the next week we should agitate among our fellow countrymen, so that here in Chicago we will stand at the head of the foreign list of bond purchasers. Such is our duty not only to the United States, but to Poland.</p>
