   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy takes pride in announcing a [new] invention [patented] by a Chicago Pole. The invention belongs to the sphere of aviation, an activity which is progressing with rapid strides, and the real value of which manifested itself during the World War of 1914.</p>
   <p>The inventor is Mr. Gregory Chmielinski, of 2134 Irving Avenue. He obtained a patent at Washington, D. C., on August 20, 1918, protecting him against any infringements. Having the patent in his name, Mr. Chmielinski is now in a position to interest a wider public in his invention. Above all, our own larger Polish financial institutions should be interested in an invention of that type. They should offer all financial assistance possible to put Mr. Chmielinski's idea to practical use.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chmielinski's invention is in connection with aeroplane motors of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>transport type. It solves the problem of the construction of aeroplanes capable of transporting a large number of passengers or heavy loads of freight. In short, Mr. Chmielinski is the creator of a whole aeroplane train, as it were, to transport both passengers and freight. In time of war an aeroplane of Mr. Chmielinski's type would be useful for the rapid transportation of soldiers and ammunition.</p>
   <p>The Department of War in Washington will undoubtedly make use of this invention, the work of one of our own people. This is especially true in view of the fact that the cost of constructing an aeroplane of Mr. Chmielinski's type is not prohibitive. On the contrary, the cost of construction and the operating cost are more than reasonable, and its practicability exceeds that of any other transport plane of its type.</p>
