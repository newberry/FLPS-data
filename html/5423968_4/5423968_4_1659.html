   <p>At the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Polish corporation, held yesterday, Ecclesiastical Goods Company, the first steps toward reorganizing the Company were taken. It is the only Polish firm of its kind not only in Chicago, but in America.</p>
   <p>The following stockholders were present at yesterday's meeting: Mrs. H. Augustynowicz, A. Rush, County Commissioner A. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, A. G. Urbanski, B. P. Pstrong, Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Augustynowicz, A. A. Kowalski, J. F. Szatkowski, and John S. Konopa. The new officers and directors are as follows: E. H. Jarecki, president; Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Augustynowicz, vice president; B. P. Pstrong, secretary, and John S. Konopa, treasurer and manager. The firm was organized fourteen years ago by the late F. Augustynowicz and N. L. Piotrowski. Since the death of Augustynowicz two and a half years ago, the business has been managed by his daughter Helen, who resigned at last night's meeting. The new manager, J. S. Konopa, former secretary <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>general of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, has many years experience in this line of business. He worked for several years with a similar firm downtown, and when the Ecclesiastical Goods Company was organized, he became its chief representative, remaining in this capacity for seven years.</p>
   <p>In order to expand the corporation's field of activity, the board of directors decided to increase its capital by several thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The store is located at 1113 Noble Street, not far from Milwaukee Avenue, and directly opposite the Holy Trinity rectory.</p>
