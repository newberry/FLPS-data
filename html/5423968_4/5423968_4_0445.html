   <p>In view of the recent proclamation of President Wilson, and the regulations issued for the safeguarding of American industries and property, we deem it very opportune to consider briefly the relation of the American citizen of Polish extraction, to the interest and safety of America. Of all citizens of foreign birth or descent, the Pole is perhaps the most dependable, and the best fitted to do his part in the colossal task which confronts this country upon its entrance into the epochal war for democracy. It suffices to note only the most important reasons that lead us to this conclusion.</p>
   <p>The Pole is the traditional foe of the Teuton, his arch enemy, whom he has fought for ages on many of the most glorious battle fields of history, and at whose hands he has suffered most. Those American readers who are acquainted with Henryk Sienkiewicz's realistic novel "The Knights of the Cross," will understand how bitter was the struggle.</p>
   <p>From the dawn of its history, Poland has been compelled to combat Teutonic aggression that threatened its national existence. The conflict continued for over four centuries until it terminated in the dismemberment of Poland.</p>
   
   <p>It was Frederick the Great of Prussia who planned the greatest crime in history, the partition of Poland and was most instrumental in executing it. Later it was Bismarck who inaugurated the ruthless system of extermination that aimed at the very root of national life, and that the Pole with his characteristic tenacity resisted and defeated. These are only a few of the innumerable causes that might be cited in explanation of the deep rooted animosity of the Pole toward the Teuton. This is the reason why there are very few if any pro German Poles in spite of all the baits thrown to them, in the form of a fictitiously independent Polish Kingdom. There are very few Poles in the present day who could be deceived by German offers. Prussia has taught the Poles that Germany has no code of national honor or morality and that all her pledges and offers are just scraps of paper.</p>
   <p>For America, on the other hand, the Pole feels a strong natural sympathy and there are the closest ties of kinship binding him to the land of Washington and Lincoln. The Pole holds in common with the American the same ideals of liberty, justice and fair play. The entire history of Poland is an attestation of this fact. It is unnecessary to mention here, those Polish heroes, Kosciuszko and Pulaski, who fought for the cause of American independence, as every American school-boy knows them. In all the wars of this country the Poles have given lavishly of their blood and possessions, to America.</p>
   
   <p>Industrially and economically they are a very important factor in the development of this country. Hundreds of thousands of Poles, are employed in our factories and on our farms. By their work they have contributed in no small degree toward augmenting and developing the vast resources and riches of America. The Poles may be counted among our most loyal and exemplary citizens. Loyalty to America comes naturally to the American citizens of Polish extraction. In the oath of allegiance to the United States, he renounces no government of his own, he renounces only those who have been his age-long foes and oppressors, the German and Austrian Kaisers. He embraces American citizenship as an emancipation from an odious foreign yoke, as a golden opportunity to live a free and useful life that was denied to him in his native land. His loyalty to America is no divided loyalty and he appreciates fully and benefits by the opportunities, he is ever ready to give his life and all for the country of his adoption. America's cause is his cause. Has not our honorable President proclaimed the right of Poland to "A united independent and autonomous existence"? Is not America also fighting Poland's cause on the vast battlefields of Europe. The American citizen of Polish birth or descent can not, therefore, do otherwise than lend his whole hearted and staunch support to the United States of America. This country's enemies are his enemies, its interests are his interests. It is, therefore, perfectly natural that he is doing all in his power to guard these interests and that as a guardian of American industries he is a factor to be reckoned with.</p>
