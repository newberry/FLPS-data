   <p>"As my appointment has arrived just now, after our local committee of the Lwow Exposition has already begun to collect the exhibits of the products produced by women's craft work, there remains only the first two items for me to fulfill, which up till now were not taken under consideration by the Polish-American committee specially organized for this purpose.

   <p>"Since all material must reach the exposition in the middle of May, all women are requested to send the material as soon as possible. Please send parcels and other material to J. Kodis, 3247 Laurel Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>"The administration of the Lwow Exposition is of the opinion that our ardent patriotism, which unites us all in the far-flung corners of the world, will stimulate us to this civic duty of participating in the exposition. Let us remember that this is not a question of showing our pride, but of demonstrating the vitality and moral strength of the Polish nation.</p>
   
   <p>"All Polish-American newspapers are asked to reprint this appeal.</p>
