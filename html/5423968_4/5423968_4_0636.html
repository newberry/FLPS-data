   <p>Despite the pacifistic orgy now <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the country, despite the Teutonic propaganda pushed to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of heights of audacity, despite the silly intrigues of the childish and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the United States will have to come to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> conflict with the Germans on both land and sea. And the sooner this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the better it will be for the [United] States.</p>
   <p>It is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> understandable that Congress--at present the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for the performances of individuals who do not understand the position of this country in world politics, or are absolutely <span class="gap">[gap]</span> capable of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> American interests of today and the future, or yield to pernicious influence calculated to undermine the [United] States--should hesitate to grant the President the power and authority to declare war. In the face of this hesitation and cowardly tying of the administration's hands, the entering into armed conflict with the Germans <span class="page-break">\2</span>will be accomplished step by step. From <span class="gap">[gap]</span> we have passed on first to a neutrality which favored the Allies, then to a neutrality which actually disapproved of the Teutons, and now to a phase of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> neutrality which in the present circumstances <span class="gap">[gap]</span> other than preparation for war with Germany.</p>
   <p>The transition from a state of peace to a state of war is a hard, tedious, and to a certain extent painful process for such a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> mass of people as compose the United States. Before the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of declaring war on the German Kaiser can be reached, and especially before America can transport to the European continent new, suddenly formed, but nevertheless powerful American armies, a certain evolution <span class="gap">[gap]</span> take place in the mind of the average American, who up to the present has been <span class="gap">[gap]</span> tradesman par excellence and who in addition has befogged the horizon of his political thinking with the fallacy of <span class="gap">[gap]</span>onroe's little formula.</p>
   <p>At the present time we are in the full swing of this evolution, embollished, <span class="page-break">\3</span>for the purpose of variety in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, by the mad antics of all sorts of Bryans, simple-minded little women of the type of the very worthy Jane Addams, and the sallies of all sorts of "peoples' spokesmen" a la Kennedy of Hearst, spokesmen who misuse their "ideas" or money to exploit human ignorance, and who serve a foreign cause which is inimical to this country by playing on the low instincts of the ignorant and disorganized mob.</p>
   <p>Gradually this greatly desired change in the thinking processes of the American people is taking place. Gradually the people <span class="gap">[gap]</span> opening their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in order to look into the face of reality. Gradually illusions and prejudices on the necessity, advantages, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of a "friendship" between Germany and the United States are beginning to vanish. And the Germans themselves, who no longer have anything to lose and who are throwing away their masks and no longer conceal their hatred of the United States, and the American people, are helping this evolution along.</p>
   <p>The last speech of the German Chancellor and the hostile outbursts of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>party leaders in the Reichstag should convince even the blindest of the peace advocates that the Germans are not pleased with the attitude of the United States and feel hatred toward it, since the Germans believe that in this war America is placing obstacles in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> path. Peaceful and neutral America has become an irreconcilable foe to the Germans, and the Teutons will never forgive these offenses. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> political figures in Germany are already saying that barring England, the United States is Germany's worst enemy. This is how all Germans feel today, and they voice this feeling as loudly as possible. And on the morrow following the war, remembering this, all Germans will want <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>And so, from now on, German politics will have to treat America as an enemy, unless the outcome of the war completely changes the political situation in the world. From now on the country of the German Kaiser also becomes the decided enemy of the United States, and its complete annihilation must constitute an indispensable condition of America's future safety.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Should the Germans come out of the present war victorious, the United States would have to face a very greet danger on the part of this Teutonic enemy, who after defeating the Allies would become the greatest military, political, and economic power in the world. But even a Germany not wholly victorious, not completely weakened and made forever harmless, would threaten the safety and vital interests of the [United] States by entering into alliances with neutral competitors of Uncle Sam, such as Japan and Mexico.</p>
   <p>The destruction of England's sea power would give absolute control of the Atlantic to Germany and control of the Pacific to Japan. The United States would be isolated from the rest of the world, threatened at any moment by an attack from Germany on the and Japan on the west. Therefore, the destruction or even the neutralization of the sea power so successfully extended all over the world by Great Britain, the natural ally and guardian of America, would destroy the sovereign position of the United States, burying for centuries the prosperity, development, and future security of this country.</p>
   
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>In circumstances such as these, the United States has no alternative but to arm as quickly as possible, in order to be able to throw all its power and splendid resources openly and mightily into the Allied camp, to defend England's power on the seas with all its strength and in general not to neglect anything that might help to destroy military Germany today or in the future.</p>
   <p>During the World War or after it the United States can proceed only at the Allies' side and always against the Germans.</p>
   <p>In all calmness and with due consideration, in the belief in the justice of the cause they are defending, the American people must prepare themselves energetically for the inevitable war, casting aside as manifestations of cowardice, ineptitude, weakness, or even treason all efforts to maintain peace and to keep us out of the war. Congress cannot hesitate much longer and must not paralyze the President's wise initiative, thus exposing the whole future and honor of this republic to danger. And when finally the United States does enter the war, it will have to be a victorious war, a war conducted at the side of the Allies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The great majority of the American people already understand this, and the local Daily News asserts that one cannot conduct a war with an external enemy on paper or in some spirit world, and warns against the statements now being made in Washington that the United States would best defend its interests and honor by keeping out of the war which the Central Powers are now waging against the Allies. This paper justly concludes that:</p>
   <p>"Such a political policy would be ruinous for the United States, because it would lead to a scandalous shedding of blood and wasteof money, and a piling up of misfortunes for the future. Therefore, in complete alliance with those countries which are now fighting Germany, the American people must insist that every effort be made to put an end to Germany's submarine madness. With such an alliance the United States can proceed with full confidence and power toward a just and lasting peace."</p>
   <p>Therefore, even for the United States, the only road toward peace leads through war. And a peace without victory would be madness--merely an unfortunate parody <span class="page-break">\8</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
