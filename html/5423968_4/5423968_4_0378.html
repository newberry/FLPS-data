   <p>A recruiting rally for the Polish Army in France was held yesterday evening at Warszynski's hall in St. Hyacinth's Parish, Avondale, where the Reverend John Zdechlik is pastor. The rally was opened by the Reverend Francis Pleczynski with a prayer and a short speech, after which he named Stanislaus Szwajkart, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, as chairman. The Reverend Pleczynski was made secretary.</p>
   <p>Szwajkart addressed a few words to the gathering, explaining the purpose and importance of the rally, after which he requested that the audience give careful attention to the program. The program proceeded as follows:</p>
   <p>The Mitrenga Brothers' Orchestra played the American national anthem, the "Star Spangled Banner", to which the audience arose, and followed with a medley of Polish songs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The pupils of St. Hyacinth's school, directed by Charles Borowinski, local organist, sang the "Star Spangled Banner" in Polish. They sang very well, to which the long-sustained applause of the audience attested.</p>
   <p>The orchestra then played "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" (Poland is not yet lost) while Stephen Babecki, a volunteer to the Polish Army, came upon the platform with the Polish flag. The audience arose and greeted the flag with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>The next number was a recitation by Miss Agatha Machowicz, "Your Country Calls", for which the audience was unsparing in its applause.</p>
   <p>Following the recitation, W. F. Rozycki, organizer of the Polish Army for Recruiting Center II, delivered an address. His words reached the hearts of his hearers, for he described the whole horror of the present war and the situation in Poland. He called upon all good sons of Poland to take up arms, and all those who cannot do so to contribute money for the Polish Army, which is being created <span class="page-break">\3</span>to demand what is rightfully ours, what has been taken away from us treacherously and by force.</p>
   <p>Following Rozycki, John Koskiewicz, a member of the Avondale Citizen's Committee, spoke, urging enlistment in the Polish Army and contributions to its fund. Among other things, he said that the community of Avondale ought to be second in the number of recruits sent to the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Szwajkart then recited "My Country", for which she received a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>The boys' choir of St. Hyacinth Parish, directed by the local organist, sang "Far Beyond the Niemen." Organist Borowinski deserves praise for his training of this choir; it proves also that our boys are not sleeping, but are learning to sing the Polish songs that will keep the Polish spirit alive within them. The public rewarded their efforts with applause that seemed to have no end.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Walter Permoda, a pupil of St. Hyacinth's School, then recited: "Tears Will not Help Us." The boy impressed everyone with his recitation; he spoke clearly and boldly, and he also received the approbation of the audience.</p>
   <p>The next number was an address by the recruiting officer for Center II, A. Wolski, who described the life of a Polish soldier. He said that the Polish soldier is a volunteer, not a conscripted man, and in spite of the fact that he is not at present being paid, as is the American soldier, he has this to his credit, that he did not enlist for money, but from a sense of duty to the homeland that now needs his help to tear itself from the grasp of the Prussian who is torturing the Polish people. He encouraged enlistment in the Polish Army, saying that there should be no young man who has no family obligations who would not join the Polish Army, for it is his sacred duty to his homeland.</p>
   <p>A recitation, "In a Historic Moment," by Miss Helen Wisniewski, was rewarded with applause. Zenon Czeskawski, a pupil of the school, then delivered an address on the Prussian system, for which he too was amply applauded. This was followed by <span class="page-break">\5</span>an address by the Reverend John Zdechlik, pastor of St. Hyacinth's Parish. As a good priest and patriot, he called upon those gathered to action, for Poland calls. "Our duty," he said, "is, at the present time, to work together harmoniously for the good of our motherland, for that is the sacred duty of every good Pole. To work, then, without delay! It is high time for action, for Poland is suffering in the Prussian grip."</p>
   <p>Then volunteers were called forward to enlist, Thomas kruzel came to the platform, and after kissing the Polish flag, left for the recruiting station with Sergeant S. Balinski.</p>
   <p>It is too bad that there was only one volunteer, but it is hoped that after yesterday's rally, the spirit of our forefathers will be kindled in the breasts of the Polish youth and they will enlist in the Polish Army to fight for a free, united, and independent Poland, and for the freedom of all nations.</p>
   <p>The collection for the Polish Army netted $36.11, and was immediately turned over <span class="page-break">\6</span>to Recruiting Officer Wolski.</p>
   <p>The audience sang "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland) to conclude the program.</p>
