   <p>At the "White House", located at Milwaukee Avenue and West Division Street, the home of the Polish banking institution, the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, hundreds of good wishers came to congratulate Professor M. S. Szymczak on his new appointment as vice-president of the bank. Crowds began to gather immediately after the business closing hours last Saturday afternoon to wish him well. Flowers and telegrams were sent throughout the day. Many friends, businessmen, and politicians called in person also.</p>
   <p>The new vice-president passed out cigars to the men and chocolates to the ladies as a token of appreciation for their kind and generous wishes. This, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>indeed, was a great occasion for him to celebrate the Christmas holidays among his friends. Professor Szymczak, having held the position as Superintendent of the Cook County Forest Preserves, without doubt will be able to handle the various problems that may arise during his initiatory days of his new position. His wide popularity will be of great service to him.</p>
