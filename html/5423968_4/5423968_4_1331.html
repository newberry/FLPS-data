Here he will find tables, charts, pictures, etc., showing the procedure he should follow in order to prevent sickness or check its spread; also the importance of sanitary measures when health is exposed to danger through uncleanliness. The mere fact that the exposition occupies six floors of the City Club Building will give one some idea of what benefits may be derived from visiting the place.</p>
