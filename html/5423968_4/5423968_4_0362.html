   <p>A rally, under the auspices of the local Citizens' Committee, was held at the A. Mickiewicz's Hall on South Morgan Street in Bridgeport yesterday afternoon. At three o'clock, the hall was already filled to capacity with men and women who had come to hear speeches on the Polish Army, which is being recruited here to fight alongside the Allies against Poland's age-old enemy, Germany, to avenge all of the wrongs done to the Polish nation, and to help democracy win throughout the world.</p>
   <p>Shortly after three o'clock, the orchestra, conducted by [E.]Bakszewicz, played a few selections, for which it was rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The rally was opened at four in the afternoon with the American national anthem, after which A. Ciesiewicz, [President of the local Citizens' Committee], called upon [M.] Swiatkowski to preside and [W.] Mocny to perform the duties of secretary. The speakers and representatives of the Polish Army were also called <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the platform.</p>
   <p>Chairman Swiatkowski delivere a short address and then requested the Reverend S. Nawrocki, pastor of St. Mary of Immaculate Conception Parish, to lead the gathering in prayer.</p>
   <p>Since the St. Barbara choir was not present to sing, Bakszewicz's orchestra played "Medley of Polish Songs", after which the Reverend Nawrocki was asked to speak. Father <span class="gap">[gap]</span>cki began by saying that he is not accustomed to speaking in a hall, but in church from the pulpit, but since the matter is important, he would do his duty. In his address, he touched upon the late Pope's sympathy for the Polish cause, and upon German hopes that Poland is forever lost. He said that the Germans had been conducting political intrigues in Poland for centuries and that Poland did not fall because of bad government but because of German trickery. The speaker said that he could see the resurrection of Poland in the near future. He believes that the community of Bridgeport will send soldiers to the Polish Army and that the Women will aid in this work. It was the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>speaker's belief also that the Polish women of Bridgeport would prove themselves true daughters of Poland. A thief cannot be expected to give back what he has stolen--it must be taken from him by force.</p>
   <p>He also pointed out that the Polish Army needs not only men but money, for, if the German comes upon us with cannon, we cannot fight him with bare fists. We too must have cannon. He called upon everyone for generosity in this cause, demonstrating how much can be done by united action. He cited as an example, the school children's collection made up of Pennies, which already amounts to more than a hundred dollars. He expressed the hope that everyone would leave the meeting with empty pockets. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that our Polish soldiers return to their families from the war unharmed and in the best of health, but with the news that Poland has been freed from the yoke of tyrants after a hundred or so years of oppression.</p>
   <p>Following Father Nawrocki's address, Chairman Swiatkowski spoke on the necessity of contributing money to the Polish Army. He calculated how much could be <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>collected if everyone of the four million Poles in America contributed a certain amount. Even with small contributions, six million dollars could be collected in the course of six months. For this money, enough cannon could be purchased to chase all of the Germans out of Poland. He appointed the following women to take up a collection: Mrs. Grabowski, Mrs. Ciesielski, Miss Kurek, and Miss Cesarz. While the collection was being taken, the orchestra played a beautiful musical selection. In addition to the collection taken on the floor, a number of individuals and societies made contributions into the hands of Mrs. Julia Bauer, [secretary of the local Citizens' Committee], which totalled 133.00. The collection on the floor netted $121.16, making a total of $254.16.</p>

   <p>The next number on the program was a selection by the St. Barbara Choir. The Choir sang the "Medley of Polish Songs" faultlessly and was forced to repeat the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>same number as an encore. Following this number, the first recruit to the Polish Army was introduced.</p>
   <p>The next address was delivered by F. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>arc. The speaker pointed out the duties of the Polish emigrant element to Poland, how these duties have thus far been performed, and how they should be performed. He pointed out that today the Polish cause is of first importance, that the great powers are interested in that cause, that Poland is supported by the Allied nations and especially by this great republic, the United States, with President Wilson at its head. The speaker called upon the youth to enlist numerously in the Polish Army. After this address, the chairman requested the orchestra to play another number.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Julia Bauer, secretary of the local Citizens' Committee then read the report on the collections that were taken and followed with a short address on the Polish Army, calling every one to work, for Poland's greatest hour is at hand. Her patriotic address was rewarded with a storm of applause.</p>

   <p>F. Paluch sang a song composed by himself as the next number. His two brothers have already joined the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>[Words to song omitted by translator].</p>
   <p>After singing, Paluch delivered a rather lengthy address in which he called upon the youth to enlist in the Polish Army and upon the older people, who cannot go to war, to contribute as much as possible to the Polish cause, especially to the Polish Army Fund, for the army is preparing to fight our age-old enemy, the German.</p>
   <p>The rally ended at about seven o'clock in the evening with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland].</p>
   <p>Recruits Given Send-off</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Before the rally ended, the chairman announced that, in accordance with the generally accepted custom, the Citizen's Committee had arranged a send-off party for the eleven recruits who are leaving tomorrow for the training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake, to be held at eight o'clock at the recruiting headquarters on South Morgan Street.</p>
   <p>In addition to the eleven volunteers themselves, their relatives and all of the members of the Citizens' Committee were Present. After a short prayer and the singing of "Boze Cos Polske", the volunteers and invited guests sat down to a modest banquet which had been hurriedly prepared. The general atmosphere was one of dignity, yet not lacking in sincerity. In bidding the volunteers farewell, the general hope was expressed not only that they return to their homes safely but that they be harbingers of the news long impatiently awaited by us that, after a century of misfortune, Poland is again free and stands among the great nations of Europe. This is the spirit in which spoke Mrs. Julia Bauer, Stephen Balinski, recruiting sergeant for Bridgeport, A. Ciesiewicz, president of the Bridgeport Citizens' Committee, T. Swiatnicki, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>M. Swiatkiewicz, F. Paluch, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ieczorek, J. Berek, treasurer of the Committee, F. Lukaszewski, J. H. Suderwski, and others whose names the reporter was not able to procure since he had to leave this truly homey gathering before its conclusion.</p>
   <p>A number of soldiers' songs were sung during the course of the evening, which ended at about eleven o'clock.</p>
   <p>Today, after hearing mass, the volunteers departed for Recruiting station II, and from there to the railroad station, to follow those who have already gone before to fight for democracy and for Polish freedom.</p>
