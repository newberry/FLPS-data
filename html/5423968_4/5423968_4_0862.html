   <p>On turning the pages of history, we find that every hundred years, more or less, some nations start a war in order to drown their sorrows and misfortunes in rivers of blood. Every hundred years, more or less, Europe goes through a war in which more than two countries are involved.</p>
   <p>This bloody anniversary has now come upon us. Six large countries are to enter battle, dragging after themselves other smaller countries.</p>
   <p>The so-called greater national necessity has reached the point where certain empires must unsheath their swords and push millions of their innocent soldiers to be killed, or to be crippled for the rest of their lives.</p>
   <p>There are no ideals in this war on the part of the empires. They are guided solely by the desire for material gains, or the desire for revenge.</p>
   
   <p>The ideals are all on the side of the smaller nations, especially those which, from time to time, were either entirely annexed or robbed of part of their lands. But these nations will play either a very small part or no part at all in this war.</p>
   <p>Despite its entirely materialistic character, the present war has one good side--it will demonstrate the foolishness of armed peace.</p>
   <p>For decades humanity has struggled under the weight of armed peace and has even been deprived of vital nourishment in order that machine guns, mausers, howitzers, and other "tools" of civilization might be purchased.</p>
   <p>For decades humanity was retarded in its march of progress by turning the healthiest part of its organism into a machine of war which, as a rule, produced only conceited, half-smart and half-foolish little automata.</p>
   <p>It is enough to listen to any Austrian officer, with a sword and a couple of stars, to be convinced that humanity has lost one person who could have been an intelligent and useful citizen were it not for that little sword and those little stars on his collar.</p>
   <p>The war will put an end to armed peace and militarism, thus eliminating all the useless sidewalk polishers who, although calling themselves the defenders of their country, serve no other purpose than to paralyze the march of progress.</p>
   <p>After the war, the peasant will stay at home instead of wasting his valuable time in destroying others or in saluting his superiors.</p>
   <p>Tragic as war is in itself, it has a comical side, too. The comical part of it is that of all the empires involved in this war, there is not a single one that could boast of not having some injury to other nations on its conscience.</p>
   
   <p>A thief wants to rob a thief, but since it is important to preserve the prestige of the "little innocent" which is forced to give battle, an entire comedy is performed with ultimatums, notes, and similar puppet shows called international laws.</p>
   <p>Let us just look, one at a time, at the empires that want to settle their differences with bloodshed. Russia has already established her reputation as a political robber. All of her possessions, from the very beginnings of the attacks of the Norsemen, came from robberies and she cannot show an honest title of ownership to a single one of them.</p>
   <p>The Germans, and especially the Prussians, have been getting fat on foreign blood for centuries, not even sparing those who, with other treatment, could be useful citizens.</p>
   <p>France, also,is no saint in her deeds. During those famous "reunions" in the reign of Louis XIV, she robbed the Germans of this same Alsace-Lorraine which the Germans recaptured in 1870, and for the defense of which they must now fight.</p>
   <p>England murdered the Boers, who got possession of Transvaal by murdering the Zulus.</p>
   <p>The Italians attacked Turkey not quite three years ago and robbed her of Tripoli, which also came into the hands of Turkey in not too honest a way.</p>
   <p>And so on in a circle. History does not know of a country which did not steal something, which, for purposes of aggression, did not try to take something from other nations to turn it to its own advantage.</p>
   <p>Some try to call this tragicomedy the struggle for existence; others see in it ordinary punishment for transgressions; others, again, after long deliberation, will cry out: "A robber is fighting a robber--let him, so long as he returns my stolen property."</p>
