   <p>While the greatest war in the history of mankind is raging in Europe, while day after day the death-bearing shots of artillery fire wipe the existence of thousands of human beings off the surface of the earth, Uncle Sam, with the playful smile of an old and experienced merchant hunting for new customers, strokes his beard and conducts a bloodless war for the purpose of securing new markets for American industry.</p>
   <p>To the accompaniment of European cannons whole mobs of agents of all sorts of factories and manufacturing firms are running about South America trying to oust German and English industry from their position of dominance.</p>
   <p>The Germans, who considered themselves the actual masters of commerce in the other half of America (and who in reality were the masters), have no inkling of the extent of the losses which they suffer day after day at the hands of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>people whose only weapon is a pencil and an order book.</p>
   <p>All branches of America's powerful industry have declared war on the well-known label "Made in Germany" and have determined to place banners with the inscription "Made in United States" throughout South America.</p>
   <p>It appears that we shall not be false prophets if we forecast victory for the United States along the entire line, although it may be only for a limited time.</p>
   <p>We shall not be disloyal Poles when we wish the United States this victory with all our hearts. Since South America seems incapable of producing her own large industry and must be dependent on other countries, then let the United States be this producer, not Germany.</p>
   <p>That our deductions are correct and that our wishes have a realistic basis <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>if proved by the fact that the United States press and the proper authorities are actively engaged in the conquest of Brazil.</p>
   <p>this country with its twenty-one million inhabitants represents no small tidbit for large manufacturers.</p>
   <p>In 1912 the United States supplied Brazil with goods worth $300,000,000, which scarcely represented a third of the needs of its inhabitants. The United States was superseded by Germany and England.</p>
   <p>Now that the two competitors are fighting each other, the third will gain--and it is right for him to do so.</p>
   <p>The present partial stagnation in American industry in only temporary. It is a precursor of the greatest economic development in the history of this country, rather than a result of overproduction, as we feared before the war.</p>
   <p>The war came at exactly the right time to save the United States from an <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>economic catastrophe. Thanks to it the great capitalists and industrialists who were preparing to fight Wilson even at the cost of ruining hundreds of lives, have turned their attention away from party politics and toward the conquest of new sources of income.</p>
   <p>Their greed in this case may prove to be praiseworthy, if as a result of it the economic well-being of the working class increases.</p>
   <p>When the European war ends, the whole economic world will turn to the United States. Neither Germany nor any other European country will be able to put its domestic economic affairs in order for a long time. It will not be able to resume its prewar state of development because of lack of laborers and capital, and lack of political and social order.</p>
   <p>Therefore, as long as Europe continues to struggle within herself and as <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>long as her commerce and industry do not return to normalcy, she will be America's customer instead of being purveyor of exquisite products and the worst sort of junk stamped "Made in Germany".</p>
   <p>Therefore, if the United States is able to develop its industry sufficiently it will be able, for a considerable period of time, to be the provider of South America, Europe, and almost the entire world.</p>
   <p>Whether the United States will be able to meet this exigency is, however, another matter.</p>
   <p>If the past standards of Uncle Sam's economic politics are to continue, we cannot even dream of the conquest of so large a market. The United States must change her politics if she wishes to do anything to benefit her people. Party quarrles, petty politics, and battles for jobs and lucrative sine-cures <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>must give way to capable economic administration of colossal magnitude.</p>
   <p>Large industrialists must then accept the principle that the victory of United States industry does not depend on the amassing of millions by individuals but on the economic well-being of all of the people.</p>
   <p>Uncle Sam can hope to exert world-wide economic influence only when all people have the right to economic benefit and when all people in the country see that their interest lies in the development of this influence.</p>
   <p>This is not only the prerequisite to achieving the goal but the goal itself, because only when it is reached will the constantly fomenting dissatisfaction and the feeling of injustice be removed from the labor sphere.</p>
   <p>The war will not pass over the laboring masses without an echo, because they, too, will see in it the renewal and reform of the old world.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The echoes of the cannon shots will not have died out before the masses set up their cry. These same people today, despite the antiwar principles announced and followed, fight for the unity and the political existence of their country</p>
   <p>One must not treat lightly the fact that the evolutionists have joined the war. Although their leaders in most cases joined for chauvinistic or even patriotic reasons, the masses joined the war for the purpose of fighting militarism. Militarism has been Europe's plague, and its destruction the ideal of the working masses who have been robbed by all sorts of military and war taxes and contributions.</p>
   <p>After the war, the action of the masses will spread throughout the entire world, not excluding the United States. Although this country does not have militarism, it has hundreds of other "isms", above all its native "capitalism".</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The principles of capitalism in the United States rest essentially on false foundations and ideas. They remind one of the pre-Christian times when the wealthy Roman patrician or Greek plutocrat lived from his slaves and the poor people surrounding him.</p>
   <p>Capital and labor are immortal because they compliment each other. They are to a certain extent even synonymous:labor always creates capital and capital always gives labor a start.</p>
   <p>But it is quite another matter that this capital with which we have to deal in the United States is a parasite and, as such, should be changed completely. In this fact lies the threat of revolutionary uprisings in the land of Uncle Sam.</p>
   <p>They can be more easily avoided now than ever before: one need only take <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>advantage skillfully of the present opportunity to gain a world-wide market for United States industry.</p>
   <p>If the laborer is well paid, if he considers himself a stockholder of the country's economic wealth, he will be satisfied and the country will come to the fore in the world. But if, after the conquest of new industrial markets, the laborer is forgotten and continues to have his mouth shut by the famous "dollar and a quarter" for a day's work, then poverty will prevail and Uncle Sam will remain in the shadow.</p>
   <p>We have to laugh when we read now, during these times, that the anti-immigration bill is still wandering about in the Congress at Washington. One must be crazy even to think about restricting immigration at a time so critical for the country's industry. American industry at its present pace definitely needs laborers and exists on them. What will happen when the markets for the products of this country increase after the European war and the influx of immigrants decreases, as it will because of the depletion of populations abroad.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Advantages and privileges should be granted the newcomers. We should not push away from America's shores those who would contribute muscular strength to help American industry conquer the label "Made in Germany".</p>
   <p>In considering the immigration question, one must not forget that as soon as the war is over feverish work will be begun to bring industry back to its former stage of development. Then the battle for laborers will begin and Europe may sharpen her emigration laws in order to prevent laborers from leaving to enrich America.</p>
   <p>European industry will suffer great losses through the war and will remain in a state of lethargy a long time after it; but it will not lay down its arms. After the war the industrial battle will rage along the entire line and America may be opposed by a commercial tariff alliance of all of Europe.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>Then why renew now some sort of anti-immigration bill and be taken in by the shortsighted chauvinistic agitation of the American Federation of labor.</p>
