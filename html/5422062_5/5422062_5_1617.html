   <p>Last Sunday's mass-meeting of the Democratic Union of Chicago, at the Morrison Hotel, was conclusive proof of the democratic sentiments of the Greeks of our community and the Greeks of America generally. It also proved that there are no Royalist-minded Greeks in America. Now, if there are those who maintain that there are such people here, we challenge them to call such a mass-meeting of Royalists and see what strength they can muster. Never mind about five or six of them who get together in the Consulate offices and send telegrams to Athens, shamelessly lying and deceiving those in Greece by telling them that the telegrams are resolutions passed in mass-meetings. For after all they must have some shame even if they are called Royalists.</p>
