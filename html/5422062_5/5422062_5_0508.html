   <p>No. Doc. 1022. - Serv. 414.</p>
   <p>The Holy Synod, of the Independent Church of Greece was officially informed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the creation of Archepiscopates and Episcopates through the far flung empire of Orthodoxy and the termination of the Patriarchate's Tome of 1908.</p>
   <p>Thereby, at the convocation of May 16, A. D. the Synod, with infinite reverence to the Ecumenical Throne and with untold desire to cooperate and abide by the age-old canonical orders resolved to recognize the termination of the 1908 Tome and revert the supervising authority of all the Orthodox churches abroad to the scepter of the Patriarchate. This resolution, the Holy Synod commands the clergy and the pious laity to accept and that the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate be respected as the highest ecclesiastical authority.</p>
   
   <p>Especially the Holy Synod very ardently commends to the Greek Orthodox church in America, to recognize as the only canonical authority the established Archepiscopate and its bishops and to terminate the division of the church which tends to diminish the respect and reverence of the people towards the church.</p>
   <p>Otherwise religious services performed by non-canonical priests have no validity without the sanction of the regular spiritual authority and the bishopric blessing.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the future, all the Greek churches abroad, for ecclesiastical questions, must appeal not to the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, but to the Ecumenical Patriarchate and its authorized representatives.</p>
   <p>And God's love and peace be upon you and guide you to promote christianity and every virtue in glory of His name. Amen.</p>
