   <p>Metropolitan Bishop Gennadios arrived to-day in Chicago accompanied by Constantine Mela, a shipmaster of the Greek navy, and G. Kontikaki, a colonel of the Greek army, who, with an official mission from the Greek Government and the Greek church, have come to America to express gratitude for aid rendered by Americans in the establishment of refugees and to help strengthen the friendship between the two countries, as well as to stir up the interest of Greeks here in the Y.M.C.A. institutions of Greece.</p>
   <p>The object of their mission is undoubtedly most important, and the persons assigned to it are worthy of the task placed upon them.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America, who have always shown their ardent interest for every Greek mission, will undoubtedly in this case also display their Greek sentiments and try with all their might to contribute toward the success of the aim of the Most Reverend Metropolitan Bishop Gennadios.</p>
