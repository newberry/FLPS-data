   <p>p. 1.- The Greek Daily first published the information about a Congress of the Communities to take place Nov. 16th. The New York dailies did not publish a word, despite the fact that the decision was taken in New York, and the Congress will be held in New York. Information of such importance ought to have made its first appearance in the New York papers.</p>
   <p>In commenting upon this subject we do not mean to exalt the Greek Daily for its alertness. We wish to express, rather, our surprise, not only on silence of the New York papers regarding a matter of such importance, but about our communal organization in general. If such silence is intentional it can provoke many thoughts and comments.</p>
   <p>How could this ommission by the New York papers be explained? How could they preserve silence on an event of such importance that is of primary interest to Greeks of America from coast to coast. Do they mean to have this Congress transacted secretly and in a family circle, staging and reserving it for themselves, if we judge from the plans they are aiming to centralize all authority in New York, and assume the guardianship of all Greeks in America?</p>
   
   <p>In a previous article we have shown how our rights have been violated by having New York assigned as the city for the Congress. Never mind the fact that we were led to believe that Chicago was to be the place, and it was to be the seat of the Archdiocese also, on account of which the communities involved themselves into expenses by hiring necessary quarters and so forth. Chicago was the place suitable for this Congress, due to its geographical location.</p>
   <p>Consequently, the decision to have New York, instead, as well as the way this Congress is to convene violates the rights of the Community of Chicago as well as all the communities of the midwest and West.</p>
   <p>The system of centralization, which the New Yorkers have laid out, is not one conforming to this are, nor can it be in accord with the Prevailing system and liberties that the Greek populace of America has long possessed.</p>
   <p>If the New Yorkers imagine that a mixed council, which they seek to monopolize, will direct the churches and schools of the Greek communities of America, they fool themselves greatly. Conditions, themselves, cry aloud that such a guardianship could not possibly be accepted by the Greeks of America. Their enterprising schemes are doomed in advance, even before being put into effect.</p>
   <p>The Greek' community of Chicago, which had the initiative for the solution of our church division and the establishment of the new Ecclesiastical regime, must fight united against those who, apparently, have a desire to return to dissension to create new causes of friction, and make Hellenism in America a feature of the New York oligarchy.</p>
