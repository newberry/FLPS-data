   <p>The value of an education for all persons, can only be denied by people who have no social consciousness.</p>
   <p>Schools are of especial importance to the Greeks in America. The church and the state are entirely independent of one another, in order that religious freedom might prevail. In accordance with the laws of the country, religious training is not given in the American public schools. Therefore schools, especially parochial and Sunday schools, are not only necessary, but they are of major importance; for without any religious training, people become unbelievers and scoffers.</p>
   <p>This is the reason that has caused all creeds to build their own schools; in which the children are taught by priests or by ministers. The children educated in such schools, grow up well-trained, and familiar with the dogma <span class="page-break">2</span>and precepts of their creed. They are careful of their morals and their behavior. They have a deep respect for the wishes and words of their elders. They are ever-willing to offer their services for the benefit of the church or the community; and in general they are interested more in the common welfare than in their own personal interests.</p>
   <p>We who have a religion and a language to keep alive do nothing. Other people study our language because they realize its beauty and cultural values; while we consider it degrading to speak our own language.</p>
   <p>What educational facilities do we have? Parishes without schools. Where schools do exist, only the grace of God keeps them alive, and half-worthy of the title.</p>
   <p>What do our priests do about this? Priests! Which priests? Do we have priests? Or are you, perhaps, thinking of certain beings, who have been tolerated by society as necessary evils? Exploiters and worthless creatures, who seek an easy life at some one else's expense.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It is true that the majority of priests are fully capable of understanding the finer and higher requirements of society. They should, because they have been trained in their vocations and the beliefs of the Church. The priests know the refined and dignified ideals of the Greek dogma; and they are taught to carry on and uphold these ideals in their careers as priests.</p>
   <p>I sincerely believe that they enter their chosen vocations, zealously and fanatically devoted to the upholdance of these ideals. It is not an easy task, for the priest is held responsible for the fullfillment of the Church's purposes and programs. He is also considered a representative of his religion, and, as such, is able to influence large groups of people; therefore he must be meticulous in his words and actions.</p>
   <p>Truthfully, how many have seriously considered whether or not the clerics in America are permitted to carry out the Ecclesiastical program as they have been instructed? Is it fully comprehended, that often they are in the same position as one who is told to build a fire, but is given no fuel or flame?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Do the Greek people realize that the churches are governed as if they were brotherhoods? Do they know that a priest has very little to say about the church he is supposedly in charge of? Do they know, that he is at the mercy and command of a board of governors or trustees, which, in most cases, is composed of backward, uneducated, prejudiced, and selfish individuals?</p>
   <p>What can a priest do when his hands and feet are literally tied by the board; when he sees that he is ignored and at times deliberately misunderstood by men who argue, just for the sake of preventing an argument; and contradict, only because they desire to impede any action or desire of the priest.</p>
   <p>Not only do they dictate the policy of the Church, but they are bold enough to interfere with his preaching and interpretations of sacred subjects. Is it any wonder that priests adopt indifferent attitudes towards their churches and parishes? Of course not!</p>
   <p>This condition can be changed very easily. Let us adopt the policy of the <span class="page-break">5</span>other churches, which are more successful than our own. The priest should have certain rights and privileges that cannot be usurped. These rights should be plainly stated in the church's charter for all to read. When this is done, a priest can be held responsible for the conditions in his church and parish. But, not until then!</p>
   <p>Perhaps some one will ask: "Is a great deal of money necessary for the existence of a Sunday-school class? Is it such a difficult task for a priest to teach the little Greek children about their faith?"</p>
   <p>I will answer these questions myself. My immediate response to these problems should be enough evidence of how interested the priests are in the education and religious training of the Greek children. I sincerely believe that all the clerics are willing and anxious to do their part; however, they cannot do so unless they are supplied with the money necessary for carrying on such work.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that the priests are already overburdened. Not only <span class="page-break">6</span>do they have heavy church programs and ceremonies to bear, but they also have many philanthropic, social, and patriotic obligations to fulfill.</p>
   <p>The present system of governing the church does not allow the priest to make his own schedule, in order that he might save valuable time to devote to some necessary undertaking--such as teaching a Sunday afternoon Bible class. When some worthy Christian desires to have some sort of religious ceremony such as a marriage or a baptism performed, and goes to the home of the priest and discovers that the priest is not there, he immediately presents himself to the board of trustees and makes complaints about the priest.</p>
   <p>The board will call the priest on the carpet for devoting his time to matters that bring no money into the church treasury. He must always be at the service of those who seek him--who are able to pay large sums for his time.</p>
   <p>What must the priest do at this time? If he heeds the board's advice he might be neglecting an important matter; if he ignores the board, he will have trouble and might just as well pack his luggage and depart. If he is <span class="page-break">7</span>not willing to leave; then the matter becomes public property, and the priest is the subject of gossip or ridicule. No priest desires to have that happen to him.</p>
   <p>Again some one may ask: why priests of other churches do not have such conditions to cope with? The answer, again, is very simple. The clerics of other churches are given complete jurisdiction over the activities of the board; and they answer only to their religious superiors for their actions. They are less burdened with clerical duties, and these are performed only in the church. All rites must be performed within certain regulated times; in order that the priest might have sufficient time to devote to his social and cultural activities.</p>
   <p>If a person questions the activities of the priest, he is enabled to end the controversy by saying, "that is the rule of our church". If this person appeals to the church board, not only will he be told: "That's the rule--you must be obedient to the father"; but he will in all probability be severely rebuked.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>This is why I contend--and shall always contend--that the work of our churches shall be fruitless and stagnant so long as they are governed by heterogeneous groups of unfit individuals. No one expects a tree with rotten roots to bear healthy fruit.</p>
   <p>My own experiences in this matter have been very bitter. It is practically impossible to please the board and the members of the parish all at the same time. Agreement is a word that holds no meaning for them.</p>
   <p>I appeal to the progressive Saloniki and its staff. Help us to instill a respect for the clergy in the hearts of the Greek people. Give them to understand that the position of the priest is a sacred one, and must be treated accordingly. Tell them to adopt the same respectful manner that is so evident in other religious groups. Explain that unfit individuals can enter the priesthood just as they can in other professions. Naturally, such people will destroy and undermine, because they are not capable or interested enough to be constructive. These few must not be considered <span class="page-break">9</span>representative of all the Greek priests in America. Prove to your readers that the other churches have followed such a regime as I have suggested, and by doing so have surpassed the Greek Church by far.</p>
   <p>If you succeed in doing these things, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have performed a great service for the Greeks of America. Your patriotic conscience will be clear, for you will have prepared the way for greater and finer accomplishments; which shall bring glory to our beloved mother country.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
