   <p>p. 5.- The newly formed chapter "Dilboy", No. 13, has begun to function in its activities to assist and help Greek crippled veterans of the United States Army, who fought in the great war.</p>
   <p>Some of these Greek veterans do not know that the United States Government has free hospitals to take care of them. They also do not know, that the Government compensates the maimed and incapacitated veterans, according to their disability.</p>
   <p>Those of the veterans who have any complaints to make will find the newly organized chapter ready and willing to forward their complaints to the proper authorities of the United States Government.</p>
   <p>The founding of this "Dilboy" chapter was due to the initiative of Mr. Millos, who is a clerk in the Hines hospital, and who we congratulate for the assistance he has extended to the Greek boys.</p>
