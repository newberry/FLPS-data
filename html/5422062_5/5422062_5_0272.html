   <p>p. 1.- Holy Week, or the week of Lord's Passions, is in reality the week of the priests' passions.</p>
   <p>The Lord suffered and was resurrected once, while the poor priests undergo the same martyrdom every year, the martyrdom of wakefulness and fasting and confessions and the rest.</p>
   <p>The churches during these days display great activity, and the collections taken during this period suffice to fill the gaps which the indifference of the people had created in the treasuries of our churches.</p>
   <p>For most people flood the churches only on certain holidays and show their reverence for sacred and holy things, while during the rest of the year they display complete indifference.</p>
   <p>However, everyone complains about the evils of our communal affairs and expects others to do the work and have it ready for them, and woe to the others if they do not find things in order.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>It is about time to change our system and have the many take interest in the community matters instead of expecting the few to keep their churches in good condition for them to use whenever they want a sacrament.</p>
   <p>It is about time to define the limits of the parishes, and every Christian should register as a member of his parish and show his real interest in the church and participate in the management of the community.</p>
