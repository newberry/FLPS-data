   <p>An international committee has been organized for the defense of the Greek Islands retained by Italy despite the fact that by her official admission she has no right to possess them.</p>
   <p>This committee bears the name Pentodekanisos and its aim is to strive by all methods to secure the liberation of the islands on which Italy is squatting like an incubus.</p>
   <p>Italy occupied the Greek Islands temporarily and stated that they would be evacuated at the proper time, i.e., as soon as Turkey, had fully complied with the terms of the treaty which closed the African Tripolitan war. But that time will never come if this is left to Italy's free volition.</p>
   <p>The islands were and still are Greek. Their commercial significance is not of much importance to Italy. They must be returned to Greece.</p>
   <p>This is the message conveyed to us by Pentodekanisos, the international committee, in anouncing its formation. The cooperation of all Greeks is asked in the rude unceasing struggle which they have undertaken.</p>
