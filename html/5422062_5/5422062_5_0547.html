   <p>p. 1- In one of our preceding articles we discussed the reasons why the silence of Ambassador Simopoulos tends to make our ecclesiastical problems more complicated instead of easier to solve. And the solution of our church problems is earnestly desired by the Hellenism of America, which indeed is fully justified in its wish to be informed of what the ambassador knows. The people want their church activities to resume their normal course after their interruption by the powers in Greece, which caused schisms here apparently sanctioned by the Greek Government until recently, when that Government deemed it best to find a remedy for this scandalous state of affairs. Accordingly, after serious study of the problem, the Greek Government has come to the conclusion that the only way to solve it is to dispatch a legate from the Holy Synod to America.</p>
   <p>We did not hesitate, even in the face of the consecration at San Francisco then impending, to characterize the silence of the Greek ambassador as <span class="page-break">\2</span>criminal, inasmuch as the new bishopric increases our church disunity and complicates even more our ecclesiastical disorders. Indeed, we foresee grievous consequences, which it would be to Mr. Simopoulos's interest to avert by timely intervention.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows, the ambassador as well as anybody else, the reason for Mr. Philaretos's antagonistic attitude. Vasilios established himself in Chicago, winning over parishes which until a short time ago had refused to acknowledge him. After his success in Chicago he established himself in New York, and now he will doubtless find followers in San Francisco after he has been consecrated as bishop.</p>
   <p>We must bear in mind that the creation of these independent churches under Vasilios is nothing more or less than a protest against the partisan selection of Alexander Rodostolos as Archbishop of North America. We greatly fear that this protest will become more vigorous, and that the breach will be widened with the lapse of time, for Vasilios, encouraged by the support which he has received, may attempt to carry out the scheme proposed by the league of laymen and clergymen of his <span class="page-break">\3</span>parishes in a meeting in Washington and following the example of the Rodostolos churches, ordain three bishops. If this was done, imagine what chaos would prevail, and how difficult hereafter would be the task of restoring harmony in the Greek parishes of America!</p>
   <p>It is precisely for these reasons that we characterized the silence of Mr. Simopoulos as criminal silence. After all, it is not proper for an ambassador who went to Greece and conferred with all the important people on our church matters and exchanged views with them to return in silence and to maintain that silence persistently, as if he were unaware of the existence of our ecclesiastical problems.</p>
   <p>Wishing to avoid serious consequences, we have emphatically called Mr. Simopoulos's attention to the danger, and today we again address him, urging him to avert, if there is still time, new complications.</p>
