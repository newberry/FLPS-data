   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Comrade:</p>
   <p>It affords me a great deal of personal pleasure to formally notify you of your selection as Chairman of the Americanism Committee of Cook County Council, The American Legion, Department of Illinois.</p>
   <p>You realize as I do that to properly function and effectively represent our Council, composed of 175 Posts and more than 3,200 Legion members, <span class="page-break">\2</span>the bulk of the work necessarily is delegated to the various committees and the responsibility for our success especially rests upon the committee Chairman.</p>
   <p>I know the many calls made upon your time but hope that as a personal favor to me and as your sacrifice for the Legion this year, you will accept this appointment.</p>
   <p>You will be furnished in the very near future with the names and addresses of your Committee and I know you will cooperate with them, the other committees and the officers of the State Department and Council in making 1931 the best year in our entire history.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Laurence J. Fenlon,</p>
   <p>Commander.</p>
