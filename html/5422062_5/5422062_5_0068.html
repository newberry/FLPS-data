   <p>The readers of Proodos have doubtless read statements and perhaps have heard rumors about uniting the two Greek schools on the West Side, those of Holy Trinity and St. Basil Churches. But even after these publications and reports the union of the two schools has not materialized, although the administrative councils of the two schools arrived at an agreement after prolonged negotiations.</p>
   <p>Because we hope that reason and a spirit of conciliation will prevail, we refrain from publishing an account of the petty spite by which certain persons are actuated. We wish to avoid arousing any more jealousy and animosity, emotions which are out of place in the consideration of this problem of the Greek schools. To the members of the administrative councils and to all those who have anything to say in promoting the general welfare we recommend that they maintain their dignity and avoid lowering themselves by adopting contemptible methods of attaining their ends, the deceitful devices of people too mean and worthless to direct public affairs. We hope that their sense of responsibility will lead them to <span class="page-break">2</span>perform their duty and to put an end to this shameful exploitation of everything which is held sacred among Greeks. Individuals who in public affairs act to gratify their personal animosities or to promote their personal interests not only undermine public institutions but dig the graves of their public careers by arousing the indignation of the people.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, for the present at least, the reorganization of the Socrates School and the resumption of its activities as a day school have been prevented by the personal caprices of certain people. We refrain from exposing them by printing their names, although we have been authorized to do so, for we believe that they are the victims of excessive zeal and of errors in judgment in their attempts to serve the public.</p>
   <p>As for our other problem, the question as to whether the Church of St. Basil shall be the meeting place of the convention of clergy and laity soon to be held in Chicago, we think that the policies of certain people who took part in the meeting which discussed the matter, and the tactics used by some of them, especially by Mr. Kotakis, were inexcusable. Mr. Kotakis is always <span class="page-break">3</span>ready to filibuster and object, but when the matter of selecting a church in which to hold the convention was up for discussion he changed his stand and left the field to others who did not want St. Basil's to be chosen. The plan was therefore abandoned, and St. Basil's lost its opportunity to be seen and admired by the delegates and other visitors and to afford to them its advantage of proximity to Greek centers.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that even in this case low personal passions influenced the actions of those who put through this scheme, by which the Greek center lost the benefits of the convention, and the Loop received them, although it had already been so much benefited by the World's Fair?</p>
   <p>At present we do not choose to proceed further in our discussion of this strange manner of handling the public affairs of the Greek parishes of our great Greek community in Chicago and of directing other important social and national matters. This unsatisfactory state of affairs has been achieved by individuals of dubious reputation and by tactics which were uncovered in the <span class="page-break">4</span>general meeting of the members of Holy Trinity Parish. This meeting was reported in a recent issue of Proodos.</p>
