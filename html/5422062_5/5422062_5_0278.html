   <p>Yesterday, 9 A.M., His Right Rev. Archbishop Athenagoras, reached the city of Chicago. The Executive Councils of all churches, with their Rectors, and many other people, waited for the arrival of Mr. Athenagoras at the Union Depot where they accompanied him to the Hotel La Salle at which Hotel, various speeches were delivered. His Holiness expressed his joy in finding himself among the Chicago Greeks, whose actions and patriotic sentiments he had heard and upon whom he depends for the re-organization of our church and communal matters.</p>
   <p>"I have no definite program to present you with," the Most Rev. Athenagoras said, "but I desire that everything that is to be done should come from your thoughts and by your decisions. To this end a congregating of all communities will be called by which the whole Greek populace will be represented, and through which common decisions for the re-organization of the said communities will be recorded. As for Chicago", he continued, "I can state, right now, that it will be a seat of the Archdiocese and I shall stay as long in New York as in Chicago."</p>
   
   <p>Then the Archbishop exchanged views in regard to the situation in our community and fully agreed with the opinion presented regarding the subdivision of Chicago into parishes and our compulsory registration in the particular vicinities of which we are members. This opinion had unanimous endorsement from all present and His Holiness was greatly pleased. Apparently indefatigable after his long journey, he was constantly asking for information about our affairs. He firmly believes that Hellenism in America will very soon show progress, and that the Greek Church in America will take its proper place among all orthodox churches as possessing superior spiritual authority.</p>
   <p>He regretted that he had to leave next Wednesday, but he promised to return in a month's time, when he will devote himself wholly to the settlement of our church and communal affairs.</p>
   <p>This decision, however, caused regret among his hearers, who, unanimously wanted His Right Reverance to stay here for the Easter holidays. As this seemed to be impossible, the presidents and pastors of the different communities went into a discussion as to which of the churches he would attend to lead the ritual next Sunday.</p>
   
   <p>After some delay it was decided to have His Holiness visit all churches first and afterwards decide as to the church in which he would officiate next Sunday. (The visit to the churches is related briefly here and then the question came up again for next Sunday's Holy Mass-- Translator).</p>
   <p>As the matter was left to His Holiness to decide upon, he chose St. Basil of the West Side, where the Greek populace is better concentrated and the church is larger.....</p>
