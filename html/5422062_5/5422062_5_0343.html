   <p>With joy the Hellenism of Chicago will hear that on Sunday, September 21, His Holiness, the Metropolitan Corinthian Damascinos, will say mass at Holy Trinity Church. We are sure that thousands of our countrymen will avail themselves of the chance to hear and see this distinguished personage. Next Sunday will be an important day to the Greeks of Chicago. Their first church, Holy Trinity, will be filled to capacity because every Greek is expected to attend.</p>
