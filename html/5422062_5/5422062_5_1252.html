   <p>An unusual ceremony is being prepared by the Greek-American Legion of War Veterans. This organization, under ceremonial leadership of Mr. Stati Mitchel, will hold its imitiation of new officers. Dr. Const. Koursoumias, present commander, invites all fellow nationals of our Community to be there, thus honoring by their presence and support morally, the noble efforts of our good and selected youth who, by their Legion, remind many Americans that, as sons of the immortal Greecian race, and deeply conscious of their descent, they do not pay tribute only to the God of Profit, Hermes, only, but that when honor and duty demand, they can also cheer the God of War, Mars.</p>
   <p>The sentiment of hatred against aliens, so much intensified lately, by a portion of native Americans, ought to be crushed against such associations as the Greek-American Legion, in order to come to itself and realize that all immigrants have helped and do help toward the present magnificence of their adopted country.</p>
   
   <p>That is why we think that it is a necessary duty and an obligation, on our part, to support and encourage organizations similar to the Greek-American Legion.</p>
   <p>This aim, we will accomplish by going to the aristocratic Drill Hall, Capitol Building, on Randolph and State Sts., next Tuesday, 8 P.M., where a pleasant surprise is anticipated, etc.</p>
   <p>Let our slogan be: "All to the fete of the Legion."</p>
