   <p>p. 2.- Our minister from Greece who intends to stay in Chicago a week, to look matters over, visited our church last Sunday. It is to be regretted, of course, that of the 20,000 Greeks in Chicago, less than 1,000 considered it necessary to go to church on that day.</p>
   <p>Among the notables of Chicago's Greek Community who accompanied Mr. Lambros Koromilas were Dr. G. Papaeliou, N. Protopapas, C. Vlahandreas and G. Matalas.</p>
