   <p>There is a little matter which the Greeks of Chicago would like to have cleared up. At the last Community meeting a sum of $20,000 was voted to buy the church on the South Side.</p>
   <p>Rev. K. Georgiados negotiated the deal and in doing so managed to get the church for only $18,000. We are thankful to Rev. Georgiados for this but there is something we would like to ask him. The lease was bought in the priest's name, although the community paid the $18,000. To whom does the church belong, the priest or the community? We don't want to cause any disturbance or unnecessary anxiety but we would like to have an answer soon.</p>
