   <p>p. 1.- Once again we will discuss our favorite subject--Priesthood. The priests are complaining of their measly salaries. There are fifty priests in the United States and they each make 5,000 annually including their extra fees for marriages, funerals, etc. Most of these priests freely admit that the only reason they came to America was because they heard of the great sums they could amass from the Greek people here. The Greek priests are costing the church-goers $500,000 a year. This money could easily be used for better purposes, such as hospitals, gymnasiums, schools, etc., where all could benefit from it.</p>
   <p>The priests are not what they used to be in our childhood days. They are human beings now, mercenary, grafting, and selfish. We are cheating ourselves and future generations by putting them on a pedestal and paying for it.</p>
