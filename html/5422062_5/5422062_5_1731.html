   <p>On June 28th the Greek flag will be officially delivered to the Governor of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The flag was dispatched by the Greek Nation, in a polite gesture of exchange, for the sending of the United States' flag to Greece, on the centennial anniversary of Greek independence.</p>
   <p>For greater formality in delivery of the flag, the Greek chapter of the American Legion wishing that many Greeks should participate in the ceremony, succeeded in getting a railroad reduction for round trips to Springfield, making the Illinois Central round trip ticket four dollars for the occassion.</p>
   <p>According to the checked reports coming to the office of the American Legion, hundreds of Greeks from cities of Illinois, Indiana and Missouri are coming to Springfield to participate in the ceremony of the flag's presentation.</p>
