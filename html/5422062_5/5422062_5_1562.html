   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are greatly pleased to see that large numbers of our fellow countrymen are leaving for our beloved fatherland, which they had left many years ago. Who knows how many times they had fondly remembered their own homes and loved ones when with other families and in other homes in this country?</p>
   <p>This is a very encouraging and pleasing development for our country, which will gain greatly by the return of her sons. The Greek nation will receive a new life-giving blood transfusion when it welcomes the adventurous Greeks who have wandered through the United States in search of a better fate and a more promising future. No one, of course, doubts that the return of so many immigrants will mean that much will now be accomplished. Our fatherland will prosper, and hence all its children will thrive.</p>

   <p>Those who go back to their native land have the greatest duty to perform. They must never forget their responsibility to their fellow citizens. In other words, they must describe before the astonished eyes of their fellow villagers and townsmen the actual economic and labor conditions in America, which in these days are not very favorable. They must make it known that thousands of men of our own nationality, as well as of other nationalities, are forced to leave this land because of the serious lack of jobs, of which there are, and will be, fewer and fewer.</p>
   <p>The Greek immigrants who return to Greece must therefore tell those who intend to come to America not to do so, because at present America does not provide ample economic opportunities.</p>
