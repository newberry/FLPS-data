   <p>For over a year the Epsilon Phi Epsilon Brotherhood has been operating very successfully as a North Side Young Men's and Women's Organization. During that time, this club has sponsored many patriotic causes and has much to uphold the Greek ideals.</p>
   <p>Last Friday, in the hall of Saint Andrews Church, the organization installed its new members with pomp and ceremony. The installation was followed by a speech by Miss S. Theodore, the president of the club. Miss Theodore emphasized the purpose of the organization, which is to bring together younger generation of Greek-Americans so they can more easily uphold Greek tradition, ideals, and love for the Mother tongue.</p>
