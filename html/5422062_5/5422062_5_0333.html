   <p>The undersigned representatives of all church associations of Chicago, met, Sept. 22, 1930, in response to the call of the Most Rev. Damaskinos, to consider the matter of taken measures to organize the Chicago Greek Orthodox Communities, in a manner that will serve to promote their multiple interests, and to avert any threatening dangers to the future existence of a unified Hellenism. After a lengthy and detailed discussion of all views on the matter, it was resolved unanimously that:</p>
   <p>Those present were to submit to their respective church members, for vote, the following resolution: that whereas it is considered difficult for the representative, of the above communities to come to a common decision as regards to the question of the merging of the churches, the power for the regulation of this matter hereby be vested to the Most Rev. Damaskinos, this being the request of all representatives present that His Holiness assume this responsibility and in connection that he should be given the power to adjust the problems confronting the whole school system.
