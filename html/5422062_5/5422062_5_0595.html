   <p>p. 1- The Greek community in Chicago remains in its original position, that is, it holds to the religious organization to which it has adhered from the beginning, regarding the Holy Synod of Greece as its spiritual head. In view of this fact it would be strange if any one of our four churches took under consideration an ousted bishop such as Vasilios Komvopoulos, who recently distributed bills informing us that he would talk at some hall on the South Side. This talk took place on the day before yesterday.</p>
   <p>The result of this speech was merely to lower Vasilios' reputation and public standing, for besides the fact that his listeners were so few that they could be counted on the fingers on one's hands, not one priest chose to attend this meeting which Vasilios held, and only Liakopoulos participated in it, so as to complete the festival.</p>
   <p>After such disdain displayed by the Greek community to the ousted Metropolitan we consider it unnecessary to write anything about the remarks which he made.</p>
