   <p>In order to eliminate the slightest doubt of the veracity and authenticity of our statement regarding the ecclesiastical question, we print below the Encyclical of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, acknowledging and recognizing the Ecumenical Patriarch's appointment of the Most Rev. Alexander as head of the church in North and South America.</p>
   <p>This illuminating document was sent by the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece, through the Greek foreign office, to the Greek Ambassador in Washington, and through the consuls became known to all communities all over the country.</p>
   <p>In very plain language the Encyclical emphasizes the fact that marriages, baptisms, or any other religious service performed by non-canonical priests, are null and void.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek consuls in America are instructed to inform the Greeks of the land that the Greek government, which acknowledged and recognized the Patriarch's mandate in the appointment of Mr. Alexander as head of the church in North and South America, declares that marriages performed by non-canonical priests are illegal.</p>
   <p>It would have been an utter impossibility for the Greek government not to recognize the doings of the Ecumenical throne, the center of Orthodoxy which was revered by all the generations of Greece and continues to be revered as such by all the governments of the Orthodox nations.</p>
   
   <p>The worst part of the irregulars' fiasco is that while they refuse to recognize the regular church authority, they nevertheless recognize a Basil, ex-Metropolitan Haldeas, who is deprived of his office and is excommunicated. (Photographic copy of the official Ecumenical primitive document of the excommunicated Basil we have here in our files).</p>
   <p>If the holy patience and great tolerance of the regular authority was exhausted and the irregulars were degraded, would they be able then to perform sacraments?</p>
   <p>It would be a great service to the Church and to our race if the dispute is ended and all abide by the Patriarch's mandate.</p>
