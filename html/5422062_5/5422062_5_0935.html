   <p>"The program of co-operation and unification suggested by Saloniki is the ideal solution to our problems. As a priest of one of the Greek churches of Chicago, I desire to express my willingness to co-operate to the best of my ability with the editors of this worthy paper. The need for unification is acute, and must be given prompt and serious consideration by all Greeks of Chicago."</p>
   <p>"Sincerely,</p>
   <p>"Reverend Leon Pygeas,</p>
   <p>"Archimandrite of the Holy Trinity Church."</p>
   <p>We present the words of Reverend Pygeas to the Greek community of Chicago with a feeling of great pride, because we have been successful in awakening our clergy to the danger that confronts the Greek communities of America, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago in particular. Reverend Pygeas' dignified but sincere statement has officially launched a campaign which will be carried on by Saloniki. Its goal is to be a unified and harmonious Greek community of Chicago, in which there will be no friction between churches and parishes.</p>
   <p>Saloniki is about to enter a long, strenuous battle with only its news' columns as a weapon. It will strive to accomplish a herculean task, and is ready and willing to make every possible sacrifice in order that this task may be successfully executed. Many obstacles will be found in our path--some unavoidable, others maliciously put there to hinder and dishearten us. But we shall not lose heart, nor shall we be sidetracked!</p>
   <p>We will make no further reference to these obstacles, nor to our past disillusionments or griefs. The future is before us and needs our undivided attention. Saloniki has undertaken this fight because we have the interests of Chicago Greeks at heart, and because we are pledged to do everything to further the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>progress and the assimilation of Greek people.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every newspaper to devote its columns to those matters pertaining to the welfare of the community or group which the paper serves. A newspaper must be the staunch friend of the people, and a real friend is one who makes every effort to help you.</p>
   <p>Saloniki has made the following promises and will work ceaselessly until they are fulfilled:</p>
   <p>First: Unification of the three parishes, which will create an annual surplus of at least $100,000 to be allocated to Greek grammar and high schools.</p>
   <p>Second: Saloniki believes that such unification will enable Greeks of Chicago to acquire their own hospital.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Third: Saloniki promises to establish a National Committee, composed of representatives of all Greek centers. It is planned that these representatives will constitute a Chamber of Commerce which will provide Greek merchants and businessmen with the protection and encouragement they so sorely need. This move will undoubtedly bring the thirty thousand Chicago Greeks together into one large family.</p>
   <p>This must be done; failure to attain this unity will result in the bankruptcy and the undoing of the majority of our businessmen. Just question the first Greek whom you happen to meet regarding his business relationships with his countrymen. His answer will be one of complaint and resentment. If he is in business he will probably reply that one of his countrymen has opened a store next door to his and that the resultant competition will soon force them both to close their doors. Or, perhaps he may be a laborer who has lost his job because of a Greek fellow laborer's insolence to the boss.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>This animosity is so strong that even the Americans have become aware of it. As a result of the friction between the Greeks themselves, the American people have coined the phrase "When Greek meets Greek".</p>
   <p>Saloniki pleads for the eradication of factional enmity. It begs for the cessation of ridiculous feuding. It appeals for brotherly love and understanding.</p>
   <p>The most Reverend Father Pygeas has distinguished himself by being the first of the Greek clergy to feel the need for coalition: he has aligned himself with Saloniki. He will discuss the matter in detail at a future lecture to which all Greeks of Chicago are invited.</p>
   <p>The groundwork will be laid; the details worked out; and in the future the Greeks of Chicago will boast that they are members of the powerful Greek Orthodox Unified Parish.....</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>This is the true opinion of Saloniki--the publication which has been pledged from its very inception to uphold the Greek honor and to serve the community in the best possible manner.</p>
