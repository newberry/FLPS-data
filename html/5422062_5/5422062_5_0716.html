   <p>After a brief discussion, the voting took place under the direction of Mr. Paleologos and Mr. Freeman, after which the votes were counted. Mr. Paleologos announced the results.

   <p>This is the first time in the history of American Hellenism that so important a meeting has taken place. This is proof that the Greeks living in America consider their Church and their religion the highest of all duties and those who are in charge of our communities should undertake a constructive religious movement. Archbishop Alexander is to be congratulated on his modest, progressive and careful ecclesiastical policy.</p>
