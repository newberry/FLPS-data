   <p>According to the report released by the Greek Community of Chicago July 7, 1907, covering the financial condition of the community for the period of May 6, 1907 to July 1, 1907, we observe that the income of the community was $3,786.47, while the expenses were $750.26. Therefore, there is a balance of $3,036.21 in the community treasury.</p>
   <p>By mistake or oversight, perhaps, this balance was reported as $3,026.21 by the secretary, that is, the amount of $10.00 is unaccounted for.</p>
   <p>On the basic of these figures the budget of July 1907 was prepared.</p>
   <p>No mention whatever is made of the sum of $126.00 which is owed by members of the community who purchased tickets for the dance given last March on the occasion of the national Greek independence celebration. This amount was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>included in the budget as an item which was collected as we mentioned in the last issue. The $126.00 should not be entered in the assets of the statement because as yet it has not been collected.</p>
   <p>This is a serious error on the part of the treasurer and secretary of the community.</p>
   <p>One can also see that there are many other irregularities in connection with the church finances. We notice, for example, that the receipts of the church are decreasing while the expenses are increasing. There is especially a large expenditure of money for salaries. To illustrate, expenses for the month of July past were $383.72 while receipts were $340.23. By discounting the amount of $115.00 which was paid for the rent of the ground and building used for church purposes the income is reduced to $225.23. In other words we have a deficit of $158.49 for the month of July.</p>
   <p>So, we see that the total cash assets of the community are $2,983.72, or much <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>less than the assets of June, 1907.</p>
   <p>This indicates that our community financial affairs are not going well. We are going backwards instead of forward. In making these facts known to the public we are taking the opportunity to call attention to the many needs of our church, school, and social organizations. That is why we urge the president and members of the church board to go out and collect membership dues and school fees. In addition, our community leaders must stop paying high salaries to unworthy, lazy, and incompetent officials and community workers, such as, secretaries, collectors, teachers, and priests.</p>
   <p>The church's money is not to be spent for other than good, productive, religious, charitable, and educational purposes.</p>
