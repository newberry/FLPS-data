   <p>p. 2- We should like to bring to the attention of our pious compatriots the fact that on this coming Saturday, April 15, at 7 P.M. grand vespers will be sung in the new and magnificent Church of St. Nicholas, located at the corner of Sixtieth and South Peoria Streets. Vespers will be sung by all the regular Greek priests of Chicago and suburbs; the sacred singers of five churches - Holy Trinity, Annunciation, St. George's, Mortal Sleep of the Virgin Mary, and Holy Trinity of Gary - will sing the admirable chants with poetic solemnity and expressiveness on the eve of Palm Sunday. After the vespers the hymn to the Virgin Mary will be sung.</p>
   <p>On the morning of Palm Sunday the ceremonies will commence at 9:30 A.M., with holy mass at 10:30 A.M. The vigils throughout Holy Week will commence at seven o'clock sharp every evening.</p>
