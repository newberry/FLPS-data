   <p>The three Greek parishes of Chicago had separately arranged for outings on the day of the Assumption of the Virgin, so that the Greeks of Chicago enjoyed a general feast, so to speak, last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The Annunciation Church of the North Side had a big gathering in Desplaines River Park, with a very lively entertainment and dance. The president, Mr. George Karampelas, with Messrs. Chronopoulos and Raklios and Lakidas cordially welcomed all who attended.</p>
   <p>On the West Side the picnic of Holy Trinity Church broke the record for crowds, orderliness, and financial success. Greek and American dances, to the accompaniment of a well organized band continued merrily and incessantly. All the committees worked indefatigably for the success of the affair, and a success it certainly was.</p>

   <p>The South Side parish, St. Constantine's, also spent a day of enjoyment. The parish president, Mr. N. Georgopoulos, the vice-president Dr. K. Theodorou, and the other members of the executive council all worked hard to entertain the guests and to swell the treasury of their church.</p>
   <p>All in all the Greeks of Chicago had a great festival last Sunday.</p>
