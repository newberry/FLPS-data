   <p>Mr. A. B. Pagoulatos, one of the resigned members of the board of the Holy Trinity Church, sent us a protest against what was published in a former issue of the Proodos, concerning the resigned members as was stated by Mr. Karaflos, the president of the board.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karaflos said that those who resigned were meddlers and troublemakers, and for this statement Mr. Pagoulatos protests and states that all those who resigned were above reproach, because all had the interest of the community at heart and that all, except one, were serving the parish for the first time, so there are no precedents about their serving the church, but all were doing their duty, as they saw it, for the public interest.</p>
   <p>P. S. Mr. Pagoulatos is now and has been for the last ten years, the Secretary of Seven Islands Association.</p>
