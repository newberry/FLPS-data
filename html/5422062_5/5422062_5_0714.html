   <p>p. 3.. We hereby notify you that by a communication received today we are recalled by the Holy Synod, and that the Synodical exarchate no longer exists.</p>
   <p>We believe that it is our duty to thank all who have cooperated with us in our heavy task, and we pray that the Lord will protect, support, and reward us for whatever good work we may have done. We remain yours with cordial blessings, Germanos, Metropolite of Monemvasia and Lacedemon.</p>
