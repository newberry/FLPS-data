   <p>On George Washington's birthday, last Thursday, February 22, the school benefit dance of Holy Trinity Church took place. It was held in the Coliseum Annex and was a marked success. The board of directors of the Church, and the Reverend Leon Pygeas made all arrangements for the affair long in advance,so as to avoid a last-minute confusion. The Hall was decorated with flowers and American and Greek flags. Flowers were offered for sale to all who entered, by some of the ladies of the Church.</p>
   <p>A fine orchestra under the baton of the well-known musician, Mr. Spyros Becatoros, played Greek and European music; stirring the hearts and the feet of even the most sedate. The dance itself was in the charge of Mr. G. Becharas, coffee-jobber, who bore his responsibilities with a smile. The grand march began exactly at midnight; but before it began a raffel was held. The prize, a <span class="page-break">\2</span>venetian hand-made cloth donated by Rev. Pygeas, was won by Mr. Skordillis; who presented it to Mrs. J. Agriostathis.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the dance were satisfactorily large; and socially the dance was also a success.</p>
   <p>One point we wish to bring out is that on this same night the North and South Side Churches also held dances. These churches should get together in a friendly spirit and arrange to hold their affairs on separate dates; because this throat-cutting, dog-eat-dog attitude is going to ruin everyone concerned in the welfare of the churches. The Churches should at least practice courtesy and consideration of others if they do not feel brotherly-love for one another.</p>
   <p>Saloniki extends its congratulations to the priests, the Board of Directors, and the guests who attended the dance.</p>
