   <p>p. 1- Having asked the opinion of the Right Rev. Germanos about the very important question of church administration in America, with which we have dealt in a series of articles, we received the following statement without any reservations:</p>
   <p>"We must create a separate archdiocese in America.</p>
   <p>"No matter what my office is here for the execution of my mission, and how ample the powers may be which are vested in me by the Holy Synod of Greece, and what the title is which the Synod has bestowed on me, you must not forget," said he, "that I am the Bishop of Sparta. Whenever my mission is concluded, I shall return to my diocese.</p>
   <p>"Another bishop will probably fill the vacancy after my departure, but he also,whoever he may be, will belong to a certain diocese to which he must return.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"By this I mean to say that it is not possible for the churches of America to be administered by special legates. It is necessary that a permanent bishop be established here.</p>
   <p>"This idea has prevailed in Greece for a long time," said Bishop Germanos, and he elucidated at length the fundamental principles of ecclesiastical authority in America.</p>
   <p>"We not only need to establish a diocese here," said he, "but we must have also a seminary in which properly to train priests for the Greek communities of America, priests who shall have the opportunity to complete their courses in American universities.</p>
   <p>"On such a foundation it would be possible for the Church of America to elevate itself to independence.</p>
   <p>"Now there is not a thing in order and I cannot see," said he, "how, without first going through these preliminaries, an independent authority can be established."</p>
