   <p>p. 2.- The Greek community on the far West Side of the City, not wishing to drag along behind the progress of other Greek communities in Chicago, resolved to have its own church and school. For that reason the South East corner of Harrison and Central was bought and the new church "Koimisis tis Theotokou" was built. On August 15th the church will be sanctified in a holy liturgy officiated by the Greek bishop and assisted by the hierarchy of Chicago.</p>
