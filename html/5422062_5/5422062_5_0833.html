   <p>Monday, August 28, was a day of great festivity and rejoicing among the Greeks of Chicago. Over 1,500 people filled the romantic Gardner's Park on the South Side. Music was played, the wine flowed, and the spirits rose; as the tables were set underneath the trees. Everyone mingled harmoniously with his neighbors on this sacred day. The board of trustees composed of Mr. N. Nomicus, president....worked industriously to help everyone enjoy himself. This picnic was a complete social success, and will not soon be forgotten.</p>
   <p>Holy Trinity and Evangelismos Churches combined forces and gave a wonderful outing at the Electric Park which was attended by the West Side and North Side residents of Chicago. The boards of both churches worked to make the affair a great success. Some of the well-known members are, K. Salopoulos, <span class="page-break">\2</span>N. Lalangou, J. Agriostathis, and B. Douka.</p>
   <p>Knowing that the picnics were given to aid the Greek churches, the people spent their money freely.</p>
   <p>We doubt if one Greek family failed to attend one of these picnics given on a day which is most sacred to all Greeks. The people heard the music of their fatherland and watched the spirited native dances, and felt that they were again in their beloved and beautiful Greece.</p>
