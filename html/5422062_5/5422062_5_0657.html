   <p>p. 1-Because of the daily increasing discord in the Greek communities of America over ecclesiastical questions the Patriarchate has decided to send here as its exarch the Metropolitan of Verroea, Archbishop Chrysanthos, a wise and energetic churchman, to study local conditions.</p>
   <p>The ecumenical Patriarchate, which observes with painful emotion the condition of our colony in its desire to form an unbiased opinion on existing problems and to find ways and means to restore to Greek communities their former order and concord, is dispatching its exarch to work with prudence, impartiality, and absolute justice and so effect the return of the peace and the tranquillity which have been lacking in Greek communities since the untimely decree was issued degrading the Metropolitan of Haldea, Bishop Vasilios.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The astonishing result of that decree has been that the former Metropolitan of Haldea, instead of being shunned by the faithful, has been made a hero and the leader of a well-organized opposition, which is taking a strong hold on our communities.</p>
   <p>This is what the Right Reverend Archbishop Chrysanthos has to smooth out.</p>
