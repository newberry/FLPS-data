   <p>In order that injustice may not be done to anyone of those who have enlisted for army service in regard to enlistments in different classes, or because of any complaint, the American Government has appointed an agent in each district. It is the agent's duty to receive complaints on the part of anyone who thinks that he has been treated unfairly, to determine whether they are justified, and to submit a report to a higher military council.</p>
   <p>We are herewith giving a list of the names and addresses of these agents. Any Greek having a complaint must appeal to his district agent, who is duly authorized, and submit any complaints.</p>
   <p>Recommendations for government appeal agents are under the jurisdiction of District Board No. 1.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: There follows a lengthy list of names and addresses of government appeal agents.]</p>
