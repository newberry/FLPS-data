   <p>p. 1.- The activities of our community proceed apace without much ado, but at the same time without organization and cooperation. Our community alone, abandoned by every religious and political authority, accomplishes such achievements they prove that Hellenism in America is full of life. But how much more could it have accomplished had it been under some government care and attention, and under suitable Ecclesiastical authority.</p>
   <p>These thoughts have been reflected in our mind by the simultaneous execution of four big works in the community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>(1) The construction of the combined church and school in the community of Pullman, the cornerstone of which was laid last Sunday.</p>
   <p>(2) The completion of the church and school of St. Constantine community of the South side, the inauguration of which is to take place next Sunday.</p>
   <p>(3) The erection of the magnificent school, and church on the North side Greek community of the Annunciation, the inauguration of which will take place on Oct. 26th. The new church will be called the St. James.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>(4) The building up of a new church owned by the community on the North Side. This church's name will be given by the highest bidder, among the Godfathers, during the inauguration next Sunday.</p>
   <p>The value of these four edifices of our communities according to most conservative figures is about $500,000. and adding the value of the newly acquired property to that already existing brings the amount to around $600,000.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, these new communal accomplishments appear all of a sudden, without being even noticed by the many, without any special aid, in the midst of religious indifference and disastrous Ecclesiastical division. The two camps have been kept apart from one another, with no affiliation whatever, and hostile to one another.</p>
   <p>What is most surprising is that both camps are being fought by representatives of the Greek government, and the so-called diocese of Chicago, Archdiocese of all America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>When, then, under such circumstances such communal progress is attained, how much more could be accomplished, if there were harmony and cooperation, Ecclesiastical unity and governmental care for the standardization and more perfect organization of them.</p>
