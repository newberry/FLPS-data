   <p>The negotiations between the Holy Synod of Greece and the Patriarchate of Constantinople, regarding the dependence of the orthodox churches in America still goes on.</p>
   <p>The Holy Synod of Greece having made the mistake of resigning from the administration of the churches of America, is now seeking to attain from the Patriarchate restoration of the former regime. The latter claims that it has declared the church in America independent and is, therefore, unable to grant the request.</p>
   <p>We think that the Patriarchate is right, because it substantially has nothing to do with the so-called independent church here, which is using the Patriarchate's name just for the sake of imposing itself upon the communities dependent on it and of converting others not belonging to it, under the pretext that it serves the interests of the Patriarchate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The only valid argument that the supporters of the independent church ever advanced was that the churches of America must be dependent on the Patriarchate of Constantinople for the sake of the Patriarchate's support. This, their strongest argument, proves to be a bluff; since we have the statement of the Patriarchate that the Church of America is independent, and that the former has no jurisdiction over it whatsoever. The case resolves itself, in other words, to a dog which has lost its master.</p>
   <p>The answer of the Patriarchate, however, clears up the situation completely and gives perfect freedom of action to the Holy Synod of Greece:</p>
   <p>(a) Because it never officially resigned its rights over the churches of America;</p>
   <p>(b) Because Hellenism in America never ceased to recognize it as its highest ecclesiastical authority;</p>
   <p>(c) Because the communities that recognized the so-called Church of America, recognized the Ecumenical Patriarchate and not the independent church. Consequently, they were deceived in regard to their dependence, for they still continue to believe that they are dependent on the Ecumenical Patriarchate;</p>
   <p>(d) Because the Church of Greece did not resign her rights in order that the Patriarchate should transfer them to other churches separate from her; and finally.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>(e) Because the Church of America has no moral authority whatever over the Greek churches of America which do not want to recognize it, nor any control over those priests who do not wish to submit to its supervision.</p>
   <p>Therefore, inasmuch as the Church of America "was conceived in sin and was brought forth in iniquity by her Mother", to quote the Scriptures, it is imperative for the Holy Synod of Greece to assume its rights without any consideration for the so-called Church of America. It is an imperative duty, because the peace and harmony of Greeks in America demand it.</p>
   <p>Nobody doubts that when the Holy Synod of Greece sends its Ecclesiastical Legate, he will be recognized by all, and the Saint of America will be left out in the cold holding the title of the resplendent holiest diocese of North and South America of former times.</p>
