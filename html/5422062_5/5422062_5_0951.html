   <p>p. 2- In the last few years the Greek churches in Chicago have collected and spent over $300,000. What for? Oh, just to parade the Sepulcher of the Savior around the streets, to quarrel among ourselves as to the best method of parading, and to intone the name of God that he may help us perpetuate our stupidity and hypocrisy....Just for that!</p>
   <p>After so much singing and parading, using the name of God in vain, nothing has happened to us. We are not better Christians than we were before we spent the $300,000. Doing what we do is simple foolishness, a waste of money, time, and energy, and above all, we are making ourselves a nuisance to others who have the misfortune to reside near a Greek church. If God had time to inquire why we enact this clownish procession, he would lose patience and turn us into bricks so that we might at least be useful for something.</p>

   <p>We are ignorant and stupid people, and we deserve to be censured for permitting ourselves to follow certain traditions which might have been convenient in days gone by but are not becoming to-day, and especially not here. We must not abuse the tolerance of our neighbors.</p>
   <p>How should we like it if we Greeks lived near or within an Indian reservation, and while we were asleep, the Indians performed one of their many queer dances accompanied by Indian singing, as we Greeks do? A Greco-Indian war would break out immediately. Most assuredly. A long war, too.</p>
   <p>What ignorant, stubborn, selfish people we are! Indians who leave their reservations and live elsewhere have brains enough to discontinue their tom-tom dances. Oh, of course we Greeks are a privileged race, and we may do as we please. That is right....It is about time to stop this foolishness if we do not want to arouse racial antagonism against us. It is about time for our clergy and their coadjutors, the presidents of churches and others, to find a different way to justify the expenditure of $300,000. Processions and chanting Kyrie Eleison are things of the past. If they wish to live on the earnings of others, they must invent something new.</p>

   <p>Indeed, I beg your pardon. I do not mean that all our clergy and their assistants are frauds; of course not!</p>
   <p>The Greek Church in America will serve its interests and the interests of the people if as a Christian institution it eliminates much of its antiquated methods and stops imitating the Pope of Rome in commercializing religion. And for the sake of self-preservation the Church must advocate education. Blind devotion is dangerous. Understanding and enlightenment will promote the cause of Christianity.</p>
   <p>Be wise! Do not spend money in trying to make a hole in the water. Bear in mind what the ancient Greeks used to say: "Be strong in mind and in body," and not only the gods but the demons themselves will help you.</p>
   <p>And since everything needs renovation from time to time, to clear away the cobwebs, so must our church be purified of its mercenary clergy and their followers.</p>
   <p>In the meantime let us all sing a requiem for the $300,000. Amen!</p>
