   <p>P. 2. -To the devoted clergymen, the honorable church committees, and all pious Christians who are members of the Greek Orthodox colonies of North and South America, greetings!</p>
   <p>In last August, 1922, the second general convention of our Archdiocese, after meeting in New York, adopted a new constitution, which it sent to the Ecumenical Patriarchate for ratification. This constitution was accepted and confirmed without the least change. After this the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Holy Synod notified us in telegrams and in letters that for very serious reasons we must fulfill without delay the requirements of articles 4, 16, and 17, which provide for the election of at least two bishops, one for the Diocese of Chicago and the other for the Diocese of Boston.</p>
   <p>Complying with this advice of the Holy Synod and convinced that the reasons which dictated it were serious and imperative, we proceeded to convoke the local assemblies of the Dioceses of Chicago and Boston, inviting in accordance with article 12 of our constitution all the canonical clergymen of both these Dioceses, their church committees, and also lay representatives elected by the churches, one from each church.</p>
   <p>The local ecclesiastical assembly of the Diocese of Chicago convened according to article 16 of their constitution in the Church of St. Constantine, April 18, 1923.</p>
   <p>This meeting was attended by thirty-one canonical clergymen and twenty-one lay representatives. After the preliminaries requisite for the nomination of episcopal candidates the convention, in accordance with the constitution, was directed to nominate candidates from the catalog of the qualified clergymen of the Archdiocese, whose names had been published in a circular.</p>
   <p>The result of the secret ballot was as follows. Archimandrite Alexopoulos Ioakim received thirty-one votes; Archimandrite Ioannides Philaretos also received thirty-one votes; and Archimandrite Mitatakis Simeon received twenty-two votes. These names, in accordance with article 16 of our constitution, we forwarded to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, that the Patriarchate might select one candidate to be Bishop of the Diocese of Chicago. We wish to remind those who are interested that when our Archdiocese here acquires its own Synod, the privilege of electing these bishops will belong to it, since article 17 of the constitution so provides.</p>
   <p>Following the same procedure, the local ecclesiastical assembly of the Diocese of Boston convened on April 25, 1923, in the Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. This assembly was attended by eighteen canonical clergymen and by twelve lay representatives, a total of thirty. The result of their secret ballot was that Archimandrite Alexopoulos Ioakim received thirty votes, Ioannides Philaretos received twenty-nine votes, and Argyrides Christophoros received twenty-nine votes, and Argyrides Christophoros received fourteen votes. The report of this election also was sent to the Ecumenical Patriarchate.</p>
   <p>The Ecumenical Patriarch was pleased to notify us in an official telegram that the Holy Synod of Constantinople by a canonical ballot had elected as Bishop of Chicago Archimandrite Ioannides Philaretos and as Bishop of Boston Archimandrite Alexopoulos Ioakim. They will be consecrated bishops within a short time.</p>
   
   <p>In making this report to all canonical clergymen, to the canonical church committees, and to all pious Christians who are under the jurisdiction of the Greek Archdiocese of North and South America we hope that the election of bishops and the coming establishment of our own Holy Synod will be hailed as the beginning of a new and favorable period for our ecclesiastical tasks.</p>
   <p>The truth is that some opposition has been expressed to these plans. We have not inquired into the source of these contrary opinions, but we consider them unfortunate and in error. In convoking the local assembly for the nomination of candidates for the office of bishop we did not proceed on our own initiative but in compliance with repeated suggestions made by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has serious reasons for requiring this action, among them its wish to insure the independence of the Greek Church in America and to set it beyond the intervention or the claims of any outside center of authority. We derive no personal benefit in hastening the election of bishops. Heretofore we have governed the whole Archdiocese. By the installation of bishops the extent of our jurisdiction is decreased, but we have taken into consideration the common interest.</p>
   
   <p>It has been said that the installation of bishops by us is a gesture of magnificence. This conception of our procedure is not in accord with the facts. The proper government of the Church on a large scale is impossible without the assistance of more bishops. The ancient Church had bishops in every important city. In Greece before the Balkan Wars, although the population was only five times as large as the present Greek population of America, there were thirty-two bishops. In the United States the Episcopalians have 123 bishops, not for magnificence but for the better government of their Church. The bishop who works within a limited district watches his flock more closely and imposes better ecclesistical discipline, since he has closer contact with the Christians under his jurisdiction. The Church is the most potent peace-making force when the bishops attend to their duties. We can assure everybody that we as well as the new bishops will try our best to make peace among the members of the Greek colonies of America so that they may unite as Orthodox Christians and lay aside their political animosities.</p>
   <p>We must add that by failing to elect bishops for our Greek Church in America we should render its new constitution of none effect, and it is this constitution which has made our Church here independent and self-governing. Without the constitution it would have been much easier for outsiders to intrude in the settlement of our ecclesiastical problems, and schisms and controversies would still be nourished. But by the election of bishops and the establishment of an independent Holy Synod our ecclesiastical self-sufficiency is insured, and all outside interference and the excitation of discord are ended; our Archdiocese by its imposing status as a Synod acquires more authority and will be able to impress the public consciousness and to effect lasting unity among our compatriots. To-day the jurisdiction of our Archdiocese is recognized by 130 communities, and there is no doubt that with the co-operation of the bishops the remaining communities will become attached to it. There is also no doubt that through this co-operation and the ethical influence of the Holy Synod the Christians of our Archdiocese will be properly educated to show themselves prompter in the initiation of various philanthropic enterprises and more faithful in the perpetuation thereof, enterprises which are necessary to maintain living piety and to provide national and mutual benefits for the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to inform you of these matters, and we request that you will pray to God for our successful accomplishment of this mission, the greatest which our position as head of the Archdiocese has offered to us in the religious and social fields.</p>
   <p>May the grace of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ bring peace to us all.</p>
   <p>May 8, 1923. New York, New York.</p>
   <p>Alexander, by the mercy of Christ, Archbishop of North and South America.</p>
