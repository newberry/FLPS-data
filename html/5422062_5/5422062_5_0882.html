   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are applauding and praising with heartfelt sincerity, the patriotic step taken by the Consul General Mr. N. Salopoulos, by the presidents of the three Greek churches, and the priests of those churches. These gentlemen have laid the foundation for a unification of the Greek community of Chicago. The three church parishes are going to co-operate under the direction of a central committee.</p>
   <p>For the first time, picnics of the three Greek churches will be given on separate days, in order that all who desire to attend all three outings may have the opportunity of doing so. Usually the churches indulged in cut-throat competition and purposely chose the same date on which to hold their picnics, in order that they might prevent any one church affair from being a greater success than their own. They overlooked the fact that they <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were cutting off their nose to spite their face; because the methods used not only ruined the other affairs, but also ruined their own.</p>
   <p>It is a relief to know that these conditions at last are being rectified. This co-operative spirit will be applied to all public and social functions.</p>
   <p>By mutual agreement, the three church boards sent representatives to a meeting held at the Evangelismos Church. There they decided to unite their efforts for the common good, and to take drastic measures against the propagandists who have fallen like hungry wolves on the Chicago Greeks. A central committee was chosen consisting of the three church presidents, and the three priests. This committee is to be assisted by another committee of four members. Both of these will be under the direction of Mr. Salopoulos. The following decisions were reached:</p>
   <p>First: To define the parish boundaries of each church more clearly, in order that the confusion arising at deaths and weddings could be eliminated.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Second: to cleanse the Orthodox Church of the propagandists, and to protect the religious teachings of the Churches.</p>
   <p>Third: all three Churches must hold their social functions on separate days; and all must help toward the success of these functions, regardless of which one will benefit financially.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, Holy Trinity Church was represented by Mr. B. Georgakopoulos, J. Agriostathis, Reverend Leon Pygeas and George Kokkinis; Mr. Mazarakis, C. Loumos, and Reverend Hadzidimitriou represented Evangelismos; St. Constantine was represented by Reverend Prousianon and I. Pappas.</p>
   <p>It is our patriotic duty to congratulate these men who are striving to make a long dreamed of, but little hoped for, ambition a reality.</p>
