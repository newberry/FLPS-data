   <p>To a Greek, the word patriotism does not mean the love of his fatherland only. In his mind the word is so closely allied to Christianity that the Greeks may be said to be as much attached to their faith from a national stand-point as from a religious one.</p>
   <p>In their eyes, to alter one particle in the ceremonial, and still more in the creed of the Eastern Orthodox Church as established by the Byzantine Fathers of the Church, would be a sin. They are proud to think that whereas other religions change and become divided, their religion alone has subsisted unaltered for ages. Orthodoxy is the same in every part of Greece and in every country.</p>
   <p>A Greek looks upon his Church with an affection easy to understand; and no <span class="page-break">\2</span>matter how far he goes from his country it is to the Church in which he was baptized that he always turns for guidance and consolation.</p>
   <p>The Greek Church holds a unique position among churches. It alone possesses the power of tying and untying the marriage knot; for the legality of a marriage does not depend upon the civil portion of it (which is a modern introduction), but upon the sanction of the patriarch or bishop. In a marriage between a member of the Orthodox Church and one who belongs to another religion, permission is only granted by the Greek Church on the understanding that the children arising from such a marriage shall be baptized and reared in the religion of the Orthodox Church.</p>
   <p>Every Greek hopes that when he breathes his last, that he will receive the holy sacrament from his priest with the same rites that have remained unchanged for centuries. This may be why religion seems to have such an active part in a man's life in Greece; it may also explain why there are practically no atheists in Greece.</p>

   <p>Although Greeks are perfectly tolerant in their attitude towards other religions they cling jealously to their own church, and both Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries have had little success in Greece. Although convinced of the pre-eminence of their own religion, Greeks have not the slightest desire to proselytise, and, indeed, raise difficulties when a convert seeks to join their ranks; for they hold it to be every man's duty to live in the faith in which he was born.</p>
   <p>This of course applies to Christians. Mohammedanism they hardly look upon as a religion; but rather as a racial fanaticism and a pretext for brutal outrage in times of war, and contemptible voluptuousness in times of peace. This is hardly to be wondered at, since the Greek religion inculcates gentleness; and their experience teaches them that the Mussulmans are cruel and ever ready to break out into massacres and violence of every kind.</p>
   <p>The Greek Church is not seeking to convert other people to its teachings, but the Church demands that its teachings be respected by this group of <span class="page-break">\4</span>evangelistic propagandists who are seeking to convert its members to a form of religion on the order of a cult.</p>
   <p>This is a warning to those who seek to demoralize the Orthodox Church here in America (especially Chicago). The Greek Church has survived many dangers far worse than the one that has presented itself. It does not fear for its existence; it only desires to protect certain weak individuals who are easily swayed by glib talk and dramatic tracts.</p>
   <p>Propagandists, take heed!</p>
