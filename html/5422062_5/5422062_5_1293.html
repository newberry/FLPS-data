   <p>The Greek government has issued a proclamation authorizing Greek subjects residing in the United States to enlist at once in the American Army.</p>
   <p>What a paradox! How anomalous it appears. A foreign government calling its subject to arms to serve under the flag of the United States. Is it a surrender of its sovereignty? No. It is an acknowledgment of greatness and glory of the United States, which entered the war not for its own gain or aggrandizement, but for the benefit of other nations. The American victory is a victory for all the civilized world, and those who fight under the Stars and Stripes are honored and esteemed above all the rest. They are fighting the battles of other peoples.</p>
   <p>The Greek people and its government considered it an obligation and an honor to have the Greeks of America enlist in the United States Army.</p>

   <p>America is making unusual sacrifices in this war, and nations the world over must acknowledge and appreciate this fact. America's forefathers struggled for human liberty and for representative government which we of today enjoy, and America's present generation makes untold sacrifices that coming generations of the world may enjoy those things for which men have struggled and suffered and sacrificed throughout civilization; and no people have appreciated them more than the people of Greece, whose ideals and principles have gone beyond the narrow confines of their country and have effected civilization wherever men have loved liberty.</p>
   <p>Greece, above all other nations, never has forgotten and never will forget the unselfish and humanitarian attitude of the United States towards the Greek people when they struggled for liberty, and it is now an obligation of the Greeks of America to enlist in the United States Army which is going beyond the domain of the country to make the world safe.</p>
   <p>That is the reason for the Greek government's proclamation.</p>
