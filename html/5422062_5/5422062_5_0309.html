   <p>The feast of St. Demetrios which took place last Sunday in the church of that name was a great success. The congregation numbered about two thousand and filled the church to its capacity. The amount taken in by the sale of candles and from contributions was $748.</p>
   <p>The success of this celebration was an agreeable surprise attributable partly to the arrival in America of the delegate whose personality has achieved ecclesiastical unity for us and partly to the large increase in the number of Greek families in the vicinity of St. Demetrios Church.</p>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of the Legate, to whose judgment it has been left to fix the number of our Greek Orthodox churches, to this large attendance at the services in St. Demetrios.</p>
