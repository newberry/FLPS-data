   <p>Twenty-two Greek boys have formed a new Greek troop, under the able leadership of Mayor J. Kallas. All of the boys are from the North Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the boys who work in shoe-shine establishments will be given one evening a week off, in order that they may attend meetings. They will receive many benefits, both mental and physical.</p>
   <p>Although we believe that this organization is a fine one, it is unnecessary for us to recommend the Boy Scouts. It is necessary, however, that we urge all the Greek boys to join this worth-while organization. The boys of the West Side must also form a troop. The present membership of twenty-two must be multiplied many times, and extended throughout the entire city.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday at 3 P. M. the boys will parade down Halsted Street to Blue Island Avenue. They will meet in the Athenian Hall. The public is invited to attend.</p>
