   <p>When the representatives of the Greek community of Chicago appeared in person to appeal to the Mother Church in Athens to modify her ultimatum recalling the priest of our community, the Metropolitan of Athens, who is president of the Holy Synod of Greece, laconically replied,</p>
   <p>"We have the right to recall your priest, and the Reverend Father Georgeadis is recalled."</p>
   <p>What an utterance from the mouth of the head of the Church!</p>
   <p>The Metropolitan-President of the Holy Synod answered correctly as a true scion of ancient Greece, but his answer and his attitude are not worthy of the high office which he holds as prelate and shepherd of the Greek Church.</p>
   
   <p>As an individual and as a Greek, a Greek who is not accustomed to surrender power without a fight, the president of the Synod had every right to pronounce his autocratic and laconic sentence,</p>
   <p>"Your priest is recalled because we recall him."</p>
   <p>In other words,</p>
   <p>"We, the Synod, as ecclesiastical governors have the power to do whatever it pleases us to do with our subjects. Whether our decision is detrimental and injurious to your community is not a matter to be discussed. We are the rulers, and we govern this state, which is called the Church, and the subjects, thereof. The subjects cannot question our authority and our acts. And if you Greeks of Chicago do not like it, do as Greeks do: fight for your rights! And we will show you that our swords are sharper than yours!"</p>
   
   <p>This is a wonderful exhibition of Greek spirit, and it is nothing new. That spirit started the Peloponnesian War, which lasted thirty years, and the result of which was that the control of Greece was transferred from Athens to Sparta. The Greek community of Chicago, being a chip of the old block and true to Greek traditions, might declare war against the autocratic and unjust action of the Mother Church. And it might happen, since history repeats itself, that the ecclesiastical power of Athens would be transferred elsewhere.</p>
   <p>But as a highly respected man of the cloth and a true Christian pastor, the president of the Synod has erred not only in his judgment but likewise in his manner of expressing it. As a man of ecclesiastical culture, tolerance, and justice he had no right to utter so arrogant a sentence as</p>
   <p>"We have the right to recall your priest, and the Reverend Father Georgeadis is recalled."</p>
   <p>By the use of the word"right" and by the manner in which he uses it he implies that justice was not involved either in the decision of those members of the Synod who signed the order of recall or in the expression and the attitude of the head of the Church.</p>
   <p>All the Metropolitan's theological and social culture must have been outweighed by his inherent spirit of Greek pride when these rude Greek-Americans ventured to question his authority by their appeal for justice!</p>
   <p>The Metropolitan's words and his attitude demonstrate very clearly that the head of the Church is nevertheless a human being and a real scion of the proud race which has made the people of the world take notice of it and pay tribute to it. If this is true, then our ecclesiastical titles and degrees of merit such as "Holy Father," "Your Holiness," and so forth are not properly applied and bestowed.</p>
   <p>As human beings and as Greeks we admire him as the people of the world admired his ancestors and ours who, when the Great King with his millions of Persians asked them to surrender their arms, proudly and laconically replied,</p>
   <p>"Come and get them."</p>
   <p>But as a tried prelate and a pastor of that noble, just, and really Christian institution, the Holy Church of Greece, he is supposed to be above ordinary humanity, and his inherent Greek fighting tendencies must be subdued by love, tolerance, justice, and wisdom. These virtues are not easy to find among us ordinary mortals, but they are supposed to exist in real philosophers, if any such survive, and among the genuine ministers of our various faiths.</p>
   <p>The Greek community of Chicago, through its duly authorized committee, has appealed to its Mother Church to reconsider her unjust decision and to permit their beloved priest to remain their pastor. This Greek priest of Chicago, the Reverend C. Georgeadis, has a splendid record of thirty-five years as a minister of the Greek Orthodox faith and was appointed by the Holy Synod to serve the ecclesiastical needs of this community. By his service here he has gained the love and the reverence of the people, but he has positively refused to be reconciled to the demagogic policies of the president of the community, Dr. Gregory Papelion, a minion of the Metropolitan of Athens.</p>
   <p>Without due process of ecclesiastical law the Reverend Father Georgeadis was ordered by five members of the Synod, through a Synodical document surreptitiously prepared, immediately to cease to function as a priest and to report to Athens within forty days to stand trial on charges preferred by the president of the community, thus leaving his parish without a minister of the Church.</p>
   <p>The well-trained and pious Greek priest upon receipt of the aforesaid document complied with the Synod's mandate and ceased to exercise his religious functions. He likewise reported to his superiors that he was unable to reach Greece within forty days on account of illness.</p>
   <p>In the interim the situation was complicated by the death of two persons and the immediate necessity of baptizing certain infants who were ill. The sovereign power of Greece, through its representative in Chicago, the consul general, stepped in and ordered the suspended priest to perform these religious functions, regardless of the commands of any superiors whatsoever.</p>
   <p>At the command of the Nation's representative the victim of circumstances abandoned his ecclesiastical inactivity and chanted the Kyrie Eleison at two funerals and at two or three Christenings.</p>
   <p>For obeying the consul general's command to perform religious rites over the dead and dying subjects of the Church the Synod, in order to justify its previous iniquity in recalling the priest without due process of law, grasped the opportunity to file additional charges against the Chicago Greek priest for his disobedience to the supreme power of the Church,--serious charges indeed!</p>
   
   <p>This action of the Synod has thrown the Chicago Greek community into disastrous confusion, discord, and unrest.</p>
   <p>Just and wise rulers who wish to perpetuate their rule over their subjects never create such conditions.</p>
   <p>That venerable body, the Synod, has deemed it profitable and advisable to maintain absolute silence in the face of a multitude of petitions sent by individuals and by the general assembly of the community, which was presided over by its lawful vice-president and attended by the entire council of the community and by a large number of bonafide members.</p>
   <p>Absolute silence likewise was the answer to the consul general's report of the uproar and chaos in the community and to his recommendations and petitions. The failure of the Synod to respond to the community or to the consul general was the cause of the committee's appeal to the president of the Synod, and this article is a reply to the Synod's pronouncement to the committee.</p>
   <p>Ecclesiastical or civil states can never ascend to their destined heights unless love, tolerance, justice, and wisdom pervade them. And since the Church is or is supposed to be an ideal state more perfect than the civil state, we may as well consult the divine and immortal conceptions of Greek philosophy relating to the ideal state.</p>
   <p>Plato's "Republic" is our guide in this matter, and we find in the "Republic" that Socrates explains what justice is, and by what means the ideal state will lead its citizens toward absolute knowledge, that is, the condition of virtue.</p>
   <p>The indignation of the people of Greece toward their rulers induced Plato to compose the Republic and publish the lofty ideas of his master Socrates. The indignation of the Greeks of Chicago had its origin in abuse of power and violation of justice by that oligarchical governing body, the Holy Synod of Greece.</p>
   
   <p>The Greeks of Plato's time had attained so high a stage of development that they were no longer contented to accept without question the conventional laws of morality or the obligations of political life but had begun to ask the why and the wherefore of these things.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, being true scions of ancient Greece and moreover thoroughly imbued with the American ideal of justice, are no longer content to accept blindly the mandates of the ecclesiastical state when their intelligence informs them that their Synod's decision to recall their pastor and the Synod's subsequent acts are devoid of justice. And this indignation of the Chicago Greeks may create the supposedly ideal state of the Church here and compel the proud city of Athens to relinquish its Synodical rule.</p>
   <p>Let us see whether the Holy Synod of Greece advocates and upholds the ideas of Thrasymachus and his group or the ideas of Socrates and Plato.</p>
   
   <p>Thrasymachus maintained that justice or righteousness in reality is this: that a man should take what he can get, that the strong man should take more than the weak, that the state and its laws may be regarded at best as a partnership of individuals, that the proper condition of this partnership is the domination of it by the strongest individual for his own interests, and finally that the laws of the state are enacted not for the benefit of its subjects but for the benefit of the governing body.</p>
   <p>Thrasymachus's idea of the state unfortunately has come down to the present day, and this is the sort of rule prevalent among governing bodies in practically the whole world with the exception of the United States, which has a form of government unique in history. The American government is the best in the world and the nearest to perfection; it is rapidly approaching the ideal state of Plato.</p>
   <p>Plato realized that Thrasymachian thought is the gospel of individualism and sought to refute it; hence the creation of the "Republic."</p>
   
   <p>Socrates, after hearing Thrasymachus, since he was aware of the prevalent corruption of the state, maintained that the state is not supposed to be a partnership of individuals seeking personal advantage, but that it is supposed to be and ought to be a moral communion of souls united to maintain the principles of wisdom and justice.</p>
   <p>But the actual states of Greece seemed to Plato to have lost their true character and to have forgotten their true aim. Thinking principally of the Athenian democracy in which he lived, he found that its rulers in their administration of the affairs of state were directed by selfishness. Instead of conceiving their mission to be the security and the welfare of the whole state, these governors aimed at securing their own advantage.</p>
   <p>The Holy Synod of Greece has misconstrued its divine mission as an ideal religious state of wisdom and justice and has permitted itself to be swayed by the corrupting influence of politics in the matter of the recall of the priest of the Greek community of Chicago without due process of law.</p>
   <p>With political or ecclesiastical leaders who are selfish and devoid of wisdom and justice, how shall men attain salvation? How can the Greek community of Chicago be devoted to the Mother Church while injustice is practiced upon them? How can the Church maintain its rule over its subjects while the foundations of justice are rocked by unwise and unjust leaders of the Church?</p>
   <p>Disregarding the Thrasymachian theory and accepting the Socratic idea, the Chicago Greek community reverently appeals to the Holy Synod wisely and justly to correct this ecclesiastical scandal.</p>
   <p>As chips off the old block unbued with the great American ideals of wisdom and justice, we shall not declare a Peloponnesian or a Panhellenic War, but we respectfully and modestly request the venerable Synod to bear in mind that sooner or later justice will triumph, and that it is to the spiritual advantage of the rulers of the Church that they shall sober themselves from their political intoxication and render to Caesar that which is Caesar's.</p>
   <p>The Greek community in Chicago respectfully reminds the Synod of the episode of Philip of Macedonia and the peasant woman who appealed to him on behalf of her husband. The dissolute monarch against whom Demosthenes directed his Philippicos replied,</p>
   <p>"I am the king, and my decision stands unaltered."</p>
   <p>The humble subject retorted,</p>
   <p>"In the name of justice I appeal my case from Philip drunken to Philip sober!"</p>
   <p>And we the Greeks of Chicago, after hearing the Metropolitan's words, "We have the right to recall your priest, and the Reverend Father Georgeadis is recalled," appeal our case to the sober sense of that august body, hoping that wisdom and justice will prevail in their deliberations and move them to correct this scandal, so perpetuating their ecclesiastical rule over the people.</p>
