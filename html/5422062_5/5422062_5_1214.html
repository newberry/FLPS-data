   <p>p. 5.- John A. Athanasopoulos, who died at Hines Hospital from poison gas, was buried with military honors by the Hellenic Post of the American Legion.</p>
   <p>The poor immigrant, who came here to make a living, at the outbreak of the war with America, was among the first to be sent to the battlefields of France with the American expedition. He took part in many battles, distinguished himself for his bravery, and was destined to die, by poison gas, for his adopted country.</p>
   <p>The flag for which he fought decorated his bier, and military honors concluded his life.</p>
