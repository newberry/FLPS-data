   <p>p. 7. Taking as a model the Young Men's Christian Association of America, which functions successfully, not only in the United States, but all over the world, a similar organization was formed here in Chicago through the initiative of Deacon M. Mazokopakis. The name given to the Chicago organization is National Joy. The aims of the organization are revealed by Mr. Mazokopakis, and Mr. S. Katsantonis, the president of the Association in their addresses which we will quote a little further on.</p>
   <p>Officers of the organization that were recently elected are: S. Katsantonis, president; Van Nomikos, vice president; J. Semidalas, treasurer; A. Garoufales, secretary; Geo. Katsinis, ass't secretary; Nick Poulos, ass't secretary; Wm. Kartzas, Mark Mamalakis, and Peter Eliopoulos, directors; M. Mazokopakis, honorary president.</p>
   <p>The Deacon in addressing the youth, said, "Human beings have always built their hopes upon an upright thinking youth. For that reason, every nation and particularly Greece, from the ancient epoch, endeavored with devotion and love to create, cultivate, and develop, healthy minds and hearts amongst the youth.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>By doing that Greece was always rewarded with the abundant production of virtuous and upright thinking citizens.</p>
   <p>Many virtues bejeweled the Greeks, but outstanding of these were devotion to God and undisputed love of country. Our predecessors, who came from Greece, were always devoted to their divine duty. They always carried with them the Vestal fire and kept it inextinguishable, as a symbol of their loyalty. Even though they were far away from their Mother country, they did not cease to cultivate the ideals of their race.</p>
   <p>Our race is not becoming old and ready to die. The sentiments, feelings, and thoughts of our ancestors are manifested today.</p>
   <p>You are, the verification of this. You! the founders of the Greek Young Men's Christian Association, the National Joy. You! the blooming flower of your noble ancestral tree. In you, and in your heart, the inextinguishable Holy-Fire, gives and will give light to the coming generation.</p>
   <p>Your noble endeavors, and your devotion to the National Joy, are followed with our sympathies, respect, and pride.</p>

   <p>Mr. Katsantonis, in a brief and concise speech said, "It is not quite a year, since seven or eight members decided to form the National Joy. Today the membership is over two hundred.</p>
   <p>With religion as a basis and Morality as its aim, the National Joy cannot do otherwise than succeed. There is not a single Greek, who did not, and does not, praise and assist this Association.</p>
   <p>This Brotherhood, on the 10th of June, gave a dance at the Sherman Hotel, for the purpose of raising funds to rebuild St. Constantine's church. The result was crowned with great and unexpected success. Associations of this kind, that tend to mold the youth, to follow the right road, are always assisted and supported by all.</p>
