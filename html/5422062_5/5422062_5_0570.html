   <p>The undersigned presidents of Greek communities of the Greek colony in Chicago announce, in a most emphatic manner, that statements made by Mr. Philaretos in the private church of St. Basil to the effect that he is being recognized by the communities of Chicago are false, and that no such understanding ever was had with him.</p>
   <p>The communities, which we have the honor to represent, continue to adhere to their decision recognizing as their higher Ecclesiastical authority the holy Synod of Greece, and they shall continue to do so because that is the desire of the Greek people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>N. Kokkinis, president of Holy Trinity Church.</p>
   <p>G. Karampelas, president of Church of the Annunciation.</p>
   <p>A. Phlampouras, president of St. George.</p>
   <p>Z. Koliopoulos, President of Church of the Assumption</p>
   <p>N. Kokkinis, president of St. Nickolas Church.</p>
