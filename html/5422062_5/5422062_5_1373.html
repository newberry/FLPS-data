   <p>The Greek Students Club, Plato, gave its annual dinner in honor of the members who graduated this year on June 18.</p>
   <p>Many notables of the community from the professional and business fields were present. During the dinner, the president of the Society, Mr. Nicholas D. Cheronis, well-known chemist of our city, spoke about the multitudinous barriers that a foreign student must hurdle in order to succeed. He recommended that financial assistance be given to all struggling students, by means of a fund for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Dr. [Pan A.] Chronopoulos was chosen toastmaster of the dinner. He thanked everyone present for his willingness to honor the graduates. He said that the Greeks, both here and in the fatherland, are proud of the progress of their youth. He then introduced the consul, Mr. Xanthopoulos, who pointed out the benefits to be derived from the support and encouragement of Greek students, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for the Greeks as a race.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster rose and congratulated the guests of honor who were: I. Haramaran, graduate machinist; J. Gekas, graduate of Law; and J. Gavaris, who received a degree in Philosophy. They, in turn, thanked the assembled guests for their kindness and generosity in attending the dinner. Dr. Theodore told the professional men, that it was their duty to be interested in community problems, and to follow the road of progress and enlightenment.</p>
   <p>He was followed by Mr. Dritsas, who stated that the field of opportunity is open in America to all students who are foreign born. By offering their talents and services to America they will be indirectly honoring Greece and the Greek-Americans.</p>
   <p>Other speakers of the evening were Mr. Kyriaicopoulos, lawyer; P. Javaras, and Mrs. Katakis. They all expressed the burning ambition of the Greek youth to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>advance in the fields of knowledge.</p>
   <p>This was a truly pleasurable evening, and it is hoped that there will be many more.</p>
