   <p>p.3.- We are told that the South Siders are gathering money to build a new church, because it is too far to go to the west Side. These reformers go from store to store asking for money, to build a church, they say.</p>
   <p>How much do you suppose they ask from each man? They start with $50, but if you give them a ten-spot, they'll take it. They tell you dimes and nickels won't build a church. You must dig deep.</p>
   <p>They want a new church because the West Side is too far, they say. Last year the West Side was right at their doors because they held offices in the church and could do what they pleased. As soon as they were ousted, the church is too far so they must have a new one.</p>

   <p>They expect the public to swallow these pills, but the public has swallowed them before and are not going to be so easily fooled. The situation is filled with comedy. These church-builders look upon themselves as Christians, saving the souls of the common people.</p>
   <p>One playful contributor gave the collector an envelope which he said contained $50. The soul-savers praised him to the skies and left. When they opened the envelope and found it stuffed with plain green paper, their anger knew no bounds.</p>
   <p>They were in an embarrassing position because the donator had witnesses that he gave $50. The collectors were forced to pay the sum out of their own pockets so as not to be accused of embezzlement.</p>
   <p>At the rate they are going, they had better build a church soon or leave the country. It isn't safe for them any other way.</p>
