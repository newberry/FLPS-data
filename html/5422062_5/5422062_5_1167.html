   <p>P3--Because of the limited capacity of the Greek church and the crowded condition every Sunday, prominent members of the Greek community here have decided that a second church is necessary so that church-goers will not have to stand outside the church, which is always packed.</p>
   <p>The new temporary church is located at 1927 South State Street, and with the Easter holidays on hand it is hoped that no one will have to stand outside for lack of space.</p>
