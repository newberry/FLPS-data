   <p>It is probable that I shall be thought of as a defeatist or as a hopeless pessimist by some of the regular readers of the articles on our community problems. Sometimes the moral has been set forth in the guise of a story or weaknesses have been pointed out by means of an imaginary discussion. No matter what methods I have used, my aim has been to improve the standards of thought and the future lot of my fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>Therefore, I am forced to say, because this is what I believe, that, even if we had the finest of Greek schools, in which Greek children were educated, not merely instructed; even if we had not had ecclesiastical anarchy since the first emigration of Greeks to America; even if we had a religious organization as powerful as the Catholics--who have schools and universities <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>all over America,....it would still be impossible for us to give our children the "Hellenic spirit" emphasized by Professor Smith. To accomplish this, many other things would have to take place.....</p>
   <p>Our efforts and labors to retain the spirit of Greece in the hearts of the younger generations should have been valiantly supported by the Greek nation. Our motherland should have taken some interest in the young Greeks of America, and should have done so from the day on which the first Greek arrived in this country. Everyone knows that the political and economic leaders of Greece credit the prosperity of the country to the Greeks abroad.</p>
   <p>What did the Greek nation do to safeguard the interests or nationality of the Greeks in foreign lands? What did Greece do to keep the source of her benefits from obliteration and eventual death? Nothing!</p>

   <p>All the pedagogues and psychologists in the world agree that children between the ages of five and eleven years are most receptive and responsive to training and environment.....By the time the eleventh year is reached the child has acquired certain ideas and impressions which are integral parts of his character. Therefore, if a child is to be imbued with the Greek spirit it must be done in these early formative years--or all efforts are wasted.</p>
   <p>What family, here in America, has amused its children by repeating the tales of Greek heroism and patriotism? What parents have emphasized the contributions of Greek thought and culture to the world of today?....When has Greece sponsored any program that would teach Greek children love for their language, customs, and religion? When has she striven to tell these foreign-born children of hers of the "Glory that was Greece"? What has she done to imbue their minds with pride so that when their friends call them "Greeks" with unsavory implications they will have a ready retort in defense?</p>

   <p>Thus, and only thus, can we manage to keep our youth within the confines of the Greek language, people, and religion. A little action, instead of the continuous useless talk, would have created a community which some people believe could only exist in a Utopia. If something had been done by Greece years ago, we who have been here forty years would not have already lost most of our Hellenism. We, who were born in Greece, have lost our Greek spirit in a land that is free and suppresses no people or religion. Our forefathers maintained and cultivated their heritage during five hundred years of the most terrifying oppression, slavery, and tyranny.</p>
   <p>There is a tremendous difference between us, for they made history while we shall die leaving no trace of our existence. Our situation is a serious one, from the point of view of progress and the future.</p>
   <p>Our problem could be solved without removal to a Utopia to do it. Some of the fault is ours--but how much more rests upon the shoulders of Greece, herself!</p>
