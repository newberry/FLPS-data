   <p>The suspense over the definite settlement of the Church question in America has been unduly prolonged, and it is due time for the Legate, Mr. Damaskinos, to put an end to a situation which causes so many doubts and fears.</p>
   <p>No matter how absolutely certain we are that the question will finally be settled according to the decision taken in Athens and Constantinople, to wit, by the suspension of the church regime created by Metaxaki and the recall of all hierarchs under him, the majority of people are not so easily convinced, and they express doubts as to whether things will turn out as desired. These fears and doubts they base upon the prolonged suspense and the indirect and wily activities of some persons to frustrate the departure from America of the bishops in question.</p>
   <p>There is not the least doubt that the Legate is animated by the highest feelings and the best intentions, and that his desire is to accomplish the mission that he was entrusted with, but he should not forget that <span class="page-break">2</span>the only weapons and resources that he has are the confidence and devotion which the Greek populace has accorded him ever since he first appeared among them in America, and that, being Greeks, namely, characteristically enthusiastic and impetuous, we turn easily and quickly to the other side as soon as we fail to see things accomplished and the situation improved.</p>
   <p>We have diligently avoided stirring up certain questions because we do not desire to pour oil on the fire and raise obstacles to the work of pacification, for which this paper has made so many efforts and undergone so many sacrifices, but, unfortunately, the other side is not animated by the same sentiments; they are trying by all means, open and secret, to kindle passions and make things appear to be at a dangerous pass, and to represent the Legate's work as a failure.</p>
   <p>For all these reasons it is our duty to remind the Legate that what he has to do is to clear up matters as quickly as possible and not admit the germs of dissension among us and first of all to carry out what has been decided on and not prolong our suspense, which surely will frustrate the work which we expect to be done.</p>
