   <p>The celebration of the event of the capture of Saloniki from the Turks, in 1912, is to be observed by the Phalanx organization of Greek Veterans in a holy mass, Oct. 26th, at St. Demetrios Church.</p>
   <p>Bishop Kallistos will head the religious ceremony and Mr. Dritsas, representing the Consul, will lead the parade. The Phalanx will have its official speaker in Andreas Vlapas, lawyer, who served in the Greek Army during the wars of 1912-1913. Miss Eugenia Pilafa will recite and little Nick G. Mannon will be dressed in Foustanella, which he brought from Greece two years ago.</p>
   <p>Such a bright ceremony, we are certain, will be attended by throngs of nationals, even if they have to leave their business for a few hours.</p>
