   <p>p. 1- The parish problems of our community have at last been solved, and our affairs have emerged from their recent unstable condition.</p>
   <p>All the major obstacles which seemed insuperable have one by one been overcome, and the spirit of cooperation prevails among us.</p>
   <p>The causes of our Church's late deplorable condition were lack of mutual confidence and our inclination to quarrel among ourselves. These had been for many years the predominating reasons for the division of our Church into two opposing factions, each having as its goal the destruction of the other and not considering that by such antagonism the entire structure of the institution was threatened with collapse.</p>
   <p>Fortunately that detestable period has been concluded, and the Hellenism of America in a united effort under one ecclesiastical authority has <span class="page-break">\2</span>turned from its downward course and has realized that only through cooperation will it be possible to preserve what remains and from the mass of ruins to restore the status of our Church, which besides its religious function serves as a factor in maintaining our national unity in the land where we now live.</p>
   <p>The Greek community of Chicago, which was the first to strive toward the solution of our church problems and the establishment of the new ecclesiastical state of affairs, has the right to be the first to enjoy the benefits of unity and to be the first to exemplify the fruit of cooperation to the entire colony of Greeks in America. It was hardly possible that a rapidly growing, thriving community like Chicago should fail to realize that the time had come to put an end to petty church divisions and parish antagonisms and all those matters which at the time of the church conflict we classified as insuperable obstacles and impassable chasms. Such a community could not fail to realize that only by good will and mutual confidence can we remain united, and that only through cooperation and mutual understanding can we continue our forward progress. We should not take sides when one parish aims at the destruction of another.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We must work hand in hand for the cause of the entire community, for parishes, schools, and churches all belong to the Greeks of Chicago; it was the Chicago Greeks who contributed the funds to establish and support these institutions, and any injury or destruction inflicted on one parish is felt by the entire community.</p>
   <p>It is a pleasure to note among the members of our community the prevalence of the spirit of solidarity and cooperation and above all to find that the distrust which many of our compatriots manifested has been replaced by mutual confidence. It is also a pleasure to see the exchange of ideas and opinions among parishes, and it is apparent that it will not be long before they will all become united.</p>
   <p>As long as the financial contributions to the support of all parishes are equally divided, there will be no objection to the unification of these parishes; we have never opposed unification, but we do object to the methods employed to effect the proposed union, - that is, we object to acts of force and compulsion. But if two parishes perceive the necessity of uniting to attain some worthy public end and of their own free will <span class="page-break">\4</span>decide to be so joined, we shall be the first to accord our whole hearted support to such an act.</p>
   <p>Of utmost importance is the fact that there now exists among the various parishes and communities the spirit of solidarity, cooperation, and mutual confidence, through which it is possible to bring about the restoration which we desire. This is largely due to the influence of Archbishop Athenagoras, who apparently has interpreted correctly the character of the Greek-American and knows both his merits and his weaknesses. Besides performing his regular duties as Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, Father Athenagoras may also because of his position regulate our community problems, and the only source from which he may derive the inspiration to do this is the absolute confidence in him with which the hearts of the Greeks in America are now filled. We therefore have sound reason to believe that the Greek community of Chicago owes to Archbishop Athenagoras hearty thanks for the splendid work so far accomplished toward the solution of our parish and community problems.</p>
