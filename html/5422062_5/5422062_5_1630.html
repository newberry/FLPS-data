   <p>The political lecture given by Mr. Al. Papanastasiou under the auspices of the Democratic Union of Chicago we regard as one of the remarkable events of our community both as far as crowds are concerned and also for its illuminating analysis. People were literally thirsting to learn from the mouth of an official the political situation in their country, and they went in masse to hear what is really going on in Greece.</p>
   <p>The Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel was filled early. The orchestra of Mr. Varzos, playing a beautiful Greek program, entertained the audience until the speaker arrived, who was greeted with enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Mantas opened the program, speaking with his native Icarian accent, and he said a few stirring words to this effect.</p>
   <p>"I have many things to say, but not being an orator, I beg that you will try patiently to understand what will perhaps be imperfectly expressed.</p>

   <p>I wish to tell Mr. Papanastasiou, however, that which we all feel, namely, that the Greek Government has never taken care of the needs of Hellenism in America, in spite of the fact that American Hellenism has never ceased to take an interest in everything that happens in Greece. There may be some whose actions are all the result of cool calculation, but the majority of our people are ful of patriotic spirit, and as soon as the revolutionary movement began in Greece, all we democratic Greeks united to help our fellow-democrats and the Greek democracy. We, living in a democratic country, know very well the benefits of democracy, and we want our country also to be governed by the system which makes people prosper.</p>
   <p>That is why we are forming the Democratic Union, namely to organize the democratic Greeks of America and so to let American Hellenism express its democratic opinions.</p>

   <p>Mr. Papanastasion was introduced by the presiding officer, Mr. Constantine Alexopoulos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Papanastasiou, in developing his topic analyzed the institution of monarchy in contrast to the institution of democracy from the historical, philosophical, and governmental points of view, and he proved indisputably, by arguments and by illustration, that the institution of monarchy is obsolate. In proof of his thesis he pointed to the rejection of this institution by all the nations established after the war except Albania. Thereafter Mr. Papanastasion thoroughly discussed the monarchy of Greece, following to history since the establishment of the Greek State. He depicted with an array of historical facts the oppressive rule of King Otho the successive attempts to overthrow him, the lack of political liberty for that very purpose and the convict on of Kolokotronis who was condemned to death for his protest against King Otho's tyranny. Mr. Papanastasion then continuedthe history of the Greek dynastics, or properly speaking of the constitutional monarchy. In conclusion he compared the monarchy benefits of the democratic forms of government.</p>
