   <p>(S. Kotakis, publisher and editor of the Chicago Greek Daily, had challenged the Right Reverend Father Ioakim, Bishop of Boston, to a public debate on the subject: Why Is There an Ecclesiastical Division of the Greek People in America? This challenge was not accepted by the Bishop, and as a consequence the following diatribe was published by Mr. Kotakis. - Translator.)</p>
   <p>We challenge them, not privately nor in a secret meeting with closed doors "for fear of the Jews"; we challenge them to appear before a public gathering, where, in the presence of many people, they might refute our statements and contradict us and furthermore submit their views publicly, in order that the multitude, whom they claim that we lead astray by our writings, might be enlightened.</p>
   <p>We have asked for a public discussion so that the people may hear both sides, for we have always considered the ecclesiastical question a public matter, about which all people must learn and be enlightened and not be led in the darkness and error in which they are now purposely kept.</p>

   <p>Of course it was not possible for these people to accept the challenge to a public debate, the purpose of which was to let the truth about the ecclesiastical question be revealed, for they would have had to answer definite questions propounded to them.</p>
   <p>It would not be possible for them to take up our challenge because they would have found themselves in a difficult position and obliged to confess the truth about certain things which they had misrepresented to their friends and followers to keep them in error and divided among themselves. For it must be understood that the followers of the bishops "do not know the truth about the ecclesiastical situation!" They do not know it, but they will learn it. The dignitaries have always distorted the truth, and they charge us with being the dividers and distorters.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why they did not accept our challenge, and they will never accept any challenge of which the purpose is to reveal the truth.</p>
   <p>Let them not forget, however, that by their silence and their refusal to take up our challenge they have been proved indefensible and have been, after all, exposed before the eyes even of their own followers as afaid of the light and the truth, and that they are the real dividers of the Greek people of America.</p>
