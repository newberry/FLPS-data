   <p>In the last issue of The Greek Star, we dealt with the subject of Protestant propaganda which is being used to proselytize members of the Greek Community. Time and again, this newspaper has warned our people against such propagandistic campaigns which attempt to disorganize the Greek Orthodox Church. Our innocent and unsuspecting people should know that there are such propagandists going about; they have taken advantage of religious freedom and tolerance in the United States to put up churches and organizations of their own.</p>
   <p>Every Greek who happens to be proselytized by such Protestant groups becomes a most fanatic missionary for the spreading of their novel ideas. These renegade Greeks who have not only renounced their religion and particular <span class="page-break">2</span>faith, which are the main characteristics of a true Greek, but they are also waging war against the creed, the doctrine, the practices, and traditions of our Church.</p>
   <p>Any Greek who denies his religion must not be called a Greek, but a traitor. He should not be allowed to associate or even to speak to other Greeks. The self-appointed and self-ordained priest of this Protestant sect, Dan Adalis, who, we are grieved to say, is or rather was a Greek, has been defaming our Church publicly and, in addition, has spread his propagandistic nets to catch as many dissatisfied Greeks as possible. We cannot promise Adalis that he will not be able to induce some fools to follow him and his employers, but we can assure him that no Greek in his right mind will leave the sanctuary of the Greek Church, without which no Greek can live decently and happily.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Those who had the misfortune to know such a debased character as Adalis, know that while he was unemployed some months ago, he was willing to take any job--even the job of injuring his own people and harming our institutions so long as there was something in it.</p>
   <p>The disgraceful name of Dan Adalis is known to many Greeks, but, in order to make it known to all for their protection, The Greek Star wishes to inform all that this man is a vagabond and a fake. He has been engaged in so many illegal activities that if the law should catch up with him he would be put in jail for life.</p>
   <p>It would be doing our people a service if we suggested that he be prosecuted and driven out of Chicago, if he continues annoying our fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>This is what we have to say about Adalis; as far as the other propagandists are concerned, we warn them to seek new converts among their own people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Other nationalities may become Protestants, Mohammedans, Jews, and Buddhists, but the great majority of the Greek people will remain Greeks and Orthodox Christians, adhering devotedly to an age-old doctrine and Church that have supported and saved the Greek nation in its long and adventurous history. So, our enemies are warned to keep away from our people.</p>
   <p>We are forced not only to call the attention of our people to these new forms of foreign religious propaganda, but also to ask our clergy, especially, to attack those who would weaken their authority and destroy the Church. Let our priests, that is, those who, before anyone else, are expected to fight for Orthodoxy, seek out those who wish to corrupt our faithful, poison their minds, and eventually draw them away from the fold. Let our clergy emulate the struggle of Saint Louis's Reverend Fiabolis who was outstanding as a valiant defender of the Greek Church during the religious controversies and proselytizing attempts in New England.</p>

   <p>From the columns of this paper, we wish to sound the call of salvation. We wish to warn the good and patriotic Greeks of our settlement to beware of treacherous Greeks who are agents of foreign interests and who work smoothly and surreptitiously among our people. Our Community has been infected by them and the resulting disgrace to the Greeks of Chicago is reflected on all the Hellenic element in America.</p>
   <p>In the name of our honor and sacred Church, we raise a protesting voice. We appeal to the press, the clergy, the heads of our various institutions and organizations, businessmen, and every patriot to co-operate with each other to enlighten the people in the face of the many threats that are confronting us. First, then, we must educate our people and strengthen their moral stamina and, secondly, we must exterminate those countrymen of ours who are a disgrace both to themselves and to the Greek name.</p>
