   <p>The question of limitation of the Greek Churches in Chicago is being discussed extensively, and the communities, one after the other, meet and decide in regards to authorizing the Legate about the regulation of the number of churches to be closed.</p>
   <p>The prevailing opinion, so far, is to have Chicago divided into three communities, the North, the South, and the West Sides, and to have all existing communities merged in these three sub-divisions, with their churches; the number of churches to be closed to be decided upon by the Legate.</p>
   <p>There is some detailed division of opinion regarding the West Side,---but, in so far, as the North and South sections are willing to have this done, the matter of the West section can be taken care of, one way or the other.</p>
   <p>We, from the start, have supported the idea that the cooperation of the communities of Chicago must proceed, up to the point where agreement can be attained by the parties concerned.</p>
   <p>There is nothing that could be done by force, and it is with pleasure that we notice that the work of the community has proceeded so far, that it is hoped with the arbitration of the Legate it will reach a happy conclusion.</p>
