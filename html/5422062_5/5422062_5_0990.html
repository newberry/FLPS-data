   <p>P. 3.- The temporary officers are inviting all members of the Greek community of Chicago to a meeting at which will be discussed the newly written constitution. We have learned that this constitution will closely follow the program laid out by the Greek consul, Mr. Koromilas on his recent visit here.</p>
   <p>The three main articles of the constitution will deal with:</p>
   <p>(1) The year of establishment of the organization, number of members and amount of dues.</p>
   <p>(2) The rules and regulations of voting and election of officers.</p>
   <p>(3) The dates and periods of time on which elections will be held.</p>
   
   <p>The first elections will be held fifty days after the constitution has been adopted. Twenty-five to thirty men will be nominated of which twelve will be elected to the Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>We feel that the place of meetings and elections should be decided now while everyone is in accord with his neighbor. Any further information on this subject can be obtained by calling Dr. C. Petroulas. His phone number is Black. 3045.</p>
