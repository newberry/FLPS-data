   <p>According to information received from Constantinople, the new Archbishop of America, the Most Reverend Father Athenagoras, will have wide jurisdiction over the Greek orthodox churches of America. This jurisdiction was tendered to him in Constantinople by the united Greek churches of America; and in accordance with this grant, the new bishops will be appointed by him without the vote and consent of the Greek communities of America.</p>
   <p>This information, no matter how paradoxical it may seem to Greek-Americans who are accustomed to having their bishops elected by the communities, is easily understood in view of the fact that the old regime has been abolished and a new regime is now in effect for the ecclesiastical administration of the Greek churches of America. It is also necessary to make a distinction between ecclesiastical and communal administration, in order to have an exact idea of the greater rights of the Archbishop and the selection of the bishops by him without the participation of the communities.</p>
   <p>According to the old ecclesiastical regime, the ecclesiastical administration of the communities of America was subdivided into four dioceses: those of New York, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. It also had its own Holy Synod, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and its Archbishop was simply a president without any jurisdiction over the other bishops.</p>
   <p>In the new organization, however, the dioceses are abolished and the Archbishop will have extensive jurisdiction over all the churches of America. The bishops to be appointed will be assistant bishops to the Archbishop. They will not have their own diocese, nor any rights of administration; because all the reins of administration will be in the hands of the Archbishop. The bishops will carry out his direct orders, assisting in the discharge of his duties. Consequently, they will be his own choice and not the choice of the communities.</p>
   <p>This is the meaning of the telegraphic communique.</p>
   <p>With this new ecclesiastical organization, the ecclesiastical union of Hellenism in America with the mother church is resumed. The Archbishop will be the connecting link between the churches of America and the mother church.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, this new ecclesiastical organization responds to the desire so often expressed by the Greeks of America - namely, to Maintain their ecclesiastical <span class="page-break">\3</span>bonds with the mother church and not to have a self-governed church administered by self-governed and independent bishops, with whose actions nobody had a right to interfere.</p>
   <p>By the new ecclesiastical organization, the Archbishop despite his extensive jurisdiction is always responsible to the highest ecclesiastical authority and under its control.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America will always have the privilege of carrying their complaints to the highest ecclesiastical authority, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, whereas previously the bishops and the Archbishop constituted an independent and self-governed authority, under whose particular administration the highest ecclesiastical authority had no right to intervene.</p>
   <p>In regard to the purely ecclesiastical administration, therefore, and the constitution of its organization, the the exclusive right belongs to the highest ecclesiastical authority, provided that it is in accord with the general desire of the Greeks in America; that is, they are to depend directly on that highest authority.</p>
   <p>However, the communal administration is different. In this the Greeks of America maintain their integral rights, and in this the ecclesiastical authority <span class="page-break">\4</span>does not even desire to interfere.</p>
   <p>The administration of their communities, the election of their executive councils, their church financial affairs - all these will be left exclusively in the hands of the Greeks of America. But matters pertinent to spiritual and ecclesiastical administration, as well as the appointment and discharge of priests and all matters pertaining to the church as an organization apart from the organization of its communities - jurisdiction over these matters belong exclusively to the ecclesiastical authorities.</p>
   <p>The extension of the rights of the Archbishop in purely ecclesiastical matters should not be regarded as a diminution of the rights of the Greeks of America, as some have misinterpreted it.</p>
