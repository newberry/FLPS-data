   <p>p. 2- A couple of Chicago newspapers have unwisely and unprofessionally reported the supposed utterances of the Greek priest at the meeting of Greek businessmen last Sunday in the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
   <p>The pious and popular Father Georgeadis, at the meeting of businessmen, in which 2,000 participated, delivered a speech enjoining patience, tolerance, obedience to social and civil law, and above all immediate consideration for the families of the packing-house strikers. He suggested that a committee of prominent Greeks should be formed, headed by the Consul General, to visit these fellow-Greeks of ours who took jobs there as strike-breakers and to induce them, for the sake of the strikers' families, for the sake of the injured business of their fellow-Greeks, and for the sake of the Greek race to abandon their temporary jobs, adding that they would have the blessing of the Church.</p>
   <p>The newspapers printed among other things unbecoming to the dignity of the Church a statement that the Greek priest, the Reverend Father Georgeadis, <span class="page-break">\2</span>had threatened the strike-breakers that if they did not abandon their jobs at once, he would bar them from communion....</p>
   <p>This statement is utterly untrue. When we interviewed our sister-publications and inquired about the source of their information, the answer was that some Greeks who were present at the meeting had told them what Father Georgeadis had said.</p>
   <p>Excellent journalism, eh? An admirable way to get news of a meeting! And an admirable thing to do, to drag the Church and its servants into disputes of this kind! I suggest for the dignity of the profession of journalism that professional methods of obtaining news be adopted.</p>
