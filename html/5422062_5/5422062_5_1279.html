   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>You have been appointed as a member of the Speaker's Committee, so I am informed by the Committee on Co-ordination of Nationalities of the All-American Exposition, and I have been requested to advise you as to what your duties will be.</p>
   <p>The enclosed pamphlets will give some outline upon which to base a speech, and I take it for granted that you will be available as a speaker in your section of the city. I will be glad to receive a letter from you informing me just how much time you can give.</p>
   
   <p>I do not know at this time what the call for speakers will be.</p>
   <p>It may be heavy and it may be small; if heavy, of course, I will want as much time as you can possibly give.</p>
   <p>Please, let me hear from you. Kindly give telephone number of place where you can be reached.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Lee E. Ranck,</p>
   <p>Director of Speaker's Bureau,</p>
   <p>Room 808 - 105 W. Monroe Street.</p>
