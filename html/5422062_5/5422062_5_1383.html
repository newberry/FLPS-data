   <p>For nearly a century and a quarter Americans have displayed a keen interest in the welfare of the Greek people. president Monroe, Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay were ardent champions of Greek independence throughout the long and arduous struggle against Turkish rule. Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe of Boston was a more important factor in the achievement of Greek freedom than the theatrical English revolutionist, the poetic Lord Byron. That Philhellenism in this country was not confined to a few lovers of Greek classics is proven by the number of American towns named Athens, Corinth, Delphi, Troy, Syracuse, or other Greek-inspired names.</p>
   <p>During the first half-century of Greek-American relations the only Greeks known to America were individual proteges of American Hellenophiles, who studied in our schools and in many instances rose to places of prominence in American life. Conspicuous among them were the famous Byzantine scholar, Professor Sophocles of Harvard, and Michael Anagnos, who contributed so largely to the education of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the blind.</p>
   <p>Since the 1890's ambitious young peasants, as well as jobless Greeks of good education, began to emigrate to this country in considerable numbers. They laid the foundations for the prosperous Greek-American communities which may be found in many parts of the United States, notably in Chicago, where there are 75,000 people of Greek origin. The rise of many of these immigrants from the rank of penniless peddlers, bootblacks or bus boys to the proprietorships of large and thriving business establishments and distinction in the professions is one of the remarkable chapters in the history of American immigration.</p>
   <p>These successes were not fortuitous. Mahaffy, who knew modern as well as ancient Greeks better than most scholars, wrote: "They are probably as clever a people as can be found anywhere in the world, and succeed not only by getting into their hands all the trade of the eastern Mediterranean, but by holding their own perfectly among English merchants in England."</p>

   <p>Next week Chicago will be host to representative Greek-Americans from all over the United States. The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, better known as Ahepa, will hold one of the largest conventions of the year. The city welcomes these visitors, whose organization, while keeping alive the ties with the homeland, is dedicated to the promotion of "loyalty to the United States of America, obedience to its laws and reverence for its history and traditions."</p>
