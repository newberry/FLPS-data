   <p>p. 3 The heralded popularity contest which was sponsored by St. Basil's Cathedral, took place last Sunday at the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>Four thousands Greeks and others, of both sexes, partook in the festivity. Two hundred and fifty Grecian maidens and matrons entered the contest. The celebration was a grand success. The participants, Greeks and others, had an opportunity to amuse themselves with Grecian feminine emotions which were very acute. Although no blows were exchanged amongst the fair competitors the fire, the envy, the scorn and other feminine emotions of a sixteen inch caliber were there smoldering and ready to explode at the slightest provocation. Thanks to the Goddess Aphrodite for precautionary measures were taken in advance by the organizations committee. The Greek ladies complying with the explicit request (but it was strict orders) of the committee, refrained from any explosions, and conducted themselves magnificently. The aspect was that of a panorama.</p>
   
   <p>Smiles and joviality were conspicuous everywhere.</p>
   <p>The first prize of the contest was tied between a matron and maid, and this award was a Chrysler automobile. Pandemonium was on the verge of breaking out. The winners of the first prize, matron and maid were eyeing each other like fighting cocks (you know). The wise Greek committee, alert as ever, cut the Gordian knot, with the quickness and ease of Alexander the Great. Matron and maid will each receive a Chrysler.</p>
