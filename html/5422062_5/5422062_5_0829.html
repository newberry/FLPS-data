   <p>The general meeting of members of the West Side Church took place last Sunday. At the meeting the board of directors of the Church submitted a financial report of the last six months. This report showed that the increased zeal of the board, and the intensified interest of the Church members in the affairs of the parish, had resulted in a one-thousand-dollar increase in assets over the previous year. The board also voted that the charter or constitution of the Church should remain as it is for the next five years.</p>
