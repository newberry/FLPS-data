   <p>With the approach of the elections ordered by the Court for the Greek community in Chicago it is not the business of this paper to make suggestions or to tell the people how to vote, but as conscientious journalists we deem it advisable to bring to light the doings and the misdoings of the former president of the community, Dr. G. Papaeliou, who again has the audacity to be a candidate for re-election.</p>
   <p>As soon as the treasury of the church became empty, after a three-year litigation through various courts, and as soon as the Appellate court confirmed the decision of the lower courts and ordered that Dr. Papaeliou should relinquish his throttling grip upon the treasury of the Church, and that new elections should be held, supervised by the court-appointed election commissioner or judge, and when the indignant members of the community, because of Dr. Papaeliou's mismanagement of its affairs, have begun to lose interest in the struggle for supremacy between opposing forces, our eminent doctor comes out before the public with profuse expressions of meekness and pretended obedience to the will of the people and tells them that a reorganization of the community is necessary.</p>
   <p>The cultured smoothness and the versatile evasiveness of the learned doctor have in the past exercised great influence upon the community, but insincere professions at last must reach an end - and when the end came, not only were Dr. Papaeliou's so-called achievements revealed as empty words, but the church's treasury was also revealed as empty. And above all, the name of the Greek community and the Church itself were dragged in the mire. These are some of Dr. Papaeliou's achievements while occupying the office of president of the Greek community. Doctor, undoubtedly you know the proverb, "Arche Andra Deixei - authority reveals the man," and by this time the community not only knows your inefficiency and incompetency in administering its affairs; it also knows the fibre of your character. A man may be excused for his ignorance and inexperience in piloting the ship of the community, and many times credit and honor are given to such a man when he is sincere in his efforts, but when a man of your education and social standing deliberately steers the ship on the rocks, such a man not only cannot be forgiven but rightfully draws upon himself popular condemnation.</p>
   <p>Dr. Papaeliou's subterfuges in the past and his utter disregard for the by-laws of the community and the wishes of the people, who by parliamentary procedure in three meetings voted against him and his associates, very clearly reveal the character of the person who was entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the community. It further reveals his unethical attitude in diminishing the Church's dignity and prestige by frequent litigation and causing several judgments to be rendered against the community. The first decision of the Court, which now is confirmed by the higher court, was to hold new elections and give an account of the community's funds. Did he abide by the Court's order? Oh no! While the treasury of the community was packed with thousands of dollars, he and his clique, having no respect for themselves, no respect for the interests and the wishes of the people, and above all not an iota of respect for the Greek Church, whose ministers were humiliated, preferred to appeal the case as if he had been wronged by the judgment of the lower court.</p>
   <p>Now when the end of his rope is around his neck, and the treasury has become as poor as a church mouse, and the judgment of the higher court has thundered over his bovine head, he sheepishly submits his case to the people of the community and hypocritically requests them to disregard all the allegations of his milignant accusers and vote for him and his group in the forth-coming elections. He promises to build a Greek hospital, a Greek school, and a magnificent church. Why, doctor, do you not derive wisdom from your past mistakes? This is absolutely absurd. With what are you going to build the proposed institutions? Thousands upon thousands of dollars have been squandered by your selfishness for your individual gain. Why did you not utilize that money for your mythical enterprises, doctor? Were you so foolish as to think that you would be able to milk the cow forever? The people are not eating hay, and by this time they know you very well.</p>
   
   <p>The proposed institutions, doctor, will be built not by you but by others who are real, conscientious, patriotic Greeks. Your sun is set, doctor, not only as president of the community but as a public figure.</p>
   <p>Don't we know each other, doctor? Have we not had our soiled linen washed in the courts in your libel suit against the Star? Have we not had fun, doctor? When the court-room was packed by Americans, did we not make them titter? Did we not substantiate the articles which we published about your mismanagement and misappropriation of the community's funds? Were we not exonerated by the court when we presented the articles of the other Greek newspaper in Chicago, Hellas, as the source of our information? Yes, dear doctor! But as we said above at the outset of this article, because of our duty to the public as journalists we shall not cease to expose you and others of your kind when and where public interest is concerned. We shall continue, true to our principles, to inform the public whenever a public official goes astray.</p>
   <p>Now these are the facts concerning the administration of Dr. Papaeliou and the squandering of the community's funds, and in the forthcoming elections each and every member is requested to do his utmost to reestablish the legal, normal, peaceful, and beneficial administration of the community's affairs.</p>
   <p>Since we live in the second metropolis of the country and have a wonderful record of social and commercial progress, it would be to our advantage and to the advantage of those Americans and others whom we come in contact with to have a house-cleaning of the present administration, which on the slightest provocation and many times without any cause whatever has dragged people into court under pretence of injured dignity or to settle insignificant differences. Let us observe the outcome.</p>
