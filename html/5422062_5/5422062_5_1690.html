   <p>At the present stage of evolution of the human race, when the majority of nations, have accepted though not entirely the democratic doctrines, which have gained ground that was formerly unapproachable it is advisable to take a retrospective view of democracy and see how it blossomed and evolved in the intellectual life of ancient Greece, see what influence and effect it had during the golden century of Pericles, Aspasia, the sophists, and the rhetoricians.</p>
   <p>During the democratic era of ancient Greece it was a necessary prerequisite for any one aspiring to a high political office, to possess or acquire oratorical skill. The necessity of eloquence in speech became felt by the majority of the people, and every one, great and small, began to cultivate the technique of oratory in order to defend himself at the bar of justice.</p>
   <p>This accounts for the talkativeness of the modern Greeks, who forget to eat, when engaged in a political debate. The citizen of ancient Greece had to present his case as briefly as possible, but in brilliant phraseology, omitting that which was irrelevant and immaterial.</p>

   <p>The democratic rulers of the people began to consider the possibility of establishing schools for the study of rhetoric so that those naturally inclined, would excel, and those who were not, would be able to use the Logos to much better advantage.</p>
   <p>Among the first to teach the Judicial Logos were Empedocles, Gorgias, Korax, Zeno and others.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously, but independently of the associated ideas of the rhetoricians, Anatolian Greece began to teach rhetoric with the first great rhetorician, Protegoras as instructor. Protagoras' teachings were followed by Thrasymachos, Prodicos, Ippias, Ileios and others.</p>
   <p>So great was the skill of these orators that while traveling all over Greece to teach the art of Logos, everywhere they delivered impromptu speeches on any subject asked for, to the delight of the masses, who hastened to become their pupils.</p>

   <p>The lucrative returns of the art of rhetoric were assured. These teachers were highly esteemed and glorified every where. Of course compensation for intellectual culture was just as great in other branches as it was in rhetoric. Pindar and Simonides were well compensated for their verses, but later on, due to a plethora of intellectual talent, historians tell us, the great Gorgias, distinguished dialectician and sophist, was earning only enough to live in the simplest style.</p>
   <p>The progressive democratic form of government and this upheaval of oratory were the causes urging the new generation of that period to seek other branches of enlightenment. Youth, spurred by democratic ideas, aspired to higher and more generalized culture. Until then the ideal goal of a youth in the high levels of society, was wrestling, and victories in the Panhellenic games. For that reason the greater part of the day was devoted to gymnastics. Very little time was left for music and poetry. Mathematics and philosophy were the pursuit of a small and select circle. Even distinguished men of the Polity did not possess much knowledge of these two branches of education. An exception to this rule we find in Pericles, who was educated in physical science by Anaxagoras, and followed the ethics of Protagoras.</p>

   <p>Now, when rhetoric became a necessity and the new generation demanded higher culture and education, because oratory alone was not sufficient to the aspirations of the democratic youths, Protagoras introduced politico-ehtics to his pupils. He strove to give them solemnity of politico-morale that they would be useful servants of democracy for the welfare of the State.</p>
   <p>Ippias expanded the circle of his teachings by adding mathematics and astronomy, while Gorgias and Thrasymachos continued to teach rhetoric. It is understood that physical culture was not abandoned; only now they discovered the right relationship between mental and physical culture, and established the harmonious equilibrium of these two powers.</p>
   <p>This reformatory movement, which was destined to create practical politico-democratic servants of the State, in spite of the efforts of many, excluded women, due to prevalent social superstitions. Nevertheless, a few women were able to lift themselves above the bounds of the established rules of society and excelled in this reformatory movement.</p>

   <p>The popular conception of these educated women, who liberated themselves from the fitters of custom, classified them in the category of Hetaerae. Glorified among those so called Hataerae was Aspasia from Metylos, who came to Athens in 440 B. C. So great was the mental culture of this Hetaera that Pericles himself fell a victim to her wisdom. After divorcing his wife, he installed her in his house and she became the social center of Athens' elite.</p>
   <p>This was the beginning of the intellectual culture and freedom of woman. Aspasia was the forerunner of woman's liberation.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the democratic form of government of today and the educational liberation of women owe their origin to ancient Greece.</p>
