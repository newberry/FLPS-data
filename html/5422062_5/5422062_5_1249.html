   <p>The drive of the Greek branch of the American Legion for new members has just begun.</p>
   <p>At the last convention of the American Legion, at Omaha, Nebraska, it was resolved, to begin the drive for members at once, and not to stop, until every Greek of the American Expeditionary Forces, became a member of the American Legion.</p>
   <p>It is the sacred duty of every veteran of Hellenic extraction to become a member of the Legion. Members of the Legion are the flower of the masculine sex of America. It is composed of men who marched under the Stars and Stripes in the World War. Every veteran of Hellenic origin who becomes a member of the Greek branch enhances the prestige of the Greek population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Become a member of the Greek chapter No. 343 of the American Legion.</p>
