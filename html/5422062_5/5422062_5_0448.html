   <p>p.1.-The progressive community, Assumption of Virgin Mary, is holding its annual dance at the Sherman Hotel tomorrow. We call it a progressive community because it really has taken many great steps forward in a short period of time since its establishment, and its officials work with much zeal for the erection of the New Church and school which are to serve the needs of our Nationals residing on the west Side.</p>
   <p>The lot upon which the building is being erected is situated in a beautiful location. The Executive Council, Mr. John Koliopoulos, president and all members of the community are worthy of congratulations for their untiring efforts for the order and harmony prevailing, and for what they have accomplished so far.</p>
