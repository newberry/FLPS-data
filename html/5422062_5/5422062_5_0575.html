   <p>Over two-thousand Greeks of both sexes, young and old, participated in the celebration of the designation of the New Greek Church, situated at Polk and Ashland Bovd. The 1.450 seats of the church were occupied long before the beginning of the ceremony. 600 or more were compelled to stand in the aisles of the Church. The predominating figure amongst them was the Right Rev. Alexandros, of New york, Archbishop of all Greek Churches in the United States; who with the Most Rev. Philaretos, Bishop of Chicago and many of the clergy, officiated at the holy liturgy. The name of the new church was designated as Saint Basil.</p>
