   <p>The Ecclesiastical question in Chicago unfolds itself swiftly and events succeed one another so as to keep the public in agony, just as in the movie dramas when the film is proficient and the subject matter interesting.</p>
   <p>So with our ecclesiastical question in Chicago. It begins to partake of that nature, with the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>however, and with many deplorable consequences for our communal affairs.</p>
   <p>The emotion over the episode of the decision of our rectory to the Diocese had hardly subsided, when, all of a sudden, the interest of the public is drawn towards the call to the other rectors for trial by the Diocese.</p>
   <p>And, to ease the spectator's mind as to whether the accused will appear or not, the public reads their statement that they refuse to appear before the court and do not recognize the Diocese and the Bishop.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The events as the reader can <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, unfold themselves with such a swiftness <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Hardly time to even feel the conversation that was prompted by such important events.</p>
   <p>And now, get ready for the last event, the more important and the one that, of necessity, gives new direction to our ecclesiastical question of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Basileos Has Arrived In Chicago</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that Basileos has visited Chicago. But whenever he has he never stayed and never has administered any rite, because the doors of our churches were hermetically closed to him.</p>
   <p>Now, however, things have changed, and Basileos, by a special invitation hastened to come here and tender his benedictions to the public that asked for them. Basileos will administer holy services in the church of St. George, today and tomorrow.</p>
   <p>This is the last piece of news which we record for information of the whole Greek colony of Chicago.</p>
