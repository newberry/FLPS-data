   <p>My dear Mr. Pantelis:</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Cook County American Legion Association held on March 7, 1923, you were unanimously elected as a Delegate-at-Large.</p>
   <p>The officers and directors of the Association are desirous of securing the advantage of your counsel and judgment in the administration of the Cook County American Legion Association, and would be very happy if you can accept the office. We appreciate that you are a very busy man, but this added obligation of service in this connection, we feel sure will appeal to you. May we have an early acknowledgment that you will serve?</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Cook County American Legion Association, By George F. Carroll, Secretary.</p>
