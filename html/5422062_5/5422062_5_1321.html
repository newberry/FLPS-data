   <p>American newspapers every day print news of the eagerness of Greeks for military service in the United States's expedition into Mexico.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's American printed the following:</p>
   <p>"Greeks residing in this city, many of whom have recently returned from the fighting in the Balkans, have held a meeting, made their resolution, and offered their services to the President for military duty in Mexico."</p>
   <p>Bravo! The Greek is always ready and willing to fight for his country. He has just got back from the Balkan wars, where Mother Greece called him to arms, and here he is again ready and willing, asking his adopted country to let him fight for her. That is the Greek spirit which has made Greek history.</p>
