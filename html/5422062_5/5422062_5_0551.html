   <p>p. 2 - On Tuesday before last, July 19, the life of John Igglesis ebbed away after a serious operation in the clinic of the Mayo Brothers at Rochester, Minnesota. The body was brought to Chicago for interment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Igglesis came from Mytilinon on the island of Samos and had been established in our community for many years. He was a devout Christian and a man of deep sincerity, esteemed by all, and his death caused great sorrow not only to his wife, Mrs. Athena Igglesis, of the Mallis family, but also to his numerous friends and to all his fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>A splendid funeral service was conducted in St. Basil's Church in honor of Mr. Igglesis. The benediction was chanted by the Reverend Father Philaretos, who extolled the virtues of the deceased in words replete with philosophic meaning. Father Philaretos was assisted by two priests, the Reverend Fathers A. Pashalakis and Demetrios Vainikos.</p>
   <p>Costly wreaths sent by numerous relatives and friends adorned the casket, and after the service Father Philaretos was thanked by Mr. Igglesis' particular friend, Mr. Demetriadis for his soul-stirring oration.</p>
