   <p>p. 2- In an encyclical the Holy Synod of Greece has informed the Reverend L. Pegeas, head of the Greek Church in Chicago, and through him all the Greeks in the United States that the Reverend Father Georgeades, former priest of the Greek Church in Chicago, is deprived of all ecclesiastical authority and is stripped of his rank as a priest.</p>
   <p>As it is known, Father Georgeades was recalled by the Synod a year ago on certain charges.</p>
   <p>The Star, standing ready to render to Caesar that which belongs to Caesar, has investigated the charges and found them not only unsupported but really malicious. But that does not exonerate the priest before the eyes of the Synod. The good father, depending upon others to prove his innocence, has failed to appear before that august body and to answer the charges in person as the Synod requested.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>That alone constitutes disobedience to the highest ecclesiastical authority and convicts him of disobedience for failure to appear. Disobedience to a duly constituted authority of the Church is an offense which the tribunal cannot forgive.</p>
   <p>The Star very much regrets the incident and reverently suggests to good Father Georgeades that he go to Athens and pay his respect to the Holy Synod of Greece. There is no other remedy.</p>
