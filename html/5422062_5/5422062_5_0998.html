   <p>p. 1.- Now that all the excitement is over and the church on the South Side has been built, other things come to worry the community. Still enveloped in the spirit of Christianity the builders of the church arranged a sumptuous banquet and invited the members of the West Side Church. They can't understand why the West Siders did not accept the invitation and refuse to have friendly relations with the South Siders.</p>
   <p>Another problem is the fact that the South Side Church cannot find any good choir singers.</p>
   <p>Somebody suggested that the committee run a pipe thru the gas mains leading to the West Side so that their choir music could be heard in the South Side Church.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Since this is an ecclesiastical venture, the pipes should be donated by the gas company.</p>
   <p>These few paragraphs tend to show the attitude of the South Side and the West Side Churches.</p>
   <p>We have just heard that a widow of a priest and her paralyzed son are in Chicago in much distress. Why don't our "Christian church-builders" do something about it instead of giving banquets which guests refuse to attend?</p>
