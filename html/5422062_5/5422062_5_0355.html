   <p>The Right Rev. Philaretos, bishop of Chicago and San Francisco verbally offered his resignation last Sunday in the Cathedral of St. Basil, in the presence of the Exarch who came to unify the Greek church in America. He thus relinquishes his ecclesiastical authority. The action of the distinguished hierarch was unexpected and created a sensation. Mr. Philaretos' jurisdiction extends to the Pacific Coast. His services to the Church and the Greek State were priceless. His devotion to his duty is beyond description. This true servant of Christ reached his decision for the benefit of the Greek Church in America desiring to accelerate the unification work of the Patriarchal Exarch, Mr. Damaskenos. The Greeks under his juridiction regret the loss of such an eminent shepherd. Bishop Philaretos, in relinquishing his authority, addressed the Patriarchal Exarch, in the following words while the multitude listened breathlessly lest they miss a word.</p>
   
   <p>"Most Rev. Brother in Christ, Metropolitan of Corinthos and Exarch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Honorable Consul General, and pious worshippers, there are times in a man's life when the mind stops functioning and the tongue is unable to utter the sentiments of the heart.</p>
   <p>"In that predicament I am now, being in the presence of the Representative Extraordinary of the Ecumenical Throne, who came as an Apostle to bestow peace and harmony to the Greek church of America.</p>
   <p>Joy and sorrow fill my heart. Joy, because divine providence favored me with the duties of Bishop at the Chicago Episcopate, where for eight years, tenderly, carefully and meekly, I have led my flock along the road prescribed by our Savior.</p>
   <p>My finite mind, which is never free from error, endeavored to wisely tend my flock and glorify the name of God, of which my imperative duty calls for.</p>
   
   <p>Eight years ago, at the time of my elevation to the present office I solemnly hold, I began to function as bishop, in my wide jurisdiction which extends to the Pacific Coast, without any material ground to stand upon, but with only a vial of sacramental ointment and the roster of the Episcopate's priests. Today, I'm glad to say, and to glorify the name of our Savior, that I have succeeded, inspite of the many obstacles and impediments, in establishing thirty schools, in organizing and founding fourteen new communities, and in building thirteen churches. I am glad for what I have done for the new Greek-American generation, in establishing catechetical schools at which ten thousand Greek boys and girls are taught our religion, and learn to live the life of Christ.</p>
   <p>I am glad, because I have succeeded in establishing certain rules ameliorating the condition of our priests and our teachers, who for a long time were the prey of certain unscrupulous leaders of communities.</p>
   
   <p>The religious and educational pillars (Priests and teachers) of our race in America, today, are standing out as examples.</p>
   <p>I officiated in 325 liturgies, preached the word of God 400 times, and gave seventy five lectures. I have ordained six priests, three of them, graduates from American institutions. I have cultivated the friendship of our brothers in Christ the Episcopalians, who as true Christians and friends, helped Greece to obtain the national loan, and signed a favorable treaty with Turkey.</p>
   <p>I'm glad, that during the trying period of the division of the church, I never thought or uttered a condemning word against a layman or a priest who disobeyed the wishes of our Mother church, and acted against my counsel. Knowing my duties as Bishop and owing to my principles, I have refrained from taking sides in politics, not even uttering innuendoes.</p>
   
   <p>But if I endeavored to restore order, peace and harmony and unite the divided church and communities, and by doing so I hurt the feelings of some, I have no regrets to offer, because that is a part of my ecclesiastical duty, for which I took an oath to uphold with all my power and might. Lofty and holy canons of the Church compelled me to maintain these divine rules of Orthodoxy. Order,peace, harmony, unity, and love, stand far above any sentimental feelings.</p>
   <p>Sorrow also fills my heart, because my full aspirations are not fulfilled. I aspired and worked for the establishment of a Chicago orphanage in whose shelter and under the protection of the church, Greek orphans, would find haven, instead of being scattered in various orphanages, in which they may become good and useful citizens, but nevertheless aliens to Greek culture and religion.</p>
   
   <p>I aspired to establish in Chicago an old peoples' home for our teachers and priests of the Chicago's Episcopate jurisdiction. I aspired to establish in Chicago a Greek free hospital, for our needy and poor families. I aspired to establish a Greek Orthodox cemetery in which to bury our deceased, instead of having them scattered at the utter ends of various cemeteries. I dreamed of building a Greek Cathedral in Chicago that would have been a symbol of Hellenism.</p>
   <p>All these are necessary for the welfare of the Greek of the Chicago Episcopate, and the reasons that my aspirations were not accomplished, are attributed to the destructive division of the church. In order to realize my dreams and have all my aspirations fulfilled, I solemnly tender my resignation to the Most Rev. Exarch, hoping and earnestly desiring that my successor will not be confronted with the same difficulties that I have been. My action, in relinquishing my office,is prompted by obedience to our Mother church.</p>
   
   <p>I first give the example of doing this, that the unification work of the Exarch shall be quickly done.</p>
   <p>The last sorrow that fills my heart is that I am separated from my beloved flock, which for many years I cared for and nourished with fatherly love and love in Christ.</p>
   <p>Those who have refused to accept my advice and obey the voice of the church, are forgiven and are blessed. Those who obeyed and cooperated in uplifting the dignity and sacredness of the church are blessed, and as a father, I extend my appreciation and thankfulness to them.</p>
   <p>I am grateful to His Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the Holy Synod, for the new and greater honors bestowed upon me, and I hope, with the guidance of divine providence, to be useful to Christianity and a faithful servant to our Savior.</p>
   
   <p>I am grateful to the government of my beloved Greece for the honor of Higher Taxiarch, given to me in appreciation of my humble services to the State.</p>
   <p>I am grateful to you Most Rev. Exarch, for your brotherly advices, and for accepting my resignation of the office of the Chicago Episcopate. And you, my dear children in Christ, I bless with the grace of Christ.</p>
   <p>Peace on Earth, peace and blessing upon the Greek church of America.</p>
