   <p>p. 3- The Consulate General of Greece in Chicago warns all concerned that the Secretary of Transportation and Communication urges our countrymen not to send paper money inclosed in letters to their relatives because the money is likely to be stolen by dishonest people, especially by persons in the lower ranks of the postal service whom it is difficult to control and hold responsible for theft.</p>
   <p>To avoid complaint on the part of those concerned and criticism of our postal service, it is urged that money be sent only by the internationally adopted form, namely, by post-office orders, which are issued for all Greek ports by all branches of the United States Post Office.</p>
