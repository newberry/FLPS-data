   <p>The Board of Trustees of the West Side Parish wishes to remind the community, that the treasury of the church has paid out $25,000 for the Greek School in the past year. Of this sum, $10,000 was paid on the property, leaving a balance of $15,000 yet to be paid. The taxes and mortgages and salaries cannot possibly be paid from the small amounts derived from the church collection plates. The only logical and fair way is by increasing the church membership. For this reason an appeal is being made to all patriotic and progressive individuals, that they join the church and pay their dues regularly.</p>
   <p>Action is what brings results, not mere words of advice or agreement. All who wish to aid the church, the school, and the entire community, are asked to get membership blanks, and then proceed to get as many subscribers as possible.</p>
