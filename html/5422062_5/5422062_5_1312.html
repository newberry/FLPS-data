   <p>Because of the inherent impulse of Greeks to serve their country that is the United States, in which they live, breathe, and function, the Greek community of Chicago held a mass meeting last week at Hull House and after listening to the oratory of its leaders adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>1. The Greek community of Chicago exhorts all its members (and requests other Greek communities all over the country to do likewise) solemnly to declare their faithful allegiance to the United States of America.</p>
   <p>2. It exhorts all its members, whether or not they have naturalization papers, proudly to appear (without advancing any valid or invalid excuse for exemption) before the constituted authorities and place themselves at the disposal of the United States flag, thus following the example of thousands of other Greeks who have volunteered their services to the army and navy of our adopted country.</p>

   <p>3. It further exhorts its members to buy more and more Liberty Bonds and also to contribute to the American Red Cross to their utmost ability.</p>
   <p>4. The Greek community of Chicago expresses its gratitude to the American nation for what America has done since 1821 for the nation of Greece.</p>
   <p>The above resolution shall be published in the Greek and American press in the United States.</p>
