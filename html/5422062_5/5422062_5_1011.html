   <p>Only a few days ago, we heard rumors to the effect that there is widespread propaganda at work in this city among our own people, organized and directed by certain Protestant groups. At first, we did not give these reports any serious thought because we had no positive information. Today, however, we received a letter from our good friend and one of our Community's most highly esteemed citizens, Mr. Eustathios Karzis, who reliably informs us that a group of propagandists has established its headquarters on the near North Side and has already attracted many Greeks there with the ultimate purpose of proselytizing them into the Protestant faith and their other infernal organizations.</p>
   <p>We are sorry that a lack of space makes it impossible for us to publish Mr. Karzis' revealing letter. However, we wish to say that what Mr. Karzis writes is not imaginary or mere conjectures, but facts. Only last Saturday, when he succeeded in coming in contact with the above propagandists, so that he was <span class="page-break">\2</span>able to discover how they operate and what methods they use in their proselytizing campaign.</p>
   <p>We hope that we can give sufficient warning to the many among our own people, who, in their ignorance and simplicity, might be influenced by the "fast and fascinating" talk of such propagandists. We are forced to admit that unless the activities of those dubious individuals are checked and unless our innocent members of the Greek Orthodox fold are informed as to what is being done, the Greek Church will lose many of its members and see its power and influence wane.</p>
   <p>Those "apostles" of the Protestant faith are fanatical tools of small and newly-formed groups of religious zealots whose object it is to undermine the older and firmly established churches of Christ. They use the lack of vigilance and weaknesses of the other faiths to gain new converts. They are now boasting of ordaining a certain Greek by the name of Dan Adalis as a priest. This despicable character has committed so many sins that much more than that <span class="page-break">\3</span>will be required to save his soul.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago have struggled so hard to preserve and strengthen the Orthodox Church in America. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent to put up church buildings and schools where the traditions and culture of our forefathers will be perpetuated. We have invited the best and ablest priests and teachers for our enlightenment and guidance in matters intellectual and spiritual. Isn't it now regrettable and calamitous that numerous Greeks are selling and renouncing one of their most precious possessions--their faith, loyalty, and devotions to the Greek Church? It is truly shameful to see members of our faith surrendering their souls to religious fanatics and propogandists. May we remind the Greek people everywhere that our faith and our Church has done so much to preserve the Greek nation and save it from total obliteration? For centuries the Greek Church has contributed inestimably toward the maintenance of our freedom and national consciousness. Certainly, a church that stood up through four dark centuries of the worst kind of oppression and slavery is worth defending and loving.</p>

   <p>The Greek Star will do all in its power to fight this new heresy and dissuade any Greek from leaving the Greek fold.</p>
   <p>In the next issue we will attempt to expose those traitors amongst us who are working to proselytize our people and undermine our Church.</p>
