   <p>The Greek Ladies Educational Society, Solon, raffled a radio at their dance, which was won by Christ Sarlas. Mr. Sarlas donated the radio to the church.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press printed in its columns the generous deed of Mr. Sarlas and the number of the ticket. Several days ago a Mr. J. Kotsopoulos presented the ticket with the winning number at the church and demanded the radio. The problem will have to be solved between the church and Messrs. Kotsopoulos and Sarlas. May the best man win!</p>
