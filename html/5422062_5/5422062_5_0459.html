   <p>We hereby announce to the Greek communities of Chicago and suburbs, especially to those of the South Side, that the interior decoration of the most beautiful church of Chicago, St. Nickolas's, 5957 S. Peoria Street, is almost completed. Next Sunday, Nov. 18, a holy mass will be celebrated by the head of the independent Greek Orthodox Church of America and Canada, Metropolitan Bishop Basileou. This eminent Hierarch of Orthodoxy will be assisted by the priests of the united Greek community of Chicago. By his wonderful preaching Bishop Basileou has captured the hearts of the faithful and has rapt them aloft to ethereal heights.</p>
