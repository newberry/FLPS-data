   <p>p. 2- The very much disputed administration of the Greek Community in Chicago is a thing of the past since the official election of last Sunday.</p>
   <p>As Judge Brentano had ordered, the rival factions filed affidavits of their candidacy, and the elections took place under the auspices of a mixed committee, Greek and American, appointed by the Court.</p>
   <p>The newly-elected officials who will administer the affairs of the community are as follows:</p>
   <p>Dr. Gregory Papaeliou, president; St. Spyrakis, vice-president; Chr. Ladas, treasurer; Dem. Papantoniou, secretary. The members of the Council are B. Georgacopoulos, Geo. Koteopoulos, Dem. Karambelas, B. Petropoulos, Athanasius Munjuris, Kyriakos Demas, Geo. Tsikhias, Const. Stavrakos, Dem. Chiambas, Philip Kekos, and Nicholas Kokinis.</p>

   <p>The management of the Star wishes success to the newly-elected officials and hopes that the prestige of the community will be safeguarded and enhanced.</p>
