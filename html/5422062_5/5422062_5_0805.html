   <p>Any group of people, which wishes to be a progressive nation, community, or even family, must be firmly united. This unified organization must be run in a systematic manner in order to instill respect into other groups. A group of individuals living together without precepts and organization will never make much progress, nor will they attain any cultural or scientific heights.</p>
   <p>This does not mean that any type of organization will serve the purpose. On the contrary, it must be of a type best suited to serve the needs of the particular group which is to be governed. The organization must be analogous to the time, place, and the manner of life followed by the people. If the organization or management is not of the proper type, it is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>preferable that there be none; for a wrong kind of rule can do more harm than none at all. If no rule exists, at least the group will be governed by certain natural laws; which more or less govern the fate of man.</p>
   <p>Daily world events, prove without a doubt that only the countries which have a government analogous to the needs of the people are progressing without the fear of social uprising. The strength of certain forms of government is so great that these governments crush all obstacles with ease; and lead us to believe that they can be compared with the lever of Archimedes, who said "Give me a lever and I can move the world".</p>
   <p>Our race especially, although it has a national organization, is sadly lacking in local and community unity; and must find some acceptable system of government in order to survive in this country. So far our unity is torn asunder by exploiters, egoists and big -headed maniacs; so, in order to achieve unity, we must remove these undesirable, self-appointed leaders <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and elect social-minded ones. Our leaders must be interested in the progress of our race in America, and not in their own personal gain. We live in a country run by a fine governmental system, and it seems a pity that we Greeks cannot profit by its example.</p>
   <p>We must learn to abide by the decision of the majority, as is logical; instead of forcing the wishes of a few upon the greater number, which unfortunately is characteristic of all Greek organizations. It is more fitting that an individual sacrifice his wishes to a system that will ultimately benefit the entire group, than that the opposite should be true.</p>
   <p>The foundation and the basic structure of a social system or organization is either religion or education--and usually both since they are interdependent. The former influences all members of any type of social organization. It uplifts the soul by its moral dogmas, and the mind is led into fine Spiritual channels. It counter-balances the tendency of humans <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to spend their mortal life on this planet seeking financial and material gains; in complete disregard of the finer but less lucrative ideals and ambitions. The latter causes the individual to grow culturally and intellectually. It enables an individual to use his faculties in a more efficient manner. Religion and education should influence humans to be good Christians, interested not only in their immortal soul and the future life, but equally anxious about the impression they are going to leave upon the earth by their thoughts and deeds. Man must be worthy of the trust placed in him by his creator. Everything on the earth, mobile or immobile, is placed at his command and disposal,and he must prove himself worthy of the trust.</p>
   <p>Therefore an individual or group which has not as yet realized its true reason for existing, but still seeks for material gain, and completely ignores its social progress, is still in the wild animal stage, which is not governed by logic and which does not easily discern between right and wrong.</p>

   <p>In order that this condition may not become a reality in our own society, it becomes a necessity for the church and school to set high standards. The priests and teachers must realize the important part they play in the development of a community. They must be chosen because of their suitability as leaders; and not because they are influential or "know the right people". Our major need at present is for priests of high moral standards, leaders in their field, and worthy of following their sacred profession. They must help the teachers perform their difficult task, a task which has overwhelming importance. They are molding the future citizens of America, and the future generations of Greeks.</p>
   <p>When a nation, society or group does not have the proper religious and educational training, but has men who serve money instead of doing their duty, then what can you expect from it? What results will be obtained by a society trained and influenced by such individuals? What will happen to the government and organization of such a society? These are the questions, each society must answer; and I as a Greek, am primarily interested in the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>fate of my own race in this country and in Greece.</p>
   <p>How do you, "Madam Society", expect to get rich harvests from a clergy, when its followers are not composed of men seeking to answer a spiritual call, but of men who are lazy or incapable of doing anything else to earn a living, and have for this reason donned the clerical robes and proceeded to exploit their fellow men? How can a man with a doubtful past imbue others with a desire to do good? How can a society expect people to attend a church that is governed by a board of trustees composed of ignorant, prejudiced, biased, backward, exploiting individuals? What can happen to a society in which dolts and braggarts are influencing the public thought merely because they possess a few more dollars than anyone else?</p>
   <p>Our Greek society which, from morning until night, criticizes and points out the defects and mistakes of other groups, blindly ignores the chaos within its churchsand schools. The dignity of our church is being trampled in the mud by the feet of its priests. The money poured into its coffers is being <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>directed into other channels--usually their own pockets--by the members of the board. Our society is not paying heed to its Augean Stables that even a modern Hercules will have difficulty in cleaning.</p>
   <p>Our church must exercise more care in the selection of men who pass into its service. Our monasteries in Greece must strive to create better impressions than they have left in the past, and must devote themselves to the rigid training of the neophyte priests.....</p>
   <p>Today our church is the battlefield where a struggle between the few decent priests and the money-grabbing trustees is being fought. Usually, however, the priest is hand in glove with the trustees; and on Sunday he blesses them for their wonderful, unselfish devotion to the Church.</p>
   <p>For shame, society, to allow such a condition in your church! But do not forget that the results will fall entirely upon your neck! You seek a <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>blessing from a clergy that has soiled hands; from a priest who automatically counts the dimes as they are dropped in the tray while he asks the Lord to forgive the sins of our little children.</p>
   <p>Save yourself, society; do away with your unfit leaders or you will sink to a level so low that no power will be able to raise you. Truly, we Greeks need organization, but not the kind we have. We need unselfish, progressive leaders to unify us.</p>
