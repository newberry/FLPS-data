   <p>p. 5.- We have received a letter of appreciation for publication, from Greek veterans who have received hospitalization at the Government's hospital, Hines.</p>
   <p>These unfortunate and crippled Greeks, who fought under the Stars and Stripes, sincerely expressed, in this letter, their gratitude to the Greek committee, who paid them a visit, bringing cheers and many useful presents. The number of Greek veterans at the Hines hospital is seventy-five and many of them are maimed.</p>
   <p>The committee that performed this noble deed is as follows: Mrs. Despina Gregoriou, Mrs. Euthalia Sakellariou, Mrs. Kleanthis, Mrs. Kostourou and the Rev. Sakellariou.</p>
   <p>This philanthropic and noble example must be heeded by the many Greek societies which also should bring cheering words and presents for each and every Greek veteran in the hospital. Let us make it a part of our business and duty to visit our suffering, ill and maimed boys, very often.</p>
