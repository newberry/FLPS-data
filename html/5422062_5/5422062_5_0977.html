   <p>The church on 19th and State Street has closed its doors to the public. The furniture has been sent to another church till it is decided what is to be done with it. The whole trouble started because the Greek people in Chicago wanted the lease to designate that the church belonged to them, not to the priest in whose name it was. Their reason for doing this is that they are trying "to unite the Greek Community"--or so they say. Couldn't they show their "unison" by supporting the church so it could pay its rent, at least? They insisted on closing the church because the promises weren't carried out. These promises were:</p>
   <p>(1) The building was to be fully equipped for a church.</p>
   <p>(2) The priest was to teach the children the Greek language.</p>
   <p>(3) $18,000 was to be paid for the building.</p>

   <p>After the first agreement, all attempt at unison failed. We are exactly where we started at the very beginning. We are as progressive as the dog who chases his own tail.</p>
