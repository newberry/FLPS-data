   <p>Last Sunday, May 12, the George Dilboy society, a Greek World War veteran's organization, gave a benefit dance at the Sherman Hotel. The purpose of this organization is to protect the interests of its members, and to keep before the mind of the American public the contributions of the Greek heroes of the American Army during the World War. To attain this latter purpose is why the organization is expending so much time and effort to have the name of Blue Island Avenue changed to Dilboy Avenue. Dilboy was a Greek hero who fought in the American Army and was killed in France.</p>
   <p>This society is composed of honored Greek men, and we do not doubt that it will eventually accomplish its aim.</p>
