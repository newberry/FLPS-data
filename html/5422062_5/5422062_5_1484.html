   <p>In reply to our letter the secretary of that division of the State Department which attends to the certification of passports was pleased to giveus the following clear and important information for those who are interested in bringing their relatives to America. Mr. J. Preston Dowden's letter follows:</p>
   <p>"Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>February 20, 1923.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Nickolaos J. Kassavetis,</p>
   <p>21 Washington Street,</p>
   <p>New York, N. Y.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"The department received your letter dated February 7, 1923, with its inclosure, according to which you wish to received definite instructions in regard to the immigration of Greeks to the United States. Your inquiries are answered as follows:</p>
   <p>"First, persons in this country should advise their relatives in foreign countries that they must first approach the American Consul and present their passports for certification, submitting to him the certificates in their possession.</p>
   <p>"Second, American Consuls as a general rule begin to certify passports about June 1st for admission to the United States after July 1st. In regard to your inquiring as to whether prospective immigrants should appear personally before the consul to submit their identification certificates or whether they should mail them inclosing a dollar, we beg to say that they may mail their requests to the consul for appointments; they must then appear at the proper time to have their passports certified, but they should not send money by mail.</p>
   <p>"Third, American consuls will inform by mail those who request them to do so when they must appear for the certification of their passports. We recommend that those persons in foreign countries who wish to come to the United States shall inquire of the nearest American consul about the certification of their passports in order to gain admission to this country after July 1st, 1923.</p>
   
   <p>The consul will give them full information. Enclosed you will also find a circular which explains how a passport is certified.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>J. Preston Doden,</p>
   <p>Under-Secretary of State."</p>
