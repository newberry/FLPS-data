   <p>The various committees of the Brotherhood "Zoodohos Pege" (Life Giving Fountain) of Saint Nicholas Church are very busy in preparation for their first annual ball, to be given at the Shoreland Hotel, Sunday, Sept. 18.</p>
   <p>This brotherhood, or rather sisterhood, was organized by the young ladies of St. Nicholas Church and aims to care for the orphans and to help financially, worthy university students of Grecian descent.</p>
   <p>The Greek public will no doubt support the young ladies in their Christian work for which they founded this club.</p>
   <p>Philanthropic and social work of this kind should be encouraged and assisted, and we are confident that the Greek public will honor this first ball of the "Zoodohos Pege" and will crowd the ballroom of the Shoreland.</p>
