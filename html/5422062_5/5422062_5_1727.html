   <p>Three hundred Cretans from the United States have arrived at Peraeus, Greece, for a visit to their native Crete.</p>
   <p>The Cretan societies of Athens and Peraeus organized a warm reception for the visiting friends. Thousands of cretans from both cities, crowded the quay of Peraeus, while hundreds in row-boats dotted the waters of the shore.</p>
   <p>As the majestic "Patria" calmly entered the shore, frenzied cheers from the multitude filled the air, acclamation and applause was manifested everywhere. The visitors on the approaching "Patria" returned the cheering with cannonades of hurrahs, spasmodically shaking hands, handkerchiefs and hats.</p>
   <p>When the boat anchored, the anthems of United States and Greece were played by the boat musicians and the Cretan tourists sang native songs.</p>

   <p>The civic authorities of Peraeus, headed by the Mayor and committees of Cretan Societies boarded the boat, greeted the visitors and gave them the key to the city. The Greek-American tourists were fascinated by this warm reception.</p>
   <p>Other prominent figures, who boarded the boat to welcome the tourists, were Mr. Dambergis, President of the Centennial Anniversary; General Korakas; Mr. Stephanides, Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, and many others.</p>
   <p>A short time later the Prime Minister of the land, with his wife, boarded the ship and had luncheon with the Greek Americans.</p>
   <p>At 10 P.M. a magnificent dinner was given in honor of the visitors, at the Civic Theatre, in which many prominent personages participated. Tomorrow, the boat will sail for their native Crete.</p>

   <p>We congratulate the wise old Greeks across the water, for they know that cordial and warm receptions to us Greek-Americans, indicate closer cooperation, friendship, and also more American dollars to be spent.</p>
