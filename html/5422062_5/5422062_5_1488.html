   <p>I am fortunate to be able to class myself among those millions who dreamed of the land of liberty and opportunity, and I can say that my dreams came true. As soon as I arrived in the land of promise, seeking now fields of labor as a stranger among strangers, I realized that being welcome in the commonwealth of equality, I could be an American, too, by doing as the Americans did. America was my dream, and Americanism was my inspiration. Long, long before "Americanization" had become a word so frequently on our lips, I was aware of my duty to my adopted country. I have always felt proud to be an American among Americans, but I believe that an American is not the man who merely calls himself an American but he who "follows the flag and keeps step to the music.</p>
   <p>To promote the objects of the work of Americanization which you and we have undertaken, I propose that the Association shall assign a place to the editors of the foreign-language press on the program of the ways and means committee.</p>
