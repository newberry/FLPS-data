   <p>I, the undersigned, Venetsanos Panagopoulos, native of Kouvala, Trifillias, Greece and for many years a citizen of Chicago, hereby assert that on January 11, 1925, I was married by Rev. Daniel Golemis, priest of the Chicago Greek church.</p>
   <p>The Greek consul in Chicago informed me that I was not in order when I intended to go to Greece on the Ahepa's excursion. It was necessary to be married again, and, in order to do that, I had to get permission from the diocese and that the ceremony had to be performed by a canonical priest. This latter ceremony took place March 9, 1928.</p>
   <p>I call attention to the Greeks of America that my misfortune may be to your benefit, because many of us do not know the existing difference between regular and irregular Greek priests.</p>

   <p>Notice of the Editor.</p>
   <p>This newspaper many times in the past published articles regarding the ecclesiastical question, that divides the Greek Church in America, and, taking exceptions to the above printed notice of Mr. Panagopoulos, we inform the public of the following facts:</p>
   <p>The Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople from time immemorial had jurisdiction over all the Greek churches in the world. This prerogative for some time was given to the Holy Synod of Greece. But lately it was withdrawn, and the Patriarch has appointed the Most Rev. Alexandros, Metropolitan of Rodstolou, as archbishop of the Greek churches in North and South America, and three Bishops, one each for Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. These appointments were acknowledged and recognized by the Holy Synod of Greece and the Greek government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>According to the Greek law a marriage is legal when it is performed by a canonical priest, and here in America canonical priests are those who are under the jurisdiction of the archbishop and the three bishops. Marriages performed by any other priest (not regular) are illegal and void. Churches and priests who do not recognize the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch, are not canonical. Archbishop Alexandros undoubtedly will unite the churches and peace and harmony will prevail again.</p>
