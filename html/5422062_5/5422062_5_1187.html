   <p>p. 2- Through its board of directors the Greek community of Chicago has filed a petition demanding of Dr. G. Papaeliou, its president, an accounting for the community's funds.</p>
   <p>They maintain that the president has failed to fulfill his obligation under article 34 of the by-laws of the constitution, which requires him to appoint an examining committee of three, as auditors, to go over the books and report to the board the true condition of the administration.</p>
   <p>Star's note:</p>
   <p>Mr. President, if the allegation of the board of directors is true, that is, if you are hiding the books and refuse to appoint the auditing committee, then, my dear doctor, as president of the community, you have failed to familiarize yourself with the constitution, which is above all, president, treasurer, board of directors, and everything else. And on the other hand let me remind you of the popular adage, "Clear skies fear no storms."</p>

   <p>Mr. President, for the sake of harmony and peace appoint the examining committee, and thus "render to Caesar that which is Caesar's." "A word to the wise is sufficient."</p>
