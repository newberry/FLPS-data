   <p>Just a week from now, our Community elections will be held. During the past month the incumbent Community officers and board of directors, as well as the new candidates for leadership, have been waging a stubborn and heated battle to become the people's choice. The financial reports have been examined by a specially appointed committee, and it is reported that the management of our Community affairs, at least from the financial standpoint, has been satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Of course, we have the usual critics who are never satisfied with anything.</p>
   <p>A fair appraisal of Dr. Chris Petroulas' administration of our church, school, and Community institutions will show that our Community affairs and forces generally have contributed a great deal to our welfare and prosperity.</p>
   <p>Considering the circumstances and the past accomplishments of our Community, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the present administration has made an excellent record for itself. It is now up to the people to approve that record and judge whether this year's Community leaders are worthy of re-election.</p>
   <p>Dr. Thomas Sanitsas and his friends will oppose Dr. Chris Petroulas' party in the coming elections. In the ranks of both the Reform party under Dr. Sanitsas and in those of the Progressive party under Dr. Petroulas are many individuals who are not very highly thought of as Community leaders. Nevertheless, let us hope that the vote of the Greek people of this Community will select only those who have the best qualifications, character, and organizing ability.</p>
   <p>Our churches, schools, organizations, patriotic causes, and Greek-American cultural centers must be reorganized under efficient and intelligent leadership. All our common institutions must be brought up-to-date within the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>coming year. Let us hope that the new administration will put new life in our thriving, ambitious, but improperly led and improperly organized Community affairs.</p>
