   <p>What a beautiful word "church" is. It is a word that should have a beautiful spiritual meaning yet our churches have sunk to the level of our coffee-houses. There are still a few people left who say, "Let us go to church and say our prayers." These people are becoming more scarce every day.</p>
   <p>If Jesus were living today and saw the number of collection plates in our churches he would say "Stay home and say your prayers - this is robbery."</p>
   <p>The Greek communities of America are breaking up because the clergical desire for money is surpassing the desire for Orthodoxy and Christianity.</p>
