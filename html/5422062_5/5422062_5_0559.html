   <p>The Greek Churches of Chicago are very much criticized, for getting away from Byzantine music. Such a criticism is not only for Greek Churches of Chicago, but for all the Greek Churches in general.</p>
   <p>It is true, that the Greek church of today is not using real Byzantine Music, but we cannot say with authenticity that Byzantine Music was given us, as pure and chaste as it was created originally. What we have today is a crude translation. The key to the original Byzantine Music is still to be found.</p>
