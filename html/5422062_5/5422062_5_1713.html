   <p>Some months ago, it was my privelege to extend to the Republic of Greece, the best wishes of the State of Illinois, upon the occasion of the presentation of our State flag to the Premier of Greece, to be placed in the Athens memorial to the soldiers of the World War.</p>
   <p>The gift of that flag, and the heartfelt messages which accompanied it, was a symbol of the warm fellowship that we of Illinois feel for the men and women, not alone of your native land, but of the other nations of the old world.</p>
   
   <p>Today, we are gathered here to receive for the State of Illinois the Greek flag, which will be housed in the State museum as a continual reminder that the men and women of Greece share with us in a mutual bond of understanding, good will and lasting affection.</p>
   <p>This exchange of flags signifies to me a growing appreciation of the fact that no nation can live for itself alone; nor progress at the expense of others. We may be proud that the United States has never cared to turn its great natural resources into destructive agencies to gain greatness through the downfall of those less favorably situated. On the contrary, we have shared our discoveries with our sister nations, extended a helping hand in protection of the weak; and answered the call of human suffering - whether it come from the orphaned children of war-striken Europe; the quake-torn zones of Japan; or the starving hordes of China's famine districts.</p>
   
   <p>Through our President, Herbert Hoover, we were privileged again this past week to extend to the nations of Europe, trembling on the brink of complete disaster, a helping hand, which may point the way to their recovery from the economic problems which confront them. That action expresses more strongly than words, the great good will of the United States, for its sister countries and opens the way to a new vision of international relations.</p>
   <p>Within our communities, and between our States, we have in the past decade, witnessed a new bond of friendliness. Barriers of class and section have been swept away, and we have come to the realization that those problems which affect one class must ultimately affect all classes; and that no section of the nation can long remain sick, without extending the disease to all other sections.</p>
   
   <p>President Hoover, in recognizing that the ills of one great nation must before long make themselves felt in every other nation, and his action in meeting the present European crisis, is an indication of new leadership and new thought in the family of nations.</p>
   <p>Out of it must come better conditions for all, and higher appreciation of the well wishes of our nation toward those less fortunately situated. That the history, the customs and the political activities of one nation affect the life of other nations, even hundreds of years later, is nowhere more clearly shown than in the influence which your native Greece, exerts on the civilized world. We owe it a deep debt of gratitude for its contribution to the cause of happy living, even though a large share of that gift dates back almost to the beginning of the world's written history.</p>
   <p>Greece, in its architecture, its materpieces of sculpturing, its philosophy, its literature and its sciences, has given to the world a creative gift that will continue to cast its influence on the countless years to come.</p>
   <p>And, standing high in this contribution to the cause of human welfare, is the steadfast loyalty and keen appreciation of individual service, that is exemplified by the history of Greece.</p>
   <p>More than 2,000 years ago, the young man of Athens, standing ready to assume the privileges and obligations of citizenship, raised his right hand, and swore to leave "his city not less, but greater and more beautiful than he found it."</p>
   <p>Today, we are gathered in the shadow of the tomb of Abraham Lincoln, who, like the young man of Athens, swore to leave his nation not less but greater than when it was entrusted to him.</p>
   
   <p>He met his obligation, and a martyr's grave, but each day he stands forth even greater - - a symbol of sacrifice, of service, of love and of understanding. And each year in increasing thousands, proud men from the far corners of the nation and the world, kneel at his bier, place a wreath, shed a tear, and take new resolve over his last resting place to perpetuate those great principles of human love, which so marked his life.</p>
   <p>Bonded together as a nation, because of mutual love of liberty, and the sacrifices which were necessary to attain it, the original thirteen United States naturally attracted the hardy and courageous spirits of the old world to the shores of the new nation. They came from Greece, Italy, Austria, Germany, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark - - from all the lands of the world. They were fused in a new mold and from that mold in endless procession came the citizenship which we know today.</p>
   
   <p>More than 2,000 years ago, Greece became the first democracy; and, in the attainment of the highest honors of citizenship, birth counted for little more than nothing. Men were elevated to high positions, and achieved fame and fortune - - not because of the conditions of their birth, but because of their degree of service in the nation's cause.</p>
   <p>Years rolled by, and the democracy of Greece was trampled on by the Romans. Kings and Emperors rose and fell, nations carried on intrigue, and alliances were made and broken; but through a long course of years, classes remained classes, and rulership vested in those born of ruling families.</p>
   <p>Such conditions have vanished from the earth; and here in America is new mold, birth again counts almost less than nothing in the attainment of the highest awards of citizenship. Preferment depends on service, and service depends on our preparedness to meet the needs of the day. We get out of our citizenship only what we put into it. America needs those who are competent and willing to serve. The door is open to all.</p>
   <p>Illinois is fortunate in the sons of Greece which it has attracted to its doors. Seldom has one been found wanting in answering the call of service.</p>
   <p>When the nation sounded the cry of danger in the World War, thousands of Greek parentage answered. Some were left on the field of battle. Others more fortunate returned and are gathered here today. In memory of those who did not return, let us join in accepting the flag of Greece, to be placed in the halls of State, a continual bond between the legionnaires of Illinois and the World War forces of your native Greece - - two great forces which fought shoulder to shoulder, not for personal gain, but in behalf of a better understanding between nations.</p>
