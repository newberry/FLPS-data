   <p>The body of the deceased Paul Rakos was bedecked with flowers and wrapped with the American Flag. The legionaires marched to his last place of rest.</p>
   <p>Paul Rakos, having come to this country in 1910, adopted this country as his own, thus becoming an American by choice. He loved the American flag, not particularly because of the bright colors, or stripes and stars, but because of its great symbolism; because of the great principles for which it stands, one of which is that, "Equal opportunity be given to everyone." As he gladly donned the uniform in defense of his adopted country, we may truly call him a one hundred per cent American, for he who is ready and willing to live by certain just principles must also be ready to defend and if necessary to die in upholding such principles. Such principles that one can live or die by are contained in our Constitution of the United States of America.</p>
