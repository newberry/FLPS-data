   <p>p. 2.- Last evening, several members of the Greek Community Organization of Chicago held a meeting at Mr. Rifakis' house where it was disclosed that there are 912 official members and $3,752 in the treasury of our church. This big addition is due to the recent elections. If we held elections every month, we could raise 300,000 easily in no time. Let us hope this good work keeps up.</p>
