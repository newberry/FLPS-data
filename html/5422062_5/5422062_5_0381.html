   <p>pan. 1.- Never was a better selection, and never a delegate vested with such powers, as the distingushed Hierarch Right Rev. Damaskinos who is landing on American spil, Tuesday, for the second time.</p>
   <p>We, being vested with Great powers, representative of the Patriarchate, the Holy Synod, and the Greek government, his opinions and judgement respected, has come to pacify the Greek element of America. To do so, he ought to feel himself capable and be equipped with something besides he ability and will power, something that encourages and reanimates, and that something is patriotism. This, the Right Rev. Damaskinos, has proved he possesses.</p>
   <p>Some one of our fellow journalists wrote, recently, inquiring as to what His Right Reverance would do on landing in New York; would he visit the Atlantis, first, or the National Herald, --as if he were a wandering priest, who would have tried to solicit favor from either of the New York Greek dailies, so as to be recommended to the Greeks for some position!</p>

   <p>What a disrespectful question to ask.</p>
   <p>Right Rev. Damaskinos was welcomed on the Steamer by the Mayor of New York, in behalf of the city of New York, through a proxy! This is sufficient, we think, for the journal that printed the comments to understand the value of this apostle from Greece.</p>
