   <p>The long-awaited day finally arrived. It will be one of the unforgettable high lights in the annals of the Greek Community of Chicago. Activity in our community began in the early morning hours. At the offices of the reception committee the members were receiving final instructions about the part they were to play in the reception of Mr. Alexander Papanastasiou. He is the leader of the Farmer Labor Party of Greece and organizer of the Neo-Hellenic Democracy.</p>
   <p>Halsted Street and its Greek stores were overrun with Greeks of every locality and political belief who were waiting to go to the Union Station to meet the celebrated visitor. The International [restaurant], owned by Mr. A. Spyropoulos, was headquarters for the Arcadians who are proud of belonging to the same locality as the famous guest.</p>
   
   <p>Various Greek notables and dignitaries kept arriving on the scene. At their head was John Mantas, president of the Greek Democratic Organization of Chicago. Others on the reception committee were: G. Karaflos; William Trakas, chemist; James Perry, lawyer; A. Despotes and S. Soter, physicians; Spyrus Kotakis, journalist; and Andrew Karzas.</p>
   <p>The above group went to Elkhart Indiana to board the train before its arrival in Chicago. The station at South Bend was filled with Greeks from that community, who added their greetings to those of the receiving group. Mr. Papanastasiou was presented with many bouquets.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greeks began to gather at the Union Station at one o'clock, despite the fact that the train would not arrive until 2:30 P. M. The reception committee nearly "melted" as they hurried to get everything in order for a dignified and imposing reception. Reporters from the American press were amazed at the Greek patriotism displayed.</p>
   <p>When the train finally arrived, the relatives of Mr. Papanastasiou were led to the coach that they might meet again their distinguished relative. Then Mr. Papanastasiou made his appearance before the large crowd...He was conducted to a waiting automobile as hundreds tried to shake hands with him....His newly-married son, Costa, and the bride were with him.</p>
   <p>George Becharas and John Athas helped the reporters to get stories and pictures. Then with some of his old friends, such as, G. Chiagouris, John Raklios, Andrew Vlahos, A. Pepowis, and M. Hatsos, the guest entered the automobile. There Dr. N. Salopoulos was stationed on a dais so that he could welcome Mr. Papanastasiou in the name of the Greek Community of Chicago. The gray-haired, dignified physician spoke in a voice choked with emotion as he welcomed his friend to Chicago. The crowd enthusiastically applauded the speech of Dr. Salopoulos, for he is the best-loved Greek in this city. Then the celebrated guest ascended the rude platform and thanked the Hellenes of Chicago for their touching tribute to him and to the policies he represents.</p>
   <p>He appealed to the Greeks to destroy all antagonisms and political ideas which serve to divide them, and to present a "united front" in order that they might succeed.....</p>
   <p>At the close of his speech he journeyed to the Blackstone Hotel where another reception committee awaited him.</p>
   <p>It is announced that Mr. A. Papanastasiou will receive any individuals or groups who desire to meet him in his suite, provided they call Mr. Elias Tsanetis and make an appointment first. He has already accepted many invitations for dinners to be given in his honor by the various Greek societies. He will be the guest speaker on next Friday at the dinner given for him by the Greek Men's Professional Club at the Bismarck Hotel.</p>
