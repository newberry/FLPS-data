   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, and suburbs, are cordially invited to honor the fourth annual dance of the church, St. Basil, given at the Steuben Club, N. E. Corner Randolph and Wells Sts.</p>
   <p>Owing to the financial need of the church, we hope that all the communities will strive to make the dance a notable event.</p>
   <p>From The Office.</p>
