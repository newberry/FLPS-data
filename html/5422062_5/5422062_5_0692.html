   <p>The ceremony of the consecration of a bishop is truly magnificent, and the new Bishop of Chicago, the Right Reverend Philaretos Ioannides, is physically, mentally, and morally worthy to be intrusted with the many great responsibilities of this ecclesiastical office. The address which he delivered before prelates, priests, and congregation confirmed the good judgment of the electors who nominated him, of the Eumenical Patriarchate which selected him, and of the members of the flock who ardently hoped for his appointment.</p>
   <p>After the consecration Bishop Philaretes took the shepherd's crook from the hands of Archbishop Alexander and walked to the episcopal throne.</p>
   <p>After this Mr. Constantine Paleologos, on behalf of his countrymen who were in attendance and also of those who on account of remoteness or business engagements were unable to attend, addressed the Bishop and promised him their love and devotion, affirming that they would all be faithful and ready to make sacrifices for the principles of Orthodoxy and the interests and necessities of our nation. This speech was vigorously applauded. The newly-consecrated <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Greek Orthodox Bishop of Chicago answered Mr. Paleologos in modest but manly terms, as is proper for a prelate.</p>
