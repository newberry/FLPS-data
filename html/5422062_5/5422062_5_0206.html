   <p>p. 1- The organization of our parishes continues to progress, and the momentum of this progress should be increased so that we may make up for the time lost while our church affairs were in their late deplorable condition, so correcting the evils brought about by the disunited parishes.</p>
   <p>We are all awaiting the arrival of the Archbishop in our city so that he may summon us into conference and set in motion the cooperative plans for putting our community affairs in order.</p>
   <p>The start has already been made, and resolutions have been adopted by which the plan of reorganization has been solidly established, and the proper course has been laid out for its development.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The disunion of the parishes, in spite of the querulous objections of those persons, fortunately few, who cannot perceive that the unification of the churches was inevitable, and that nothing can keep us apart, has been welcomed by the majority.</p>
   <p>With the organization of the parishes has come about the establishment of a central committee representing all the parishes of Chicago. This committee will make decisions upon public matters and be able to attain the public cooperation of all the parishes.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the intervention of the Archbishop in the solution of our church community problems has thus far proved very beneficial, and now it is for us to bring about the completion of our church organization.</p>
   <p>It is now the duty of the Central Parish Committee to gain the cooperation of the public in our reorganization.</p>
   <p>Perhaps at present many are asking the question, Was the arrival of the Archbishop needed to compel us to reorganize? The answer to this question is unfortunately Yes, inasmuch as many of the parishes depended entirely upon the Archbishop's aid.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It should be clearly understood, however, that the Archbishop cannot devote all his time and his energy to the solution of Chicago's community problems, and it is now our duty to work in whole-hearted cooperation for the cause. Only by the real and sincere cooperation of us all can our church affairs be rescued from the chaos in which we find them.</p>
   <p>To close one church to save another is the foolish idea of persons who have never studied the affairs of our church communities, and who do not realize that each and every church has its individual obligations, that failure to meet these obligations will force it to close its doors, and that it cannot be saved by an act of unification.</p>
   <p>The only means of salvation is the enrollment of each communicant in the parish district to which his church belongs, and this can be accomplished by the means which the Central Parish Committee deems proper, and the same method of enrollment will be employed by all the parishes. The fruitless experiments that each parish is conducting by itself will not produce the desired result. The method adopted must be quick and precise, for the need is urgent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It is time for the special picnics and dances to stop which have been given to raise funds for church communities, for the expense of conducting these affairs usually exceeds the receipts, and our churches cannot be saved by selling raffle-tickets and by organizing functions to attract crowds but only by public cooperation. New means of raising funds must be devised which shall be proportionate to our present needs and conditions.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Central Parish Committee to take this matter into consideration immediately and not to expect the Archbishop to discover the ways and means of cooperation.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Archbishop has given us the proper start, and upon us depends the perpetuation of this new era of cooperation. The more expeditiously we work to this end, the faster the condition of our church affairs will improve. If we do not continue to apply our efforts, the total responsibility will fall on the directors of the parishes, who probably will not avail themselves of the new state of affairs nor realize the benefits of cooperation.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
