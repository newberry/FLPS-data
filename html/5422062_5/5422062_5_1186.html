   <p>p. 3- Undoubtedly the Greek community of Chicago is very much honored by its president, Dr. G. Papaeliou, and his profession. But it is too bad that the Grecian Aesculapius, in spite of his five years in this country, cannot hold a conversation in English to tell the American people how well he administers the affairs of the community. Besides this he is a very poor mathematician, for when it comes to giving an account of the community's funds, he always experiences great difficulty with figures and numbers. After all, the community cannot expect the learned doctor to be as efficient in figuring as he is in writing prescriptions.</p>
   <p>Of course in regard to the $1,500 shortage in the community's funds he is not to be blamed, for doctoring and figuring are not the same art and profession, but when it comes to his inability to learn English, I think that our good doctor is not to be excused. Since he has lived here for five years and is still unable to use the English language as proficiently as he pushes the pencil, something must be wrong. Maybe I am unfair not to take the doctor's head into consideration. That is, he either has an Albanian head, incapable of learning anything, or his head is dizzy with those bothersome figures. Anyway, our eminent doctor-president is preoccupied with things that a mere publisher does not understand.</p>
