   <p>Six thousand subjects of allied nations, including a great number of Greeks in Chicago, will be refused the right to do business on May 1, according to an act voted upon and passed on by the Municipal Council of Chicago last December.</p>
   <p>By this restriction, it is sought to refuse the issuance of business permits to individuals who are not American citizens, or who have not given evidence of their desire to become citizens. Owners of saloons and manufacturers of beer especially will be subjected to strict control by this decision. Others who will be severely affected are the owners of confectioneries, small restaurants, and other small businesses in foreign neighborhoods and centers. The many bakers of the city will also be severely handicapped by this law.</p>

   <p>In enforcing this law, the city treasurer has prepared 100,000 applications. Applicants for business permits must take an oath on filling out one of these applications. The very first questions asked of those signing these applications will be: Where were you born? Are you an American citizen? If you are not an American citizen, have you filed intentions of becoming a citizen?</p>
