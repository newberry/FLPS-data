   <p>The mission of good will in the second Chicago visit of the Patriarchal Exarch of Corinth, the Rt. Rev. Damaskinos of the Greek Orthodox Church, was successful in healing what promised to be a serious rift in the American branch of that communion. This was announced yesterday by Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, and an opponent of the exarch when he visited Chicago a few weeks ago.</p>
   <p>Lambros declared that peace has come to the Greek Orthodox people of Chicago after the criticism and protest of a considerable group had been made against the prelate. The difficulty arose over the attitude taken by the Exarch in attempting to depose his Grace Alexandros, head of the Orthodox Church in America.</p>

   <p>"Although the Exarch's mission to America originally was that he should become the head of the American Orthodox Church," Lambros said, "he is soon to return to Greece." The Rt. Rev. Athenagoras will become the ecclesiastical head of the Church in America in his place and the present Metropolitan, Alexandros, will become the Metropolitan of Corfu.</p>
   <p>Bishop Philaretos of Chicago will be advanced to a higher episcopal throne in Greece.</p>
