   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are going to read in this column, the details concerning a type of propaganda now being spread among them. These details should cause the hair to rise on the heads of the clergy and the trustees of the churches; but the boards and priests are too busy fighting among themselves to be aware of any important movement going on underneath their very noses.</p>
   <p>Whether or not a bishop is sent to America, the orthodox clergy must form a religious organization which will fight propaganda; that is not only causing disbelief in all of the orthodox precepts, but is even causing people to become neurasthenic and in some cases psychopathic. [Translator's note: No mention is made of the exact form this propaganda takes.] For example, we point out the fate of a well-known Greek doctor in Boston, who, due to the influence of this propaganda, suffered a mental break-down. These propagandists offer no service to the Protestant Church; on the contrary, they only harm the Christian religion and are therefore dangerous influences.</p>
   <p>The Greek people, whether educated or uneducated, have been taught from childhood to believe in saints, colorful ceremonies and the Virgin. When the Greeks hear the speeches of the propagandists--who believe in none of those things--they become confused and do not know what to believe. [Translator's note: I believe that it is the Evangelists that are referred to, because they are still mentioned as an enemy of true Christianity in our churches today.]</p>
   <p>Therefore, we appeal to the Greeks of Chicago and the rest of America to read this column and guard themselves against this propaganda which deprives the individual of spiritual and mental peace...</p>
   
   <p>Hellenes of America, do not read the leaflets and tracts published and left in all public places by these propagandists; [Translator's note: This makes it practically certain that it is in reference to Evangelists, because they spread their propaganda in just such a manner]they demoralize the spirit and ruin the mind. Beware of associating with those individuals or their friends because they will only bring about your downfall.</p>
   <p>These propagandists have been functioning in Chicago for about ten years. They have penetrated our churches, our schools and our homes; but as yet they have not acquired roots, and only a few of our people have become their victims. We will publish the names of these people shortly.</p>
   <p>We appeal to our clergy to make a concerted effort to save these poor fools from themselves. They must convince these people that they are doing no good to the Christian religion and are harming themselves--per-haps without realizing it. They must understand that the people who devote themselves to changing the religion of others, are using low and common methods in order to accomplish their desires, methods that are degrading both to the individual who applies them and to the victim. Our priests have enough evidence to denounce these groups and their churches as harmful to humanity and detrimental to social and moral progress, We have before us the example of Archimandrite Chrysohoidis, who renounced his orthodox teachings and became one of the propagandists; and is today repenting his mistake. Other examples can be presented, but we do not desire to shock or disgust our readers.</p>
   <p>What can this type of propaganda do to help society? Of what benefit is it to Christianity? Why is all this damage to mind and soul allowed to proceed unchecked?</p>
   <p>Therefore, Greeks of Chicago, read this, and future columns similar to it, in order to know the truth about this movement; and by doing so, keep yourselves from becoming victims of it. We will tell you how to recognize the approach used by these propagandists. Beware of those glib-tongued spiritual seducers who seek your downfall.</p>
