   <p>Dear Mr. Mammon:</p>
   <p>On behalf of the Speaker's Bureau in the Seventh Federal Reserve District, I wish to express my sincere appreciation for your unselfish assistance and cooperation during the Third Liberty Loan Drive.</p>
   <p>The part played by speakers in carrying the message of patriotism was of such value, in the distribution of bonds among the people of foreign descent, that no doubt your personal satisfaction should be great in knowing that you have rendered a real service to your country at this time.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Wm. K. Pflaum.</p>
