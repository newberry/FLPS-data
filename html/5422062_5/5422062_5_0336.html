   <p>On a call from the Most Rev. Damaskinos, the presidents of all Greek churches, here, gathered the night before last, at the Hotel LaSalle, and discussed the question of unity and cooperation of communities, and the limitation in the number of churches in Chicago. The writing up of the constitution has been left wholly in the hands of the Most Rev. Damaskinos.</p>
   <p>The decisions taken are of great importance as influencing the improvement of our communities finances which on account of the long waited for decision, are not in any too good condition.</p>
   <p>So, the arrival of the Most Rev. Legate in America will be the cause of not only the settlement of the church question and the establishment of order, but also of the local unity and cooperation of our church organizations, which, due to the long church strife, have antagonized each other with inestimable loss in the community interests.</p>
   <p>The pleasant news, we record with particular satisfaction, because the Greek Daily has for many years carried on the struggle for unity and cooperation and we reserve the right to express our thoughts upon this most important question.</p>
