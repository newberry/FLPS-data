   <p>Germanos Troianos, Archbishop of Sparta, recently appointed Bishop of the Greek Church in America by King Constantine, will be the guest of honor at a banquet served by the Chicago Greek colony to-night.</p>
   <p>The apeakers will be P. Armiriotis, chairman, Greek consul in Chicago, Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell, Attorney John Dritsas, and Peter S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star.</p>
   <p>Greek churches in Chicago a few days ago obtained a temporary injunction from Judge Pam restrainning Bishop Troianos from establishing a new regime here.</p>
   <p>When the Reverend Leon Pigeas, pastor of the Greek Church of the Holy Trinity, <span class="page-break">2</span>1101 South Peoria Street, heard on Sunday that the Bishop would attend the services, he resigned and closed the church, fearing, he said, "trouble and even bloodshed." Judge Pam has given permission to Bishop Troianos to attend the services.</p>
