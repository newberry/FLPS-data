   <p>Last Sunday Reverend John Messarhakes was appointed to officiate temporarily at the church of the Assumption of the Virgin, as the regular pastor Reverend Papanicolaou left for Greece on a vacation trip.</p>
   <p>We hope that the parish will keep this very well educated and eloquent pastor even after the return of their pastor as he will prove a very beneficial and able assistant.</p>
