   <p>The North-Side Greeks held a celebration last Sunday in naming their new church, located at Hollywood and Winthrop Avenues. Present at the ceremony was the Most Rev. Alexander, archbishop of the Greek church in America, Bishop Iokeim of Boston and Bishop Philaretos of Chicago. St. Andreas was the name given to the new Church.</p>
   <p>A symposium was given at the Morrison Hotel by the founders of the church in honor of the Greek hierarchs, at which three hundred participated. A collection was made for the needs of the new church and $10,000. was raised, which added to previous collections makes a total of $40,000. The executive committee asserts that $10,000. more are needed for the normal functioning of the church.</p>
