   <p>You walk down Balsted Street, the "Boulevard of the Balkans," and you'rs in the center of Chicago's "Little Greece." There are other Greek colonies here, compact and apart, but the "Land of the Pantheon" on the near west side is the largest. The one thing that will impress you in "Little Greece" is the "Kaffeneion", or Greek of coffee house. It is the relaxing place of "Messrs. The Passersby." The typical Greek Club.</p>
   <p>Smoke Water Pipe--If You're Man Enough</p>
   <p>Behind the plate glass windows with their Greek inscriptions, you find innumerable men sipping their Greek coffee, smoking their Argilehs, or water pipes, and reading Greek newspapers. Others are deep in discussion of the Greek revolution or a solution of the tangled Balkan situation.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>You enter one of these "clubs". You order your coffee which is thick and brown-made from the pulverized coffee bean. You drink, but not too much, for on the better of the cup is the "mud" or sediment.</p>
   <p>You try the Argileh, if you think you are man enough. A waiter places the bowl at your feet, you take the end of the flexible stem in your mouth and you inhale-a "stomach draw". The smoke passes through water, goes to the bottom of your lungs--and you feel great, or-----</p>
   <p>Real Greek Food At Real Greek Restaurants</p>
   <p>You will find Greek restaurants in this section where you get the real Greek cooking. There is the Pantheon at 515 S. Halsted Street, where you can get your lamb in the various gastronomical phases that the Greeks cook this meat.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>And there is the International down at 705 S. Halsted Street. On your way down to where Hull House stands, you will find at least one restaurant to your liking. Or, if you prefer to eat Greek dishes nearer the Loop, you can go to the Athenian restaurant at 816 N. Dearborn Street, the former Greek-American dishes there, and excellent liquor of the Greek variety.</p>
   <p>Roast Lamb On Open Fire For Greek Easter Fete</p>
   <p>If you were in Chicago's "Little Greece" during the last week-end, you would have seen sights you never would forget. Last Sunday was the Greek Easter, one week later than our Easter.</p>
   <p>Great Easter bread--cakes, with the colored Easter eggs baked right in them, were on sale at the various bakeries. And there were live lambs <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to be bought at almost every step. Every Greek family must have a live lamb for Easter. The entire lamb serves some purpose. The "giblets" are made into a soup, "mageritsa", which has a slightly tart taste. You get soup like this once a year--at Easter.</p>
   <p>There are parades on Friday night preceding Easter, regular torchlight processions. The greatest this year was in the heart of "Little Greece" at Harrison and Halsted Streets, where lines of marchers from two directions assembled.</p>
   <p>On Easter morning, directly after midnight, when the signal that "Christ has risen" is passed, there is a general celebration throughout the Greek colony. The tables are laden with food and fine drink, and everyone rejoices. The ceremonies sometimes last until daybreak.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>ll Greek churches, All Imposing Edifices</p>
   <p>There are 11 Greek orthodox churches in Chicago and all are imposing structures. Chief among them are St. Constantine's, Holy Trinity, St. Nicholas, Church of Holy Assumption, St. George, Evangelism and St. Basil, the latter of which is the seat of the diocese.</p>
   <p>The Greek clergymen of the above churches are: Revs. Demetry, Petrakis, Panagopoulos, Mandilaris, Vainikos, Papanikolas, Paspalakis, Kesses and Golemis.</p>
   <p>The Greeks from all over the city flock to this neighborhood during Easter. It is here, too, that they are able to buy their real Greek foods--and the varieties of Greek bread.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>There is one Greek loaf that has a historical significance which few young Greeks know. This bread is baked in the shape of a huge doughnut, and can be found at the Crete bakery, 523 S. Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Like the old Greek money, which used to have a hole in the money, stands for "the missing part of Greece", and was originated at a time when Greece was not complete as a nation. But you buy that bread right here in Chicago today!</p>
   <p>First Greeks Came From New Orleans</p>
   <p>It is interesting to learn from Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, one of the largest Greek newspapers, published in the United States, that the first Greeks to come to Chicago were a few pioneer traders from New Orleans in the early 40's.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>It is also interesting to know that Mr. Lambros has his editorial offices at 130 N. Wells Street, where he had published his paper for 22 years--now in a Loop office building. It is probably the most compact newspaper office, with a linotype machine and composing room on the fifth floor of the building, that you ever saw.</p>
   <p>Many Settled Here Following Great Fire</p>
   <p>They came back to Chicago with relatives and friends. One of these Greek pioneers died only a few years ago. He was Capt. Nicholas Pappas, who had settled in Kinzie Street, more than 78 years ago.</p>
   <p>Like other nationalities which have helped to build Chicago into the great cosmopolitan city that it is, the Greeks established their real settlement directly after the Chicago fire in 1871.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Many Greeks came here after this disaster, notably among them Constantine Mitchell, who lived in Streeterville and was a friend of old Capt. Streeter; Thomas Combiths, whose son, Frank, later was with J. H. White &amp; Co., at the Fulton market; Constantine Masters, who became one of the best known tailors, and Christ Chacona.</p>
   <p>Many Beautiful Greek Women Here in Chicago</p>
   <p>Christ Chacona was known as the "Columbus of Sparta". He had come here and realizing the possibility of Greek trade in this city after the fire, had retuned to his native Tzintzina, Sparta, and brought back a number of relatives with him. Many became fruit merchants. About 1882 the Greek settlement in Chicago was thriving, and there were nearly 1,000 here but all of them were men.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>So it is not odd that the Greeks revere the name of Mrs. Peter Pooley, the first Greek woman to come here in 1885. Mrs. Pooley, was active in the Greek community and the organizer of a benevolent association for Greeks which kept alive the ideals of the Greek religion.</p>
   <p>But today you see many Greek women. They are the type which inspired the beautiful sculpture of Greece. The type that would even today inspire Praxiteles, the sculptor of the second Attic School, who immortalized the female form.</p>
   <p>You can find these women perhaps in the Tsoukalas Dancing Studio, 218 S. Wabash Avenue, or you might even see them right at the "Delta", center of "Little Greece," at Halsted and Harrison Streets.</p>

   <p>Greek Business Men Quick To Make Headway</p>
   <p>The Greek is mainly a business man. He has been inured through the ages with the idea of keen bargaining, but he always is fair with his competitor...Mr. Lambrose, to quote him again, will tell you the paraphrase of the old Greek adage. He says:</p>
   <p>"The original Greek merchants in Chicago started out in the selling of 'red hots' and 'Hot tamales." But how they have progressed since that time is seen by referring to such successful business men as Raklios Restaurants, Andy's Candies and De-Mets Candies.</p>
   <p>Greek firms flourish in Chicago today. There are: Peppas &amp; Alex, one of the largest restaurant outfitters in the country; Cokins &amp; Co., La Salle Street, investment house: Drexel Ice Cream Co.: Victory Ice Cream. Co.; Rusetos Ice Cream Co.; Kalodimos Bros. Ice Cream Co.; Kakarakis Bros. and Deligiannis Bros., importers, and others.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>It might be of interest to Chicagoans that the Atlas Exchange Bank of Chicago was founded by Greeks.</p>
   <p>Some of the careers of local Greek immigrants are worthy of the pen of Horatio Alger. There is, for instance, the epic of the John Raklios, the "restaurant king," as well as that of Andrew Karzas, impresario of amusement palaces.</p>
   <p>Restaurant Magnate Started With Only $30.</p>
   <p>John Raklios came here in 1900, with only $30. He started out as a fruit merchant in an office building. Later he bought an interest in a restaurant near State and Harrison Street. Today, he is the head of a chain of restaurants with leaseholds in Chicago, exceeding $15,000,000.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Andrew Karzas had as remarkable a career, showing the opportunities that Chicago offered the young immigrant. He once owned a news stand at Cottage Grove Avenue and 63rd Street, just one block from the place where his great Trianon ballroom now stands. Chicago Greeks boast, several hundred Greek doctors, lawyers and dentists. They also have many prominent people in the realm of art.</p>
   <p>So it does not mean that when you take your trip down the "Boulevard of the Balkans" that you meet in the "showpieces" in the windows of the Greek Kaffeneions, the real Greeks of the city. They are only our coming citizens.</p>
   <p>Following are some favorite Greek dishes that were listed on the menu of the Athenian Cafe, 216 N. Dearborn Street.</p>
