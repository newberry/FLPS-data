   <p>p. 2- In order to bring relatives to America, one must know these rules.</p>
   <p>First, they must be equipped with American certificates and a copy of their first or second citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>Second, the Greek emigration law permits any Greek citizen to emigrate except those who are fourteen years old or older and have not yet performed military service. In many cases even these may emigrate, provided that they bond themselves.</p>
   <p>Third, the Greek emigration law requires that women and children under sixteen years of age not escorted by adult male relatives shall be equipped with certificates from a Greek Consulate in America.</p>
   
   <p>Certificates from a Greek Consulate are not requisite for Greek refugees nor for adult male Greek citizens nor for Greek women and children accompanied by adult male relatives.</p>
   <p>The Greek Consular certificates cost $18.75 for free Greek citizens. Greek refugees do not need certificates, but if they desire Greek certificates they should not pay more that $3.90 each since Greek Consuls issue certificates to Greek refugees for this reduced fee.</p>
   <p>Many profiteers collect $18.75 each from refugees and pay the Greek Consul only $3.90.</p>
   <p>American citizens pay only $3.90 for a certificate from a Greek Consul. Greek citizens who pay $18.75 must also demand naturalization certificates of those to whom they pay the above mentioned fee and they themselves should send these certificates to Greece.</p>
   
   <p>Some persons collect $18.75 or $3.90 and promise to relieve those who pay for the certificates of the trouble of sending them, and then many times they fail to send the certificates bought for a refugee citizen although they have collected $3.90; many times also they collect $18.75 and deceive the Consul by asking for a refugee's certificate paying only $3.90 and thereafter erasing the name and the birth place of a free Greek citizen.</p>
   <p>In this way they deprive the Consulate of $14.85 and they likewise deprive the citizen of his three years naturalization certificate. If a citizen who has been thus defrauded requires the services of the Consulate, he has to pay another fee of $18.75 whereas if he had the naturalization certificate for which he has paid, no second payment would be required.</p>
   <p>The American certificates are good for only six months. Those who acquired their certificates prior to December 7, 1922, must get new certificates and send them to Greece to be forwarded to the nearest American Consul.</p>
