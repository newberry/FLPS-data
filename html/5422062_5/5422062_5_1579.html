   <p>No Greek who comes to America ever intends to establish himself here. He comes with the fixed purpose of acquiring a certain amount of money and then returning to his family and his beloved birthplace. For a long time he clings to that idea. American habits and customs, American greatness and idealism for some time have no influence upon him. These wonderful things in the New World may be all right, but his purpose remains unchanged; he is going back to his Greece.</p>
   <p>He looks with contempt upon other immigrants who immediately after arriving apply for naturalization papers, renounce their native lands, and embrace a new country ofwhich they know nothing, according to his reasoning at least. Not for him! He is a Greek and would remain a Greek even if this country was Adam and Eve's Paradise.</p>
   
   <p>He likes the country's wealth, and he came here to get as much of it as he could. He admires and respects America's freedom and justice, but to become any-thing else than Greek is for him, absolutely inconceivable. To throw off his nationality as easily as he takes off his shirt is not in his make-up. People who do not have no solid foundation of patriotism. The Greek has remained Greek the world over. Greeks have gone through fire and water, through slavery and annihilations. Their tongues have been cut out because they defied tyrants and spoke Greek where it was prohibited, but they have remained Greeks. Their divine religion, their divine languages, and their divine love for Mother - Greece have pulled the race through. Oceans of Greek blood shed, untold suffering and sorrow, crucifixion and hanging of ministers of the Greek Church have not changed the Greek.</p>
   <p>But America the great, America the universal for the first time in the history of the Greek race has accomplished the impossibility of yesterday; that is, Greeks are becoming Americans. They are becoming Americans not only through naturalization but also through devotion and love for what America stands for, - liberty, equality, and justice for all. These things have changed the mind of the unalterable Greek. After slow but careful examination he discovers that no other country on earth is so truly and solidly founded on these three divine principles, - liberty, equality, and justice for all, - as America is. The Greek intractability is swept away by the true universal brotherhood of American idealism.</p>
   
   <p>His fixity of purpose, his tenacity, and his dreams of going back to Greece to live there for the rest of his natural life are things of the past. Thousands of Greeks are already established here. Thousands will follow suit. And the Greece of America in years to come will shine over the horizon as ancient Greece did. Patriotism will distinguish the American Greeks among all the other integral parts of which this universal country is composed.</p>
   <p>Patriotism is the sacred duty of Greeks in America. Devotion, faithfulness, love, and self-sacrifice are the elements of which patriotism is molded. The Greek's patriotism for America must be as sacred as the Greek's patriotism for Greece. The sun may change its course but America will never attack Greece, nor vice versa. Mother - Greece therefore should be considered as one state of this glorified Union. That is the only way to look at the thing. That is the only way in which our patriotism for America can be true and solid. That is the only way in which the American Greek can preserve his indentity; namely, to consider Greece as a spiritual state of this Union and America as the whole ideal state which includes Greece. But patriotism cannot be bought in the market, nor can it be acquired in universities; colleges, or any other institutions of learning, nor is there any power which can invest people in it as in a garment. Patriotism must be in the blood of the individual, a substance within the man. Patriotism must be in the heart, in the brain, in the soul, and in the whole body.</p>
   
   <p>It calls for personal sacrifice: There is no other duty holier than the duty to our country. And there is no room left in the individual's heart for any conflicting emotion when patriotism is in the blood. We Greeks in America now must do for our descendants what our ancestors did for us; we must lay the foundations of patriotism for our Greek-American generations to come. Patriotism must continue to exist in the blood and not on the surface. Future Greek-American generations which will constitute the new Greece of America must be prepared for now. The patriotism of the individual begins in the cradle and endures till death, but the embryo of patriotism must be cultivated and nourished before birth. Therefore it is the task and the duty of the Greeks in America to instill patriotism now in the embryo of future Greek-American generations. And by so ding not only shall we do ourduty to our adopted country, but we shall also automatically assist Mother-Greece. If Greece is to be considered as a state of this glorious United States, Greece must be remembered and loved by coming generations and this can be brought about by these three agencies: the Greek Church, Greek patriotic organizations, and the Greek press.</p>
   <p>The little Greece of America is composed of Greeks from every sections of Greek territory, liberated and unliberated, and of Greeks from various parts of the world which are not Greek. No country on earth except America has so large a number of Greeks from Turkey, Roumania, Macedonia, Thrace, Epirus, the Archipelago, Asia Minor, Egypt, Africa, Russia, England, India, and many other parts of the globe, - all these in addition to Greeks from every part of Greece.</p>
   
   <p>This variegated mass of Greeks is composed of Christians of the Greek Orthodox Church, that sublime edifice of Christ, and these Greek Christians are likewise spiritual and emotional subjects of Mother - Greece. Their traditions, habits, and customs differ, as well as the national and racial currents of their thought; nevertheless they are truly and solidly brother-Greeks in their own particular ways.</p>
   <p>Chicago's Greek community, composed of fellow-Greeks from all the above-mentioned countries and territories, enjoys the honor of having established the first Greek Orthodox church in the New World. This Chicago church is the first Greek Christian edifice to shelter so variegated a mass of Greeks in perfect religious unity and concord. This is of tremendous importance. One meets there his fellow-Greeks from all parts of the world, shakes their hands, and becomes interested in their affairs. Greeks from unliberated territory talk of the sufferings and the sorrows of their brothers and sisters who still live in these unredeemed Greek lands. That arouses Greek patriotism and sympathy, and this awakening is followed by united Greek action in behalf of those unfortunate compatriots and in behalf of all Greece. United thought and united action bring benefit to all concerned.</p>
   <p>All these various Greek elements are united under the spiritual ministration of the Greek Church; all are instructed in the importance of patriotism; and all enjoy the blessings of freedom, equality, and justice under the protection of the American flag, the flag which is tolerant of the Greek Church and of all religious faiths. The life of the Greek Church in America depends upon future generations of Greek. Americans, not of generations of Greeks. It is therefore one of the paramount duties of the Church to perpetuate patriotism for America in the blood of coming generations and to inculcate in them the ideas of love, devotion, and self-sacrifice for the country that gives us liberty, equality, and justice. But being true, devoted, and faithful to America the present and the future generations automatically assist the cause of Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>The second factor in keeping patriotism alive in the blood of the individual is the patriotic societies. Greeks in Chicago and everywhere in America must form patriotic organizations to keep the fire burning in the present generation and to transmit deep-rooted patriotic feeling to those who will come after us. Future Greek-American generation must be the foremost patriots among all the elements which compose this great democratic and philauthropic country. Patriotic societies will erect Greek schools to instruct the youngsters in the divinity of the Greek language and in the traditions and the achievements of the Greek race. The schools in conjunction with the Church will teach the children that they are descendants of a glorious nation and live in the most glorious country in all the world, and that it is their imperative duty to glorify themselves as offspring and natives of these two outstanding countries.</p>
   <p>The Greek press in America is the third factor in keeping patriotism alive in the blood of the Greek race in the United States. Service to the Greek race should be the purpose of the Greek newspapers in America. This service must be honest, true, and loyal, and its effect will be far-reaching and tremendous. Not only America will be benefited by it but Mother-Greece as well. Religious and patriotic articles printed in the Greek press are bound to uplift the moral tone of the present generation and to mold the plastic mind of future generations. The heavenly beauty of the Greek language must be kept before the eyes of living Greek-Americans and of those not yet born. Communities and individuals must be rebuked when they stray from the path of righteousness. For the sake of material gain we are likely to forget our duty to our country and to Mother-Greece. Some kinds of religious agitation and some destructive pacifist propaganda now prevalent may becloud the minds of present and future generations in regard to patriotism. But the press in conjunction with the Church and the patriotic societies must keep a vigilant eye over Greek communities that all these forces antagonistic to patriotism and this disguised monster of pacifism may not affect the traditional principle of the Greek race, the principle of patriotism.</p>
   <p>The life of the Greek press in America also depends upon future Greek-American generations. Therefore its work for the Greek race is automatically a work of self-preservations. Indeed, honest and faithful service to the Greek communities in America is the salvation of the Church and of the press and will effect the perpetuation of our race.</p>
   <p>The Greek race in America, when it is well established, and if patriotism remains in its blood, will stand out as a patriotic example for others to follow and imitate. Little Greece in America will play a big role in years to come.</p>
   <p>The formation of patriotic societies should be undertaken at once. Prominent Greek-Americans should devote a part of their time to organizing these societies, not only by cities but everywhere. The Star is ready and willing to assist any group of our fellow-Greeks anywhere in the United States to form these patriotic organizations.</p>
   <p>Let us begin now. Let us be united for our own good, for the good of our adopted country, and for Mother-Greece.</p>
