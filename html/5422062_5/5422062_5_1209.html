   <p>p. 1--To our request published in Proodos last week for news from our readers we have not had enough replies with items of interest to the general public.</p>
   <p>We do not believe that our readers thought that they were expected to pay for the publication of their news. Of course they are not. The only expense is three cents for postage. (You know that last July the letter-postage was increased from two cents to three cents.)</p>
   <p>The receipt of social news through the mail to be published free of charge saves our going after the news or maintaining a staff of reporters and also benefits the children and the adults who report the news to us, and we are grateful to them besides. So we beg once more that you will let us hear from you with your news.</p>

   <p>The Picnic of Thermopylae and Gorgo Gapa Lodges</p>
   <p>p. 1. The third annual picnic of Thermopylae and Gorgo Gapa Lodges in Paul's Grove was a great success and left indelible memories in the hearts of all who attended.</p>
   <p>The fine weather and the painstaking preparations of the indefatigable committee on arrangements, George Delahanes, Anast. Markakes, and Vasilike Bonsiou, combined with the fraternity's genuine spirit of brotherhood, were the reasons for this success.</p>
   <p>The attendance was increased by the presence of the members of Aeschylus Lodge of Gary, Indiana, who came over in a body a hundred and fifty strong. Their band composed of youthful members of the Lodge, was the life of the picnic.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The guests listened to addresses made by various brothers, and it was announced that the Gary lodge's picnic will take place on August 21, and that of Navarinon and Hestia Lodges on August 28.</p>
