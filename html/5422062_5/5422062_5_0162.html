   <p>D. Sakellariou, the priest of St. James Church is one of those few people that believe that the poor must eat. And so he has gathered together various foods and brought them to the church. He quietly summoned several of the poor families in the neighborhood and gave them enough food for several days. That is a good Christian deed.</p>
