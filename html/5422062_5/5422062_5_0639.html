   <p>p. 1. The ecclesiastical affairs of the Greek churches in America, and the litigations of the various communities before the Bar of Justice, became a very painful wound to the Mother Church. The idea of terminating the ecclesiastical anarchy in America has become a reality now. High dignitaries of the church, in collaboration with the Greek government, submitted a request to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Faith that it act to terminate the anarchy of the Greek church in America. His Holiness, the Ecumenical Patriarch, at a full session of the Holy Synod, granted the request, appointing the Metropolitan of Saloniki, Mr. Gennadios, legate of the Grand Church, and Plenipotentiary Extraordinary of Orthodoxy, to go to America and restore peace to the litigans, counsel the clergy, and elevate the solemnity and dignity of the Church to its former state.</p>
