   <p>The Greek Post of the American Legion is working in cooperation with the United States Government. The Government is going to give every ex-soldier a medallion as a remembrance of the Great War. The Greek Post has organized a committee for the purpose of aiding the Greek soldiers to receive their medallion.</p>
   <p>All the Greek ex-soldiers are requested to bring their discharge papers to the president of the committee, Mr. N. Peppan, at 174 West Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary that you be members of the American Legion.</p>
   <p>This is an opportunity to get your medallions without delay.</p>
