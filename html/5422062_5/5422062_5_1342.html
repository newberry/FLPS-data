   <p>Dear Mr. Pantelis:</p>
   <p>I have notified the Custodian of the Lincoln Tomb that the Sons of Pericles will be there on the afternoon of Sunday, June twenty-eighth. He will be expecting the delegation. If you will let me know about what time they will be there, I will give him that information also.</p>
   <p>I suppose you have already made arrangements to secure a wreath here in town. If not, I should be very glad to take care of that for you.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Paul M. Angle.</p>
