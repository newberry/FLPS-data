   <p>p. 5.- Last Saturday, the women of St Basil Church visited the Hines Soldier's Hospital, which carries the names of many Greeks of our city on its list of patients.</p>
   <p>The ladies were laden with cigarettes, fruits, candies, etc., to distribute to these men who served and were wounded in our World War.</p>
   <p>Among the Greeks were Sam Louis, P. Derveris, K. Saunders (Siountris), P. Rigas, J. Tzanetis and K. Bellas. They heartily thanked the kindly disposed women for their gifts and for their visit. They asked them to come again soon.</p>
