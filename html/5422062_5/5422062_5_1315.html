   <p>p. 1- In previous publications Loxias has urged the Greeks of Chicago and elsewhere to form their volunteer regiments and enlist in the army of our new mother, the United States of America.</p>
   <p>We now repeat our request because of an article of Hon. Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, published in the Greek dailies of New York, inviting Greeks to join the U. S. Navy. The honor is great. There is no time to lose. Greeks all over the land must accept the honorable invitation. And those who prefer they army must not wait to be the last to join it; they must be first.</p>
   <p>By fighting under the American flag, which is the greatest of honors, you automatically fight for and protect our Mother Greece. Greece is about ready now to join the Allies. Your enlistment in the U. S. Army is more strength and power to poor Greece. Do not wait to fall in line; be at the head of it. Join first and honor the name of your new country and your native land.</p>
