   <p>p. 3.- The Greek clergy in Chicago in unison with all the Greek communities, sent an appeal to the Tribunal of the Diocese, which governs North and South America, pointing out Chicago as the proper place to hold the Ecclesiastical convention.</p>
   <p>Chicago, owing to its geographical position, and due to the fact that it has more churches, and also the largest Greek community, is the most suitable place for all concerned for the congress. We wish and hope, that the Archbishop would take in consideration all the above reasons and honor our city with the forthcoming convention. Nevertheless, if his decision is otherwise, we shall respectfully abide by and solemly accept it.</p>
