   <p>p. 1- Many people are inquiring, especially in recent telegraphic communications from Athens: What is the present condition of Greek-American ecclesiastical affairs?</p>
   <p>This is a perfectly legitimate inquiry, now that Mr. Simopoulos has returned from Greece, for it is well known that he went to Athens to discuss the affairs of the Church, and people are impatient to hear from the ambassador what the result of the discussions was, and what decisions were made about solving the church problem.</p>
   <p>We wrote some time ago, in accordance with information received from Greece, the accuracy of which we have not the slightest reason to doubt, that the opinion of the Greek Government had prevailed, and that consequently the Holy Synod of Greece would send a legate here to whose <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>jurisdiction the churches of America would submit. This information has been verified by the latest telegraphic intelligence, which is more specific in its information that the Minister of the Church and Education and the Metropolitan of Athens have conferred and have agreed to send a legate from the Holy Synod to America for the purpose of reorganizing the paralyzed Greek churches of America. But this information, however confident we may be that it is reliable, is open to doubt as long as it is not officially promulgated.</p>
   <p>In consequence we believe that it is about time for Ambassador Simopoulos to break his silence and come forward with a statement to America's highly interested Hellenism, thereby satisfying the legitimate desires of those who expect an official statement from the mouth of the official representative of the Greek Government, an absolutely reliable source of information.</p>
   <p>We should like to state here that Mr. Simopoulos in the past has appeared to be willing enough to issue statements on all subjects and has responded promptly when energetic action has been required, and all this stands in strong contrast to his present persistent silence.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>However, we know well enough that the appointment of a legate from the Synod will take place after the return of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michalakopoulos, to Athens, and it is highly probable that Mr. Simopoulos is postponing the disclosure of what information he has until he is in the more advantageous position of having facts to bear out whatever he has to say to America's Hellenism.</p>
   <p>As for us, we shall rely on the information which we originally received relating to the submission of the Greek churches in America to the ecclesiastical administration of the Holy Synod of Greece and the dispatch by the Holy Synod of a legate to America. We are sure that little time will elapse before this information is officially verified by the representative of the Greek Government.</p>
