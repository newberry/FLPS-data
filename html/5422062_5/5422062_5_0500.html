   <p>Last night the young ladies of the Nea Genea gave us a wonderful dance. The unusualness of the dance made us all glad.</p>
   <p>The beautiful park, the decorated hall, the warm evening, the moon, the stars, the beauty, the joy and happiness surrounding everyone,--all these made it an evening that will not be forgotten for a long time.</p>
   <p>The young ladies of the Nea Genea have a right to be proud of their affair because of its enormous success.</p>
