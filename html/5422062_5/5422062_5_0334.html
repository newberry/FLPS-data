   <p>p. 5 Those who did not attend Holy Trinity Church last Sunday missed something they will regret all their lives. Their only chance will be to hear Metropolitan Damaskinos if he speaks again at some other church.</p>
   <p>The Holy Trinity, Chicago's oldest Greek Church, could always gather crowds, but the vast throng which attended last Sunday was unparalleled by any other such ecclesiastical affair. It shows that no matter what people may say, the Greeks of Chicago can get together and support their churches if they want to.</p>
   <p>One has to hear and see the partriarchol Metropolitan Corinthian Damaskinos in order to realize his power and his charm. No words can describe him. After the mass all hastened to receive the blessings of his Holiness.</p>
