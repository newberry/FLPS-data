   <p>p. 1.- The mystery of the four hierarchs' arrival in Chicago has begun to be revealed.</p>
   <p>The great and unprecedented events in the annals of Chicago that dramatically took place Sunday, Oct. 7th, will remain historic. The chronologists of the church will occupy themselves with them for some time, and undoubtedly the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the church of Greece will take action as soon as they are informed about what has taken place in the anonymous church of the North Side, whose pastor happens to be Mr. C. Demitres. We have no doubt, besides, that the latter is the one who laid out the grand schemes for the execution of which four hierarchs were gathered here to disgrace Greek religion.</p>
   <p>Such momentous events cannot be described briefly, we just give a hint in the way of introduction reserving our time for full exposure of undreamed events, the importance of which have involved this city, the four props of our Ecclesiastical structure.</p>

   <p>Our readers know that a year or more ago it was decided to add another church to our community. For this purpose a Masonic Temple was bought, on the North Side at Winthrop avenue and which, off hand, was changed into an Orthodox church. Despite the fact that for one year, now, holy rites have been going on there, the church has remained un-named, and many were the rumors spread regarding it; rumors to the effect that it was to be dedicated to an "unknown God", to "Baal", and so on, were circulating.</p>
   <p>Finally, the mystery was revealed yesterday, in the presence of the four Hierarchs, Archbishop Rodostolou, Bishops Philaretos of Chicago, Ioakim of Boston and Kallistos of San Francisco, Consul General of Greece Mr. De-Pasta, and a multitude of pious Christians.</p>
   <p>If the name was to be given in some conventional, or traditional manner, it would have been acceptable, but, listen, an election was held and St. Andrew won, while Our Savior Jesus Christ ran second. Details will be given in the next issue.</p>
