   <p>Sunday before last a dance was given at the Sherman Hotel by the girls from the "Greek Society" of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Besides a very good orchestra composed of many instruments, there was a very appetizing buffet at the disposal of those who were dancing.</p>
   <p>From this affair the collections were very satisfactory. It is true that these girls work hard each year, so their affair will turn out to be successful. Therefore, these girls deserve hearty congratulations.</p>
