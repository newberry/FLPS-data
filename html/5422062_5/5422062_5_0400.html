   <p>A large"Bravo" should be extended to all the Greek men and women who were to the Nea Genea dance given last Monday. Although this annual dance has always been a success, we never expected such a huge crowd. They poured into the Trianon from all parts of the city. Despite the huge throng everybody had a good time. We congratulate the young ladies for this splendid event.</p>
