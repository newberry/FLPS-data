   <p>p. 3 - The now-and-then president of the Greek community, Dr. Papaeliou, is negotiating to buy a lot to build a new church. The community is antagonistic to the unwanted president, who was thrown back upon its shoulders by a court decision and objects to his plans.</p>
   <p>For that reason, forty prominent Greeks of our community held a meeting last week and disapproved of the acts and doings of Dr. Papaeliou. In order to put a stop to his fantastic schemes, they raised money among themselves, and a new church was established.</p>
   <p>The contributions among the forty amounted to $1,800. A committee was appointed to raise funds among Greek businessmen who do not approve of Dr. Papaeliou's squandering.</p>
