   <p>p. 2.- As is known, three delegates will meet this week and clear up all difficulties in our communal problem. We have not succeeded in getting the names of the officers on the North and South Sides as yet. On the West Side they have C. Petroulas, president; G. Papaeliou, doctor and advisor; S. Sourapas, treasurer; and J. Kominakos, advisor. Loxias wants to assure the public of the patriotic, democratic, honest, esteemable characters of these men from whom we expect the best.</p>
