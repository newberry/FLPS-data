   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have shown to their Archbishop the utmost devotion and reverence during his short stay here.</p>
   <p>The hotel in which he stayed was crowded from early morning till late into the night by people who went there to express their sentiments.</p>
   <p>His first holy mass, administered at St. Basil's Church, was attended by thousands who went to see him and to hear his mellifluous speech.</p>
   <p>And his preaching has held the congregation spellbound for an hour. His was not religious preaching only, for it touched the chords of patriotism in the hearts of his listeners. Archbishop Athenagoras feels deeply that for the Greek, religion and fatherland are inseparably bound together, and that patriotic sentiment must be invigorated in order to preserve our language and religion abroad.</p>
   
   <p>The general impression formed by all who have seen and heard him is that there is no longer any doubt that under the spiritual guidance of such a hierarch Hellenism in America will speedily become a great national power.</p>
