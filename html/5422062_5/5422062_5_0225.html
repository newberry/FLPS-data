   <p>Greek Chicago, at last, has got within its own fold its ecclesiastical leader, and in spite of the fact that for reasons unknown his arrival has been kept secret by the priests and the presidents of the community, who composed the reception committee, our countrymen hastened as a body to express to him their reverence, visiting him at the Hotel La Salle, where he is staying and which is overflowing with clergy and laymen from morning till late at night.</p>
   <p>This time, Archbishop Athenagoras does not come to Chicago simply to see his flock and leave, as he did on his first visit of a few days only, but to stay for a long time in our community and so to become intimately acquainted with Greek Chicago, in whose cooperation and patriotic feelings lie so many hopes.</p>
   <p>"I shall stay long in Chicago," was the first information given to us, "and from next week on, I shall have the work of our communal reconstruction of this great colony started, with the cooperation of all communal leaders.</p>
   
   <p>I shall apprise you all of the preliminary work done in New York, and in a short time I will have a convention of all Greek communities in America called to have this work approved of by the whole Greek populace of America.</p>
   <p>"One of my first concerns is our school reorganization, and to this end conferences with teachers will be called, the first of which I shall hold this week in Chicago to lay down the basis of our school reorganization, which is excellent at this moment, so as to have our schools operate on the basis of our new educational system on their opening.</p>
   <p>"Concerning the community organization of Chicago, I wish to inform you that it will be done according to the needs of the colony and in cooperation with the community councils. And in regard to the rumored closing of certain churches, the truth is that I have only heard opinions and have expressed no opinion of mine upon it. On the other hand, it is useless to assure you that these questions I consider to be of a purely community nature, and consequently it would be impossible for me to decide single-handed without the consent of the factors involved in the community.</p>
   
   <p>- "Nor am I thinking of going a single iota astray from the administrative system of our Orthodox Church, which has proved to be the most perfect. For the Protestant churches, on one hand, caused the clergy to recede from administrative functions, and the Catholic churches, on the other, caused the laymen to draw back, while the Orthodox Church has the mixed system of cooperation of clergy and laymen.</p>
   <p>- "These facts are what I had to state concerning all that has been published re: thoughts exchanged with the clergy of Chicago, and I ask you in addition kindly to announce that I desire, above all, to hear the opinions of all for the reorganization of the great Greek colony of Chicago, whose patriotic feelings I have known from afar and have perceived at close quarters."</p>
   <p>This conversation with the Right Reverend Archbishop we considered it our duty to publish in order to make it known to all that only with the cooperation of the people will the Archbishop take up all matters of our community as well as of all Greek communities of America, and on the cooperation of the people he is basing all his hopes for the school and community reorganization of the Greek people of America.</p>
