   <p>A sumptuous dinner was given last Sunday in the Pantheon Restaurant by the Cretan Society. It was held in honor of the Cretans who fought in the World War.</p>
   <p>.....the president of the Society, Dr. John Volikos, thanked the assembled guests with tears of emotion in his eyes, and congratulated the heroic men who had fought for freedom. He then introduced Mr. C. Palaeologos who said, "My joy is great for three reasons. First, because I consider all of you as my brothers since we all have the same mother--Greece.....Secondly, because as a member of this Society, I have the privilege of being the friend of these brave men who carry on the traditions of their gloriously brave ancestors....Thirdly, because I was born on a sister-island of Crete, and have the same background as all of you assembled here.....</p>
