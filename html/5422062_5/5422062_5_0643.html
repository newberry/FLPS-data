   <p>The dance given last Sunday at the Sherman Hotel by the Greeks of the West Side, for the benefit of the church and school, the Assumption of Virgin Mary, was attended by 2,000 Greek-Americans.</p>
   <p>Each of the participants wore a red rose, given gratis by beautiful Greek maidens attired in national costumes. The beautification of the great hall, bedecked by cut flowers of every description, the tinted reflections of the lights, the smiling faces of all, the ever present youth, and the tantalizing music, presented an aspect of splendor that even the minions of the Sherman House stood aghast.</p>
   <p>About 11 o'clock, Mr. K. Paleologos, in a brilliant and oratoric speech, brought out the potentialities of our present day endeavors and sacrifices in building up churches and schools. The dance and hilarity proceeded to the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>P.S. Dear Greeks, a few more dances of this kind and we will have churches and schools in every part of the city.</p>
