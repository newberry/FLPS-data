   <p>The installation of the new officers of the four chapters of the Sons of Pericles took place at the Trianon, last Monday.</p>
   <p>The 5,000 people who came to witness the ceremony of the installation were swept off their feet by the procedure of the event. The Sons of Pericles, for months in advance, had been trained and prepared by the local committees for the presentation of their program.</p>
   <p>Although most of the "Sons" originally knew very little of the Greek language, nevertheless, the preparation and training they received before the event, enabled them to present the program in the Greek tongue, to the astonishment of the entire audience. The questions and answers of the "Sons" were made in pure Greek with great fluency and facility. The program was distinguished for its patriotic, religious, and political topics. The audience for one-half hour was agog. The joy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the participants was so heightened that the dance, which took place right after the installation, was extended one hour longer than the fixed time for the celebration.</p>
   <p>The four chapters of the Sons of Pericles are Lord Byron, Ypsilanti, Garfield, and the Greek Center.</p>
