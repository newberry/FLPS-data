   <p>The Greek movement in Chicago has been very much in evidence this past week. Conventions, banquets, dances, arrivals and departures--all have taken place. One of the highlights is the arrival of His Holiness, the Patriarchal Legate, who his public appearance last Sunday.</p>
   <p>From the pages of The Greek Press and Saloniki, the Greek population was informed that His Holiness would say mass at St. Basil Church (Agiou Basiliou). Although the Mitropolitis Damaskinos arrived promptly at 10 o'clock, thousands of Orthodox Greeks had been waiting patiently since early morning to see him.</p>
   <p>Mass was said by the Patriarchal Legate, Bishop Philaretos of Chicago, and fifteen priests of the various churches. After the church services, His Holiness addressed the congregation with a deeply affecting speech. Bishop Philareto also spoke. His Holiness blessed the Greek churches in Chicago for carrying on our Orthodox religion in the foreign land.</p>
