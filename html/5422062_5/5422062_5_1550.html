   <p>In the mail that has just arrived from abroad we noticed that the Greek Government has appropriated a special credit of $25,000 to be used for the purpose of returning Greek immigrants in the United States and in other foreign lands to the homeland.</p>
   <p>According to the information which The Greek Star had published some time ago and according to a special bulletin recently issued by the Greek Foreign Office, thousands of Greeks who have been in America but a few months or a year or two are wandering through the streets of Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston in a pitiful state of hunger, sleeplessness, and desperation because of lack of work.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star and the Greek Community of Chicago are vitally concerned with the <span class="page-break">2</span>important immigrant question, which is so closely connected with the unemployment situation in our community as well as with almost all the aspects of our national life in this great commercial and industrial American metropolis.</p>
   <p>The actions and decisions of the Greek Government in regard to the status and future disposition of the Greek immigrant of America will immediately affect the interests and attract the eager attention of the Greeks of Chicago. We are informed that the government of the homeland has asked Mr. Moraitis, the general manager of the Greek-American Transatlantic Steamship Company, to put a ship at the disposal of the Greek immigration authorities for the purpose of returning to Greece those immigrants already in America who are destitute and who are leading a miserable existence in a strange land, itself beset by many economic and labor difficulties. The Greek Government made this fine gesture after lengthy debates and questionings in the Greek Deputy Chamber. During those discussions, a dark picture was painted of the living and working conditions of the Greek immigrant in the United States. Mention was made of <span class="page-break">3</span>the hardships and sufferings which the newly arriving immigrant to America undergoes, and of the indescribable obstacles and unfavorable circumstances which he has to overcome in searching for some kind of work and support in a new, strange, and oftentimes inhospitable land.</p>
   <p>The concern of the Greek Government for its native sons who are leaving, or who are now living in, foreign countries must be highly praised. It proves that our homeland is interested in the welfare of those courageous and enterprising immigrants of ours who seek economic security and opportunities abroad with the ultimate hope of returning to their families and native towns after they have saved a few hundred or a few thousand dollars. It is very encouraging indeed to think that the Greek Government follows the progress and welfare of the Greek immigrant at all times. The problems of the Greek immigrant are also the problems of the Greek Government. Thus far, the Greek diplomatic and consular authorities in America have done all in their power to help the Greek immigrant in every possible way; they have protected our rights and have <span class="page-break">4</span>appealed to the American Government whenever the Greek was unfairly treated or discriminated against because of racial hatred and prejudice.</p>
   <p>The return of numerous immigrants who have been coming to America by the thousands every month will certainly relieve the terrific strain which the great wave of European immigration has been causing in the economic, social, industrial, and labor spheres of American life. The tide of immigration has now reached its zenith. We hope that the present difficulties in labor, business, and industry, which are to a very great extent the outcome of the high rate of immigration to the United States, will discourage those who may desire to emigrate to America. Thus, they will remain in their homelands working and getting along better there among their families, relatives, and friends, rather than working hard in a foreign land where they are subjecting themselves to many perils: first, because they are unable to speak English; second, because of the difficulties encountered in seeking employment due to the fact that most Greeks are unskilled laborers; third, on account of the <span class="page-break">5</span>serious decrease in labor demand; and fourth, because the great influx of European immigrants has aggravated rather than ameliorated general economic and industrial conditions in the United States.</p>
   <p>Those Greek immigrants who are being repatriated would perform the greatest service to our people in the homeland if they would inform the latter of the economic difficulties which will be met in America and of the many disappointments and hardships which were experienced by thousands who have returned home or who are about to do so. It would be well to tell those who have been seized by the widespread mania to become rich quick and amass great wealth by going to America that their golden hopes will very quickly prove to be just so many empty dreams and futile ambitions.</p>
   <p>We have found that it is difficult to convince those fellow countrymen of ours in Greece who are eager to improve their fortunes by coming to America. Some of them think that emigration is discouraged merely because a few people <span class="page-break">6</span>believe that it should be discouraged. They fail to see that the mass exodus of young Greeks threatens to destroy our homeland economically, commercially, and in every other way.</p>
   <p>In addition to the Greek Government, other European governments, especially Italy, have taken similar measures to recall their subjects who have not been able to gain economic sufficiency and security in America. These governments have sent numerous official bulletins to their nationals both at home and in foreign lands informing them that emigration at the present time is not advisable and is not profitable for many well-known reasons.</p>
   <p>It has been proved that our homeland is able to provide enough food for many more than its present small population. There is considerable evidence of economic, agricultural, and industrial progress and opportunities in Greece which can be profitably exploited by those Greeks who despair of their homeland and are overtaken by the desire to make millions in America. Many of us <span class="page-break">7</span>can live happily and prosperously in Greece. Let us not be lured by the fantastic riches of America. In order to amass even a small amount of money, hard work and much sweat are required. Ask most of the Greeks who have established themselves in Chicago or in other American cities and they will tell you how they succeeded in opening up some sort of business and how long and hard they worked in order to win what they have. Many of them regret that they came to America, but most of them will assure you that success in America is won only by hard work, only by superhuman sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Those who want to emigrate to this country may well consider our advice. They must learn that America is not a running Pactolus of gold.</p>
