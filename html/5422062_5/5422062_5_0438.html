   <p>The Greek diocese in Chicago for a long time has aspired to the acquisition of a Greek cemetery. This desire has been gratified and the Greek communities of Chicago have a Greek Orthodox cemetery. It is bought for $100,000. and composed of eighty acres, situated fifteen miles west of Chicago on Wolf Road between Lake St. and Grand Ave. It is now at the disposal of the Greek masses.</p>
   <p>The center of the cemetery will be beautified by the erection of a Church of Byzantine rhythm, at a cost of $50,000.</p>
   <p>The cemetery is divided into 10,000 lots, and will contain 80,000 graves. Near and around the proposed church are the burial places of our priests and members of their families, on another part of the ground plot, 1,500 burial places are dedicated to paupers of our communities.</p>
   
   <p>Part of the gains of the cemetery will be deposited in trust as a perpetual care fund.</p>
   <p>The above sketch in the picture shows the magnificence and beauty of the new church which is going to be built as soon as funds are available.</p>
