   <p>A sufficiently large crowd of people attended the affair given by the Pethia Society of Gargalianon last Sunday. Not all of them were from Gargalianata and near-by Messinia; many people from other sections of Greece came to support the worthy purpose of the dance. Money is being raised to build and conduct a modern school in the town of Gargalianata, Greece.</p>
   <p>Small tables were set up in one section of the large hall, where refreshments were served to all the guests. Since they all knew one another a hilarious atmosphere prevailed. After the tables were cleared various card games were begun. Although the majority played bridge, a few groups stealthily played poker. Still other groups, feeling more ambitious, had a marvelous time dancing.</p>
