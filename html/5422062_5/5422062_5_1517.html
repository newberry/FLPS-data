   <p>In an effort to help and protect the thousands of immigrants who come to America from Europe every year, 600 foreign language newspapers of the United States yesterday offered their services to the public safety commission of Chicago and Cook County. To show their good faith they gave the board $2,400 in cash. The foreign language editors intend to make the Chicago commission the directing influence of a nation-wide campaign for safety among America's foreign-born peoples.</p>
   <p>The money was given to the commission in a check by Louis Hammerling, president of the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers. Mr. Hammerling announced the purpose of the editors that gave the money. He said they expect the commission to provide articles on the campaign to be waged against avoidable accidents. These articles will be translated and printed in the various papers of the association.</p>
   
   <p>The offer was made in the Hotel La Salle at a joint meeting of the editors and members of the commission.</p>
   <p>Editors Put On Board</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, arranged the meeting. It was attended by eighteen editors, all of whom today will begin an editorial campaign in cooperation with the public safety commission. On the suggestion of Coroner Hoffman, who attended the meeting, the editors selected four of their number to become members of the commission. They are: P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star; V. A. Geringer, editor of the Daily Svornost; John R. Palandech, editor of the United Servian and the Balkan World; and A.M. Liebling, editor and publisher of the Daily Jewish Press.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lambros, toastmaster, opened the meeting by saying: "We all extend to Coroner Hoffman and the safety commission the united and enthusiastic support of the foreign press of this city. Our publications reach nearly 1,000,000 people, most of whom are foreigners unacquainted with American customs and in the greatest danger of accident. We mean to influence our pulpits and teachers to propagate this campaign among all those of foreign descent."</p>
   <p>Hoffman Explains Board</p>
   <p>Coroner Hoffman explained the work of the commission, pointed out its aims, and how he believed the aims could be accomplished. Graham Taylor advocated better political education of foreign-born residents of the Seventeenth ward so they could effect through the city council reforms needed in the ward. He pointed out that Grand avenue and Halsted street is one of the most dangerous street intersections in Chicago and that the foreign editors could minimize accidents there and elsewhere by entering the campaign.</p>
   
   <p>State Senator Ettelson urged organized movements for bringing about state legislation. He said members of the State Legislature desire to do the right thing, but often through lack of information or misinformation they went wrong. The remedy, he said, lies in visits to Springfield of delegates from organized movements, armed with facts and statistics.</p>
   <p>Says Immigrants Suffer</p>
   <p>Mr. Hammerling, spokesman for the editors, said in part:</p>
   <p>"I have been deeply touched by the words of your coroner. You have started a movement with untold possibilities. I feel more strongly on the subject than do most of those not acquainted with the problem of the foreign born. Ninety-seven per cent of the accidents in our industrial plants are inflicted on immigrant population.</p>
   
   <p>"It is among those men not accustomed to the way things are done in this country that the most work is to be done. I will give $2,400 for the work of your commission as a gift of the association of which I am president."</p>
   <p>Lauds Immigrants to U.S.</p>
   <p>"We are Americans, all of us. We strive to be good American citizens. There are thousands of foreign immigrants who come to this country every year and find themselves ignorant of conditions and unable to speak the language. They eventually become the bulwarks of your country. The Woolworth building, in which I have my offices in New York and which is fifty-six stories high, was built by immigrants from architect to hod-carrier.</p>
   <p>"I have experienced the trials and struggles of a young immigrant in this country. I know what it means to arrive in a big city and be unable to find friends or to be able to secure food and lodging. I recommend that sometime the commission look into the proposition of giving sympathy and encouragement and furnishing interpreters and teachers for these immigrants. I have made a fortune and I am willing at any time to give a substantial contribution to such a work."</p>
   <p>During the executive session which followed the general meeting Mr. Liebling read theeditorial in The Tribune which portrayed the disillusionment of a young immigrant who came to America to find his fortune and failed because of an accident which broke his back. He also praised the articles on the foreign born population by Henry M. Hyde in The Tribune.</p>
