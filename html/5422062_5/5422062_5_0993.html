   <p>Mr. Loxias:</p>
   <p>I beg you to print the following announcement in your paper so the entire Greek Community will know about my proposal.</p>
   <p>Announcement</p>
   <p>Because I cannot understand the reason the officers of the Greek Church, Holy Trinity, want me to resign as choir-master, I will offer my services, free of charge, to any of the other churches for an entire year. If they find me qualified, they can employ me at $240 a year thereafter.</p>
   <p>N. Dokos.</p>

   <p>Loxias says, - We are sorry to hear that Mr. N. Dokos has been compelled to resign. The reason is, undoubtedly, that he is an honest and patriotic man, doing much good for the church, and, as such, he does not fit in with the plans of the officers. We hope one of the other churches accepts his offer because he is too valuable a man to lose.</p>
