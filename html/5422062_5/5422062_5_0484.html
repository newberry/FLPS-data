   <p>p. 1.- A sensation was created by events published in this column yesterday, regarding the way the name of the formerly anonymous church at Winthrop avenue was chosen, the one now called St. Andrews.</p>
   <p>All these events were considered incredible at first. Being affirmed by the people present, however, all are expecting to learn from the Greek Daily the details of these events that took place at the Morrison Hotel, where a banquet was given last Saturday, on the arrival of the hierarchs.</p>
   <p>The Greek Daily, having gathered all necessary information, will publish, beginning tomorrow, all the details of our religion's disgrace for just a few dollars which, by means of tricks, the ingenious pastor of the Masonic Temple tried to collect, with the cooperation of the four Bishops of the Rodostolian church and in the presence of the Consul General of Greece, who was to officially certify the great event.</p>
