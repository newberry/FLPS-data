   <p>Last Sunday, in the beautiful hall of the Masonic Temple, the annual dance of the patriotic Hellenic Post, Number 343 of the American Legion, was given. It was attended by the finest people of the community, and was well conducted. The members of the Post tried very hard to please their guests, and should be commended for this effort. The people who attended this dance should also be commended, because by doing so they aided these young men who fought so gallantly, and who always rush to attend and support affairs given by other organizations.</p>
   <p>During the dance flowers were presented to the ladies, and various candies and cakes were served, which had been donated to the Post by the confectionery company of Melissinos and Sia. A great number of people participated in the Grand March, creating an impressive scene. Many comments were heard about the remarkable success of the dance.</p>
