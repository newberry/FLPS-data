   <p>The Greek Community of Chicago owes M. Petropoulos $75 for services rendered. The community refused to pay Mr. Petropoulos, so the poor man asked for $50. Again the community refused, so Mr. Petropoulos has gone to court.</p>
   <p>If the community loses, it will pay $75 to Mr. Petropoulos and $100 for court expenses. If it wins, it pays only the court expenses of $100. Either way the community loses. Isn't it a shame for the community to lose all this money, just for trying to be economical?</p>
