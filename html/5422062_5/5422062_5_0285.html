   <p>p. 5.- Last Sunday, Greeks from all over the city attended St. Constantine Church. They all wanted to see and hear His Holiness, Archbishop Damaskinos.</p>
   <p>It was a day long to be remembered. Everyone present was quiet and at ease during the long sermon. The choir and the music never sounded more beautiful. The altar boys were in their glory. The Archbishop's liturgy was one that struck the hearts of all and left a lasting impression on them.</p>
   <p>Before leaving for New York, His Holiness was visited by many of our prominent Greek Chicagoans at his hotel.</p>
