   <p>p. 3.- As all Greeks know, Saturday, Jan. 30th is the holiday of the Three-Hierarchs, who are Basil the Great, Gregory the Divine, and John the Golden-voiced. As in all other Greek churches, special mass will be held at 10:00 A.M. in St. Andrew Church.</p>
   <p>Archrev. Tsourounakis of this church will give a lecture on Sunday evening in connection with this holiday. His theme will be "Greek Letters and the Three Heirarchs." It will be very interesting and many should be present.</p>
