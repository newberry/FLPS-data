   <p>Many times we have spoken for the betterment of conditions of our clergy. No well thinking person could deny that our clergymen are to a certain extent the guides and guards of our religion. Are they paid well, in order to maintain the dignified and solemn prerequisites of that school? Our clergymen are not paid well. We appropriate great sums of money for trivial and insignificant affairs of display, but for the maintenance of our priests we show the attitude of the miser. Owing to this inconsideration our priests cannot afford to attire themselves according to the demands of our church. We must either pay the priests well or we must reduce their number so that the remaining might be paid well.</p>
