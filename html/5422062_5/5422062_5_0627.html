   <p>For the benefit of all concerned, this Newspaper publishes a letter sent by Mr. Ant. Mizalis, a resident of Foun Du Lac, Wisconsin. It states:</p>
   <p>"A Greek, living a good many years in Manitowac, Wisconsin, went to Greece. While there he fell in love with a girl and decided to marry her. He applied to the priest of his native town and also to the Episcopate of his county for a license; it was refused. On the ground that he did not have a certificate from the priest of his parish, asserting that he is a member of a Cannonical church. The poor Greek had to postpone his marriage until he got the required certificate."</p>
   <p>Is the populace responisble for the division of the church in America, or the clergy? Why should we hold the church-goers responsible and not the church itself? Of course, both the populace and the church are right. The thing which is not right, will soon be adjusted by the coming of the Plenipotentiary Extraordinary, of the Ecuminical Patriarchate. The High Prelate knows where the wrong lays. But in the meanwhile, the Greek and his girl must wait for the certificate.</p>
