   <p>On Friday November 3, Bishop Callistos officiated in the Great Vesper at our church. He was assisted by our pastor, Rev. Mark E. Petrakis, and about twenty other priests who had gathered here that evening. The church choir aided in the ceremony, and did extremely well with Mrs. Ann Siavelis at the organ. Among the psalms were "Phos Hilaron" and "Evlogetos E : Chiste".</p>
