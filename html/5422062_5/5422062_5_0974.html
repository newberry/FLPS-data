   <p>There are 36 Greek Orthodox Churches in the United States today and 46 priests. Valued at $15,000 each, the churches cost $540,000. At $150 a month, 46 priests would get $82,800 a year. If we add choirmasters and other employees of the church, the amount would exceed $120,000. Are we ever repaid for the money that goes for the spiritual peace of our countrymen? No! On a nice Sunday more Greeks can be found in Riverview Park than in all the churches put together.</p>
   <p>When the King of Greece asked for help from the Greeks of America, the 20,000 people of Chicago sent the huge sum of $400. That means, on the average, each person in Chicago of Greek descent gave 2 little cents for the Greek cause. We ought to be proud of ourselves!</p>

   <p>We really can't blame the people for this, though. We make just enough to live on. If there is any money, no matter how little, left over the priest gets it. And for what? To tell us that in the bible thousands of people were fed with two loaves of bread and so we must not eat oliveoil on Wednesdays and Fridays (while they eat chicken and more chicken.)</p>
   <p>Instead of trying to reform the common people, let us reform our priests.</p>
