   <p>The contemporary popular dialects that are spoken in different parts of Greece, are not the only ones that a fellow-writer referred to a few days ago in his article. There are others he missed which capable ones among us ought to have studied as language material.</p>
   <p>The Korakistika that the children use for the sake of enjoying themselves, attaching a suffix to every syllable at the words beginning with K and ending with the vowel of the syllable, to which this suffix is attached, certainly is not a dialect. Korakistiki is understood easily by the listener. When a friend tells you in Korakistika, "tha-ka Phi-ki jo-ko to-ko ra ka" you understand that he tells you, "tha phiyo tora" (I shall go now), no matter how quickly he tells it. You answer, "Ke-ke pou-kou tha-ka pa-ka te-ke?" Which is, "Ke pou tha pa-te?" (And where will you go?) He understands you also at once, while the third person present may understand, also, but with some difficulty if he is not prepared. This is the so-called Korakistika. Others, however, attach a suffix beginning with a different consonant than K and make things more difficult to understand.</p>
   <p>However, besides Korakistiki, the residents of Village Stemnitsa of Peloponnesus <span class="page-break">2</span>have introduced something different than Korakistika by which they understand one another, and which their neighbors, residents of Gortenia and Megalopolis, also understand, while the rest of Peloponesians do not. How they ever thought of it and speak it so easily I do not know. (Explanation follows as to this method, which is rather complicated - Translator). A third individual who might be present will not know their method of reversing the syllables of the words at certain consonants, is unable to understand because they also use symbolic words and other words of unknown origin, as for example the word - Mpaniko, which means "poly" (much). When they want to say "ehei polla", they say "heei mpanico" (There are many). "Passari" which means "Krasi" (wine) etc.</p>
   <p>In the bi-syllable words the reversing of syllables or the changing of the positions of the consonants, is easy. But in the tri-syllable words, where the consonants of the second syllable are placed at the beginning of the word, and the other syllables remain as they are, the reversing is more difficult. (Illustrations follow - Translator).</p>
   <p>The pure Modern Greek dialects, however, are the Tsakonika and Arvanitika. The second is a Greek-Albanian dialect which differs much from the one used in Albania today. It is spoken differently in the environs of Attica, in Parahora, <span class="page-break">3</span>the islands of Salamis, Hydra and Spetsa, and other sections than it is spoken in Albania. It is known that Albanians today, maintain that their language is the ancient Pelasgiau and Dr. Thomspoulos, in a great work of his, wanted to prove that the Albanian language is the ancient Cretian of the Minoian times etc. On the other hand, the late Dr. Loukas Bellos has proved that many Albanian records have their origin in Homeric roots with Latin additions, which through centuries past have been disfigured due to different rules of pronunciation.</p>
   <p>The Tsakoniki dialect, to the study of which the late Defner had devoted, since 1862, his whole life, having edited its grammar and diction, is considered to be the ancient Dorian, showing the influence of Slavic pronunciation and very little of the Latin. The root elements of the ancient Dorian language, however, are indisputable. Even so, there are other difficulties which cannot be easily explained away, despite every endeavor of Mr. Defner to find their roots and origin in the ancient dialects. He failed in some as he was deceived as to the origin of the word, Tsakonia, as Kynouria is called. (The author proceeds to show how Mr. Defner deceived himself and others who accepted his explanation - Translator). Against this daring explanation of the origin of the word, the truth is, that Kynovria, has been named Tsakonia, from the Slavic word, Zakon, and, Tsakoni, which means right, legal, privileged, the meaning of which the <span class="page-break">4</span>Greek people preserved in the proverb:</p>
   <p>"Kathe topos kae tsakoni</p>
   <p>Kathe mahalas kae taxi".</p>
   <p>"There is a privilege in every locality</p>
   <p>There is a cast (class) in every neighborhood".</p>
   <p>This proverb is known by all Greeks. And the Kynourians had indeed privileges, for Taakonia since the Eighth Century B. C., was recognized even by the Frank conquerors.</p>
