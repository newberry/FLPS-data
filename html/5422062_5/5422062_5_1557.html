   <p>By making a rapid and sweeping survey of the members of our nationality throughout the United States, we observe that while thousands of Greeks have become naturalized American citizens; on the other hand, there are many thousands among us who have hesitated to follow the example set by our more far-sighted and thoughtful citizens.</p>
   <p>In regard to this subject, we must admit that the greater part of the Greek press of America has failed to cope with the need of impressing upon our countrymen the idea that the acquisition of American citizenship rights is an imperative duty. Perhaps this is to be attributed to the fact that in case of a Greek order for mobilization of our national armed forces, those Greeks who have already become American citizens will not be able to render any military and personal service to our homeland.</p>
   <p>It is true that the whole question must be studied thoroughly by Chicago's <span class="page-break">2</span>leaders and press before any valid opinion can be expressed. But, if by chance the matter is discussed in all its aspects and in its entirety, we shall see that those who have taken both their first and second papers and become naturalized American citizens have done no injustice to our homeland. Nor is it a sign that we have forgotten our duties to the country of our birth. It must be remembered that our deep, abiding love and devotion to Greece has not decreased. Is not love of our country one of our most powerful virtues and characteristics, which can be superseded neither by time nor gold, not even by the circumstance that we have sworn allegiance to a foreign country. Judging the question from this standpoint and relying on the many examples of the Greek people's patriotism and loyalty to Greece even though many thousands have become citizens of the United States, we notice that we have not harmed our interests nor forsaken our ideals. On the contrary, we have become the recipients of many benefits and privileges. Those Greeks who have been honored with American citizenship have benefited the entire Greek people indirectly in many ways.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>But, even though some of our leaders could not use their influence as American citizens to protect the rest of the foreign-born Greeks, who can deny that in reality all of us are American citizens because of the fact that we must obey the laws of the United States of America on the one hand, and enjoy the rights and privileges of being protected in our life and work. Our homeland has never asked the Greeks of America to refuse to obey the laws of the United States; it has never asked us to refuse to accept the benefits and opportunities which have and are being offered us by the people of America; it has never required of us to refuse to acknowledge our gratitude to this great Republic.</p>
   <p>There is no one who doubts the loyalty and devotion of those Greeks of Chicago, for instance, who are now American citizens. Also, who can question the just demand of America for obedience to its laws, loyalty to its flag, and love and respect for everything that America stands for? We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to the future happiness of the Greek people of America to become real Americans and adopt the best and finest things that America has to offer, while, at the <span class="page-break">4</span>same time, we maintain and preserve the best and finest things in our Greek culture and heritage.</p>
   <p>All these remarks and discussion are the result of a thorough study for the citizenship question. We must impress upon the Greeks of Chicago, especially those who are to become the hub of the Greeks of the entire United States, that they have nothing to lose but everything to gain by becoming naturalized American citizens. That is the reason why those who are already naturalized American citizens are not to be accused or scorned. On the other hand, we are indeed surprised to discover that there are quite a few among us who attacked the idea of becoming American citizens and relinquishing our identity as Greeks as a highly treacherous and unpatriotic act, in view of the fact that most of our countrymen expect to return to Greece sooner or later anyway.</p>
   <p>We hope that these ideas and beliefs will not come to the attention of Uncle Sam because of the serious consequences that may follow. We must warn our <span class="page-break">5</span>people to keep away from irresponsible, loose-tongued, and half-baked individuals who give the false impression that they are authorities on all questions pertaining to the life and affairs of the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
