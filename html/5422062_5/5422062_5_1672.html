   <p>During the last three days the entire Hellenism of the world has been aroused to anger and resentment. This resentment has been caused by the terrible occurrences at Rodos, the island home of the heroic, long-suffering Dodecanese. In the history of Greece, events of such a nature are not rare, for it seems to be her fate to be forced to submit to periodical assaults. However, this last action of the Italians against unarmed citizens, is enough to make any human being furious. If they had been facing armed resistance, even if it were justified, the Italians could justify their barbarous and brutal conduct. But when they knew that the citizens had not one deadly weapon in their possession--because the Italians themselves had previously disarmed them--the act becomes a criminal, barbarous, and savage one.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Italian leaders announced that ten people had been killed. Each one can comprehend the magnitude of the crime purposely perpetrated by the famous Carabiniares. Each one of us can, in our mind's eye, see the death struggles of the martyred heroes of the island of Rodos. The announcement also makes reference to the flight of the people to the mountain crags. They fled to these that they might not be slaughtered like cattle by the enemy. There, in old times, they could have hidden in the caves and fought the invader by means of guerrilla warfare. But the progress of the twentieth century had furnished the Italians aeroplanes, which they used to bomb these new heroes of Greece.</p>
   <p>Of all the tragedies which have befallen the Dodecanese during their three-thousand-year's history, this Italian outrage is the most vile. The struggle of two thousand years ago between the two races, has been reborn, with all its old hatreds and fanaticisms, as strong as in the time of Philopoimon [a general of the Greek army]. Then, the invaders overpowered and enslaved <span class="page-break">\3</span>the Greeks, and created a new empire, the Byzantine. But in all the hundreds of years of oppression and enslavement that have since passed, the Greek race, language, and customs have not been obliterated. These islands, which have been held by Italy only by sheer force and power, have retained their pure Hellenism, despite myriad obstacles and punishments. During the last twenty years of the Italian subjugation these people have demonstrated their love for Greece by refusing to obey any of the Italian orders intended to aid in the obliteration of their nationality. They cried out to the world for justice, but their cry was heard by no one. The position of our unfortunate brothers, especially during the last few years--since the great Mussolini took the reins of government--has become intolerable. The Italian conquerors force all the Greek schools to teach in the Italian language, in an effort to prevent the Greek spirit from finding nature in the young generation. Mussolini wants to make them Italians! He must not be allowed to do such a terrible thing!</p>
   <p>We, the Greek people, whether living in America or Greece, must unite and <span class="page-break">\4</span>fight for the rights and freedom of our islands. The Greeks of the Dodecanese Islands, infuriated by the massacre in Rodos, are rapidly becoming ready to fight. The rest of us should lay aside all church, club and social matters, and strive--as one--for the freedom of our Islands. We must keep our Greek brothers from becoming Italianized. The Greek clergy and people in America, free as they are to think and act, should loudly proclaim their decision to help the Greek Dodecanese Islands attain liberation.</p>
