   <p>The Greek cathedral of St. Constantine, through its first priest, Rev. Mr. Petrakis, announces that next Sunday, our visiting Prelate of the Greek church, His Eminence Gennadios, Metropolitan of Saloniki, will officiate at the above said church, assisted by Bishop Philaretos; Father Petrakis; and Rev. Mazocopakis, archdeacon. Mr. De Pastas, consul General of Greece, and eminent members of the laity, will participate in the holy liturgy.</p>
   <p>The participating worshipers will have the opportunity to hear the eloquent orator and Right Worshipful Hierarch of the Church of Saloniki.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that the Cathedral has not sufficient room to accomodate the anticipated multitudes, ladies with children are requested to stay at the women's quarters of the church.</p>
