   <p>We are reliably informed that the executive council of our Church Community has voted to appropriate the sum of five hundred dollars for legal expenses. How could our Church and Community administrations fail to pay attorneys, court expenses, etc.? It seems that if we are not involved in some court case from time to time, we are not satisfied.</p>
   <p>It is understood in advance that our Community treasury has reached the bottom because of the deplorable state of affairs to which we have been reduced. Unceasing quarrels, personal hatreds, and passionate denunciations as well as lust for office and power have all set us against each other. It was inevitable that we would find our Community finances almost exhausted.</p>
   <p>It is now hoped that little by little the money that has been thoughtlessly and foolishly wasted will be replaced through the sale of candles and through church collections on Sundays and holidays. In this manner we may hope to collect enough <span class="page-break">2</span>money to pay future legal expenses.</p>
   <p>A great deal has been written in The Greek Star on how the domestic affairs of our Community should be straightened out and how we should proceed to oust individuals who have done so much injury to our general interests. Our people know what has happened in our church and civic life because of the stubbornness and the constant warring between the two political factions in our Community.</p>
   <p>In spite of all these most regrettable developments, the people--the members of our parishes--have done nothing. That is why these ugly things have been going on in our Community year after year.</p>
   <p>We now ask if our people have lost interest in our common affairs? It is, therefore, evident that the leaders of our church, schools, and other institutions find a good chance to misinterpret our constitution and enforce the laws which we have adopted as they see fit. Some of our Community officers have been squandering the people's money without restraint. Surely, they are leading our <span class="page-break">3</span>Community to economic ruin, and in doing so they are subjecting the Greek people to all sorts of humiliations.</p>
   <p>How long will this state of affairs last? How much patience must one have? When will our best and ablest citizens take the reins in their hands?</p>
