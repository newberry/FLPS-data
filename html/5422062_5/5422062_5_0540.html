   <p>The Right Reverend Alexander Rhodostolou came to Chicago yesterday and left almost immediately for New York, despite the fact that a meeting had been set for this week in Chicago, the first meeting of the Holy Synod and the self-governing churches of America.</p>
   <p>This hasty departure and the consequent postponement of the bishops' meeting have given rise to various rumors, one of which is that Archbishop Alexander and his bishops are very uneasy over the impending arrival in New York of the new legate, the Reverend Father Hresanthos. We received the news of the coming of Trapezountos Hresanthos from a private source yesterday. However, we were unable to ascertain the exact time of his arrival.</p>
   <p>The hasty departure of Archbishop Alexander and the postponement of the Synod meeting strongly suggest to us that something is being cooked up in clandestine fashion, and the more clandestine the cooking the stronger the smell.</p>
