   <p>Last Sunday was one of the most important days of the year as far as the Greek community of Chicago is concerned. On that day its members went to the polls with enthusiasm and fanatic determination to elect the board of officers of the Greek settlement for the year 1909.</p>
   <p>Presumably, on that day 2,039 qualified members of our community were to go to the Masonic Temple to exercise their constitutional right of franchise, and to select the best qualified leaders of our community. The task of choosing such leaders is as important as the services which they should render in the administration of our common affairs. These services are badly needed at this time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Therefore, the great demonstration in front of and inside the Masonic Temple was a thunderous Greek demand for better leadership and improved administrative methods. Such huge political demonstrations serve to prove how deeply interested the Greek people of this community are in their future and in efficient, honest, and dynamic leadership. They are fully aware of the fact that Chicago, which boasts of the second largest and most influential Greek settlement in America, must have men with ability, a driving determination, and intense patriotism in order to make this community a progressive, modern, and easily adjusted foreign language group.</p>
   <p>Even the American public showed great interest in the outcome of last Sunday's election. It, too, is eager to learn what our abounding and tremendous energy can accomplish and contribute amidst the polyglot cultures and environments in this Babel of immigrants. Unfortunately, violence and street brawls occurred among the hot-headed followers of the opposing parties.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Passing over the regrettable episodes and bloody brawls which took place, we now come to the main subject of interest, that is, the way in which the now famous elections of last Sunday were held.</p>
   <p>It is well-known, though it does not add to our dignity and self-respect, that the United States court was called upon to set the date of the election as well as to maintain public order and arrange other election details. However, in spite of the agreement of both parties, and the measures taken by the police and the court, the results of the election were not perfectly satisfactory or even fair because the great masses of our people, the rank and file of the Greek community, were not properly represented, nor was their mandate heeded. This was caused by the fact that many voters did not have the opportunity to vote because of the limited time in which the voters were allowed to cast their ballots. Voting hours were set by law from 8 A. M. to 10 P. M. There was only one polling place available to the public. Now anyone will wonder how 2,039 voters could have time to <span class="page-break">\4</span>cast their ballots properly and leisurely within 14 hours. We do not really know if this method of voting in a single hall and in such a short period of time were devised intentionally by partisan supervising court and police authorities. Irrespective of this, however, it is now generally conceded that the outcome of the election does not represent the true desires of the majority of the Greek community.</p>
   <p>It is really a misfortune and a sad state of affairs when all the 2,039 qualified voters are excluded or prevented from exercising their right to vote. A truly fair and democratic way of voting affords each voter the opportunity to participate in the government; for in voting he knows that he is doing his share toward selecting the ablest and worthiest citizens as responsible leaders. A citizen who is not consulted in the selection of public officers will offer no co-operation in administering the affairs of the state or of any community. He feels that he is merely an instrument in the hands of arbitrary, ambitious, selfish, and untrustworthy <span class="page-break">\5</span>politicians.</p>
   <p>Now that the election is over, we do not wish to create any trouble or arouse the community by recommending any new election. This would be both costly and dangerous. So, we are respecting and approving the expressed wishes of part of the voters of the Greek settlement. We all know that in all probability the results of the election would be far different if a new election were ordered. Nevertheless, The Greek Star takes this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Christ Petroulas and his assisting subordinate officers on their victory in the recent election. We wish to remind him, however, that he and his party have a precarious hold on the affairs of this community because 1,093 qualified voters of the community were prevented from expressing their opinion in the selection of next year's officers. For the benefit of the general public, we publish the names of the newly elected officers and votes received. Dr. Christ Petroulas, president, 486 votes; James Tsiambas, vice-president, 453 votes; Steve Sourapas, treasurer, 469 votes; John Stephanou, <span class="page-break">\6</span>secretary, 467 votes; and about ten members of the church board.</p>
   <p>The opposing Reform party made a fine showing with Thomas Sanitsas, candidate for president, receiving 456 votes. His friends and supporters received a proportional number of votes, which, however, were not sufficient to win over the Progressive party's candidates.</p>
   <p>It is now up to the court holding jurisdiction over the results of the election to issue a definite decision. As yet, we are not in a position to know what the order of the court will be. We can only mention that Mr. Sanitsas appeared before Judge Honore with the request that the election be annulled and a new election held. On the other hand, Dr. Petroulas demanded the immediate recognition of the validity of the election. After the judge heard both sides, he delayed the issuance of any definite decision, reserving the right to study the case and the facts presented by both sides.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In the meantime, he issued a restraining order preventing Dr. Petroulas and his friends from taking office. So, for the time being, Mr. Manousopoulos is temporary president of the community.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros.</p>
