   <p>Owing to the turbulent question of the Greek church in America, the society of Greek professionals in Chicago, which for many years stands with vigilant eye guarding the Greek name and the welfare of the Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere in America resolved to appeal to the proper authorities in Greece, with the object in view, of terminating the scandalous ecclesiastical questions of the division of the Greek church in America.</p>
   <p>The appeal, which was clothed in beautiful dignified language, was brief, precise and denoted immediate solution of the matter in hand.</p>
   <p>It was forwarded to His Holiness the Ecumenical Patriach in Constantinople which is the seat of the Ecumenical Throne of all Greek Orthodoxy the world over, to the Holy Synod of Athens Greece, and to the government of Greece.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek church in America was divided into three factions. This division was very disastrous to the welfare of the Church and much more disastrous to the welfare of the communities, which in turn were divided accordingly.</p>
   <p>The result of the appeal is that the three above mentioned authorities ordered the departure for America of His Holiness Damaskenos, Metropolitan of Corinthos, as Exarch of the Ecumenical Throne, and as representative extraordinary of the Greek government, to unify the church of America, and unite and pacify the communities, which for a time being were jumping at one another's throat.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the Exarch, who possesses tremendous intelligence and learning, and wearing the toga of extraordinary Church and State powers, will find it not difficult to accomplish the object of his delegation.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek communities of Chicago and the Greek communities of the whole America are thankful to the society of the Greek professionals of Chicago, for this and other noble initiatives taken by the society of these learned Greeks in behalf of the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to our Chicago Greek intellectuals.</p>
