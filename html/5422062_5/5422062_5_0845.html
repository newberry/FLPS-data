   <p>The ladies in the St. Constantine Parish have formed a society. This organization was formed for the specific purpose of helping the Greek school and the church.</p>
   <p>Reverend Theodore Prousianos suggested that this society be organized. The following officers were elected at the last meeting: Mrs. Maria Contos, president, Mrs. P. Rekas, vice-president, and Mrs. A. Zoe, secretary.</p>
   <p>The ladies are going to raffle off a silver fruit dish in order to raise enough money to buy a bishop's throne for the church. They will need about $450 for this purpose.</p>
