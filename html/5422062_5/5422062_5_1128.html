   <p>Because of rumors which have been circulated that the Society of Greek Family Man in Chicago intends to disband and consequently to close its South Side church, we hasten to inform the public and all concerned that these rumors are not true and are absolutely unfounded. They are part of the systematic propaganda emanating from the newly installed officers of the Chicago Greek community, who very much desire our reconciliation with the rest of the colony.</p>
   <p>We have bound ourselves by path to defend the good name of Father Georgeadis, and until he is exonerated, reconciliation is impossible. In our case our pastor Father Georgeadis, is compelled to abandon his pastorate and our church against our wishes, we shall appeal to the Ecumenical Patrichate, the head of the church, for a new priest.</p>
   <p>Reconciliation and the renunciation of our church for the sake of unity and harmony are utter impossibilities so long as an innocent priest wrongfully accused, remains unvindicated. If those who have connived at the campaign of vilification directed against our pastor come to their senses and publicly apologize, our resolution may be modified.</p>
   <p>THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</p>
   <p>of</p>
   <p>The Society of Family Men,</p>
   <p>Chicago,ILL.</p>
