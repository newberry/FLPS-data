   <p>p. 2- The executive council of Assumption of the Virgin Mary community wishes to announce to the Greeks of Chicago and especially to those who attend this particular church that the erection of a new church is planned on the lot owned by the community where the present church stands. The council begs them not to pay any attention to groundless rumors that the community is hampered in its endeavor by court complications.</p>
   <p>The community has never, from the time of its establishment up to this moment, had any court contest, no individual or establishment has any legal right to hinder the work of building the church and the school, as will shortly be proved.</p>
   <p>Executive Council,</p>
   <p>By John Coliopoulos, President.</p>
