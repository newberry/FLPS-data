   <p>p. 4.- Last Sunday's mass at St. James Church is not one that will be easily forgotten by those present. On this day the famous Eikon of St. Spiridon was dedicated to the church. Pupils of the school under Mrs. Contos, the teacher, recited various poems.</p>
   <p>The priest of the church spoke on the life of St. Spiridon and two youthful students said the "Pater Imon" and the "Pistevo" (I believe). The choir sang two Byzantine hymns under the leadership of N. Vombrak. The Eikon was donated to the church by P. Orologas of the Pheonix Candy Shop on Halsted street.</p>
