   <p>The local, national and international athletic games of today typify a Greek custom.</p>
   <p>It is a natural instinct in mankind, whenever there is a gathering either ceremonial, or testimonial, to seek ostentation and merriment.</p>
   <p>The ancient writers referred to many gatherings which were the prototypes of the later Olympic games.</p>
   <p>Homer tells us that when Odysseus sailed into Corfu, King Alkinos ordered, in honor of the roaming navigator, a celebration to be held including dances and athletic games. Likewise the Argonauts, while sailing at Kolhis, met a storm, landed at Lymnos, and offered sacrifices and held athletic games.</p>

   <p>It is also known that the ancient Greeks held such games at the death of a notable. As for instance, very extensive games were held, fulfiling the wish of Achilles when he died. These games also were held at the death of Oedipus, Patroclos and others. Homer extensively tell us that the Greeks after offering sacrifices to their gods always held games.</p>
   <p>Athletic games were the topic of the day even when the Greeks held their Amphictyonic councils (a league of Greek people meeting for common interest, semi-annually Delphi and Thermopylas.) The present League of Nations is based upon the Greek Amphictyonic councils.</p>

   <p>As is known, all the cities (most of them being in themselves kingdoms of ancient Greece) held annual or semi-annual athletic games, in which the people of surrounding territories participated. Thus the local games eventually became Pan-Hellenic, as the Olympic, Isthmian and Nemean games.</p>
   <p>The present day awards (money or trophies) to the victors of games, also springs up from the ancient Greek programs. The acclamation of the spectators was what swayed the decision in awarding trophies to the victors. Contrary to the now prevalent conception (that money was not given as an award) the awards comprised valuable objects, or money, and that is the reason the games were called "money athletic games. Solon, fixed five hundred drachmas for the Olympian victors, and 100 drachmas for the Isthmian. The victors of the other games were accordingly compensated as Diogenes the Laertios, tells us.</p>

   <p>These "money" games took place at the early periods of the Pan-Hellenics.</p>
   <p>The apparel of the athlete also typifies a Greek custom. The contestants of the four Pan-Hellenic games were not entirely nude, for they had a loin cloth. But the wearing of the loin cloth did not prevail long. The Lacedemons were the first to discard it and in 720 B.C. it was no longer used in any part of Greece, a short, sleeveless tunic being preferred.</p>
