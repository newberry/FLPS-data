   <p>The men of Chicago who had taken part in the last War organized the Greek-American Post of the American Legion.</p>
   <p>The Achean Society of Chicago, as evidence of its appreciation and respect for these brave men, presented and American flag to the Post. It was given not only by the Society but also by the entire Greek Community, which had contributed to the fund. The Acheans should be congratulated for their appropriate selection.</p>
