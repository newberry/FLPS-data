   <p>Encouraged by the tremendous success they always have when they give a social affair, the well-known philanthropic society Young Greek Girls Philomusical Association will, on August 3rd, hold a roof-garden dance at the Parkway Hotel for the benefit of our poor and needy.</p>
   <p>Our alluring nymphs inform us that the management of the above hostelry does not permit more than 600 persons to participate in the dance on the roofgarden, which is on the 19th floor, for reasons of safety. All tickets are sold and, they add, don't feel disappointed if you can not attend the affair of the fair ones.</p>
   <p>The poor and needy and the Greek public in general ought to feel happy and proud of the energetic efforts of our young girls who always are on the go for the benefit of the Greek community.</p>
