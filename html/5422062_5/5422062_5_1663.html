   <p>From the Verga of Calamata, a historic wall, before which many Turks were beheaded, during the struggles of 1821, by the sickles of the Maniati woman, who as worthy descendants of the Spartan woman, knew how to use them very skillfully, not only in the harvest field, but in the field of War as well. In Tainaron, no beautiful gardens can be found as there are in the Messinian fields, nor is there the enviable transportation as found in other localities that are equally mountainous and less historic.</p>
   <p>This deplorable fact, pertaining to transportation, has been justly and repeatedly dinned into the ears of those who do not want to hear. But different administrations in power have always shoved Mani aside, as a locality not worthy of attention, forgetting its history and its indomitable struggles for freedom. It was a section which, according to Tricoupis,--(Translator's note. A greek statesman and Premier) was justly considered as the starting point and basis of Peloponnesos, because on the bravery of the Manniates, and their territorial advantages, the success of the struggle of all the Greeks was based....</p>

   <p>From Calamata to Tainaron, the inaccessible mountain chain all along the line of Taygetos, is accompanied by a parallel line of evergreen pine-trees, that like magnificent sentinels, adorn its glory, and by the humerous little inlets, bays, and capes of the Messinian gulf. Some villiages and towns cling to elevations like wasp nests, while others more modern, are located on level ground, or in the rocky and cataclysmic coasts.</p>
   <p>However, if Mani is mountainous, barren, and inaccessible, it has produced throughout the centuries unconquerable heroes and heroines. It was by this incomparable living material, that never ceased to offer itself as a sacrifice in the different struggles for the fatherland, that Mani was always victorious and could remain at liberty even during the tragic period of Turkish domination when it enjoyed special privileges and self-government to an extent that amounted to absolute freedom.</p>
   <p>Mani, although it is covered by rocks and mountains, has 360 villages and is populated by 45,000 people, who engaged themselves with Demetra rather than Vachos. They are not acquainted either with extreme poverty nor with large riches. Their bodily exercises make them dexterous and the simple <span class="page-break">\3</span>fare causes them to be robust. Economy is their riches but Economical as they are in time and money, they have neither notary publics, nor judges. All their obligations are assumed verbally and are inviolate. An insult to chastity has to be paid by blood, while all others, even murder, might be forgiven. Hospitality is a beloved virtue with Maniates. Strangers, however, must enjoy their confidence, or have letters of recommendation for they may introduce new foreign habits and customs, leading to corruption. The priests preach freedom, not only from the pulpit, but also on the field of battle.</p>
   <p>I have listened to the following dialogue between a priest, a teacher, and a pupil.</p>
   <p>Teacher: "What are you?"</p>
   <p>Pupil: "A free man, because I dispose of my thought and will freely."</p>
   <p>Teacher: "On what do you build the foundation of your freedom?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Pupil: "On the memory of my ancestors, the Spartans."</p>
   <p>Teacher: "What are your duties?"</p>
   <p>Pupil: "First, to respect the aged and help them as much as I can; second, to love and support my parents to the best of my ability; third, to hasten slowly in the assuming of obligations and having undertaken them, to execute them without fail; fourth, to honor the married so that I may be respected later, and to consider woman as a treasure, inviolable, and maidens sacred; fifth, to preserve my freedom as I have received it from my ancestors and defend it with my very life."</p>
   <p>This is the ideal pentalogue of the youth of Mani, up to date, and one that always will constitute the basis of every civilized school.</p>
   <p>The war mania, and the irreconcilable hatred of Maniates toward their enemies are so well known through their determined and fiery struggles that they are respected facts.</p>
