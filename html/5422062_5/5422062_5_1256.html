   <p>P. 2--In the beautifully decorated dance-hall of the Sherman Hotel more than eight hundred people of both sexes recently gathered to enjoy the magnificent and impressive dance of the Greek-American Legion.</p>
   <p>A large orchestra, an abundance of flowers, and a well-stocked buffet with polite service by the reception committee and their assistants made this dance memorable.</p>
   <p>All departed after midnight in the best of spirits.</p>
