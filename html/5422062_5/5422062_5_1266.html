   <p>The Greek Post of the American Legion will hold its annual dance in the Hotel Sherman, next Sunday night. The purpose of this affair is philanthropic; the proceeds will be disposed of for the benefit of injured members of the Greek Post.</p>
   <p>To this dance of the brave Greek Veterans of the American Army, who were loyal to their Greek descent, and who elevated the Greek name to high reputation, we have no doubt that every one will hasten to take part in the benefit given in honor of the injured veteran members of the organization.</p>
