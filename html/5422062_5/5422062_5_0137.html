   <p>p.2.--On last Wednesday Mr. Alexander, the secretary of the Diocese of Chicago, after some preparatory work among the parishioners, invited the boys and girls of the parish of St. Demetry with their parents to the hall of the church and formed a new organization of the youth between the ages of sixteen and twentytwo.</p>
   <p>The prevalent spirit of mysticism was manifested even in this new society, for the only thing that Mr. Alexander gave out for publication was the pass-word, "Tuesday a date!" That was all. More about this later.</p>
