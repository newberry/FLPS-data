   <p>It is with much pleasure that we announce the organization of a Young Women's Club here in Chicago. The purposes of this group will be: to retain and promote the customs and mores of Greek family life; to help the community assimilate the best part of the American way of life; to help make the new generation of Greek girls the finest type of womanhood from a social, cultural, and domestic viewpoint.</p>
   <p>The club will also support all philanthropic movements.</p>
   <p>An organization of this type can do an unlimited amount of good, and we are sure that the Greek girls of Chicago will rush to join its ranks.</p>
   <p>We will soon publish the names of the girls who organized this club.</p>
