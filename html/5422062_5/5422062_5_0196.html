   <p>p. 1- Our church reorganization is slow but sure. The establishment of the monastery seems to continue to absorb the attention of the Archdiocese more than the convocation of the congress of communities. It seems, to judge from the lack of any new information, that it will be further delayed if not postponed indefinitely.</p>
   <p>It is a matter of dispute whether the congress shall be held in New York or in Chicago. We have dealt with this subject in the past, and we should like to come back to it were we not afraid that we are arguing about something which the Archdiocese does not consider of pressing need.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if we examine more closely the expected results of the proposed congress, we shall see that nothing positive will result from it because decisions regarding matters of the communities cannot be final, for it is known that the communities, recognized as associations, must vote as units on decisions of the congress.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>That they will do so is very doubtful, especially if the communal liberties are to be restricted, and new evils are to be introduced as it is rumored.</p>
   <p>Our communal matters are at a standstill pending the convocation of the congress. Our parish dissension continues with sporadic jumping about on the part of some priests to administer sacraments in parishes not their own.</p>
   <p>This phenomenon is to be regretted because it proves that some priests, fortunately few, do not want to behave themselves and keep order, in spite of the fact that formerly they were loud for order and claimed the title of regular and orderly priests.</p>
   <p>We confine ourselves to these few remarks to-day, awaiting their apologies to the Archdiocese or rather the latter's decision upon them.</p>
   <p>The affairs of the West Side community - of the Holy Trinity - are getting into a mess. We are informed that some councilmen have even <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>submitted their resignations to the president, Mr. Palivos, having become despondent because no improvement in the situation is possible.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Palivos would follow the example of the councillors, the situation surely would be ameliorated, for this man, after all, ought to understand that he cannot continue to be president after taking under his protection the embezzlers of the school funds and cooperating with them.</p>
