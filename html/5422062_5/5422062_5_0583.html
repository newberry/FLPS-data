   <p>The New Church of the North Division.</p>
   <p>The Churchgoers of the New Church were honored by the presence of "The Most Rev. Bishop Philaretos." The tremendous crowd participating in the celebration of Epiphany were very much impressed by the dignity and profound words of Bishop Philaretos. The Bishop ordered the immediate formation of Sunday School classes for the children, and urged the parents to send their children to the newly created Sunday School, so they would be imbued with the religious and moral principles of the Orthodox Church.</p>
