   <p>The young women's society, known as the New Generation of the South Side, has been actively on record for seven years. During all these years it has worked zealously, and its activity has been recognized by all the Greeks of Chicago, so much so, indeed, that every year they attend en masse the society's masquerade ball, held in the large and magnificent Trianon ballroom. For seven consecutive years this ball has been held by the young ladies of the New Generation Society, and the Trianon is always filled to capacity by people, who wish to be marry and enjoy the entertainment. We congratulate the young women, who first conceived the idea.</p>
   <p>It is an encouraging sign for our new generation, when young women, such as those who make up the various organizations of our youth, feel the necessity of forming societies, to labor and struggle for noble purpose, such as the maintenance of our schools and the welfare of the unfortunate.</p>
   <p>Their noble endeavors are worthy of all praise, and we wish for them that they may never know the bitter disappointments of life.</p>
