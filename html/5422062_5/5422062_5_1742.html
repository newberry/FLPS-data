   <p>In the preceeding articles we have shown that in sending the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mihalakopoulos, to America, the Greek Government will not render any service to itself nor to the Hellenism of America.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, sending of the Minister of National Economy should be an advantage for Greece, especially to its general commercial interests. The study of Hellenism in America, from the standpoint of its econimic importance for Greece, should prove more fruitful to Greek government policy.</p>
   <p>The question of Greek education, befitting the new Greek generation of America, should also be of imperative importance as regards the status of relationship of Hellenism in America to its Mother Country. The Greek communities are struggling along and cannot solve this question by themselves, without the moral succor of Greece.</p>
   <p>In the first place, we are not able to create the personnel for our schools here and consequently the teachers must come from Greece, with the necessary qualifications. Secondly, they must be under supervision of a superior, who would regulate the educational program for the schools so thay they may function uniformly.</p>
   <p>In so far, as the Greek education of the children of 500,000 Greeks of America is concerned, it is the Greek government's duty, we believe, to have a suitable minister visit America. That minister is Mr. Papandreas.</p>
   <p>The Ecclesiastical question having being settled, there remains a most important matter to be straightenen up and that is school organization. This matter presents many difficulties that cannot be settled by the Greek population of America alone.</p>
   <p>The Greek government is duty-bound to pay serious attention to this most important question, if it really wants to preserve the Greek race in America; if it seriously concerns itself with the Greeks that are abroad.</p>
   <p>A visit by the Greek Minister of Public Education, will not only render great service to the Greeks here, but it will also exercise a great influence in strengthening the national spirit; it will create the conviction that Greece is watching her children abroad with interest, willing to help them in their efforts to preserve their racial identity.</p>
   
   <p>Furthermore, a minister of Mr. Papandreas' dignity has much to gain from a visit to America. He will be given the opportunity to visit the various American educational institutions, studying their system of education and see from close quarters the progress made; studies and observations that will greatly help him in his efforts to organize the department which he directs.</p>
   <p>Since the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is useless, there being no diplomatic matters to settle, we suggest that one of the Ministers of National Economy and Public Education be substituted, because they have important things to observe and study here for the benefit of Greece and the Greeks of America.</p>
