   <p>Before we express our opinion about the unexpected and astonishing action taken by the Union of the Greek Clergymen of Chicago, we consider it timely to publish the announcement promulgated by Bishop Kallistos in the form of a circular letter and the announcement issued by our pastors as advice to their parishioners.</p>
   <p>Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America--Circular Letter "My beloved children! The grace of the Almighty be with you.</p>
   <p>"It is very well known to all that in order to continue without interruption the operation of our religious institutions and to enable them to perform their functions successfully, it is imperative to have the complete support, both moral and material, of all who profess to be members of these institutions and rightfully claim benefits from them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"The financial statements of the last fiscal year of all the Greek parishes of Chicago reveal that not one of them has met its expenses--that all are operating with deficits. We feel that it is indispensable that all the Greeks of our Diocese shall know this and shall realize the responsibility which every one of them bears for these conditions and the duty imposed upon each to register as a member of the church nearest to him and pay his dues regularly. From this obligation to register in their parishes the poor are not exempt, although they have been exempted from the payment of dues. The recognition of this obligation by all and their acceptance of it by registering and regularly paying their dues are the only means of securing for our churches and our schools the funds necessary to preserve them and to operate them; otherwise they will inevitably sooner or later be confronted with the necessity of closing their doors, a disastrous event for our national and religious existence here.</p>
   <p>"For these reasons we appeal to the devout and religious sentiments of you <span class="page-break">\3</span>all that you shall not neglect your duty to help your institutions financially if you desire them to remain open and to operate for your benefit. In case some of you disregard these urgent recommendations, this will be proof that these persons, by refusing to register and to help, voluntarily sever practically every tie and connection with the Church and prefer to stay outside its fold. All those who neglect to comply with these exhortations within two months from this date will lose their right to be served by the Church in their religious needs except that of the Holy Communion. "An order to this effect has been given to the trustees and the administrative councils of the churches of the Chicago district, and after two months from date they are to offer their services only to those who have paid their dues. From this requirement only the approved needy will be exempt, and these must be properly registered in their parishes as indigent persons. The Church adopts these measures with great sorrow and anguish because it perceives that only the co-operation of all who are interested and the contributions of all who have the means to alleviate the financial distress of our institutions here will make possible their operation in the future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Hoping that no one will fail to perform his duty, and that our Church will not find itself in the difficult position of having to enforce the above measures, we remain with felicitations and love, "Bishop Kallistos of San Francisco."</p>
   <p>Pastors' Union of Chicago (An Announcement)</p>
   <p>"Dear Brethren,</p>
   <p>"The Pastors' Union of the City of Chicago in its desire and its efforts to effect the uninterrupted operation of our institutions and to promote our spiritual life observes and recognizes that the financial problem is more important than anything else in the successful accomplishment of this purpose.</p>
   <p>"Our churches and schools are our national and religious centers in this country. Under their shelter we assemble in all the most important hours of our joys and our sorrows. From these sacred institutions we and our <span class="page-break">\5</span>children receive spiritual comfort and courage, and by means of them we preserve whatever we have in common as Greeks and Christians that is sacred and precious.</p>
   <p>"We your pastors, your spiritual leaders, hereby recommend and urge that you all as heads of families and as individuals read this very carefully, think about the purpose of its appeal to you and what it asks you to do, and hasten to register as members of the Church which serves you, which you need, and to which you will sooner or later go for assistance and consolation. The inexcusable indifference of many of our brethren exposes our institutions and our mission to grave danger.</p>
   <p>"As your pastors who are directly responsible for the preservation of these sacred institutions, we will not allow them to incur danger of dissolution. As administrators of the authority of the Church and the nation, as guardians of your spiritual welfare, and above all as the shepherds of your youth, we will not hereafter permit neglect, indifference, and malevolence to plot <span class="page-break">\6</span>against the very substance of the churches and schools of our city, thereby withering the faith, the love, and the ideals without which Greek Orthodox Christians cannot preserve their religion.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, our beloved, comply with this urgent appeal which is addressed to you by the Church through its pastors. Come and register as regular members in our churches and schools, take an active interest in them, and demonstrate your love for them. Any evasion or neglect on your part will result in moral and material injury to our community's life. It will also personally injure every one who does not comply promptly with this appeal, which is addressed to you in your own interest.</p>
   <p>"Confident that all you Greek brethren who constitute the Greek community of Chicago will find proper and right these recommendations of your spiritual leaders, we remain with love, invoking for you the grace of the Almighty and of <span class="page-break">\7</span>Jesus Christ our Lord,</p>
   <p>"Eirenaeos Tsourounakes, Eustathios Georgiades, Averkios Demakopoulos, Daniel Golemes, and Daniel Gamvriles, archimandrites; Markos Petrakes, Constantinos Papanikolaou, and Niketas Kesses, priests."</p>
   <p>These Are Our Comments</p>
   <p>And now we ask our pastors, the spiritual leaders and representatives of Jesus Christ and the Greek Orthodox Church, whether they are pleased and satisfied with their accomplishment when they read what they have written. Are these the shepherds whom we might have asked to lay down their lives for their flocks? What has the poor Greek immigrant laborer to expect after this statement by God's functionaries here? What comfort, consolation, or encouragement, moral or spiritual, is he likely to receive from these guardians of the Holy Scriptures and of the cannons of Orthodoxy? Where <span class="page-break">\8</span>could one find a worse example of extortion by a gang? Is it possible that institutions founded on love and charity should be preserved by threats and by insidious coercion which operates in times of calamity?</p>
   <p>What is the difference between a racketeer or a bandit with a gun in his hand and a clergyman (unfortunately an Orthodox Clergyman) who lies in wait to get your money, even though he knows that you are destitute, when one of your near ones and dear ones lies dead, and the question arises whom you shall pay, the undertaker, the cemetery, the institutions, or the pastor?</p>
   <p>And we have the example of a bishop who threatens to deny religious services to his flock and of pastors who proceed like collectors or gendarmes to get money in time of disaster, at a time when they ought to be organizing the community to supply food and shelter to the needy and the suffering among the Greek population as the two Greek apostates, so called, do in the Greek colony! And the pious pastors are doing all this under the pretext of <span class="page-break">\9</span>preserving the Greek churches and schools of Chicago!</p>
   <p>In Chicago, as we have written in another article, the strangest and most incredible things exist, and so we have this paradox, this threatening Union, that is to say, this gang, this racket of our clergymen!</p>
