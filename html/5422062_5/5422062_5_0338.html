   <p>The resolution of the former Archbishop of America, Mr. Alexander, to comply with the decision of the Patriarchal Legate, the Most Rev. Damaskinos, in connection with the resignation of the Right Rev. Bishop of Chicago, Mr. Philaretos, as well as that of Mr. Ioakim of Boston, puts an end to the strife of the Greeks of America as regards the church question.</p>
   <p>There remains the question of the withdrawl of the Bishop of San Francisco, Mr. Kallistos, but even that will take place, so that the church situation, causing the dissension, that so much embittered the Greeks of America, for so many years, will be abolished completely.</p>
   <p>It must be understood, that the struggle was being directed not against persons, but against the dividing regime that broke up the bonds with the Mother Church, and which as was natural influenced even the highest church dignitaries. It is logical, therefore, that Right Rev. Kallistos of San Francisco, withdraw, also, because his stay here will mean, necessarily, that the withdrawn Hierarchs were the cause of the division and that the Bishop of San Francisco was the carrier of peace.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>But, we refer to this in passing, as we consider the departure of Mr. Kallistos certain, and we simply mention it in order to say that with the withdrawal the persons involved, the first part of the Legate's mission is completed and gives room for the second and more important part, that of the regulation of the new regime, which will establish our dependence on the Mother Church completely, and will re-unite the bond of the Greek churches of America with the former.</p>
   <p>What still remains is the departure of the resigned Hierarchs, who still remind us of the unpleasant regime of division that existed before the eyes of the people for so long and the events that took place ever since the arrival of the Legate up to the time of the resignation of the bishops from their positions, and the activities of some of their followers. Their presence here unfortunately still creates ground for some justifiable suspicious, the possibility that the resignations might not be realized. Many express impatience and even are in doubt as to the effectiveness of the really perplexing task of the Most Legate, Mr. Damaskinos, who labored with so much wisdom for the disentanglement of the church situation, and, who has reached the universally desired result, without use of any forcible means and without resorting to cruder <span class="page-break">3</span>methods, for the execution of his great and national mission. It is also just and right to appreciate the compromising attitude of the former Hierarchs of America and specifically that of the Right Revs. Basileos Philaretos, and Ioakim, who hastened to place themselves under the instructions of the Legate, resigning willingly from their positions, and of the former Archbishop, himself, at the last moment. Their example, undoubtedly, will be followed by the Most Rev. Kallistos of San Francisco.</p>
   <p>We, at least, have not the slightest doubt, that whatever is announced so far, must be considered an accomplished fact, and to express to the Most. Rev. Legate Damaskinos our hearty congratulations on the manner in which be handled the first part of his mission, by which he brought about the reconciliation of both camps, and peace and harmony to the Greeks as a whole, an accomplishment for which we shall be everlastingly grateful to him. Due to the fact, however, that his return is most needed, and to give an end to any prevailing uneasiness, may we also urge a hastening of the other points that are to be decided upon and for His Holiness to make his decision more apparent. That is, in regards to the second part of the task, namely that the establishment of the new regime, should immediately commence, calling a meeting of representatives of all the communities of America, which will adopt the plan of the new church regime, that will restore our church bonds with those of the Mother Church.</p>
