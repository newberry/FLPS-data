   <p>We think that there is justification for our amazement at the definite mania or passion that has overtaken our community leaders, who, it seems, have been busy during the last two years purchasing lots and church buildings in Chicago.</p>
   <p>But we cannot understand why some of us want to increase the financial obligations of our community with an additional loan of $35,000. The lot which was bought for this huge amount of money was desired--and purchased--by only a small group of individuals. We cannot see why we should make unnecessary and unauthorized purchases of lots and church buildings at this time. Thus, by acting hurriedly, some of our leaders are causing great harm to the community. There is even danger of losing the only church building which we now own.</p>
   <p>It is our opinion that the Greek people of Chicago would prefer to have one, and only one, magnificent cathedral, as befits our prestige. We do not need more than one good church, however, for this cathedral would be sufficient.</p>
   <p>The nature of the work that our people are doing and the prevailing custom among the Greeks to attend church regularly every Sunday and on every important national or religious holiday, force them to travel three or four miles by train or streetcar in order to get to church. The distance to the single church which we will have will not prevent our people from going to church.</p>
   <p>The young and progressive men who are directing the destinies of our community affairs have absolute confidence in the generous spirit of our people. These men, however, should not abuse this generosity by spending the money of the community on unnecessary projects. Our present church buildings are enough to meet our present needs.</p>
   <p>Our responsible officials can well direct their attention to our educational and school needs and problems. These are important and immediate needs. Or do they think that the church contributes more than the school to the moral edification of the individual?</p>
   <p>Confident though we are of their vision and foresight in such questions, we rather think that they have not yet conceived of a practical idea for the establishment of a real school. The belief that the parents have to be first convinced of the effectiveness and perfect operation of the school before they will send their children to them is entirely wrong. In the past, the parents had to be assured, through various publicity channels, that it is now worth while to send their children to Greek school, since a goodly number of studentsare ready to attend. This method of securing a sufficient attendance of students is the result of the selfish and self-seeking motives of certain of our leaders.</p>
   <p>A modern, well-organized school with only the highest aims in mind, a school for the benefit of all the people, must operate regardless of the number of students that are willing to attend. A good school must continue giving instruction even when students are slow to enroll. It must have its doors open even when only three or five students are in attendance. Such a school cannot fail to equip the students with the finest moral and intellectual qualities.</p>
   <p>As soon as the first classes meet, as soon as it becomes evident that here is a school which will continue giving full, effective, and systematic instruction, the students will come without being urged. There will then be students coming not only from Chicago, but from other parts of the state as well.</p>
   <p>As in every other enterprise, in order for a school to succeed and do its work properly, there must be a well-planned and systematic way of getting things accomplished.</p>
   <p>But because we must take into account not only the age of the children but also the distance they must travel to and from school, we must build and maintain a boarding school and hire competent teachers for a kindergarten.</p>
   <p>But who can deny that we also need a good afternoon and evening school for the instruction and education of adults? This school can offer instruction on Sundays when the adults can afford to spend a few hours in study or in the classroom. Most of our young men are completely in the dark as far as a knowledge of the Greek language and history is concerned. Even those who pretend to be educated lack an adequate liberal education.</p>
   
   <p>So, it will be necessary for our teachers and priests to give additional instruction to at least two classes a week in various important and useful subjects. Why do not many Greeks who are in the professions, or who are educated, give lectures on many useful and interesting subjects?</p>
   <p>Let us try to impress upon the minds of the Greeks of Chicago that their mission in life is not merely to work, to make money, and to lead an animal existence, but to develop and improve socially and intellectually. In this way, they can be truly happy and content.</p>
   <p>We have observed that very few illiterate and ignorant persons have the ability to profit from the lessons and opportunities offered by our social environment and the world in which we live. Most of us need some sort of guidance and instruction from those who know.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, in a certain section of the city where most Greeks are found, and where laborers especially congregate, no effort is being made to enlighten the people, to point out what is wrong, and to teach humanitarianism and proper conduct.</p>
   <p>No serious or practical effort is being made for self-development and improvement among our people. Even our priests themselves are not doing or saying anything which will contribute to a fundamental improvement in our lives.</p>
