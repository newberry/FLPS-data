   <p>Honorable Sir, kindly publish my letter in your newspaper for the benefit of all concerned, and I beg to be held responsible for the veracity of its contents.</p>
   <p>The Patriarchate of Jerusalem, being in debt $3,000,000, decided to send Archbishop Panteleimon, to the United States, to collect contributions for the Agios Tafos of Jerusalem. This Holy Father Panteleimon, fortified with credentials from the Patriarchate, came to America and found a very rich field for the purpose.</p>
   <p>This Theologian and Hierarch of that branch of the Greek orthodox church, decided to immortalize the Scribbers and the Pharisees, became shrewd and cunning and for the sake of the almighty dollar, divided the Greek church of America. He built in New York a branch of the Jerusalem Patriarchate. The gullible Greeks of America, believing that the Greek church was indivisible, as long as it was headed by a hierarach of the seven Patriachates of Orthodoxy, followed him and generously contributed to the unfortunate Patriarchate of Jerusalem, <span class="page-break">\2</span>which was $3,000,000 in the red. The money, already collected, was not sent to the Patriarchate, but was and is used to keep this Archbishop and his clique in luxury in the American Metropolis.</p>
   <p>This is not a new practice of the clergy of Jerusalem. They undertake to build and run monasteries, and other branches of such institutions. It usually takes rivers of gold to keep these monasteries and their branches going. At the end of much extravagance they usually send the bill to the Jerusalem Patriarchate.</p>
   <p>Oh! gullible Greeks of America, do not send any more dollars to this Holy Father, who is one of the many that caused the Patriarchate to be $3,000,000 in debt. The Ecumenical Patriarch requested the Patriarch of Jerusalem to recall Archbishop Panteleimon.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
