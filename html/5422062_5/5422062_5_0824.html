   <p>Loxias for the first time in its history will go against its established rule and meddle in the affairs of a community. Because of the destruction by fire of Holy Trinity church the community is rent asunder with discussions for and against a new and larger church.</p>
   <p>Some maintain that the community cannot afford to build a new church and that consequently it is necessary to repair what is left of the old one. Others say that a new and much better church must be built to meet the growing needs of the community, and as to the cost, which according to plans will exceed $80,000 the community's credit is good, and it can borrow the money needed.</p>
   <p>The discussions pro and con are so heated that an explosion may occur at any time. Both sides of the argument are absolutely right. Those of one faction are very conservative, knowing that the treasury has no money for a new church and averring that we must be contented with the necessary repairs, etc., until the treasury is in a flourishing condition.</p>
   
   <p>They maintain that the community needs many things, but that because of lack of funds things must move slowly and steadily. Their argument is admirable and they are perfectly right.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the progressives, as they are called, maintain that since the community is growing and expanding with the advance of this new era and its ever-increasing needs, so likewise the community's institutions must grow and expand, modified and adjusted to the requirements of a new and progressive age. Chicago is growing, progressing, and keeping pace with the spirit of the times; therefore the Greek community must do likewise and meet the requirements of the upward trend. And so far as the needed money is concerned, the community must borrow it as other enterprises do when theybegin to build. The money needed is not on hand. When the new church is built, it will be an incentive to the parishoners to keep up the payments on the debt incurred. The community is not poor, and it is the largest of the Greek communities in Chicago. We must have courage to go ahead and have faith in our ability to repay money borrowed. We will mortgage the church, and it will pay for itself. That is the progressive spirit of to-day. Do not be too old-fashioned; meet the demands of the times, etc. Their argument is also perfectly sound.</p>
   
   <p>Things are in so inflammable a state that it requires only a match to start a great conflagration. And if the explosion really comes, church, school, and our children must suffer a great setback. Neither side will give ground. Right here Loxias goes against its principles and steps in to avert the anticipated calamity. It may be such a catastrophe that coming generations will feel the effects of it.</p>
   <p>Loxias suggests that the church does not belong exclusively to the church-goers but to every one, to the whole community. Other members of the community may not go to church so often as those who are members of the church, nevertheless, they should be consulted and asked to participate in a general church meeting. This meeting must include all the Greeks of the community, regardless of their station in life. Laborers, businessmen doctors, lawyers, teachers, housewives, priests, and above all coffee house proprietors (who never go to church) should come together. Put the proposition up to the whole assembly. Get everybody interested in it, and let all decide what is the best course to follow. When the whole community becomes interested, then responsibility appears and responsibility is the key to obtaining the needed money if the decision is for a new church.</p>
   
   <p>There is no doubt that the money could be obtained, and, that the new church could be built to satisfy the desire of one faction, but there must be unity, and the only way to have unity, amity, and peace is to consider the affairs of the community as the property of all- to make the members of the community realize and feel that it is their common property, and that it is the duty of all and to the interest of all to take care of that property. The difficulty whole community becomes interested. Let everybody vote for or against a new church; let everybody realize the importance of his vote and the consequences of the outcome one way or the other. When everybody is interested in a church or in any public enterprise, that church or other enterprise will not atrophy or lose its vitality. The interest of the whole community is the best interest and the most enduring also.</p>
   <p>It is easy to obtain a loan to build a new church, but loans have their responsibilities, and the responsibilities must be shouldered not by a few but by all the members of the community. Therefore make all the people of the community interested and consequently responsible.</p>
   
   <p>Loxias' suggestions are not one-sided and are not intended to hinder the activities of the community. They were given without any request by either side, and if they serve the purpose, well and good; if not, they may be disregarded. It is the sincere desire of this publication to avert a possible division in the community of the West Side, and if the plan suggested is inadequate, let us invent another plan which is better, but let us remain united. In union we shall find the solution.</p>
