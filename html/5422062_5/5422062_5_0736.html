   <p>Last Monday evening in the wonderful rooms of the White City the dance for the benefit of the Church and school of the North Side Greeks was given. It has been advertised for some time. About two thousand guests were present including the Greek consul general and his staff, the executive officers of local nationalistic organizations, scientists, reporters, and numerous proprietors of commercial establishments and their employees. Many Americans also attended, persons who have connections with the Greek Colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The event,considered from all angles was eminently successful; and as for the hospitality offered by the church's executive committee, it deserves a word of appreciation. In the big ball-room, under the musical spell of a large and up-to-date orchestra, were the European dances; in another room, with the same enthusiasm and skill, Greek dances were danced to Greek music.</p>
   <p>Perfect order was preserved, and an atmosphere of enthusiasm prevailed, the result of the executive committee's careful preparations was to make the whole affair a success. During the dance various drinks were served and fragrant flowers were <span class="page-break">2</span>distributed by the members of the executive committee and their assistants.</p>
   <p>The dance was over at 1:30 a.m., and all went home full of enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Saloniki, heartily congratulates the sponsors of this occasion.</p>
