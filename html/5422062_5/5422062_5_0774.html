   <p>There seems to be great resentment toward the small group of men who worked so earnestly to buy the Koimisis Tis Theotokou Church. Even the Archbishop of Rodostolou refused to send a priest to the parish because he did not approve.</p>
   <p>It is doubtful whether he is aware of the fact that 12,000 parishioners have been attending services--for twenty years--in a hovel; I will not say stable! Does he know that $500,000 has passed through the treasury of that church, which still is in debt, despite this money? Does he know that this hovel burned down two years ago, and that instead of endeavoring to build a new church, some of our unenlightened people insisted upon patching the wreck?....</p>
   <p>Does His Holiness know that the school of the church (?) [sic.] is situated <span class="page-break">2</span>next to large factories, and that the school raises money for its own support by giving theatrical performances?</p>
   <p>Does he know that no general board meeting was ever held to purchase a church, but that it was done by a small group, who had the progress and betterment of the community at heart?</p>
   <p>We are quite sure that His Holiness is not familiar with any of these facts. Mr. Xanthopoulos, our esteemed consul, is, therefore, requested to write to the Archbishop and enlighten him in regard to the affairs of this church. If he fails to send a priest he will, I am afraid, have to answer not to a few, but to 11,500 parishioners, who will be severe judges.</p>
