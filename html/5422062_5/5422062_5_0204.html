   <p>The situation in the executive affairs of Holy Trinity community became so bad, recently, that no matter how disgusted we were we feel duty bound to ring the alarm of danger and place the responsibility for it wholly upon its President and his irresponsible Councilor.</p>
   <p>Decision after decision is taken up every day against the Community, and under the pretence that for the sake of safety the proceeds are not deposited in the bank, the Treasurer, the President, and the Priest collect the money and nobody knows what's what:</p>
   <p>Furthermore, we are informed that bonds of the community are being sold for this or that thus defeating the purpose for which the bonds were issued.</p>
   <p>And this, in spite of the fact that $3,000 was given the school as a recompense for its deficit, and the destruction of the books, in order to conceal the real facts in the matter.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In view of this deplorable situation what is the President of the Community, Mr. Palevos, going to do and what does his councilor, Mr. D. Kominakis, advise him to do?</p>
