   <p>The statement is made here that since March 25, 1936, the first post of the organization Phalanx, composed of Greeks in America, who were veterans of Greece, has been organized in Chicago and has been functioning continuously.</p>
   <p>Its object is the continuation of our sacred struggles to save Greek Nationalism and preserve Greek ideals along-side the American ideals for the new generation which, in the main, composes the center of our mission. (Instructions follow as to how to organize in all parts of the country, wherever Greeks are found--Translator).</p>
   <p>In making this known to you, we appeal for a speedy national rally, under the protection of our one and undivided mother post. As in war times so today, we must move quickly. A much more extensive field of action is before us in time of peace. This field of honor in time of peace ought to motivate your daring, especially in those of you who, by their courage and bravery, carried through the triumphs of national liberty during the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>various struggles of Greece for freedom. There is no reason for you to live a life of privation and insignificance. Heroes should lift their heads with pride. Their struggles and sacrifices for the freedom, many millions subjected to slaver in Greece, entitle them to such a right. It is time that they seal their war-glory by the glory of a peace-time struggle, not at all inferior to war-battles. This achievement is assured by members of the mother post of Veterans of Greece, with all their hearts and souls.</p>
   <p>On the strength of our military decision, the re-enforcement of the Phalanx's friends, and the impartial support of the Greeks in America, the work of the Phalanx will be a success and new light will penetrate the minds of those who dream of a new Hellenic greatness, national and also world-wide.</p>
   <p>The executives of the newly organized Phalanx, with its members, greet the American Greek Veterans and remind them of their heroic deeds in Epiros, Macedonia, Thrace, the Islands and Asia Minor, and call upon them to organize.</p>
