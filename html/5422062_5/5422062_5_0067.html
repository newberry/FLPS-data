   <p>Every effort to modernize our ecclesiastical music is a good effort towards its progress and perfection; as, at present we endeavor to suppress, and if possible cling to the nasal tunes of the Byzantine music.</p>
   <p>But there are some songs and services of the mass which cannot very well be changed, altered or replaced by modernistic expressions, and some of them are the songs of the funeral services.</p>
   <p>Attending the funeral services of the late John Gavaris, we noticed that the effort to change the tune of that music was a failure, and resulted in confusion and discord, with a strange and bad effect on the audience, like the omission of some one at the funeral.</p>
   <p>What does the pastor of St. George have to say about it?</p>
