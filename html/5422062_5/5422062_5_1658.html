   <p>The inspiration which imbued the Pan-Arcadian Society to begin a campaign for the advertisement of Greek imports should pervade every Greek community in America. It is not at all difficult for each Greek businessman to tell his friends and business associates about the worth of Greek products. In other words, we can become what is popularly known as "boosters". What we say in praise of Greek products is by no means just patriotic oratory. Any expert will testify to the superiority of Greek cognac and brandy over the French.</p>
   <p>Greek merchants are to be commended because they handle and encourage the sale of imported products, even at loss to themselves. They are rendering inestimable service to the fatherland. However, they can not do very much alone....Even if every Greek in America were to drink nothing but cognac, it would still be impossible for the sale of cognac in America to be of any real benefit to Greece. What, then, can be done? Exactly what the Pan-Arcadian Society has suggested. We must create propaganda for Greek imports and become <span class="page-break">2</span>high-pressure salesmen to the American people.</p>
   <p>That is the only way in which the economic condition of Greece and, at the same time, that of our relatives in Greece, can be materially benefited. It is the first time we have been asked to do something for the old country which will not hurt our pocketbooks. But this campaign will be of more direct benefit than anything which our money can do.</p>
