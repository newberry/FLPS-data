   <p>All the Greeks of Chicago will be glad to be informed that their Community has entered upon a new era of reconciliation and peaceful development. The spirit for unified effort and sincere co-operation has begun to prevail in a Greek settlement which was badly and disastrously divided.</p>
   <p>This is the most pleasing news of the times, for through the co-operation and reconciliation of the two opposing political factions in the Community much can be done in the way of constructive reorganization. Only a month ago political wrangling was so violent and explosive in the Community that there seemed to be no prospect of peace.</p>
   <p>Indeed, now that the Sanitsas party is reconciled to the victorious and newly elected party of Dr. Chris Petroulas, work of great importance will be completed, <span class="page-break">\2</span>reflecting honor on our populous and progressive Greek Community of Chicago. It will raise this Community far above all other Greek communities in America, and rightly so, because the size of our Greek settlement warrants such a distinction.</p>
   <p>The turbulent election days will be quickly forgotten; the sarcastic give and take of the campaign will cease; thank God that the spirit of peace and harmony returned to Chicago. Victors and vanquished have now agreed; all have promised to work for the common good. This fact was greeted by all with shouts of joy. The Greek people of this city had grown sick and tired of the endless strife and arguments in courts and meeting halls. It is such demonstrations of blind passion, uncompromising stubbornness, and disunity that throw communities, organizations, and even entire nations backward; such activities creates anarchy, confusion, and internal disorganization. Ultimately, such small or large organizations are doomed to die ingloriously.</p>
   <p>But, now, the proud Greek Community of Chicago can raise its head high and say:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"I shall strive to accomplish great things; I shall become worthy of the good people who are working hard to establish the best schools and churches, to bring all classes of the Greek people together regardless of occupation, circumstance, or former allegiance."</p>
   <p>It is only fair that honor and praise should be given to all those who helped bring the two opposing parties together. Our fellow countrymen of the South Side, who now are ready to offer the new administration of the Community every possible support, deserve high praise. May all their hopes be fulfilled, especially their desire to build a new Greek church on the South Side. A magnificent church is to be built to serve those Greeks who are living at some distance from the Greek settlement in the neighborhood of Halsted Street. The sum of $15,000 is available for the purpose. So, our Community is solidly united behind an executive and administrative council which has the power and the ability to guide the common destinies and the vital interests of our community. It really would be useless to accomplish any great community task without the active support and friendship of the opposition, It would really <span class="page-break">\4</span>be a pity to have such a great community divided against itself. It would be a great injustice to regard the Spartan, the Athenian, the Tripolitan, the Argive, etc., as non-Greeks. We are all brothers, we are all Greeks regardless of what part of Greece each one of us comes from. Most of us have come to America with a common purpose and with one steadfast hope, and that is to return to our native land richer and more secure for the future. The prosperity which we look for in America, we hope, will insure us and our families in Greece against sickness and poverty. To obtain such security, however, and in order to secure full satisfaction for our future contentment and happiness, we must have unity, co-operation, mutual respect, and confidence in each other.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, a constructive spirit is prevailing in our community. The die is cast. We have made the irrevocable decision to patch up our former differences, co-operate, and unite--for in unity there is strength.</p>
   <p>We would not fail to mention the praiseworthy stand of Mr. John Rifakis, the <span class="page-break">\5</span>former treasurer of our Community, for not participating in the recent factional battles. This attitude on the part of Mr. Rifakis is deeply appreciated by the Greeks of Chicago who can now better appreciate his character and honesty. He kept close watch over our finances. Not even one penny was misappropriated during Mr. Rifakis' term of office and during the stormy debates of the election campaign. This is a most encouraging fact, because it shows that some of our community officials work without party considerations.</p>
   <p>Judging from the annual budget which was submitted to the council and the general membership of the community, one can easily see that we have before us a wide field of activity. Last year's balance sheet has shown a large surplus which will give the council the necessary funds with which to work out an excellent program of activities for the current year.</p>
   <p>Not only the regular members of the Church Community, but even the nonmembers are asked to co-operate in the application and enforcement of such a <span class="page-break">\6</span>pretentious program. We are sure that there will be no Greek in this Community who will not contribute toward the improvement of our church. No one will refuse to support our schools, our settlement house, and our small community centers. Our school personnel, our clergy, our press, and our consular officials must be supported by all who want a progressive, up-to-date, and ambitious community.</p>
   <p>What this Community needs most at this time, besides the school and church, is a hospital of our own. Can this dream of every Greek in Chicago come true? Every Greek will be proud of such an institution which will minister to the most urgent needs of our people. Not only will every Greek be, thus, properly treated and cured, but he will also be among his own people. The patient will have a great feeling of comfort on hearing his own language spoken and on seeing members of his own nationality around him. The erection and equipping of a hospital may seem like a difficult problem and a task requiring superhuman efforts. In spite of all, however, the project is feasible provided that there is sufficient discussion and systematic planning. It will be necessary to find <span class="page-break">\7</span>out how much money the Greek people of Chicago are spending aimlessly and fruitlessly. We must discover how many Greeks in the Chicago area will be served by a community hospital. The Greek Community of Chicago is large enough and prosperous enough to afford such an institution. Why should our people be forced to go to an American hospital when better treatment at more reasonable rates could be obtained in a hospital of our own? We can and should raise the money. We have a large number of excellent Greek doctors who would staff the hospital. What we now need is efficient campaigners and organizers who must convince the people of the need and usefulness of such a hospital.</p>
   <p>At any rate, if their appeal is not heeded, it is of the utmost importance to keep our people united. They must never lose sight of the great objectives which we have been setting forth in these editorials. Nor should they lose confidence in their leaders. Such a loss of confidence in our leaders would disrupt the normal development of our community life and would endanger our welfare and prosperity.</p>
