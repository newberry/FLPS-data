   <p>This coming Tuesday the young ladies of the Nea Genea club are giving their moonlight dance at Pilsen Park, 26th and Albany Ave.</p>
   <p>The wonderful inspiration of New Genea to give us a chance to dance under the stars must be supported by everyone.</p>
   <p>The endeavors of the young ladies have been such that we must help them out. There is, noreover, a philanthropic purpose behind it.</p>
   <p>There is, no doubt, but that the dance will be a success. The Hawaiian music will also add much to the enjoyment of the evening.</p>
