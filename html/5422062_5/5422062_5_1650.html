   <p>Greeks in America, or American Greeks, as they are called in Greece, are displaying a new interest in the political conditions of their motherland since there is now so much speculative talk about the possible return of the monarchy. Most of them, having grown up in America, cannot see for the life of them the rationality of calling back a former king to rule over the land--the land which first promulgated the principles of democracy. It is irrational and dangerous to restore the monarchy; but in postwar years nothing is improbable. Worse things than the restoration of a monarchy have taken place in the world during the last few years.</p>
   <p>The Greek nation is, perhaps, equally divided on the proposition of restoring the king.....This was not true five or ten years ago. Now, with economic <span class="page-break">\2</span>conditions not a whit better, and in the face of prevailing political strife, half of the people of Greece see in the restoration of the monarchy an orderly solution of all their problems.</p>
   <p>That the restoration of the monarchy under present conditions will of necessity bring about immediately or in the course of time the establishment of a dictatorial monarchy, such as exists in Bulgaria and Jugoslavia, cannot have entered the mind of the average pro-Royalist in Greece.</p>
