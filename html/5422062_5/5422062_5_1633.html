   <p>The cherished hope of the Hellenes of Chicago to make public their wholehearted admiration for one of the finest of the leaders of Greece was realized by them last Friday night. On that evening a dinner was given in honor of Mr. Alexander Papanastasiou, former labor leader of international note. Petty jealousies, rivalries, disputes, and political differences were forgotten by all. Co-operation helped make this dinner something to be long remembered.</p>
   <p>The head of the committee in charge was George Chiagouris....The Morrison Hotel was used as headquarters. Aside from Chiagouris, who handled the details of the menu and the speakers' program, Mr. George Becharas also did much to insure the success of the dinner by distributing and selling tickets. He was aided by A. Peponis and John Athas.....</p>

   <p>Recalling the various events in the history of the Hellenes, of Chicago, and bringing to mind their other brilliant dinners and dances, we have reached the undeniable conclusion that last Friday's dinner, given in the Palmer House was, by far the most outstanding social affair they have sponsored. The attendance was record-breaking. Greeks from every walk of life, of every political group, and of every type of environment were present. Although formality made them say they were going to an honorary dinner, actually they came to see and hear a great Greek patriot.</p>
   <p>Eight o'clock found all the guests seated, anxiously awaiting their first glimpse of the famous man. As soon as the tall dignified man made his entrance, the guests wildly cheered and applauded. The orchestra of Nick Varzos played the Greek national anthem, which was sung by all, giving them a great patriotic thrill.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The service was perfect, dinner being served as only the Palmer House can serve it. During the entire meal the orchestra played lovely Greek airs, making the setting purely Hellenic or Athenian.</p>
   <p>One of the men who worked very hard to insure the success of the dinner was Andrew Karzas. He acted as toastmaster of the dinner, and so sat at the right of the guest of honor. When dinner was over he started the speakers' program by welcoming the honored guest, calling him the "Father of Democracy". He then asked Dr. Constantine Theodore to be master of ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Dr. Theodore began by saying that he was speaking in behalf of the entire Greek community of Chicago. Then, addressing himself to Mr. Papanastasiou he said:</p>
   <p>"You are the man who has made humanity realize a part of its dream for <span class="page-break">4</span>freedom and happiness, and by doing so have stepped into the history of the Greek nation. You are the one who has summoned the goddess of democracy and restored her to her birthplace. We who have joyfully watched this take place greet you in the name of liberty."</p>
   <p>His speech ended with this lyric strain: "All shall soon see that only through the ascendancy of democratic ideals can Greece regain her former glory."</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Constantine Paleologas Mammon. First, he briefly reviewed the career of the guest of honor; then he defended the principles of democracy as outlined by him.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Mammon was followed by the young son of Mr. Chiagouris, who has just finished law school. He first welcomed the guest in English, and then, in flawless Greek welcomed him again in behalf of the Greek-American youth of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>One of the points he emphasized was that something be done by the Greek Department of Education for the Greek youth in America. "All of you are eagerly waiting to hear the words of our honored and beloved guest," he said; and so the young man turned and asked Mr. Papanastasiou to speak.</p>
   <p>He arose with the air of an experienced public speaker and began his talk, which lasted more than an hour. We are sorry not to be able to reproduce the entire speech; unfortunately, we are not acquainted with Greek short hand; so only the high lights of the speech are herein noted.</p>
   <p>"My Dear Fellow Countrymen and Countrywomen!...."This dinner will be one of my most pleasant and encouraging memories of American Greeks. Despite the fact that in the land where Plato was born it is considered useless to strive to achieve an ideal which seems hopeless, I gladly accept the title of dreamer. My entire life has been devoted to create equality <span class="page-break">6</span>and understanding among the various classes. I sincerely feel I must fight for the existence of a system which insures the lowliest individual the right to be a free man.</p>
   <p>"I distinctly recall the period which followed the War of 1897, when young men deserted their home towns to emigrate to America to make their fortunes. Watching them go, we were filled with qualms about their safety and existence, for they were all very young and uneducated. How could they succeed in a foreign, highly competitive land? We unconsciously compared the Greek emigrants to America with the Italian laborers who came to Greece to work on the construction of the Isthmus of Corinth. We all recoiled from the working and housing conditions endured by the workers and from their terribly low wages.</p>
   <p>"It did not take long for us to experience, however, benefits derived from the Greeks who had emigrated to America. The agricultural peasant class of Greece was powerless in the hands of cheating moneylenders, <span class="page-break">7</span>usurers, and landlords....Alone, they could never have paid off their debtors and prevented their families from dying of starvation. It was the money sent to the home town by a hard-working son or father in America that made all this possible. It is not difficult to imagine the fate of thousands of poor families in Greece if one of its male members had not courageously set out to lay tracks and open restaurants in the United States. If the drachma [a Greek coin] was kept from reaching a new low, it was due to the effect of the currency exchange between Greece and America. The contributions to Greece were so generous that there is not one small town which cannot boast of its road, church, school, hospital, or asylum which has been built by a typical society of Greeks in America. Sisters have been dowered, houses have been bought for old parents, entire families have been transplanted to America, and hospitalization and surgery has been provided for even the most distant relatives by the contributions of the sacrificing men [Greek immigrants] in this land. America has helped make Greece and we want to make Greece democratic and prosperous like America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>"A large part of the benefits came directly from the large population of Greeks in Chicago."</p>
