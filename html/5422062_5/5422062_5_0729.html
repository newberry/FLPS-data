   <p>From the columns of our friendly colleague, the Greek National Herald, we take the liberty of reprinting a communication from the Most Reverent Archbishop of North and South America on the independence of the Greek Orthodox churches in America: "From the legal point of view, and from that of the typical churchman we find the decision to be proper because when the decree of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was revoked, all authority was withdrawn from the Holy Synod of Greece, and all the churches in America were placed under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.</p>
   <p>"No one denies that the Ecumenical Patriarchate by its position and its history is the supreme ecclesiastical and nationalistic head and the religious center of our race, but it cannot respond to the liberal ideas of our present generation on account of its location, for it is subjected to constant persecution and restraint.</p>
   
   <p>"When the memorandum was drawn up and delivered by Mr. Palaiologos, conditions were harmonious and favorable for the complete success of the organization because the churches were under the jurisdiction of the Holy Synod, of which the position was stronger, since it was directly connected with the political center of Greece.</p>
   <p>"Nobody could have imagined that conditions would reach such a point as they now have reached under the present unrighteous government in Greece, and that the Greek colonies would be drawn into national storm, like ships following the ark in which for many years have been guarded the most idealistic and most charming dreams of our race.</p>
   <p>"We are developing in a different way in consequence of present conditions in Greece. We consider our decision as best and as a foundation-stone for the preservation of the racial integrity, the character, and the active force of our scattered Greeks.</p>
   
   <p>"For in the course of time there will be changes in people and in their conception of things, and we cannot foresee or foretell what will be the conceptions and the attitude of our descendants.</p>
   <p>"We have at all times proclaimed and instructed the authorities that our churches everywhere, especially our scattered churches, are not only for the worship of God and the cure of souls; they must also be significant national centers to serve the nation's interests as well as to satisfy the devout longings of the soul, a fact confirmed and attested by the history of Greece and by the privileges with which Greece has endowed the Patriarchate of Constantinople.</p>
   <p>"Up to this time we have struggled like true national heroes, but because we see that those who are in Greece are not conscious of their country's plight nor of where its true interests lie that they do not reveal sufficient strength of will to emulate the progress of other nations, and that our nationalistic conditions here are affected by the conditions which prevail in Greece, we must suppress all our desires for racial solidarity and accomplish our salvation independently.</p>
   
   <p>"Neither a man nor a nation can live well or harmoniously without heeding the proverb, "Know thyself."</p>
   <p>"In accordance with the letter printed above we believe that the new organization will not only achieve honor and success but will also become a model of church government to be imitated by the Church of Greece from which until yesterday we patiently awaited some benefit, and for which we have made so many sacrifices and endured so many bitter experiences.</p>
   <p>"Let our Church be governed by our Hellenism here both for the sake of the Greeks in America and for the benefit of our nation overseas. May our foundation be blessed by the high and mighty God, who is our Lord!"</p>
