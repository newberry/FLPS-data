   <p>p. 1.-- The former Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michalacopoulos, who, as we know, undertook while he was in office to solve the ecclesiastical question, now advises the Greeks of America to solve it themselves.</p>
   <p>This advice of Mr. Michalacopoulos's is like the procedure of the doctor who, unable to do anything for his patient, abandoned him to his own powers of resistance, or to nature, as the doctors say, or to God's mercy, as some express it.</p>
   <p>We have frequently given the same advice and encouraged various leaders of our community to come to an understanding on the method of solution, not because we believe that they can solve the ecclesiastical question by themselves, but in order that they may realize what the ecclesiastical question is and know what they must request of the Greek government, letting it know at last what the Greeks in America want. For as things <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>now are, the Greek government does not know what we want, and we do not know ourselves, and the whole affair has become a vicious circle, as vicious and as villainous as are the filthy monks who ride on the back of the Greek people of America.</p>
