   <p>We are informed that the Greek Orthodox Church which never permits itself, either by tradition or prefixed cannonical rules, to become stagnant, but always follows the necessities of the times has consented to participate and enter willingly the anticipated discussions of the changing of the Greek calendar.</p>
   <p>The Greek Orthodox Church has always maintained the indisputable fact, that in changing the date of a certain religious event, religion is not altered.</p>
   <p>Whether Easter Sunday, for instance, is celebrated on the first or second Sunday of April would not alter or change the religious significance of the event. The Greek Orthodox church always has advocated unity of action and function amongst the Christian Churches of the world.</p>
