   <p>With one of the most colorful ceremonies ever witnessed in Chicago - a ceremony lasting more than three hours and replete with old-world touches - Rt. Rev. Philaretos Joanides was consecrated as a bishop today at the St. Constantine Hellenic Orthodox Church, at Michigan Avenue and 61st street.</p>
   <p>The new prelate, who comes from the Seminary of St. Athanasius, in New York, will have as his See nine states in the middle west, including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Minnesota.</p>
   <p>As the ceremony, according to the Greek church rites, cannot take place without the presence of at least two archbishops - the usual number ranging from four to five - Archbishop Alexander of New York and the Metropolitan Theateiron of London were on hand to crown the new bishop with the mitre. They were assisted by many Cappadocian bishops and priests, both of the Greek and the Episcopal churches.</p>

   <p>The church was redolent with the heavy odor of incense and the perfume of flowers. The little shrines, the effigies of the saints - to which children were lifted up to kiss - were wreathed in flowers, while the pillars were entwined with greens, and the altar was gayly decorated with Greek and American flags and crimson peonies.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of candles were lighted by the parishioners who stood with bowed heads throughout the ceremony. Flower girls added to the festivity of the occasion by pinning blossoms to the coat lapels of the communicants and distributing peonies among the women.</p>
   <p>The processional was a pageant of Byzantine glamor, the vestment being embroidered with silk and gold -</p>
   <p>A Greek cross blazed over the altar as the attending chaplains crossed their candles in token of a blessing.</p>

   <p>The new bishop had prepared for the occasion, both by fasting and by a preliminary ceremony held the day before. He appeared first garbed in black. This vestment was removed and one of purple substituted. Finally, at the coronation, he was barged in white and gold.</p>
