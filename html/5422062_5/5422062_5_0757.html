   <p>Compromise in the political dispute now agitating the Greek Orthodox church in Chicago was reached today in the Superior Court of Judge Hugo Pam. It was agreed that Bishop Germanos Troianos, appointee of King Constantine should be permitted to attend service tomorrow at the church of St. Trinity, 1101 S. Peoria St., but that he should not attempt to speak or to take any part in the ritual.</p>
