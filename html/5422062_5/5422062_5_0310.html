   <p>Last Thursday, in the private parlors of St. Basil's Church, the Eusebeia Society of ladies served a dinner to its membership to which many others of our community were also invited, and all spent a delightful evening in a family circle with the Right Reverend Father Philaretos and other distinguished guests.</p>
   <p>We urge other ladies' organizations of our community to follow the example of this splendid society so that we may come into closer contact with our fellow-Greeks. It is necessary on account of the great distances that separate us to come together in such common gatherings, and fortunately the majority of our churches have private halls for such purposes.</p>
