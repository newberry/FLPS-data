   <p>Boys with their parents from six surrounding states will be here on September second to fourth inclusive to attend the District Convention of our junior Order. The program printed below, although it is tentative still, it will give you an idea that the Sons of this city are not asleep. Brother Peter J. Matsoukas, the Supreme Advisor of the Sons of this District, together with Charles G. Geanopulos, Supreme Secretary and W. J. Mavromatis, Supreme Treasurer, are working on the program to make sure that it is a success. On September third a dinner-dance will be given at the St. Demetrius Church and a number of notables will address the guests.</p>
   <p>We cannot urge you too greatly to make sure to attend the various functions. Now, let us all loosen up and give these boys a boost. If you feel old and weak, attend one of the boys' affairs and we assure you that you will leave feeling young and peppy!</p>
