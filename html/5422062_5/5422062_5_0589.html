   <p>The hope and wish of the South-Side Greeks is to raise money in order to rebuild the St. Constantine Church and school, hence we are giving our 17th annual dance at the Trianon, Dec. 27th, for that purpose. The South Siders as well as the rest of the Greeks are urgently invited to be present at the dance, which will be enriched by a vaudeville program.</p>
