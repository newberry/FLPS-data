   <p>Monday night was a brilliant one at the Greek pavilion. It was the scene of a dinner in honor of our ambassador, given by the Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago. The dinner began at eight in the evening, and was attended by more than two hundred Greeks and Americans. One of the notables present was Professor Morley of Northwestern University. The guest of honor was seated with other celebrities and the former presidents of the Club and their wives.</p>
   <p>The menu was fit for a gourmet. All the food was cooked under the supervision of Mr. Stamatopoulos, the famous chef brought from Greece by Mr. Mantas for the express purpose of being in charge of the food served in the pavilion. Dr. Despotes was the chairman of the evening, and he performed his duties very gracefully. During the dinner Mr. Dritsas, Greek Ambassador, Mr. Morley, and Mr. A. Pantelis delivered short addresses.</p>
   
   <p>Music was furnished by the orchestra of Mr. Grechis, and, after the dinner, a series of classical dances by the ballet of Mr. N. Tsoukalas, were presented.</p>
