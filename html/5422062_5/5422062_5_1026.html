   <p>Now that the excitement of the elections has died down, we expected to see harmony reign among the Greek people of Chicago. It seems that Dr. Petroulas should make a good president. The only trouble is that the Greeks refuse to cooperate.</p>
   <p>Every possible issue is disagreed upon by one side or another. They forget that we are all Greeks, of one language, in a strange country, who must stick together if we want to progress. From today, we must resolve to support one another, our nationality and our church. Dr. Petroulas is more than eager to bring about a central Greek community and we should help him all we can.</p>
   <p>At the next general meeting try to keep harmony and peace for the good of all the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
