   <p>P.1--In connection with the articles that we have already published on the subject of the clergy's attempt to assume absolute authority we deem it proper to define the terms parish and church for the sake of those who do not thoroughly understand their meaning and of those who are misled because others have given them the wrong conception of the terms.</p>
   <p>There are many who unwittingly confuse the two terms, and there are also those who purposely misinterpret their meaning to the masses, asserting that it is the duty of the clergy to conduct the affairs of the church and that laymen have no authority to engage in matters pertaining to the church.</p>
   <p>We therefore believe that it is absolutely necessary to define the terms relating to the church. Our first step will be to make the distinction between temple and church. Ordinarily, when we speak of the "Holy Trinity Church" or the "St. Constantine's Church" we mean the temple of the Holy Trinity or of St. Constantine, that is, the structure. The Church as a discipline or an organization, the affairs of the Church, the church authorities, and the clergy of the Church have no relation whatsoever with the term church used in the sense of the temple, the structure, which is also called church. For in ancient times the word church meant a forum or a place of congregation in which political matters were discussed somewhat as they are discussed in the assemblies or parliaments of our day.</p>
   <p>The present definition of Church (capitalized in English) is discipline or divine worship; it also means an organization. When we speak of the Orthodox Church we do not mean the temple or structure, and the head of the Church is not the head of the church structure. For instance, the head of the St. Basil's Church has no connection whatsoever with the church structure, properties, or administration. He may have some relationship with the spirit of St. Basil in the way of communing spiritually with this Saint or of interpreting his doctrines or of conducting the litanies of St. Basil. It is right and proper for him to perform these functions, for they fall under his ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but with the structure of St. Basil's Church or the financial affairs of St. Basil's parish this officer of the Church has no right to interfere, and church functionaries in general do not interfere in these matters, which fall under the jurisdiction of the parish.</p>
   <p>The parish, on the other hand, is a congregation composed of the laity, with its schools, orphanages, and churches, that is, its church structures including both chattel and real property. All these comprise the property of the parish. The members of the parish are those who contribute funds to support the various parish enterprises. The parish assumes the responsibility of selecting the proper physicians for its hospitals, the faculty of its schools, and the proper functionaries for its churches or temples. Just as the parish has no right to intervene in the duties of the physicians, the faculty, or the church functionaries, so none of these persons has the right to meddle in matters which are under the jurisdiction of the parish.</p>
   <p>These matters are so clearly defined and so well established that we are amazed at the boldness of a certain clergyman in even harboring in his mind the idea of subverting an order of things so solidly established, not to speak of going so far as to alter the order of the Greek Orthodox Church, which for centuries has upheld the principle set forth in the words of the Lord, "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's." Nowhere in history do we find the account of a Greek parish which was governed by the clergy.</p>
   <p>Most important of all, however, in the fact that this particular clergyman was successful in influencing even the wisest and most intelligent Greek citizens of our community, who of course were unaware of the real state of affairs, to yield to his most preposterous and entirely senseless suggestions and plans. This fact seems the more astounding when we realize that this very same clergyman for many years was responsible for our continued ecclesiastical disunion by reason of his efforts to bring about the absolute authority of the clergy and rule jointly with Philaretos, whom he made a bishop and directed as he pleased, over the disintegrated Greek Church. Another fact which also seems astounding is that this clergyman was successful in influencing the board of directors of St. Basil's Church to elect as its chairman the Archbishop himself and by so doing to confuse the business of the Church with that of the parish!</p>
   <p>Only under a Bolshevik regime do we find the clergy dominating the parish and the worker controlling the factory. If this well-known clergyman has become a Bolshevik and is desirous of having the Church adhere to his Bolshevik administration, all is well, but this poor silly creature must learn that in a well-established and well-regulated state there is no room for Bolshevik principles, for as the Bible says, "No man can have two masters; ye cannot serve God and Mammon." Our Church has no desire to introduce a Bolshevik administration, nor does it wish to be involved in the real-estate business, for this business is the parish's affair, and this clergyman had better refrain from meddling in it. The Philaretic period, when Bishop Philaretos was in power, and when our beloved parson entered the real-estate business by being influential in the purchase of the structure of St. Basil's Church and of the cemetery, is a thing of the past. In the present new state of affairs we earnestly hope (and we have not the slightest doubt that our hope will be fulfilled) that the things and the persons responsible for the chaotic condition of our Church will be put in their proper places. We have absolute confidence that our prediction will come true.</p>
