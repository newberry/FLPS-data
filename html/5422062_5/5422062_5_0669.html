   <p>P. 1 - The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has sent the following telegram to the Greek Archbishop of America, by him transmitted to Bishop Philaretos of Chicago: "Metropolitan of Haldea, formerly of Mythemnes, is demoted from rank of archbishop and lowered to the class of layman. Ecclesiastical decision follows by mail. Ecumenical Patriarch Gregorios."</p>
   <p>It is well known that the Metropolitan of Haldea, Vasilios, who came to the United States about two years ago without the permission of the Patriarchate, was the cause of many scandals in various Greek communities. By his actions he lowered the dignity and the prestige of the Greek Orthodox Church. Ordered by the Patriarch to return, he disobeyed in a manner unbecoming to a clergyman.</p>
   <p>Although he was ordered to desist from his official activities, he continued to perform the functions of an archbishop and ordained as priests various idle and illiterate drones.</p>
   <p>For this reason his punishment by demotion was not only just but imperative.</p>
