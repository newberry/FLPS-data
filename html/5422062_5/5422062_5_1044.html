   <p>p. 3.- We deplore the conduct of Mr. Alkibiades Seraphic at a recent meeting where he grossly insulted the president of the Greek Community of Chicago. He must have forgotten that he is employed by the United States government. He lacked dignity and acted at this meeting as if he were in some low tavern.</p>
   <p>Perhaps, because he is an employee of the United States government, he considers himself superior to the president of the Greek Community. Either of the above reasons is a very poor excuse for Mr. Seraphic's behavior. We hope he will learn to be a gentleman before attending any future meetings.</p>
