   <p>Last Sunday evening, the priest of the church of St. Constantine, Rev. Marcus Petrakis arranged for a small dance in the hall of the church for about 100 young people and many parents. Refreshments were served, donated by women of the community.</p>
   <p>Rev. Petrakis is always promoting means for keeping the Greek boys and girls interested in the Greek church and Greek community life. He is to be congratulated on the progress and success of the purpose, and we wish him further success in his efforts.</p>
