   <p>According to our esteemed colleague, The Chicago Tribune,a report was received from Washington, D. C. to the effect that thousands upon thousands of undesirable aliens are entering the United States daily in spite of strict immigration laws.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star has dealt with the immigration question many times in the past, thus, arousing the interest of our community. Because most of us had to conform to the existing immigration laws, it is only natural that we desire to know how the immigrant will fare under new requirements in a strange and new world. The Greek people of Chicago, that is, most of our fellow countrymen, can remember the doubts and fears that possessed us upon our arrival in the New World. Almost all of us were afraid that we would not be admitted or that the entrance requirements would be extremely stiff; we looked and acted our best. Who does not remember the medical and physical examinations at Ellis Island <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and sometimes the grueling questioning of United States immigration officials?</p>
   <p>According to The Chicago Tribune, the United States Government is contemplating changing or amending the existing immigration laws in the interest of the country. The recent report of the Congressional Committee on Immigration as well as the recommendations of the immigration authorities of New York, especially, stress the need for radical changes in the present immigration laws.</p>
   <p>It is reliably reported that besides the undesirable aliens who are finding their way into the United States apparently without any great difficulty for some unexplained reason, there are many thousand criminals, smugglers, and other despicable characters engaged in white slavery. It has also been discovered that many thousand Chinese are making their way into this country while the authorities who are held responsible for this matter can do little to prevent their entry into the United States.</p>
   <p>According to the lengthy statistical and factual report of the United States <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Immigration Department, and according to other experts, even though the immigration laws are quite strict, nonetheless, they seem to be very elastic; this accounts for the multiplicity of ways in which the laws are easily misinterpreted by clever lawyers who succeed in legalizing the entry of various immigrants into the United States. We, here in Chicago, know that hundreds of Greeks have succeeded in entering the United States by various under-handed methods. Some of them have come here indirectly through Canada and Mexico, while others have been smuggled in secretly.</p>
   <p>Even though more than $500,000 is spent annually for salaries and expenses of secret agents, supervisors, and inspectors, the United States Immigration Department has not been able to check the steady stream of criminal elements which is flooding this hospitable and tolerant land.</p>
   <p>Finally, the Committee on Immigration which issued its highly interesting and very important report, which is to be submitted to the United States Congress <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>for consideration, recommends the adoption of most drastic measures to curb the immigration evils. It is urgently recommended that new laws be made or old ones amended to prevent undesirable aliens and all types of criminals from gaining admission into the United States.</p>
   <p>It is the firm opinion of The Greek Star that this country should accept all immigrants gladly regardless of nationality as long as they respect the Federal, State, and local laws; as long as they come to the United States for the purpose of living peacefully, working hard, and as long as they are willing to respect the rights of others.</p>
   <p>Of course, we admit that there is much prejudice and hatred against many aliens. If they deserve it and if they have violated the laws, they must be punished and deported. The immigration laws must be stiffened sufficiently to refuse admittance to those who will always be a liability to the United States instead of an asset.</p>
