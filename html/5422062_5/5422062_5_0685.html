   <p>Amusement lovers had an unforgettably good time, August 24, 1923, in the magnificent Trianon Ballroom. The very progressive association, "The New Generation," which is composed of Greek girls exclusively, from the South Side of Chicago, held an affair there.</p>
   <p>More than fifteen hundred couples danced on the floor of that beautiful ballroom, while an equal number sat in the comfortable chairs of the Trianon, watching the dancers.</p>
   <p>The assiduous concern of the members of the association, prior to and during the dance, the attractive ballroom of the Trianon, and the wholehearted moral and material support of our [fellow] countrymen contributed to the wonderful success of the dance, and made possible the complete enjoyment of those who attended.</p>
