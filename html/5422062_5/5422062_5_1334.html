   <p>The following Sons of Pericles were recently initiated into the Ahepa: John Nicholas, Dan Manos, Peter Williams, Tom and James Psirris, Ted Varveras, F. Sarantopoupos, Christ Cristos and Gus Copoulos. Congratulations ! ! !</p>
   <p>The Sons of Pericles, Ypsilanti Chapter No. 22, greatly appreciate the chairman of the advisory board, Mr. Van Nomikos. In addition to co-operating with them in their various functions and meetings, he has (Hey!! Skin-ney!!) given free passes to his theatres to all the members of the chapter. The younger generation need more men like Nomikos.</p>
