   <p>The United States summons its people on another expedition to hasten the termination of the war and secure victory.</p>
   <p>The expedition is to collect $16.40 from every man, woman, and child in the city of Chicago through War Savings certificates and Thrift stamps.</p>
   <p>In other words, the Government for the months of December and January will borrow $4.12 and after five years will pay five dollars. For borrowing $82.40 it will pay $100.</p>
   <p>Begin with a Thrift stamp of twenty five cents, and when you have sixteen of them, the Post Office will give you in exchange one certificate. This certificate will bear your name and address, and in case of loss a duplicate will be issued.</p>

   <p>It is the best way of saving and especially for children it is the beginning of practical wisdom so far as saving is concerned. It is the best Christmas present a thousand times better than the useless Christmas present that we are accustomed to give.</p>
   <p>Every Greek individual in Chicago should buy War Savings certificates because it is not only profitable but also patriotic. The voice of our country is calling us, and we who feel faith, love, and loyalty to her must not remain deaf nor justify our deafness with the excuse that we have already bought Liberty bonds. Our country is calling us, and we must respond not once, twice, or thrice, but everytime and at all times when she calls us. If our country is defeated there will be no security for anybody. Your family, your property, and your life will become the property of the oppressor.</p>
   <p>Let us Greeks in Chicago become the example for others to follow as we did with the two Liberty Loans. Buy War Savings certificates! America is calling us.</p>
