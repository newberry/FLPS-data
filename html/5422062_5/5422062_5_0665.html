   <p>p. 3-The Greek consulate of Chicago hereby notifies the Greek communities of its district that according to a communication received by the Greek minister at Washington, D. C. from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece has recognized the revocation of its late decree, and that hereafter all the Greek communities outside Greece will again be under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.</p>
   <p>In communicating this order the consulate also announces that the Holy Synod by its order No. 1022 of May 19, 1924, by which it recognizes this revocation, also abolishes the office of exarch in this country and so leaves all the Greek communities here free to recognize the archdiocese and its bishops.</p>
   <p>Therefore the only recognized ecclesiastical authority will be recognized as legal in Greece, and any of others will be null and void.</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 10, 1924. L. Matles, Consul General of Greece.</p>
