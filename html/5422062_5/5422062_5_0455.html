   <p>p. 1. -- Those who have followed our articles on the ecclesiastical matter know very well that our struggle is a struggle against a spurious ecclesiastical regime which has split the Greek communities of America in two and is keeping them divided to the detriment of our racial interests.</p>
   <p>Now, if there are some who do not want to know the truth, or who through self-interest support this spurious ecclesiastical creation of the Rodostolian Church, attributing to us malign intentions and asserting that we are making all this noise for personal reasons, we assure them that they are mistaken and are victims of their ignorance.</p>
   <p>But the question whether we are sincere or malicious, in itself, amounts to little after all, if what we have published corresponds with the facts and the truth, and we say:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"If we have spoken falsely, let them correct us; if not, why blame us?"</p>
   <p>We have stated further that the matter of the dismissal or the resignation of the former pastor of St. Basil's Church, the Reverend Father Paschalakis, is one which we do not consider of any consequence in itself. We only have discussed it to show the plight of the Rodostolian Church.</p>
   <p>We have dealt with it in order to demonstrate to the public how insincere are the clergy of the Rodostolian Church among themselves, how deceitful in their relations, how they plot against one another, and what esteem their priests have for their bishops.</p>
   <p>The committee of St. Basil's Church have declared that they will go so far as to resign if the Bishop does not dismiss Paschalakis, and replace him by a married priest.</p>
   <p>We have just pulled a fold of the stage curtain aside to let the people see the Rodostolian operations behind the scenes. Now they have certainly <span class="page-break">\3</span>been disturbed by our revelations, and they are trying to muddy the waters by representing us as distorters of truth and also by contradicting - what? - That which everybody knows.</p>
   <p>Isn't it confessed by all that the former pastor of St. Basil's Church, Paschalakis, was also president of St. Basil's Ladies Society, and that we have published the fact, time and again, without being refuted by anybody - and that we blamed the ladies for tolerating such a thing, on account of which many of them resigned?</p>
   <p>Now they tell us that a lady is president of the society, Mr. Paschalakis having resigned. But it is precisely this fact which manifestly proves that we are right in our contention, and which gives us the right to state that the Greek Daily has put things in their proper place.</p>
   <p>When a priest is made president of a ladies' society, do you expect things to go unnoticed and without comment, especially when such a priest is robust and powerful, amiable and jovial, so that everybody wants to see the priest?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>They blame us for satirizing the matter. But, Pharisees and hypocrites, once you have committed such an error, do you expect us to spare you and in addition to praise you for what you have done?</p>
