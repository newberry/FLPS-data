   <p>We dealt in our last issue with a grave scandal in which Bishop Philaretos with his presbytery are the principal actors. The scandal is due to the Bishop's violation of the Church canons in conducting in common with a heretic bishop and heretic priests, in a heretic church, a ritual ceremony, though he is aware that the Greek Orthodox Church does not admit into her fold nor recognize those who adhere to other dogmas, that our Church is truly faithful.</p>
   <p>We characterized this action on the part of Bishop Philaretos as a grave ecclesiastical scandal, involing grave responsibilities and penalties. We proceed today to justify our characterization according to the Church canons which he so shamelessly violated along with the priests whom he induced to join in that violation. Here is what Canon 45 of the Apostles says:</p>
   <p>Any Bishop or presbyter or deacon who shall pray with</p>
   <p>heretics shall be cursed.</p>
   
   <p>Moreover, Canon 33 of the Synod of Laodicea reads:</p>
   <p>It is not becoming to pray together with heretics and schismatics.</p>
   <p>In view of these particular interdictions we ask any one who is able to read the above canons: Did Bishop Philaretos and the presbyters along with him violate the canons of the Church? Who ever gave them the right to make such close contact with heretic bishops and clergymen in violation of the Church canons? What are the reasons for such conduct? For certainly there must be some reason for this attitude of theirs, which doubtless they dare not avow. But their offense is so manifest and their attitude is so arrogant, that they plainly will not heed anyone as long as there remain many credulous persons among our compatriots who follow them and believe that whatever they do is well done.</p>
   <p>To whom do they owe an apology for their conduct?</p>
   <p>Their ecclesiastical creation depends on no ecclesiastical authority.</p>
   
   <p>They are outside all jurisdiction whatsoever. Neither the Holy Synod of Greece nor the Patriarchate of Constantinople has the least authority over them in spite of their assertion that they are dependent on the Patriarchate in order to deceive the people and calumniate those who ignore them.</p>
   <p>And yet these persons are violators of the Church canons, excerpts from which we have cited above. Who is to judge and try them? Who ever judged and tried the priest Hazidimitri for blessing a Protestant marriage?</p>
   <p>Lo, the results of the establishment of an independent Church in America! Let its supporters take a look at it.</p>
   <p>It is high time to realize into what chaos they are bringing the Greek populace of America, these self-appointed ecclesiastical leaders, and what sinister schemes they are weaving which they have fortunately begun to put into effect early enough to make it possible for us to understand them easily, namely:</p>
   <p>To loot the property of the communities and to govern them arbitrarily; and</p>
   <p>To desert the Orthodox religion and bring our churches under the jurisdiction of heretics, with whom they have begun to associate themselves, conducting holy rites in conjunction with them so as to pave the way and accustom our people to such procedure.</p>
   <p>These sinister schemes of the Rodostolian Church and these systematic activities of Bishop Philaretos and his patron priest Hazidimitri we were unwilling to let pass without protest, and we have no doubt that their supporters finally will realize that these people are serving their own interests for the sake of which they are capable of doing anything.</p>
