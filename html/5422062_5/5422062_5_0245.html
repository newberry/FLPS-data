   <p>p. 1- The solution of our church problem and the union of the Greeks in America under one ecclesiastical authority have depended largely upon the organization of Hellenism in the United States - a task heretofore impracticable without the existence of a sole ecclesiastical authority.</p>
   <p>But now the happy moment of the realization of unity among the Greek churches has finally arrived, and the entire Hellenism of America has been subjected to one ecclesiastical authority, through which it expects to enjoy unity and organization.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the task of reorganization and of reestablishing matters in their former status is not a simple one, and we are not inclined to believe that through the touch of a magic wand or the rubbing of Aladdin's lamp matters will undergo a metamorphosis and be restored as they were. On <span class="page-break">2</span>the contrary, the task of reconstruction and of rehabilitation will be gigantic, and it will be a long time before the act of reorganization becomes a reality, and the ruins which were left behind by the collapse and disintegration of the Greek Church are restored.</p>
   <p>We are well aware that the catastrophe was so devastating that Archbishop Athenagoras has to labor diligently to restore order, and because of this we believe that it is the duty of the members of all the Greek parishes throughout the United States to collaborate with him so as to lighten his great task of restoring and reorganizing Greek-American religious communities.</p>
   <p>The great forward step toward recognition of one ecclesiastical authority and obedience to it was actuated by the patriarchal exarch, Mr. Damaskinos, and all the obstacles and barriers that would have confronted our new ecclesiastical leader upon his arrival here were dealt with in such fashion by the exarch that when Mr. Athenagoras arriven in America, he found all the parishes and their priests united and under his ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In other words, our ecclesiastical problem had already been solved, and the Greeks in America had already unanimously recognized the new status of the Greek Church.</p>
   <p>All that the Archbishop had to do was to acquaint himself with the new ecclesiastical state of affairs and to begin the task of reorganization. After Mr. Athenagoras's arrival we became convinced that the way for him to get an accurate conception of the condition of the Greek Church and to orient himself in the present state of affairs was to visit, in person, the various Greek communities of America and acquaint himself intimately with persons and facts so that he might himself gain a clear idea of conditions and not depend on other sources and channels for his knowledge.</p>
   <p>Since then, however, we have been delighted to observe that the Archbishop did find occasion to visit various Greek communities and to reach even our own community, Chicago; and in spite of the fact that his visit to us was very brief, he learned much concerning us, and he now has a clear picture of the present status of the community affairs of the Greeks in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>We believe that it is time to begin the work of reorganization, and there is no doubt that the Most Reverend Archbishop Athenagoras has already drawn up plans along these lines, and that the Greeks in America are impatiently waiting to see these plans materialize.</p>
   <p>Chicago, at any rate, is anxiously waiting for Mr. Athenagoras's arrival, for he has given his promise that he will be here about the early part of May to undertake the task of reorganizing the parishes of one of the largest Greek communities in the United States. His presence in this city is imperatively required, for it is time for our numerous unsettled affairs to be put in order.</p>
   <p>There is not a particle of doubt that Mr. Athenagoras will keep his promise to our community and we wish to assure him that the Greek community of Chicago is anxiously waiting for his prompt arrival in this city so that he may by his illustrious instruction and guidance aid the community in settling its problems.</p>
