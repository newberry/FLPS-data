   <p>p. 1- This year's dancing activities will begin with a dance to be given by the young ladies of the South Side at the Palmer House on this coming Monday, Oct. 11.</p>
   <p>This group of brilliant young ladies bears the encouraging name New Generation and has always helped the community by its activities. This delightful evening dance which they are arranging will benefit the Greek public as usual, for not only the enjoyment of the dance is to be considered but also the fact that the proceeds of the affair will be used for charitable purposes. These young ladies of the South Side have always devoted the profits of their gala occasions to national and philanthropic enterprises. We are always ready to write to any length about the activities of this group.</p>
