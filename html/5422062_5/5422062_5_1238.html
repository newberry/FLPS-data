   <p>Last Monday there arrived from Greece H. Maurikides, Secretary at the American Legation in Athens, Greece. Mr. Maurikides, twelve years ago, was a citizen of Chicago and is well-known among the Greeks. He is the founder of the Athens Post of the American Legion, and came to the United States as a delegate of the Post to the 10th Convention of the Legion, which will take place at San Antonio, Texas, on Oct. 10th. After he was entertained by many friends, he left for the Convention, promising to return to Chicago for a the ten days sojourn.</p>
   <p>He has two resolutions of the Athens Post to present at the Convention, and we have no doubt that the general assembly will pass upon them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The first is to demand that a law be passed by the United States Congress permitting Greek veterans, who served honorably in the United States Army and are good citizens, to bring to America their wives and children above the quota of the immigration law. These Greek boys who fought for the Stars and Stripes and are good American citizens, wish to be permanently established here with their families.</p>
   <p>The second resolution is, that the American Legion, as a whole, through its Executive Committee, assist the Athens Post, financially, to build in Athens an edifice of the Legion, which will serve as a meeting place for every American who visits the Greek capital.</p>
