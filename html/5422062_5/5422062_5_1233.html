   <p>p. 2.- Mr. Editor of Saloniki:</p>
   <p>In the name of all disabled Greek veterans of the World War, who are receiving government hospitalization here, I hasten to express our appreciation and gratitude for your kindness and generosity in mailing a copy of your publication to each one of our Greek boys here. Mr. Editor, every Monday, the day on which we receive your newspaper is like a holiday to us, because it makes us feel that we are not forgotten by our fellow Greeks. It is just like a stimulant to the mind and body to read the affairs of the Greek community and the affairs of our beloved Greece.</p>
   <p>Also, kindly convey our appreciation to Hellenic Post No. 343 of the American Legion, and especially to John Giannikakis, for their kind visit and for the presents they brought to us. Such visits from the outside world make us forget our troubles and pains, and feel that we still are members of this great commonwealth.</p>

   <p>Thanking you all from the bottom of our heart we respectfully remain,</p>
   <p>Disabled Veterans of the U.S.N.H.</p>
   <p>Great Lakes, Ill.</p>
   <p>By Michael Maistros.</p>
