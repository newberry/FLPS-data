   <p>Mr. James Manousopoulos, the chairman of the governing board of the Greek Community of Chicago, has failed to answer my question, the third one thus far, in regard to the sending of the annual church contribution to the Greek church headquarters, the Holy Synod of Greece, at Athens, Greece, on January 6, 1907. What else is this failure of the head of our church community to answer our insistent interpellation, other than an admission of guilt?</p>
   <p>Secondly, I challenge the Reverend Archimandrite Leon Pygeas (1) to divulge the names of the witnesses who were present at the time the community board and the Reverend Pygeas questioned those who were suspected of mishandling or fraudulently diverting church funds; 2) to tell us when and by whom were the depositions of the defendants approved when there were no witnesses present; 3) to state who wrote and signed the sworn statements of the defendants <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the case when there were none but illiterate witnesses present. And 4), the community would like to know whether or not Mr. Gregory Papaeliou, who accused me of being a moral accomplice in the fraud, conducted the questionings.</p>
   <p>Those of our leaders who are making such loud boasts about their integrity and virtuous conduct in office should tell the truth and avoid every injustice. Is it not so, gentlemen of the church board? We are waiting for an explanation.</p>
   <p>(Signed) The Reverend Archimandrite Cyril A. Georgiadis.</p>
