   <p>The oldest living resident of Chicago today is 104-year-old Michael Adamski, who lives at 84th Street and Houston Avenue, South Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamski suffered a broken leg yesterday when a train knocked him down as he was passing the Baltimore and Ohio railroad crossing. The injury did not endanger the life of the centenarian, and he hopes to recover shortly so that he may be able to sue the railroad. He contends that he will live to see the Fair in 1893.</p>
   <p>A reporter from the Herald paid Michael Adamski a visit yesterday and wrote an interview about him.</p>
   <p>According to the report, Mr. Adamski, despite his many years, is in good physical condition. Although his voice is somewhat weak his conversation is altogether intelligent. He has been in America for fifty-five years, but does not speak English. Michael Adamski is five and one-half feet tall, weighs one hundred and forty-five pounds, and, according to his neighbors, performs the duties about his home like a person of forty. He lives in his own home, which he purchased from his savings in his younger years. Adamski keeps a fine garden, has several cows and chickens, and lives off the income he gets for the sale of milk and other produce.</p>
   <p>He was born in Poland on December 24, 1788. When living under Prussian dominance became unbearable, Mr. Adamski left his native land and came to America in 1837. All his life he worked hard, and the small home in which he lives is his only possession.</p>
   <p>"I married over seventy years ago," he said. "My wife was only nineteen when we were married. We had six sons and three daughters, but of these only two of my daughters are alive today. Both are married. I have only two grandchildren," continued Mr. Adamski.</p>
   <p>When he spoke about the death of his children tears filled his eyes. When he was asked how he felt he replied:</p>
   <p>"I have always been in good physical condition. Through all my years I have never been sick more than a week. My working duties were always performed. The thought of death has never entered my mind."</p>
   <p>As to his accident, Mr. Adamski explained that he was carrying a bag of meal for his cows across the railroad tracks when a train came upon him from a side track. He claims that this incident occurred because of the anger of the engineer, who at first tried to burn him by letting steam out from a side valve and then advanced the train toward him. The engineer and fireman laughed at him afterwards, said Mr. Adamski. According to him, the railroad men in South Chicago are hostile to the Polish people, and disregard their safety and play practical jokes on them which may sometimes prove fatal.</p>
   <p>The recovery of Michael Adamski is highly probable. We wish him good health and hope that he lives to be 150 years old.</p>
