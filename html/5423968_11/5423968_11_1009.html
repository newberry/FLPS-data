   <p>I wish to express my sincere thanks to all citizens of Polish descent in Chicage, regardless of political affiliations, for their unanimous votes which elected me to the office of city treasurer. The confidence of my countrymen is dearer to me than the office itself. I will always appreciate it, and will endeavor to repay this confidence in faithful service. Thank you countrymen.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer.</p>
