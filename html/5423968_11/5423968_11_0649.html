   <p>The board of directors of the P. N. A. greeted Paderewski after the conclusion of his Saturday night concert in Chicago. A summary of his speech reveals that our maestro Ignacy Paderewski knows our Polish conditions in general, and is very familiar with them.</p>
   <p>Two main thoughts are in his mind. We sketch them shortly for you. One is "to remember that you live and strive not only for your own sake, but also for the nation." The second thought concerns the preservation of our nation. But he spoke nothing of that because, knowing us and being here, he has convinced himself that we fulfill this duty of preservation.</p>
   <p>We thank Paderewski for his kind and good words and his practical advice.</p>
