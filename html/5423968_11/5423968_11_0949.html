   <p>John F. Smulski yesterday transmitted to Mayor Dunne and the council his resignation as city attorney. The resignation will be accepted and the office will lapse under the new charter act, which makes the office of corporation counsel the city law department and abolishes the office of city attorney.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smulski is the Republican nominee for state treasurer and expects in a few days to give his entire time to the pending campaign. Isadore H. Himes, Mr. Smulski's first assistant, resigned Monday. Mr. Himes is one of the Republican nominees for municipal court judge.</p>

   <p>Mr. Smulski in taking his leave of office reports that from May 1 until Oct. 1 his office has disposed of 804 cases, with total judgments against the city of $153,171. This showing is made as against judgment's aggregating $506,302.35 in 1899, $600,173.16 in 1900, $546,968.06 in 1901, $848,775 in 1902; from Jan. 1, until April 21, 1903, $312,965. Mr. Smulski assumed the duties of his office April 21, 1903.</p>
   <p>Showing Made In Office.</p>
   <p>"For the remainder of the year 1903 under my incumbency," Mr. Smulski reports, "we disposed of one-third more cases than in the preceding part of the year and the judgments against the city were $192,348; in 1904 the judgments against the city were $280,891; in 1906 we disposed of 1,046 cases, with total judgments of $268,415. In 1906 from the first day of January to the first day of October we have disposed of 804 cases and the judgments against the city are $153,171.</p>

   <p>"When I assumed the duties of city attorney I found upon the dockets of the courts nearly 3,000 cases pending against the city of Chicago. We have reduced the number of pending cases so that there are now little over 1,500 cases pending. As to the number of cases brought, the persistent defense made by the city attorney's office against personal injury litigations reduced the average numbers of suits brought against the city over sixty per cent, so that while in former years the number of cases brought averaged 100 a month, during the nine months of 1906 the average has been reduced to thirty-one per month.</p>
   <p>Affairs Well In Hand.</p>
   <p>"The force of the city attorney's office is now well equipped and has the disposition of litigation against the city well in hand. The men are well trained, and the day of big judgments against the city of Chicago is a thing of the past. The average judgment against the city in former years was anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500. The average judgment during 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1906 has been gradually reduced until it is now below $200."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The work of the city attorney's office has already been practically transformed to the office of the corporation counsel. Mr. Smulski expects to make an active campaign although he is figuring upon a large majority both in Cook county and the state.</p>
