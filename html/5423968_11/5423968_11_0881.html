   <p>Stephen Adamowski, who is a candidate for alderman of the 39th ward, is indorsed by the athletic clubs of his ward. They know he is a sport fan, therefore, having him elected, it would be easier to get a new recreation hall and playground.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamowski is well qualified for the office he is aspiring for: he has the ability, and knows the needs of the constituents of his ward, which is composed of Polish Americans.</p>
   <p>All voters of the 39th ward who did not have the pleasure of meeting Mr. Adamowski may call upon him at his headquarters, which is located at 3128 Milwaukee Ave., and he will be glad to see you.</p>
