   <p>The committees of both Houses of Congress issued a relatively favorable report on the new immigration bill. In the Senate a Republican, Chandler of New Hampshire, gave the report, and in the House of Representatives, Stump, a Democrat of Maryland. The new bill contains the following articles:</p>
   <p>The captain of a ship carrying immigrants, or his first officer must obtain a sworn statement from every immigrant traveling on his ship, which he is to present later to an American immigration official. This sworn statement is to contain the following specific information: Name, age, sex, profession, does the immigrant know how to read and write, nationality, place of last residence, destination in the United States, has his way been paid to the point of destination, has he paid his own way, or did someone else pay the transportation, and if so, was it a person, community group, or government; has he any money, has he more or less than thirty dollars; is he traveling <span class="page-break">\2</span>to his relatives or friends, if so, their names and addresses; has he been in the United States previously, when and where; has he ever been in prison or in the poor house; was he ever maintained at community expense; does he favor polygamy; does he arrive on the basis of a contract; is he healthy in body and in mind, is he a cripple and from what cause, etc.</p>
   <p>This sworn statement must be legalized by the consul of the United States in the port from which the ship sails. The captain must pay a ten dollar fine for every traveler from whom he does not obtain such a statement. It takes at least fifteen minutes to obtain such a statement from every immigrant. Consequently, in the course of one hour the captain can receive only four such statements, and so, he can barely examine forty or fifty immigrants each day, through continuous work. Thus, if a conscientious examination of hundreds and thousands of immigrants is desired, weeks are required for such an examination, and perhaps months of time!</p>
   <p>Who knows whether Congress will accept this bill. Nevertheless, it is insane <span class="page-break">\3</span>on every count because it is impractical. The shipping companies in Europe are endeavoring to examine the immigrants as thoroughly as possible (but evidently not by the captains but by the agents), because they do not wish to have to send the immigrants back to Europe at their expense; it is impossible to demand more if Congress does not wish to appear ridiculous in the face of Europe.</p>
