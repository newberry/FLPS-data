   <p>The most terrifying and heartless person to the immigrant entering the port of New York is the Commissioner of Immigration, Mr. Williams. He is the one person to decide, who shall and who shall not enter these United States. His decision is final, and there is no appeal from it. This is so because the newcomer does not know where, or to whom, to appeal for help, or because he has no friends with money or influence. At any rate, even the authorities at Washington would not pay much attention to the pleas of one individual or to his friends, however influential they may be.</p>

   <p>Mr. Williams is therefore the all-powerful, the supreme sovereign of the port of New York. The fate of these unfortunates lies in his hands. He can at will push them into oblivion, into an eternal abyss of misery and despair. Mr. Williams severity in fulfilling his duties as a Commissioner of Immigration is proved by the fact that, from January 1st to March 1st, by his action 3500 immigrants were turned back - an unprecedented number in any similar period of time.</p>
   <p>It is true that the immigration laws are strict, and that the officials in charge must adhere to the law, but in many instances, the Commissioner allowed himself to be guided more by his caprice than by reason, when he turned back persons fully qualified to enter the United States.</p>
   <p>It is a fact, that the Commissioner overstepped his authority, in turning back people that should have been permitted to enter.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>It seems impossible to disqualify 3500 immigrants in a period of only two months. When questioned, the Commissioner explained the matter as follows: "The fault for turning back so many immigrants, lies with the agents of the steamship companies throughout Europe and other parts of the world. The agents sell tickets to all comers, without regard to their entry qualifications. These agents are chiefly interested in commissions. The more tickets they can sell, the more commissions they receive."</p>
   <p>"People afflicted with all kinds of diseases, people without the specified amount of money required by law; absolute paupers and miserable and ragged beggars, whose appearance alone is proof enough for refusing then entry, are enticed to travel to this country.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Congress has decided not to act on the question of immigration regulation in the current year, owing to the fact that many congressmen and senators have diverse opinions on the proposed regulations for immigrants. However, my duty and obligation is to enforce the existing laws and regulations and to bar all undesirables." So speaks the Commissioner of Immigration, with his anti-immigration chauvinists clinging to him.</p>
   <p>The explanations given by Mr. Williams are too vague, and evade much of the truth. We know positively that the Commissioner turned back a person of good health, possessing the financial qualifications, and whose family lives in the United States; in fact his father is an American citizen. Such manifestations of chauvinism are frequently indulged in by the Commissioner.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>If he dislikes the individual, or his nationality, he unaccountably refuses him entry, without further appeal.</p>
   <p>The assertion that many sick persons are among the arriving immigrants, does not stand criticism either, because a sick person will not dare to attempt so long and tiresome a journey, and furthermore a sick immigrant knows he is unfit for physical labor.</p>
   <p>Therefore only the healthiest, strongest, and those most willing to work are arriving, and these sturdy immigrants are not to be compared to the American weaklings. The truth of the matter is, that many are lacking the amount of money required for entry; however, upon arrival, relatives and friends provide these funds. Mr. Williams, will not give this any consideration, and he turns back the healthiest and most deserving immigrants.</p>

   <p>The Commissioner's statement, that some of the immigrants have the appearance of paupers and are as ragged as beggars, is also very unwise. We certainly cannot expect poor people to have the same appearance as the Commissioner, or to be able to wear the same quality of clothes. Instead, they possess a big heart, and a desire to work. They are honest and their labor can create more wealth for this country, than some of the obese unscrupulous, top hat, full-dressed, diamond bedecked American politicians. The Commissioner is worried, that Congress this year, will not pass any immigration restrictions at all. However, the chauvinists and union leaders, headed by Gompers are living in the hope that restrictive legislation will be passed.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, luckily for the immigrants, there are in this country millions of their fellow countrymen, fighting their cause. They are fighting the chauvinists, and will not allow any acts of injustice to be perpetrated, against honest and hard working people.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Against the Hayes anti-immigration bill, several hundred protests, were sent from the Polish National Alliance groups. This fact proved, that there are people in the United States who are willing to fight an anti-immigration injustice.</p>
   <p>The fact that congress will not pass any anti-immigration legislation, will aggravate Mr. Williams considerably, but we, as citizens of the United States will see to it, that no such prejudicial and unjust law shall be passed.</p>
