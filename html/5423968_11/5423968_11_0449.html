   <p>Yesterday evening the friends and colleagues of K. J. Wiechecki, former manager of the Polish National Alliance publications and at present recruiting officer for the Polish Army at Recruiting Center II, honored him at a farewell banquet held at the headquarters of the Polish Press Club at 2138 Pierce Avenue. Wiechecki is leaving for New York.</p>
   <p>Among the guests present, besides Wiechecki himself, were Judges Courtney and [J.] LaBuy; [Casimir] Zyahlinski, the president of the Polish National Alliance; J. Zawilinski and J. Magdziarz, the secretary and treasurer of that organization, respectively; R. Majewski, A. Ksycki, S. Wrobel, Z. Ulanowski, M. Borysiewicz, W. Grabowski, H. Lokanski, S. Lewental, H. Setmajer, M. Szubert, E. Kolakowski, K. Piatkiewicz, P. Piasecki, W. Rzeszotarski, I. Osostowicz, S. Orpiszewski, W. Wrzesinski, F. Nowak, Dr. W. Balcerzak, the new recruiting officer for Center II, Alexander Wolski, N. K. Zlotnicki, F. S. Barc, T. Rygier, W. Lubicz, S. Grzybowski, T. Paszkowski, J. Bronikowski, and M. Perlowski.</p>

   <p>The first speaker was Z. Ulanowski, who has been one of Wiechecki's close friends for many years. He explained the reasons why Wiechecki's closest friends had arranged the banquet, and, after presenting the guest of honor with a gold watch as a memento from those friends, he called upon Zychlinski to act as toastmaster. Zychlinski declined this honor in favor of Judge LaBuy.</p>
   <p>Almost everyone present spoke a few words, lauding Wiechecki's activity in Chicago during his many years' residence here, both in Alliance and Falcon matters and in social and club work. It is impossible to annotate all of the speeches that were made, but it can be said that in all of them rang a sincere, friendly vote, as if whispering: "We are sorry to see you leave, but go--where your Polish heart and your duty call you!"</p>
   <p>Some of the speakers were: Zychlinski, for the Polish National Alliance; Magdziarz and Zawilinski, in behalf of the same organization; S. Orpiszewski, editor-in-chief of Dziennik Zwiazkowy; F. S. Barc, as a friend of many years' standing; and N. K. Zlotnicki and H. Lokanski, in behalf of Ad Astra <span class="page-break">\3</span>Society, Group 1398 of the Polish National Alliance, from which a great many members have enlisted in the Polish and American armies. Other speakers were: M. Perlowski, former president of the Citizen's Committee of Chicago; F. Ksycki, a Colleague from Wiechecki's days with Dziennik Zwiazkowy; Alexander Wolski, his successor as recruiting officer; H. Setmajer and W. Rzeszotarski as colleagues from the Alliance; Dr. Balcerzak as a recruit in the Polish Army, in the medical corps of which he enlisted recently; S. Grzybowski, the new general manager of the Alliance publications; W. Lubicz in behalf of the Polish Falcons' Alliance; S. Lewental, in behalf of the Polish Press Club; and I. Osostowicz.</p>
   <p>Judge Courtney delivered a splendid speech, in English, naturally. He expressed himself clearly on the Polish question, saying that a free and independent Poland must arise as a result of the war in Europe.</p>
   <p>Finally, K. J. Wiechecki, himself, arose to speak, thanking everyone for the farewell given him and for the kind words spoken; he said those words would strengthen him for further effort.</p>

   <p>A few hours were spent thus at the Polish Press Club, and as they left for their homes the guests were thinking: too bad that he is leaving us, but would that there were tens of thousands like him. The Polish Army could then show the Germans what Poles can do.</p>
