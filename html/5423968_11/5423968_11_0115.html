   <p>In spite of numerous protests against the immigration bill, forbidding entrance to America to analphabets, the bill was passed.</p>
   <p>This bill will do most harm to Poles as well as Ukrainians and Slovaks, among whom is to be found the largest number of analphabets, that is, those who are neither able to read nor to write.</p>
   <p>According to the new law the authorities expect the immigrant to know his mother tongue. Those that cannot read nor write must not emigrate to America, because they will not be admitted.</p>
