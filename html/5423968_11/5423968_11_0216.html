   <p>On November 11th a patriotic celebration in commemoration of the anniversary of the Armistice was held at the Chicago Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The first speaker on the program was Mr. Olejniczak, the president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union in America, who, speaking about the circumstances that resulted in the independence of Poland, emphasized the merits of Paderewski and Dmowski as those that contributed the most to that cause.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Olejniczak said nothing about the great deeds of our "Gray Commandant." He did not even see it fit to mention his name. And when Mr. Olejniczak had finished his long and partial speech someone in the audience called out to him: "And what about Pilsudski?"</p>
   <p>That hearty outcry was received with a long applause, which proved that the greater part of the good-thinking Poles cherishes a profound love for the great leader of the nation.</p>

   <p>The manifestation was a moral blow to the president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. He attempted to apologize, but the audience received it rather as a self-accusation.</p>
   <p>Indeed, we must not falsify history.</p>
