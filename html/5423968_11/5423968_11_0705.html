   <p>We have heard and read many times that the part played by the Polish-Americans in the Lwow Fair of 1894 created a favorable impression; that the native Poles were in a position to publicly come in contact with Polish-American life; that a definite tie of sympathy and understanding has been established between the Pole of America and the Pole of Europe; and that better co-operation in the work for the national cause [freedom of Poland] has been brought about.</p>
   <p>These facts, which were well publicized by the Polish papers abroad, and extolled by toasts given at banquets in Lwow in honor of E. J. Jerzmanowski of New York and Adam Szwajkart of Chicago, were all repeated by the Polish-American press. Unfortunately the Polish element of America, which seems to be divided by discord and continual squabbling, did not react favorably toward this. A portion of Polish-America began to voice its anger, along with other inconsequential remarks, about the Polish-American Pavilion at Lwow. The contention of this opposition was that the Poles of America were poorly represented.</p>
   <p>This is not true, a hundred times untrue. The proof of this--the proof of the most enthusiastic endeavor and greatest feeling for patriotism and brotherly love, revived in Polish hearts by the Lwow Fair--lies at this moment before us. We will share this evidence without delay with our readers of the New Year edition of the Dziennik Chicagoski. We are also happy to announce that the expression of our faith in the Polish-American Pavilion at Lwow has come true.</p>
   <p>The proof of the favorable results lie in the Memorial Book of the Polish-American Pavilion at Lwow.</p>
   <p>Mention of this book has already been made. The idea was originated by Adam Szwajkart, manager of the Pavilion. Mr. Szwajkart seriously remarked to himself, "If the Pavilion is to bring to realization our closer contact with the Polish people of Europe, then a permanent record of the results should be made." A record book of heavy vellum was displayed at a vantage point in the Pavilion, with the suggestion that the visitors pen their names, impressions, and reactions about the Polish-American Pavilion.</p>
   <p>Out of this arose an unusually interesting historical document, a living mirror of visitors' impressions of Polish-American work and activity.</p>
   <p>The consensus of expressions in this book ring as follows: heartfelt benevolence, admiration and enthusiasm beyond any boundaries.</p>
   <p>In an interview after his return to America, Mr. Szwajkart stated, "Despite the many trials and tribulations, the intrigues of evil-spirited people, the hanging threat of bankruptcy, the days that I spent at the Pavilion will remain as the happiest moments of my life. Why? Because there flowed from the hearts of the Polish people a feeling of a real happiness, sincere admiration, and a glowing enthusiasm toward us [the Poles of America]. It seemed as if all this was brought about by some magic wand," he concluded.</p>
   
   <p>All of Adam Szwajkart's efforts and hard work were amply rewarded by the ardor expressed by his fellow countrymen. This can be readily understood when one glances through the pages of the Memorial Book of the Polish-American Pavilion at Lwow.</p>
   <p>It is high time for us to give a summary of this important document. The book is rather large, of heavy parchment, with a silver eagle and an American flag on its cover, containing the following gold leaf inscription:</p>
   <p>"Polish-American Pavilion--Kosciusko's Fair at Lwow--1894."</p>
   <p>The book contains one thousand pages, of which 934 pages are signed by the visitors of the Pavilion. Each page averages about ten signatures.</p>
   <p>Taking this as an average, about ten thousand persons, perhaps more, voiced their sympathies in one way or another for those in America. A majority, three-fourths, signed only their names; the remainder added poetical expressions, good wishes, observations, opinions, aphorisms, and excerpts from prophetic sayings to those in America. There are various forms of writing, but the spirit is the same--warm and sincere.</p>
   <p>"May fortune favor you," "Live," "Thank you for your work," "Return to us!"--these are the wishes that can be found on each page of the Memorial Book.</p>
   <p>And what a variety of names grace the book! There are signatures of Polish aristocracy, school children, parliamentary delegates, workers, native citizens, school teachers, editors, doctors, poets, medical students, priests, soldiers, officers, veterans of the Polish uprisings, and children of the new Polish generation. Besides these there are names of many notable Polish individuals, many of whom left sentimental sayings [Long list of names given].</p>
   <p>Polish names, however, are not the only ones in the book. There also are Russian, Czech, Lithuanian, Slovak, many Hungarian, German, even an Italian name with the following inscription:</p>
   
   <p>"Amico della Polonia." Besides Polish phrases, there are words of practically all the languages of the world. A Greek sentence is also found in the conglomeration of foreign expressions.</p>
   <p>The Memorial Book gave many an opportunity to send original good wishes to friends in America. Good wishes by many are sent to Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish; S. Zahajkiewicz, editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski; the editor of the Zgoda [no name]; and many others. Someone who signs herself "Anatolka" recalls memories of her cousin in America, etc.</p>
   <p>On the whole, the book contains many interesting, serious and humorous passages.</p>
   <p>An effort is going to be made by the Lwow Fair committee to have the book on public display [in Chicago].</p>
   <p>[Over eleven columns of excerpts are published--all of interest.]</p>
