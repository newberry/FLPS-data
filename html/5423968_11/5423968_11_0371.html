   <p>The rally for the Polish Army was opened by Reverend Doctor Kmiecik, assistant in St. John Cantius Church, with a prayer and a short address. Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz was named chairman and Mr. Pitera was made secretary.</p>
   <p>The following program was presented: addresses by the Polish Army organizers S. Krzywonos, W. Rozycki, and M. Perlowski, Recruiting Sergeant S. Wlosinski, and Alderman Adamkiewicz, John Kaszuba, a pupil of St. John Cantius Parochial School, sang a solo, Miss Frances Czuj recited "Two Wounded Men," and Victor Mika recited and sang.</p>
   <p>After an ardent appeal to the gathering by Michael Perlowski, Dr. Pietrzykowski offered ten dollars as expense money to the first man who would step up to the table and enlist in the Polish Army. After a short time, Francis Kuzirut volunteered and was warmly applauded by the audience. Further appeals by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organizers Rozycki and Krzywonos brought no results for the time being, but several men promised that they would soon enlist.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that on March 17 a collection for the Polish Army netting $248.94 was taken in St. John Cantius Parish, it was not intended that any collection would be taken at this meeting, but Leon Stitzenberg, owner of a jewelry shop at 1228 West Chicago Avenue, offered five dollars to the Polish Army Fund, while a readiness to contribute was noticed among other members of the audience Organizer Rozycki took up a general collection that brought in $36.93. This sum was turned over to the local pastor, Reverend Siatka, who will forward it to the Polish Army headquarters.</p>
   <p>An unfortunate fact, worthy of note here, is that there were a great many empty seats in the hall. It is sad that at such a fateful hour, in a cause that brooks no delay, a cause upon which depends our whole future, the future of our homeland, and the freedom of all nations, we cannot stir ourselves to action. Can it be that there are only so few good Poles in St. John Cantius <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Parish, to whose hearts the cause of our tortured and destitute Poland lies close? It is unbelievable, it cannot be possible! Let us awaken, then, let us not neglect our duty nor postpone what must be done now. Surely all of us know that the Prussians have set out to destroy the whole world, killing and burning all that is not German. Do you want to permit German victory so that these base hydras may tear from our breasts the last hopes of ever seeing a free and independent Poland--so that we may forever remain wanderers without a country? We hope not.</p>
   <p>To action, then, Poles! Our homeland demands sacrifices; it is our duty to rescue it from slavery and to purge it of the murderers of our defenseless children, our defenseless mothers, sisters and wives--to expel from it the destroyers of human rights!</p>
