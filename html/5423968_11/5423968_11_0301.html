   <p>Of all the heroes who have spread the fame of Poland throughout the world, none is loved so much by the Polish people as Thaddeus Kosciuszko. The hero of Dubienko, Raclawice, and Maciejowice typifies, as does no one else, all of the best qualities of a soldier, citizen, and statesman....Poland did not have many sons who loved her as Kosciuszko did. He served during one of the saddest periods of Polish history, forced to look upon the partitioning of the country, upon the internal quarrels and the futile efforts, all of which pained and saddened him. Called upon to lead the insurrection, he proved his love for Poland by word and action. He proved it on the field of battle, showing a contempt for death. He fought, never fearing the superior forces of the enemy; even when he was seriously wounded in the battle of Maciejowice, he continued to give orders. His spirit continually lives with us, and the Polish Falcons have made him their patron. The Poles justly surround his memory with love and honor, seeing in him an ideal. He did not wear royal robes, he did not live in luxury; instead, he lived the life of a soldier and in his life we see the height of national aspiration. Let us fill ourselves with his spirit; the finest expression of patriotism, he exemplified every virtue. Those who emulate him will grow to be heroes who are ready at every moment to shed their blood and to give their lives at our dearest and most sacred altar, our motherland.</p>
   <p>If we ever needed heroes, we need them today. During the present difficult times, Poland is receiving blow after blow, and Poland's rivers run with tears and blood. Give Poland more heroes like Kosciuszko and thrones will fall. Let there be more of those who are taking up arms against the enemy and we will soon be free. Besides the heroes fighting upon the field of battle, we have other heroes also. Skarga, Kollataj, Sienkiewicz, Sapieha, Paderewski--these never took up arms, but they too are heroes. And so, we too can find heroes among ourselves where we least expect them, among our own working people, where, hidden beneath n blouses, beat brave hearts, while in veins strained by heavy labor flows the blood of heroes. Every worker is a hero who has a strong will, an indomitable spirit, who knows his duty and who instils in his children a love for their motherland. He is defending Polish principles, he is raising high the banner of liberty and freedom, he is fighting the enemies of Poland--this is a real hero before whom heads should be bowed. To the extent of his means he offers his money, and he keeps in close touch with Polish matters. Today, class differences have disappeared; today, one spirit motivates everyone, there is but one aim: to re-establish a free, united, and independent Poland. Today, no one asks whether that Poland is a cottage or a manor; all hands are working, those with the hammer, the plow, and the pen, and the soft, gloved hands too. Never before have all the elements of Polish society co-operated as they are doing today. The bright day of freedom will soon dawn, and darkness and ill will will disappear. The Polish nation will not be lost, for a nation fighting for its freedom cannot lose. Other countries have seen that our nation still lives, for there is a spirit within us that the Prussians cannot break, upon which the blows of our enemies fall harmlessly, and that spirit is upheld by our faith in victory. The great truth for which we are fighting, the faith that sooner or later victory will be ours, is as strong as Christianity itself. Polish eagles will fly to Warsaw, and with them, our faith. The time will come when Poland will wring the neck of the Prussian hydra.</p>
