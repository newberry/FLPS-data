   <p>The time has come when every Polish man and woman and every society, group, or settlement must consider what part the American immigrants should play in the event that Poland should be united and should be granted at least autonomy. What should the emigres do for this homeland, which they have constantly and honestly remembered (although in their own fashion)?</p>
   <p>It is not too soon to bring up this matter, as some people might think. It is the sacred duty of good and intelligent citizens who want to begin to work for their nation with a carefully made plan.</p>
   <p>Polish emigres must not await the end of the European conflict with folded hands. They must begin mobilizing their forces now if they want to emerge victorious in the fulfillment of their duties toward the homeland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>After the European war and the eventual granting of autonomy to Poland, a battle, not bloody but a hundred times more important than the war itself, awaits them--the struggle to erect lasting and firm foundations under the homeland so that she can in the future be strong and free. This battle will be a hard one, made difficult by our national faults which in the post-war chaos not only will not disappear, but will come to the fore in even stronger aspects.</p>
   <p>To prepare for this struggle, to point to its magnitude and consequences, is a hundred times more important than the empty and senseless polemics conducted hitherto for the party interests and "business" reasons of publishers.</p>
   <p>Cognizant of the fact that by bringing up this matter we shall be performing one of the loftiest purposes of the press, we begin today a series of articles--the first of their kind published in the United States--inviting publications which realize the importance of the matter to join us in a discussion. Such a discussion, conducted in accordance with editorial ethics and intelligence, will <span class="page-break">\3</span>permit the consideration of any matter from all points of view, and will enable us to reach definite uniform conclusions for the future.</p>
   <p>We newspaperman should play the role of the advance guard in this matter. There-fore let us begin a basic discussion. Let us express ourselves on this subject. Let us not be guided, as heretofore, by prejudices which lower our dignity as interpreters of public opinion, but let us be guided by a deep and sincere intention to serve the cause of our Poland.</p>
   <p>We toss you colleagues of the pen, net a mailed glove, but a wreath of opinions, and ask for your criticism and your views.</p>
   <p>We also ask our readers to express themselves in this matter. Their opinions will, to a certain extent, be the mirror reflecting the opinions of the general public.</p>
   <p>We new turn to the actual subject.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Instead of an introduction to the enumeration of the duties of Polish emigres toward the independent homeland which may possibly become a reality, one should consider, at least along general lines, the internal state of affairs which will prevail after Poland is united and its autonomy is announced.</p>
   <p>(1) Economic misfortune will be the only characteristic which the three parts of Polish territory will have in common.</p>
   <p>The greatest war in the history of mankind, compared to which the present war in France and Belgium is nothing, is being fought on this territory. The war in the East is not a war mainly for political and material gains as is the war in the West: it is a war of two races, one of which is defending itself and the other attacking, as it has been doing for centuries, with the purpose of completely extinguishing the former.</p>
   <p>The Germans carry out their plans relentlessly, gifted, as they are, with the <span class="page-break">\5</span>ability to work according to a systematic plan of action. They are carrying out their plan of Drang nach Osten with a mastery worthy of a better cause. The present war is the final expression of Teutonic onslaught, though fortunately for the Slavic race, and for us Poles especially, the experienced and skillful polities of the Triple Entente has forced the Germans into war sooner than they wanted it, at a time when they least expected it, and at a time not advantageous to them. Another Grunwald is being fought on our territory. Our land will be trampled by horses' hoofs and ploughed by cannon wheels. Instead of crops and seeds it will produce unheard-of poverty and starvation. Thousands of workers will be killed or crippled or, because of general industrial and agricultural stagnation, will die of starvation. Poverty and starvation will devour all reserves and thought of tomorrow will give way to thought of saving one's self, regardless of what might happen in the future.</p>
   <p>The decrease of laborers will be reflected in all branches of economic endeavor. The lack of money which went up in the smoke of bursting grenades and shrapnel--will <span class="page-break">\6</span>deprive people of the means of constructing and creating new sources of work and national wealth.</p>
   <p>In a word, Polish soil will lie follow and it will be necessary to start cultivating it from the beginning and through hard work to bring it back to its former productivity.</p>
   <p>Though Poland should be given back to us, it will not be in as good condition as it was during the last few years of its freedom: our envious enemy will have destroyed almost everything we had and lack of superintendence and apathy will do the rest.</p>
   <p>The only people who will successfully emerge from this war will be our capitalists and magnates. The majority of these, as soon as peace is signed, will think immediately of departing for all sorts of spas to take the "cure" to relieve their war-torn nerves, the fashionable disease from which they are chronic sufferers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Among these capitalists there will be a handful of such people as Maurice Zamojski, Jerzy Lubomirski, Okocimski, Sapieha, and Sanguszko, who have constantly thought about the industrialization of the country and the improvement of its economic condition. But this will be only a drop in the bucket, in view of the boundless poverty and economic chaos.</p>
   <p>It is the common people together with honest capitalists who will have to bring some semblance of order out of this chaos. This work will be lighter and more productive only if the government of the country (not of the state!), at least during the first few years, rests in strong, energetic, and truly economical hands. Good management is the only thing that can help Polish soil more quickly become the provider and supply the inhabitants with food. Only then will men of the cities be able to think about the reconstruction of industry and the provision of work for the thousands of unemployed.</p>
   <p>Besides this immediate problem, Poland will have to think about setting its national economy upon a firm foundation, in order not to be economically and <span class="page-break">\8</span>commercially dependent on other countries which have more capital at their disposal and more experience in gaining markets.</p>
   <p>(2) The political situation will be most chaotic in Polish areas after the war. Our unfortunate quarrelsomeness, politely called individualism, will then really run riot.</p>
   <p>The Polish people, awakening from the bloody sleep of war and rejoicing in their regained liberty, will fall apart into dozens of political parties, each of which will want to rule believing (sometimes even sincerely) that it is the best and the only one having the right to rule.</p>
   <p>Let us not labor under the illusion that the present war will cure the Poles of their native faults. These faults will remain. They will even take on a sharper aspect.</p>
   <p>Only a firm, strong hand will be able to hold all of the various Socialists, <span class="page-break">\9</span>Nationalists, members of the Peoples Party, Conservatives, wild Centralists, and only God knows what other kinds of partisans, in their traces.</p>
   <p>In other words, Poland from the moment of its rebirth will be the happy hunting ground of all sorts of party agitators, who will add greatly to the difficulty of setting up a proper economic system in the country and expediting the establishment of order, which is indispensable.</p>
   <p>The arrangement of political matters, after all, will depend entirely upon the form of government which the powers may deign to grant us or force upon us. Therefore it is impossible at present to make any sort of deductions in regard to this.</p>
   <p>(3) The social aspect of the situation will, in all probability, be the most difficult.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Ignoring the unavoidable agitation by the internationalist camp, which will not overlook this opportunity for furthering its own interests, we must call attention to the three different schools of thought to which the future Polish citizens now adhere.</p>
   <p>The three annexer governments have practically turned the Poles into three different nations, joined only by a common racial background and a common language. Many years--perhaps many generations--will elapse before the people from the kingdom of Poland, Galicia, and Poznan, learn to live together and evolve one economic system.</p>
   <p>Even now, during a time of such tremendous Polish pro-national propaganda, three different governmental systems are clearly defined. What then, will happen later in the general chaos of opinions and points of view?</p>
   <p>One has to take into account impartially and without prejudice this difference of schools. Only an unusually sympathetic understanding of the matter and <span class="page-break">\11</span>complete disregard for one's personal ego will be able to expedite the work of establishing order.</p>
   <p>This is how the picture of the probable situation of free Poland presents itself to us.</p>
   <p>Now we approach the actual purpose of this article--that is the role that the American immigrants will play in the event that they return to the homeland.</p>
   <p>The "return wave" must occur, since a large proportion of our emigres will be drawn to free Poland through love of the homeland and through the possibility of securing for themselves a better existence while simultaneously serving the general good of the nation.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Nov. 14, 1914.</p>
   <p>In the first part of this article we expressed the opinion that the moment Polish soil is reunited and we are granted at least autonomy, if not complete political freedom, a return wave will envelop American Poles and carry them <span class="page-break">\12</span>back to the place from which they came.</p>
   <p>Polish mounds will then open and the invisible spirits of our forefathers will sound the call of the return to the soil which they fought for, which they made fertile with the sweat of their brows, and over which they shed tears, as innocent martyrs and slaves.</p>
   <p>This call will even reach the ears of the American immigrants, and many will answer the call. We believe this as sincerely as we believe in the strong attachment of the Polish people to their soil and to the memory of their ancestors.</p>
   <p>It is still too soon to try to calculate what percentage of immigrants will return. This could be only guesswork. The task would probably be impossible and is more likely to be so since we cannot count on those who talk loud and at every mention of the homeland shed tears out of dry eyes. We can count on only the quiet masses, whom we do not hear, who say very little or nothing at <span class="page-break">\13</span>all, but who in their souls have already decided to return to their own people, and there to roll up their sleeves and begin work on the foundations of the future glory of the nation.</p>
   <p>There is no use occupying our minds now in guessing how many Poles will return, but we should instead consider the fact of the return to the homeland and the quality of the returning element.</p>
   <p>Besides this, we should endeavor to implant the conviction in the minds of the generations born and trained here that they too, should return, because, with their practical and democratic American education, they have an important mission to perform in Poland and a splendid future awaits them.</p>
   <p>If we consider carefully the reasons for which the Poles emigrated to America, we shall be able to make some sort of deductions as to the quality of the element which will return to the homeland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Lack of political freedom drove some to the land of Washington. Others were driven by the urge for economic betterment. Still others wanted new experiences and wanted to become acquainted with new worlds. Others were driven by the desire for an adventurous life or by a persecution complex.</p>
   <p>Among the Polish immigrants in America all strata and spheres of society are represented from the simple peasant to the playboy count.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the diversity of the immigrant element we can divide the returning element into the following groups:</p>
   <p>(a) Patriots who live in the expectation of returning to the homeland and await only the call of the free and needy homeland to return.</p>
   <p>(b) Speculators (in the good sense of the word) who are ready to take their savings to the homeland and there to begin working in commerce or industry.</p>
   <p>(c) Incompetents who were unable to orient themselves in America and have too <span class="page-break">\15</span>little energy to overcome the obstacles in the paths of their dreamed-of goals--in other wards, people who, having put on shoes that are too tight for them, do not know what to do to keep their feet from hurting.</p>
   <p>(d) Undesirables for whom America has become a little too small and too hot, who will return to take advantage of the postwar confusion in order to ply their trade.</p>
   <p>With the exception of the last named, all of these people can be of use to the homeland if they are willing to work for the people in general and for themselves. Every businessman and every merchant will be especially welcome if he is able to introduce progressive management into his own affairs and subsequently into the affairs of others.</p>
   <p>The Jewish plague has made itself felt for many years in the homeland. All commerce and industry with very few exceptions is in the hands of the Jews. Strong and consequential boycotts have not helped. The scattered efforts of <span class="page-break">\16</span>individuals to build up commerce and industry on a large scale helped, because a great wave of Jews has begun to inundate the Kingdom of Poland and to debase local commerce and industry to a great extent.</p>
   <p>The simple peasant, not recognizing the danger, crawled into the Jew's pocket as his father had done, although he could have opened up the same sort of business that the Jew had. The intelligent person disdained hard work, always looked upon himself as one of Fortune's chosen people, and--what is worse--held in contempt any sort of commerce or industry.</p>
   <p>Therefore the door of Poland is wide open to speculators, and if they work sensibly, economically, and honestly, their success is assured. Land will no doubt be very cheap. The same will be true of buildings and homes. Any one who has a little money in his pocket and gets to work systematically will soon become financially independent. We have in mind particularly the Poles from America.</p>
   <p>The American system in commerce and industry, especially the division of labor <span class="page-break">\17</span>and the American's ability to sell manufactured merchandise, is simply astonishing. Thanks to this system money is turned over many more times during the year--incomparably faster--in America than in Europe, and as a result more people are employed and lower prices can be set on merchandise.</p>
   <p>Poles coming to free Poland from America will be able to employ the American system successfully, whether it be in the manufacturing industry or in the agricultural industry--through scientific raising of cattle and fowls and scientific development of dairy products, etc.--or in commerce or some other branch of the country's economy.</p>
   <p>American business properly understood, free of humbug and advertising tricks, can enjoy great success in the homeland and in time may become the best medicine for Jewish bargaining methods--that awful plague of the poorest classes of our society.</p>
   <p>Polish Americans will be better able to enter into commercial contacts with <span class="page-break">\18</span>American firms and, by the same token, to oust European industrial countries from the Polish market. It would be incomparably less dangerous for us to be financially dependent on the United States than on some European industrial country.</p>
   <p>Poland, freed from her chains, will enter the economic battle poor and ruined and consequently she will be forced to depend on imported merchandise until she can properly develop her own industry. Therefore we should, on the one hand, warn her against the influence of neighbors and, on the other hand, guarantee her credit from some wealthy power. Among the wealthy powers, the United States should always have preference.</p>
   <p>Poles from America, having received good business training here and having learned the local commercial factors, can be the best counselors in Poland.</p>
   <p>Naturally it is necessary that these Poles from America really possess this training. One would net demand this of all the returning Poles--that would be <span class="page-break">\19</span>impossible--but would demand it from a considerable number of young people, who can still be trained for the role of Polish economic pioneers.</p>
   <p>Parents who clearly understand their duties toward the homeland and want to return to the homeland should not train their sons at present to be pitchers, postal clerks, or lawyers; they should train them to be businessmen or technicians. Free Poland will need such people. She will have enough lawyers, physicians, notaries, and other so-called professional people, even better trained than those we have here.</p>
   <p>Besides the purely professional and economic attributes which the Poles from America will take to the homeland, they will also take with them great social virtues.</p>
   <p>The magnificent institution of respect for work, which is inconceivable in Europe, the evaluation of a man according to his ability and enterprise in business, and the magnificent democracy of American society, are virtues which <span class="page-break">\20</span>the Poles from America will seek the opportunity to implant in the homeland.</p>
   <p>It is clear that in writing this we do not have in mind American capitalists or democratic politicians but the American people in general and the principles of the Constitution embodied in the Rights of Man.</p>
   <p>The Poles should give up the idea of crests and titles once and for all, and modeling themselves on the United States they should endeavor to copy her form of government, only without its obvious faults.</p>
   <p>The Poles in America can become the pioneers who will carry these postulates into Poland. Although they may not be successful, nevertheless a battle of this sort is always fruitful and will help in winnowing the political seeds of all sorts of European parties.</p>
   <p>Poland demands action from us. At the moment we cannot give it to her in the <span class="page-break">\21</span>degree we should like, but at least let us prepare for the future. Let us prepare the ground work for the mass emigration of patriotic laborers, with hands and dollars ready for work, because both will be badly needed there.</p>
   <p>Besides these, there is not much more that we shall be able to take with us--we absolutely will not take along our quarrels, battles, and shameless brawling, which are running riot in our Polish-American organizations.</p>
   <p>Let us go there not to rule but to work. Let us go there to make money at the same time that we are increasing the wealth of the Polish people in general. Let us not lead the life of lazy people and parasites. Then the return wave which brings the sons of Poland back to their mother will also bring times of real blossoming to the homeland.</p>
   <p>This reminds us of one of the objections to our above-mentioned deductions, but we shall not discuss it because we are waiting for your opinions and the echoes of this article. When this objection is brought up we shall not fail to <span class="page-break">\22</span>demonstrate its fallacy from our point of view.</p>
   <p>We still have many matters at hand which could be included among the duties of the emigres toward free Poland. We prefer not to bring them up now but to postpone them until some time in the future in order not to overload the minds of the readers.</p>
   <p>We are ready for a fundamental discussion and ask for it. Nevertheless, we apologize in advance that in the event that personal sallies or ordinary party bias appear we shall not reply.</p>
