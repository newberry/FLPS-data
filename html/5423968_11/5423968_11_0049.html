   <p>Despite the anti-immigration sentiment in certain American circles, people are beginning gradually to understand the actual value of immigration for the United States. Words of truth and recognition can be found more and more frequently in the American press for those who with calloused hands have created the present greatness of this nation and are building its future power.</p>
   <p>The English-language newspapers, when they wish to render justice to immigrants, refer exclusively to their economic value for the nation. The eyes of true Americans are as yet closed to the moral and mental worth of the immigrants. But even here the truth is beginning to emerge, and it will not be long before the questions today discussed only in Polish newspapers will find their way into the columns of the English-language press.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy herewith presents several excerpts from recent issues of American newspapers to illustrate the arguments used.</p>
   <p>In the last five years approximately four million immigrants have been permitted to enter the United States. Of these eighty-two and a half per cent were persons ranging from fourteen to fourty-four years of age, hence at the age when one is most capable of work and does not need to rely upon others for support. Eleven per cent were under fourteen years of age, and only six per cent over fourty-four.</p>
   <p>This means that in the course of five years the United States gained more than three and a half million workers for whose training for work it has not spent a cent. These people were no liability to America from the day of their birth until the time of their going to work. The country gave nothing for their food, medical attention, or education in their childhood period. These expenses have fallen upon other countries, and the best productive period of these people's lives fall to the lot of the United States. This is a gain of gigantic proportions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In order to make certain whether such a number of workers was necessary here, the Federal Immigration Committee surveyed thirty-seven large branches of industry within the area between the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains. The committee collected data on 619,999 workers employed. It was found that sixty per cent of these people were immigrants. Were it not for these "foreigners," the business surveyed by the committee would amount only to forty per cent of its present size. This means that it would be smaller by more than a half. It would be impossible to find sufficient working hands among people born on American soil. Commerce and industry would fall to the level of half a century ago.</p>
   <p>The committee has also discovered after surveying the origin of children in public schools, that these immigrants are not opposed to education. It was shown that in thirty-seven large cities fifty-eight per cent of the children attending public schools were children of immigrants. In Chicago this percentage was even sixty per cent. But how many children of immigrants attend parochial schools!</p>

   <p>There is one thing that somewhat worries such Americans as are greedy for money. The immigrants send a great deal of money to Europe. But the defenders of justice have an answer to this charge. They reply and show in figures that native-born Americans export far more money across the ocean. Hundreds and thousands of these Americans travel annually throughout Europe. If the immigrants do send a part of their earnings to Europe, they still keep the second part here, and on the third part they live. Moreover, it must also be remembered that the entire product of their work remains here.</p>
   <p>Some one in New York found fault with the immigrant Italians. His contention was that after completing the construction of a tunnel under the river, the immigrants returned to Italy.</p>
   <p>"That is true", replied a certain Italian who has permanently settled in America, "but they left us the tunnel."</p>
   <p>The future of the immigration question in this country is perfectly clear <span class="page-break">\5</span>to our people. It is the type of question which requires time to be successfully solved, but it moves nearer to its solution every day and every hour. Where there are an abundance of land and a great amount of money but a shortage of people, there immigration is a blessing, and sooner or later every one must realize this.</p>
   <p>It may be unpleasant to the Anglo-Saxons, the Irish, and the Germans that their numerical superiority in this nation is in jeopardy. They fear that in a not very far distant future, Poles, Czechs, other Slavic races, and Italians will govern here, but that is unavoidable. The mind of an American is so constructed that once he becomes convinced of the existence of some necessity, he will finally become reconciled to it. He will, endeavor to obtain the most benefit out of a situation that is unpleasant to him.</p>
   <p>The natural increase in population is not adequate in this country in view of the maddening onrush ot commerce and the huge necessities of agriculture.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Immigration is, therefore, necessary. It is useless to expect a great flow of people from Ireland or even from Germany. Ireland herself has already become depopulated, and at last political and economic conditons in that country are constantly improving. Germany also has less and less people to contribute, and moreover, the Germans are promoting a political emigration into Poland and Russia. Poland and Italy are at present the only large countries in Europe from which emigrants depart on a large scale, and this state of affairs will last quite a while.</p>
   <p>It is useless to oppose this; facts must be faced as they are. The thing to do is cordially accept healthy and honest immigrants. They should be directed where they are most in demand.</p>
   <p>The National Liberal Immigration League is at present interested in this question. The Dziennik Zwiazkowy will undoubtedly present more detailed information at some future date on the activities and the progress of this League.</p>
