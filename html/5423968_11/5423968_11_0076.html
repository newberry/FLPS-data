   <p>"Only half the women who leave Ellis Island, the place where immigrants land, make their way to Chicago." Such was the statement made by Mr. Graham Taylor, who spoke recently at the annual organizational meeting of the Congressional Brotherhood of Chicago. This may be attributed, in part, to the fact that railroad conductors, while still in Hammond, call out, "Chicago;" Many immigrants,having the impression that they have arrived at the city called, and being unaccustomed to their surroundings, alight from the train and become "lost," some times permanently. Some of these unfortunate, and destitute women are taken by agents to houses of ill fame as soon as they leave the train. Others wander about the city and, in the end, also find their way to these dens of iniquity. It is a calamity and a crime calling to heaven for vengeance if such conditions exist as Mr. Taylor claims. It is high time for welfare societies to give serious thought to warding off this evil. Every right-thinking person knows the great amount of commendable work done by the Women's Auxiliary Of The Polish National <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Alliance, which has exerted every effort in behalf of the newly arriving women and men. This benevolent group broadens the scope of its activities with each day. It would not hurt other organizations that pride themselves on their activities in behalf of our people here in America to assist our Women's Auxiliary.</p>
