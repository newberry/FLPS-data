   <p>In behalf of the great honor bestowed upon a Polish priest who will in a few days be consecrated the first Polish bishop in America, the following rhyme was written by a Polish citizen:</p>
   <p>Hail youthful prelate, son of the fairland</p>
   <p>That to the world a Sobieski gave;</p>
   <p>From Islam's power Christendom to save.</p>
   <p>Where Kosciuszko and his gallant band</p>
   <p>For freedom's cause made memorable stand;</p>
   <p>And prince and priest and peasant, true and brave,</p>
   <p>Unflinching faced the dungeon or the grave</p>
   <p>Rather than tamely bear the helot's brand</p>
   <p>'Tis meet a prelate boasting Irish blood</p>
   <p>Shall give to thee the consecrating rite,</p>
   <p>For, like fair Poland, Ireland aye has stood</p>
   <p>For faith and country foremost in the fight</p>
   <p>So, ever linked, may Celt and Pole be true</p>
   <p>To God and home as symbolized in you.</p>
