   <p>The following news has reached our office:</p>
   <p>An outstanding American art collector arrived in Warsaw a few weeks age, and went to the New World Art Salon, stating that he was ready to deposit 15,000 Austrian crowns in the national bank as security, for which he would receive an equal value in Polish works of art. This collector plans to exhibit these works of art at the Chicago Fair and offer them for sale. The Salon called together all the leading Polish artists to discuss the matter. Shortly afterwards the artists agreed to the American's proposition.</p>
   <p>He then left for Cracow, where he was to present the same plan. If he completes <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the arrangements, as is highly possible, he plans to open a salon of Polish art in Chicago.</p>
