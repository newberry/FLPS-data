   <p>The body of Teofil Lenartowicz, one of the most famous contemporary Polish poets, will be taken to Cracow from Florence, Italy, where it now rests. There the body will be buried with great solemnity at the cost of the state. The funeral rites will be held on May 28. The ceremony will be a magnificent one, for the day will amount to almost a national holiday.</p>
   <p>That the American Poles ought to be represented in a ceremony of this character was well understood by the Patriotic Organization. It had already, immediately upon receiving notice of the poet's death, had a mass said for his intention. At the Organization's last meeting, Father Vincent Barzynski suggested that a wreath be sent to the great poet's funeral from the Poles of Chicago. Fifteen dollars was assigned from the treasury for the purchase of a wreath. But in the hope that other organizations, or perhaps the Poles of Chicago in general, would like to increase this sum by voluntary contributions, the wreath will not be purchased until Thursday of this week. Contributions to the fund can be made at this newspaper's offices or directly to Father Barzynski.</p>
   <p>We hope that Polish organizations will support this noble plan and will help to realize it by contributing as much as they can.</p>
