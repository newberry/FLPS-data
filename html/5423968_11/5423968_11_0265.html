   <p>We have written many times about the sincere feeling of gratitude which is spreading throughout Poland, including the people in general, and the government towards the United States. There is a distinction between the feeling of the government and the people. The Polish government has a great deal for which to be thankful to America from a political point of view. It is not necessary to point but all the details, for they are well known. The people of Poland are grateful to the Americans for the humanitarian work of various kinds that has been carried on throughout the nation <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>during the War and up to the present time. They owe many thanks to the various American interests for aiding in the reorganization of the industry. A great deal of the work accomplished will bear a permanent mark.</p>
   <p>The Polish people are virtually bubbling over with this sincerity to such an extent that they try to show it in every way possible. It is nothing short of amazement to read that all the people observe every American holiday, especially national holidays. The same attachment which they have for their own has been adopted by them toward this country. This is of no little wonder, for the Poles greatly cherish their own holidays. They have adopted this thought: "What is holy and pleasant for you, it is pleasant and holy for us." "Fourth of July," "Decoration Day," "Thanksgiving Day," and others, are observed by them with great manifestation. It has been suggested that a great monument, a symbol of thanks, be erected to America, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>commemorating all the fine things she has accomplished for Poland. This indeed would bear great significance to both nations.</p>
   <p>The humanitarian work which has been carried out by the American government is coming to a close. Its work has reached a point where the Polish nation is able to carry on. This work of rehabilitating the post-War derelicts of humanity, and the stranded orphans, was undertaken by the Hoover organization, which established the Foundation for European Children in Poland under the American Relief Committee. This organization is gradually liquidating its work. Stations which are situated in areas where the people of the Polish government can take over the work are being abandoned. Belief activity is only being carried out where there is dire need for it. This timely and impressive humanitarian work <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>rendered by Hoover's organization has virtually fed, clothed, and bound the wounds of Poland. It gave succor to thousands of homeless urchins, many times saving their lives. Countless thousands were fed and clothed. Today, this relief work is reaching its climax.</p>
   <p>We are informed by one of the papers published in Poland that the American Relief Committee, Foundation for European Children, will continue its welfare work on a graduated scale until June, 1922. This gradual liquidation, after two and a half years of intensive work, is only natural. Its purpose has been accomplished. It was called upon to render its benevolent service to Poland at a time when a severe existed in the country. Today, as the conditions of strife are alleviating, and normal times are being restored, the country is able to take care of its own problems. The same thing <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>occurred in Belgium and France. Conditions in that part of Poland which has been less hit by the War, or touched by the Bolshevik uprising, have improved greatly during the past two years. It is in these sections that relief work is being stopped. Because of the discontinuation of relief stations in western parts of Poland, many provincial committees have voiced a protest against the abandonment, and have made pleas to have the former work restored.</p>
   <p>This protest action can be easily understood: the people became accustomed to the comforts rendered by the American Relief Committee, and when this assistance was taken away they began to protest. But they will have to be content and agree upon the fact that their future, and the future of Poland will depend on their ability to take care of their own problems. Every person will have to look after <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>himself and protect himself against the scourge of hunger.</p>
   <p>A sound answer is found in this same Warsaw paper relative to these protests.</p>
   <p>"The protests that are flowing into the headquarters of the American Relief Committee have no right for consideration and assistance because this organization expressly was organized to assist children stranded as a result of the War, and this aid cannot be diverted into other channels. It is impossible to render service to conditions that are prevalent in every country. Only urgent emergency problems concerning children are taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>"It must be remembered that growing children may be in poor circumstances <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>directly as a result of the War, or to social circumstances which were a result of the aftermath of the War. Herbert Hoover's organization is primarily interested in the first cause. Continuation of the work where the A. R. C. has left off should be carried out by the various communities. It is up to the local organizations to make arrangements to feed these destitute children while they are attending school. This problem should be taken under careful consideration by those individuals who are greatly concerned about the future of the democracy, for it is through their energetic interest and work that the future of the country depends. However, this does not concern the continuation of the work of the American Relief organization, which always had and always will have the rendering of temporary service as its chief duty, and the suspension of this welfare service when normal order is restored. It would even be considered dishonest to expect help from the American people during normal times, for it is <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the duty of every community of the Polish nation to look after its own orphans and destitute children.</p>
   <p>"The discontinuation of work by the A. R. C. has only affected such parts of the country where conditions have been restored to normal, where prosperity has been restored as a result of the full capacity functioning of industry, and where the cultivated fields bore bumper crops. The A. R. C. will continue its work in sections of the country where rehabilitation is slow, where debris and ashes still tell the story of the destruction of the War, and the invasion of the Bolsheviks. The orphan asylums which have been continuously in the War Zone are still in great need. There is also great need of assistance for the Polish exiles that are returning from the Siberian steppes. Help is also needed where industry is being rebuilt, newly established, or where unemployment exists.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>"It is the people of this latter group that are undergoing great hardships. So are the children. These groups have been taken under the wing of Mr. Hoover. The Polish-American Relief Committee for Children will distribute canned goods and other prepared foods.</p>
   <p>'The parts of Poland untouched by the scourge of War and invasion should be obligated to look after their less fortunate brothers, and to refuse the assistance of the American Relief Committee, which until recently has been of invaluable service to the homeless, starving children.' "</p>
   <p>This has been well told. It should arouse the ambition and altruism of the people. It does not pay to fall into the hands of charity to such an extent that one would exploit it for personal gain. This is <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>professional begging, an undesirable practice. Already a number of American people are complaining that the European people are taking are taking advantage of American good will, that they are making a living out of it, and that they have become parasites. Let them not be so bold as to say this about Poland! (Although we do hear at times such statements made by...Polish-Americans.....but these were the words of the lesser intelligent, voiced by those who have given the least for Poland, and benefited most by American prosperity...nothing need be said about this). Poland realizes that the resources of the American Relief Committee are not illimitable.</p>
   <p>There was a time in Poland right after the War when Hoover's organization took care of over 1,300,000 children daily for one year. At present, this work has been curtailed considerably. Only the poorest children in the poorest sections of the country are given aid. Children in the more prosperous parts step aside in order that the ones in great need may find <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>shelter from the cold, food when hungry, and aid in sickness.</p>
