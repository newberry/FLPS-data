   <p>Last Wednesday, December 6, exercises commemorating the November insurrection in Poland in 1831, were held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall under the auspices of Circuit II, Polish Falcons' Alliance of America. The hall was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>The program, which, due to last minute difficulties, began a half hour later than it was scheduled, was opened with an appropriate address by H. Lokanski, president of the committee in charge, who named as chairman, J. Zaklikiewicz, president of Circuit II, and the undersigned as secretary.</p>
   <p>After summing up to the aims and ideals of the Falcon organization, the chairman said that political questions would not be discussed at these exercises. He said that in his opinion such questions were for a higher authority to consider, and that he, as a well-disciplined soldier, would obey that authority.</p>
   <p>The first musical number of the program was a choral number, "Battle Song", by the Falcon Paderewski Chorus, which received such enthusiastic applause that the Chorus was forced to return for an encore. After they had sung "Onward, Falcons, Shoulder to Shoulder," M. Kmieciak of Most 192, arose to speak.</p>
   <p>In graphic words, the speaker outlined the history of Poland, beginning with the Congress of Vienna. In speaking of the November Insurrection, he said: "The insurrection failed, but the Polish spirit, the national desire for liberty, survived. Blood was not shed in vain." He passed on to describe the cruel persecution of the Polish nation under Russian, Prussian, and Austrian rule. He described vividly the methods by which our oppressors tried to destroy, or at least donationalize, the Polish nation--[all of] which methods failed. The Polish nation did not for a moment forsake its ideals of liberty, and adheres to them today. Here the speaker passed on to the history of the Falcon organization and its aims. He said: "It [The Falcons Alliance] cannot serve any particular party, for it is under oath to Poland, and must be ready when Poland calls. Today, Poland does not ask for blood--we must, therefore, help the poor who lack bread. Remain always in readiness, with deep faith in our nation's future," concluded the speaker, We must add that during his address, a member of the K. O. N. [Committee of National Defence] camp, who apparently lacked good manners, questioned the speaker. The speaker replied: "This is not a back street of Lodz."</p>
   <p>Falcon gymnastics--pyramids--followed Mr. Kmeciak's address, and were applauded warmly. Then followed a vocal solo by Mrs. Dzielski, accompanied by Miss W. Krzyczewski. Her rendition of the beautiful "Circuit II March" was so well received that she was forced to give an encore.</p>
   <p>After this musical number, Mr. Rolycki spoke, urging all those present not to forget for a moment their starving brethren in Poland. "If we are to contribute to their relief, let us do it today, for tomorrow may be too late," he said. He described the awful suffering of the innocent war-victims, and pictured the plight of Poland whose men had been taken to give their blood in an alien cause. At this point, he asked the audience to honor those who had given their lives for their motherland, by rising. Everyone rose, while the orchestra played the sad and beautiful hymn, " Z Dymen Pozarow" (With the Smoke of the Conflagration).</p>
   
   <p>A collection for the relief fund followed, netting $56.87. During the collection, the band, led by Mr. Przybyszewski, played a beautiful medley of Polish songs.</p>
   <p>A quartet from the Paderewski Chorus sang "A Dream" as the final number on the program, after which the chairman thanked all those who had contributed to the success of the celebration, as well as the public for its attendance. He closed the exercises by asking the audience to sing the Polish national anthem "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
