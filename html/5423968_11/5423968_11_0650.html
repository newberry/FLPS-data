   <p>"This year marks the 101st year since our country was put in bondage. A century has elapsed since Poland was buried. Was she actually dead when buried? No! She was buried alive, and the most convincing proof that she did not die a century ago and is not dead now is the Poles of today.</p>
   <p>"Our nation lives; furthermore, it is expanding intellectually; it is increasing in numbers; its love for our martyred country is ever growing stronger; and its voice is constantly crying out to the whole world: 'Poland lives, but is suffering in chains!'</p>
   <p>"Nobody doubts that Poland, after this century of suffering, will be resurrected. Least of all do we, the sons and daughters of Poland, doubt <span class="page-break">\2</span>this, because from the moment when doubt steals into our hearts, we cease to be Poles; we intermingle with other nationalities, choosing the one most satisfactory to us.</p>
   <p>"Our friends--identical with the friends of historical justice--do not doubt the resurrection, because in all the political horoscopes, the restoration of Poland is always mentioned.</p>
   <p>"Our enemies and tormentors do not doubt it, because they are neither less watchful nor less severe in their persecutions, in their spying on us, and in placing traps to catch us wherever they can possibly do so.</p>
   <p>"That Poland will be resurrected after its era of martyrdom is indubitable, but when will this happen?....The first year after a century of torture has begun; does another series of such years await us? Will we, or our children, ever in our lifetimes see the day when our most cherished dream will be <span class="page-break">\3</span>realized? Can we hope that after being buried alive for a century, a new era will begin or has already begun signifying the rebirth and resurrection of our country?</p>
   <p>"We possess certain traditions, stories, national prophecies hidden deep in our hearts, which we protect and believe so fervently that cold reasoning is useless. These prophecies lie dormant and dim in the blood and bones of some, while others have boldly proclaimed them for many years past. We all feel that Poland was destined to suffer for one hundred years, and that after this hundred years, she will be resurrected. This was predicted by our peasant gooseherds (Geslarze) and by our poets. Wernyhora, a Cossack, described the triumphant battles we were to wage. The king of peasants, our Adam Mickiewicz, prophesied this in his published Gazeta Wojewodztwa Szawelskiego (The Gazette of the Szawelski Palatinate). A French horoscopist foretells it today. Although all of these predictions are dim, uncertain, and foggy, deep in our hearts we believe them, because it is so easy to <span class="page-break">\4</span>believe what one's soul desires.</p>
   <p>"The century of the martyrdom of our country can be divided into three epochs. Each of them lasted a third of a century, from thirty to thirty-five years. The first ended with the brave revolution of 1831; the second ended with the insurrection of 1863, which we are commemorating today. The third era is coming to a close now: Will a new revolution also end this era? Because of unusual circumstances in this period, it would seem that this should happen; it cannot be surprising, then, that all of us are awaiting not a useless revolution, but some triumphant battle, some miracle from God, the judge of all happenings, which will restore a free Poland!</p>
   <p>"It would seem that in view of our hopes and our faith, some decisive moment is approaching--a moment great and blessed--and we are preparing ourselves to meet it. It seems that we are whispering to each other: 'The time is approaching!' We are shaking each other's hands, coming to an <span class="page-break">\5</span>understanding, uniting and trying to be prepared to accept this long-awaited miracle at the proper moment. It would seem that the end of this century of bondage would find us so well prepared that it would need only a leader commanding us in the name of God and country--and none of us would be found missing.</p>
   <p>"That is how it should be. A nation less fervent but more sensible would act in this manner. Other nations which are friendly to our cause expect this of us. This is what our enemies fear.</p>
   <p>"And yet, it is not that way with us. Our hereditary misfortune, our quarrels, our quarrels, our lack of unity stand in the way. We lack something, some knot that would join us, some one, forceful, leading thought. Although love for one's country should be the knot that binds, the leading thought. although this love for our country lives in all our hearts, it still lacks the power to call us to unified action for our homeland. We all <span class="page-break">\6</span>agree on this one fact, but on thousands of others we have become divided into parties and camps, and we quarrel constantly. This happens here as well as abroad. We see one object but a thousand roads before us, and each of us chooses his own; we enter into labyrinths where we become lost, oftentimes going around in a circle and returning to our starting point; and we are just as far, if not farther, away from the object we seek. When one points the way, others seek to pull in another direction, and the same old blindness continues. And there is not one leading star, although it might point the way to our aim, which we would be willing to follow. There are only will-o'-the-wisps rising from stinking swamps. They tempt one to approach and then lead on to false roads.</p>
   <p>"How much longer will we be lost in a desert?</p>
   <p>"Let us take our thoughts away from this sad picture for a while, because it is too painful. It reminds us too clearly of some unhappy events of not long ago. About two years ago, when the Kosciusko year was being <span class="page-break">\7</span>celebrated, all our hearts were filled with new hope. Abroad and here in a strange country it seemed that we could hear the first strains of the bell of resurrection.</p>
   <p>"It was then that the Polish League was organized by representatives of all parties. With what ardor it was greeted! How it was acclaimed by everyone! How we were praised, congratulated, wished success, and promised support! What hopes this project kindled in our hearts!</p>
   <p>"It is sad to relate what happened to it....This poor Polish League has not disappeared completely, it is true, and perhaps it has a future; but today it is being choked by its own members--just as our country is being oppressed by our enemies.....</p>
   <p>"Let us stop thinking about this sad plight we are in, and let us look back to find reassurance in the history of the nations, to find an analogous <span class="page-break">\8</span>situation. Let us ask ourselves whether we could not benefit from a previous, similar situation and gain some hope for the future.</p>
   <p>"Alas, it is difficult to find such an example. Nations and countries have been destroyed and rebuilt on their own ruins; conquered nations have been absorbed by the conquerors, and even if the higher intellects of the subdued nation were able to influence the triumphant nation and change its customs and oftentimes its language and laws, still this can not be considered a restoration of the former nation--it is not a true resurrection. But, considering these epochal examples, we shall see that they have to slight a resemblance to our own situation. The oppressed and conquered nations accepted the new conditions without an attempt to regain their former greatness. We, alone, through an entire century, have not stopped our protests even for a moment; we have never lost hope of regaining our freedom and rising again; and what is most important, instead of losing our nationality and becoming absorbed by the conquering nations, we have <span class="page-break">\9</span>increased in numbers and in strength, and we are more powerful intellectually than we were a century ago. This strange and almost miraculous vitality--a vitality, as I might call it, truly predestined--can only be compared with one other instance like it in history.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Jan. 29, 1896.</p>
   <p>"Let us look back nineteen centuries ago when our Lord and plating His earthly sacrifice, sent His destitute Apostles to all points of the world. A terrible era in the history of Christianity began. The persecution of Christians lasted three centuries. Christians were murdered, dismembered, and tortured wherever they appeared. All of us are familiar with this sad history; I need not and have not the time to describe it here.</p>
   <p>"Briefly, the persecution of Christians reached its climax during the reign <span class="page-break">\10</span>of the Roman Emperor Dioclesian, who, with his associates, vowed to exterminate all Christians, and with insane brutality did kill and order to kill to the last Christian. Finally, it seemed to him that he had accomplished his object. There were no Christians, or at least he thought there were no more. Dioclesian was triumphant. There are two marble columns in Spain standing today which this brutal tyrant had erected to perpetuate his name. On one he appears as ruler of the world together with Emperor Maxim, and on the other with Emperor Galerius, and on both is the inscription, 'After the Extermination of the Christians and the Complete Eradication of the Christian Faith and Dissemination of the Glory of the Gods'.</p>
   <p>"It seemed that there were no Christians. A few years later we see two powerful leaders fighting for world control. One was Maxim, the son of Maximian, (the co-emperor with Dioclesian); the other was Constantine, the son of Constantine Chlorus. They were both pagans; their armies were pagan. There were Christians among the soldiers, but they were very <span class="page-break">\11</span>secretive: To believe in the Christian faith was still a crime. Constantine fought a few battles with Maxim with varying luck; first one, then the other would win. But Maxim had a greater army. Soon a decisive battle was to be fought, and nobody doubted that Maxim would be the victor.</p>
   <p>"Constantine prayed to his gods. While praying one time, he cried aloud, as if inspired: 'And the Christians have some kind of a god. If you, the God of Christians, hear me and are more powerful than the other gods; if you give me victory and show me some sign under which, in your name, I can fight, I shall offer myself and my entire empire to your honor.'</p>
   <p>"That day he advanced to meet Maxim. The day was beautiful; not a cloud in the sky. Suddenly, at noon, the soldiers, the commanders, and the commander-in-chief stopped in surprise, their faces raised to the sky. There appeared, visible to all of them, a flaming cross on high, and in the flames were the words 'In This Sign You Shall Conquer!' The entire army saw this miracle.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>The Emperor was astounded. It was whispered that that was the sign of the Christians. The Emperor ordered those who were suspected of being Christians to be brought before him. They tried to explain the meaning of the Cross, but the Emperor shook his head. A God who died on the cross did not appear to him to be a true God.</p>
   <p>"His mind filled with conflicting thoughts, the Emperor fell asleep. In his sleep he had another vision: A white-clad figure with a cross in his hand--the figure of our Saviour. Reassuring him once again that in the sign of the Cross he would conquer, Christ asked him to make a flag which would bring victory in this battle.</p>
   <p>"The following day, Constantine did not hesitate. He called in some workman who drew a sketch of the flag. Constantine ordered it to be made at once. It was in the shape of a lance with a tin shield covered with gold and horizontal arms, forming the shape of a cross. At the top of the cross <span class="page-break">\13</span>was a crown studded with precious stones, and on it the first two letters of the Greek name of Jesus Christ. From one arm there hung a gold woven cloth with a picture of the Emperor and his children on it. Then he chose fifty of his personal guards to carry the flag alternately. The flag was called Labarum.</p>
   <p>"Heartened by this sign, the Emperor did not hesitate to fight a decisive battle with Maxim. The battle was extraordinary, miraculous: Constantine won a decisive victory. Maxim, while fleeing, drowned in the river Tiber, and Rome opened its gates to Constantine.</p>
   <p>"As ruler of the world, Constantine requested the pope, St. Sylvester, to come to him, so that he [Constantine] could understand the tenets of the Christian faith, and later issued an edict favoring the Christians. Finally, he became a Christian himself and the Cross was thereafter triumphant, barely a few years after the presumably complete extermination of the Christians....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>"Perhaps the description of this well-known event has been a trifle long. But it came to my mind, and I thought it was appropriate. Let us consider the history of Europe further, and we shall discover that all kinds of battles were fought, and Europe was changed in appearance many times. But very seldom did they fight in the name or in the sign of the Cross: Nations forgot about this heavenly symbol, 'In This Sign You Shall Conquer!'</p>
   <p>"And what about Poland? I wish to remind you of a few events. Poland became a kingdom when the Cross came to it. This was the first evidence of the Cross; Poland enhanced its own power. Poland became mighty and occupied Lithuania when she carried the Cross to this pagan nation; in the name of the Cross, she became a power.</p>
   <p>"Poland began to weaken when she began to forget the Cross. Defeat threatened her. Once more the Cross displayed its power at Czestochowa, and when John Casimir renounced his regal titles in honor of Holy Mary, the Queen of <span class="page-break">\15</span>Heaven, Poland came to her senses.</p>
   <p>"When Christianity in Europe was again threatened with extinction; when the Turks arrived before Vienna in their triumphant march, then once again a faithful follower of Holy Mary and the most fervent of Christian European monarchs, King John Sobieski, achieved a miraculous victory in the name of the Cross. Who can doubt that in the instances just related, the Cross and the Cross alone was victorious; that it led the nation to triumph when the nation was willing to follow it?</p>
   <p>"And yet the Cross was later abandoned; it was thrown away and was completely ignored. Then Poland fell. There followed a century of imprisonment, suffering, and torture. Let no one claim that there were sincere and praiseworthy efforts or that there were instances of religious fervor and bravery in the Kosciusko November and January revolutions. There may have been a few indications, but there was no all-embracing, invincible, great <span class="page-break">\16</span>mutual faith in the Cross; the Cross was not there to lead us, as the pagan army of Constantine was led. During the revolutions faith in the Cross did not supersede everything; true, it was accepted and respected, but absolute and invincible faith was lacking.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Jan. 30, 1896.</p>
   <p>"Today, my dear brethren, after a century of persecution of our nation, we are, like the Jews, lost in a desert, not knowing whether days or years separate us from the promised land; and we see many paths and many roads, but we cannot find the one that will lead us to the object of our hearts' desires. We lack a guiding star. Will-o'-the-wisps lead us. We mistake them for stars and follow them and circle around without end, uncertain after a while as to whether we have approached closer to our object or whether we are farther away.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\17</span>
   <p>"Alas, these false flares are our misfortune! Just like the horrid swamps from which they rise, they also wish to destroy us. We are told to consider them as stars, and we, fools that we are, oftentimes chase them!</p>
   <p>"My dear countrymen, I was to speak about the Catholic Congress. The time allotted for me to speak is ending, and so far I have not even mentioned a word about my theme for this evening. Do I need to speak much about it? Everything I have said concerns this project. We need unity, peaceful co-operation, a union of our strength; we need the ability to see the light leading us to our goal. We have tried out various methods to discover it, but all of them have disappointed us. But now a new project has evolved which, of itself, reassures us that we are treading the right path: It is the plan to call a Catholic Congress and it is to begin in the name and in the sign of the Cross! Who, among us, would not support such a project? There will be some who will shrug their shoulders charitably and laugh at us; but it is a favor to us to be scorned for the Cross.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\18</span>
   <p>"This most holy sign, this most perfect sign, this invincible sign which even led the pagan armies to victory; this sign that should be our guiding star and which would undoubtedly lead us by the shortest way to our goal: Certainly we respect it, but it is put before us by some of our own brethren and by our enemies as a sign to be honored, worth hiding in our souls and minds, but not worthy of leading us in our national aspirations, as a thing entirely foreign and not connected in the least with our patriotic feeling.</p>
   <p>"O, dear brethren, does not the history of the world give us enough examples to prove that it is not a strange thing; that it is not a minor matter; that it is not a thing that has no connection with love of one's country, but, on the contrary, that it is the most important and only road leading us to our object; that it is the only star which makes the will-o'-the-wisps disappear like ghosts; that it is the only sign in which we can possibly triumph?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\19</span>
   <p>"As dear to me as is my country, so dear to me is the Cross. As I crave in this life supreme happiness--the freedom of my beloved country--for which I am prepared to sacrifice everything, so in my future life, in eternity, I hope to arrive where the Cross leads me. Just as I believe that our country has a great future before it and will be free and independent some day, so do I believe that this can only happen with the Cross and under the leadership of the Cross--that it is the only sign in which we can triumph.</p>
   <p>"If another war awaits us for and in defense of our country; if in the near future we are called upon to sacrifice our all and life itself, then let us do so willingly, but let us carry the Labarum at our head, because only in this sign can we conquer.</p>
   <p>"We are preparing ourselves and should continue our preparations for this blessed event--this resurrection--which will follow a war, perhaps decisive both here and abroad. But let us do this in a different manner <span class="page-break">\20</span>than we did heretofore. Let us place our complete, undivided confidence in this sign which led Christian and pagan armies to victory as long as they believed in it. And we in America, adding our little to the universal preparations, must also follow the same spirit in our own beginnings. Let us not wander around in a maze; let us not seek the will-o'-the-wisps that beckon us to follow them, but let us begin where we should have begun long ago--let us turn our eyes to the Cross.</p>
   <p>"There are a few who will say that faith is something separate, and patriotism has nothing in common with faith; but we point to the examples of Constantine The Great, King Menceslaus, St. Hedwig, Kordecki, John Casimir, Sobieski, etc.</p>
   <p>"Others say they respect the Cross and that it should be respected, but that it should be hidden in the soul and the mind--that national signs in national work are more important. We will show them Labarum, the flag combining the sign of national action with the sign of the Most Holy Faith, the only true <span class="page-break">\21</span>faith, in which nations were victorious.</p>
   <p>"There are some people, too, who will warn us that among the Poles there are many professing a different faith or no faith at all, and yet they are ardent patriots, very important for the cause, and that the Cross may curse them. We shall tell them that when the army of Constantine, under the Labarum, was triumphant, only a few Christians were among these former enemies, torturers of Christ and pagans.</p>
   <p>"Do not pay attention to these voices. We have had enough of their false leadership. Let the one guiding star shine for us--the star of salvation, the only light leading to the object we desire, and this same cross which appeared to the armies of Constantine with the inscription: 'In This Sign You Shall Conquer'.</p>
   <p>"With all our strength, with all the influence we possess, let us support <span class="page-break">\22</span>the plan of calling a Catholic Congress in this first year after a century of suffering, and God willing, we shall find ourselves on the desired path and will emerge from the labyrinth of crooked roads to walk along freely and without detours toward what all of us desire.</p>
   <p>"And fear not that we shall be alone. The doubters, the opponents, the uncertain and unwilling--all those who wish to deserve the name of Poles and do not want to be left behind in the desert--will follow along as soon as we show them the way. Our faith lies in the Catholic Congress, because in the Cross lies our salvation.</p>
   <p>"And this same Cross, which, as a symbol of suffering, taught our beloved nation to know how to suffer; this same cross, as a symbol of salvation and triumph, will lead it from the grave and surround it with a gleaming aureola in the future."</p>
