   <p>Philip M. Ksycki, advertising manager for the Alliance publications and widely known in both Polish and American circles, was highly honored recently by being appointed to the State Council of Defense Publicity Committee for Cook County.</p>
   <p>This is a very important post, to which only the most capable, energetic, and trustworthy men, known for their unqualified loyalty to this country, are called.</p>
   <p>The task of the National Defense Committee is to aid actively in providing for every one of this country's wartime needs. The appointment of Ksycki to this Committee is singularly appropriate, for he is fully capable and will do the Polish element here credit.</p>
   <p>We extend our congratulations to him upon being thus honored.</p>
