   <p>The following letter has been received from Warsaw:</p>
   <p>"The emigration of country and city dwellers from various parts of the Kingdom of Poland to America is this year again assuming considerable proportions.</p>
   <p>"The reason for this is the unheard-of difficulties in trade, business, and farming which a gang of Muscovite hoodlums are spreading all around.</p>
   <p>"They arrive with empty pockets from the depths of Russia and wax rich on the spoils stolen from the people, just to go back to the place from where they came to live comfortably on their ill-gotten wealth.</p>
   <p>"Shortsighted high officials of the Muscovite government are blind to all that is happening and do not realize that this indifference is weakening the foundation of their own welfare."</p>
   
   <p>But this is not all....</p>
   <p>Our immigrants, arriving here in America, presumably the home of all oppressed peoples, will soon realize how mistaken they were in running away from the Russian knout.</p>
   <p>They will find here the knouts of the Lodges, the Johnsons, and other members of the A. P. A. [American Protective Association]. They will become convinced that, according to these gentlemen, freedom has an empty ring, and that the Russian is just as powerful in Washington, District of Columbia as he is in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
   <p>Sad, indeed--sad beyond belief....</p>
