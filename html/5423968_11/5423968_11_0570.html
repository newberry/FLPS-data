   <p>We are living in an age in which the writing of editorials does not depend, as the Americans say, on the opinion of one man, since his opinion alone, however good his intentions, is bound to do more harm than good.</p>
   <p>We cannot make accurate political investigations because we depend mostly on telegraphic reports that are altered and on European newspapers that are three or four weeks old.</p>
   <p>One cannot indulge in daydreams when writing an editorial--daydreams belong in another section. Arguments with our well-wishing colleagues of the pen (God help us!) lead nowhere either, because they have degraded the art of argumentation to the level of a chat between two women of the Szczcpanski market place.</p>
   <p>Therefore, since my political deductions are likely to make a fool of me, since I am not allowed to write about my daydreams in this space, and since I have <span class="page-break">2</span>not been trained in the art of scolding and calling other people names, I reach for the "Voice of the People" as a drowning man reaches for a straw, for the typesetter is waiting and one cannot leave a blank space in the paper.</p>
   <p>I solemnly declare that what I am writing here is based on my personal views on the matter, views for which the paper has graciously granted me space in its columns and for which it should not be held responsible, as I do not wish to draw down on the heads of the innocent members of the Polish National Alliance the accusation that they are Muscovites or something similar.</p>
   <p>Therefore, holding out my hands in fear and despair, and anticipating lashes from the whips of the excellent writers under the red or black sign, and asking for the sharpest condemnation (which I need for my editorial crown of thorns), I begin:</p>
   <p>All political orientations have got it in the neck. The self-same dignitaries of homeland politics who have tried to convert the dollars of the Alliance <span class="page-break">3</span>members to their own faith are divided among themselves, thus giving proof that, in spite of the whole reams of paper that embrace their so-called deductions and orientations based on conviction and experience, they will never get as far as the courts of Huerta, Carranza, or Villa, much less to the forum of international politics, which during the present war has taken on monstrous forms.</p>
   <p>We have been worrying our heads over all sorts of enlightened opinions, shattering our picks on them, while in the meantime war has come and all of our informers, as one man, have shown the white feather and left us on the rocks of intolerant and rash Polish-American politics.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we lack unity and harmony of opinion. Only the bare facts which the last few days have brought us stand forth clearly.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that all of Galicia, as one man, has taken up arms and, disregarding everything, has declared itself for Austria.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is also a fact that sooner or later Austria's enemies will win, and she herself, like a denuded criminal, will stand before the international forum which will delineate the new map of Europe.</p>
   <p>What will become of us then? Will we be regarded as allies of Austria and treated as such or will some dark little corner be found for us at this great political table, where, with great courtesy and sweetness, one member after the other is going to be amputated from the little Austro-German body?</p>
   <p>In order to answer these questions I must go back to those times when--Oh, wonder!--I was taught the rudiments of international law and had the rules of political maneuvers drilled into me. International law is concerned with alliances, unions, treaties, etc.,--pacts between politically free nations--but it does not contain the slightest mention of any treaty between master and slave.</p>
   <p>Galicia is Austria's slave. Therefore, why should there be any anxiety as to <span class="page-break">5</span>whether the diplomats, who at least are a little wiser than I and even wiser than all of our political leaders--not even omitting the aldermen of the Sixteenth Ward--will consider Galicia a free and independent political unit and, as such, punish her for joining the enemy--the Triple Alliance.</p>
   <p>This is the first argument, product of my Galician brain! Is it silly? The specialist in all sorts of nonsense from Milwaukee Avenue will evaluate it and will graciously condescend to inform others!</p>
   <p>Further, Galicia, by taking up arms at the present time and, in addition, becoming a united, single-party Galicia (which must be considered the first miracle), can be considered either an obedient Cinderella who went forward to break her neck pro maiore Austriae gloria or she can be considered a living national unit striving to win freedom and independence. Galicia is either a Haspburg servant, a resurrected Piast [name of first Polish dynasty], or the legendary Knight of the Tatra Mountains at Zakopane! [Translator's note: Giewont, a mountain peak seen from Zakopane, is called the Sleeping Knight <span class="page-break">6</span>because of its formation.]</p>
   <p>If the diplomats regard us as the servants of the Hapsburgs, then we have lost--if as the Sleeping Knight, then they will have to negotiate with us.</p>
   <p>The alternative may not be to the liking of those who want to consider Galicia the obedient servant of His Austrian Majesty. But there is a solution for this, a simple peasant solution which is irresistible. If the Polish insurrectionists in Galicia will not lay down their arms (of which there can be no possible fear) after the decisive Russo-Austrian battle, if they continue to fight on and with good results (which will not be difficult for them since they will have millions of people behind them), then all diplomats must turn their attention toward us. Since the diplomats will ardently desire peace, they will have to call out: "Stop, boys! Come over and tell us what you want." Then we shall have what we want; namely: a place at the diplomatic congress so that we may demand our right to freedom and self-determination.</p>
   <p>The fears of some of our pessimists, who claim that Europe then would have us <span class="page-break">7</span>murdered or sent to Siberia, are foolish and absolutely unfounded. Twentieth-century Europe is capable of a criminal war, but it will never be capable of a criminal peace, if only for the reason, which I have tried before to point out, that Poland, both geographically and culturally, is the only country which can fill the role of a buffer state between Russia and Germany. The creation of a buffer state is the concern of all the victors in the present war and for this reason alone the Western Powers cannot condemn Poland to death and annihilation. By declaring herself for Austria, Poland has tossed the gauntlet at Eastern barbarism and declared herself for Western culture. After the war all civilized countries will feel the same revulsion at bloodshed that, a cabinetmaker just hired as a butcher's assistant feels toward his new profession.</p>
   <p>Finally, pessimists will argue that the Polish legions are under the command of Austrians. The answer to this is simple: Austria gave our legions arms and allowed them to train in war maneuvers, which other countries did not do. Without this training, we would have resembled soldiers threatening the sun with hoes. We would have accomplished about as much as our fathers did in the unfortunate <span class="page-break">8</span>year of 1863, when they tried to take cannons with shotguns.</p>
   <p>Practical life teaches us to take what someone gives us, and surely war teaches us to forget all theories and scruples and take even those things which no one gives.</p>
   <p>Therefore, since all Galicia has taken up arms, since it is certain that her motto will find a pleasant echo in the ranks of our brothers under Russian domination, since it is not in our power--not even by using thousands of bottles of ink--to stop the current of events, since politics should and do go on across the sea, we over here should be silent, disciplined, and obedient. Then let us listen and be disciplined, because by so doing we shall not draw upon ourselves any responsibility in respect to the homeland.</p>
   <p>Let us listen and send money. All of the Polish-American bickerings here are nothing, the senseless spending of money for conventions is nothing, all of our politics is nothing, in view of the immensity of events which are now <span class="page-break">9</span>taking place in Europe and indirectly affecting all humanity.</p>
   <p>This is what I believe. If you think I am wrong, beat me--but you will not convert me.</p>
