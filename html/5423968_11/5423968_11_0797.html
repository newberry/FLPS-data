   <p>Madame Helen Modrzejewski appears on the stage of a Polish hall in company with Polish amateurs! Madame Modrzejewski plays "Catherine Koguciak" in "Chlopach Arystokratach" (Peasant Aristocrats) by Anczyc! The famous Polish actress, regarded in the theaters of the world as an unequaled interpreter of Shakespearian drama, who has achieved countless triumphs in both hemispheres, whose arrival in almost every capital always creates a holiday [atmosphere], and whose appearance on the stage is greeted with enthusiasm--this same Madame Medrzejewski, with whom the world's foremost actors (e.g., Booth) consider it an honor and a privilege to appear, has appeared in a Polish folk play in company with our Polish-American amateur players! This is indeed a singular occasion, capable of arousing the interest of even a most indifferent [public], for it is an event that can be witnessed only rarely during the course of a lifetime. It is an event that will remain forever in the memories of these who have been fortunate enough to experience it.</p>

   <p>It is no wonder, then, that the Polish hall on Bradley Street [St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall] was filled to capacity; were it twice as large, it would undoubtedly have been filled also. Already on the morning after the tickets were printed, reserved seats were no longer available; later, anyone who could get in to see the performance at all considered himself fortunate.</p>
   <p>We find it impossible to write a review of the performance. Whatever we might write would seem weak and inadequate in comparison with what has been said and written of Madame Modrzejewski not hundreds but thousands of times; we cannot hope to add laurels to the many wreaths of fame which this incomparable artiste has already earned, and we do not even try. But in submitting a report of her performance, we wish, at least, to touch upon several points that may prove valuable and instructive to our amateur players--to those who had the honor of appearing with Madame Modrzejewski, as well as to all others.</p>
   <p>For Madame Modrzejewski, in appearing yesterday, and by her prospective appearance next week, not only brings great honor to Chicago's Polonia, she not only shows herself to be an angel of charity, considering the cause for <span class="page-break">\3</span>the benefit of which these appearances are made, but she has also become, to a certain extent, a teacher, whose lessons might well be taken to heart by our amateur players and our public at large.</p>
   <p>Even in her recitation of Ujejski's beautiful "Hagar Na Puszczy" (Agar on the Desert), and afterwards, in the short poem "Moj Boze, Moj Boze!" (My God, My God!), which she added by request, she demonstrated to attentive listeners the difference between a top-ranking artist and artists of lesser magnitude, not to mention ordinary amateurs. Our players ought to give this their most careful attention, not with the hope that they can ever equal her, for that is impossible, but to try, in proportion to their own individual abilities as nonprofessionals, to give their self-instruction a certain direction, a certain character. It is noteworthy that Madame Modrzejewski can speak softly (if the role demands it), and yet be heard throughout the hall much better than others who speak considerably louder. Our Hall has certain [acoustical] defects that prevent even the loudest-speaking persons from being heard distinctly at all times, and then, our audiences have not yet learned to maintain the absolute silence necessary during stage productions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But after all, an important fact was worth noting during Madame Modrzejewski's recitation: she could be heard far better than those who spoke more loudly than she did. The main reason for this is that her enunciation, that is, her manner of pronouncing each word, is nothing short of perfect; secondly, her voice control is unequaled--by modulation of her voice, she interprets the finest shades of meaning...[in the lines she speaks]. Many of us think that, after all, we speak Polish well, that we pronounce the words correctly, that we certainly know what we are talking about, and that our voices express our emotions adequately; yet, all this cannot compare with the artistry with which a skilled stage performer interprets the thoughts of authors. There are different requirements in elocution and voice modulation on the stage than under other circumstances. Skill is acquired only after long and erduous training, such training as, for example, is necessary for the mastery of a musical instrument, or vocal art. Just as in music, which has its levels that characterize artists, amateurs, and dilettanti, so in declamation, in which elocution and voice control are most important, there are higher and lower levels of artistry. Even an amateur can acquire this art to a greater degree <span class="page-break">\5</span>than one would imagine. Our artiste [Madame Modrzejewski] possesses it to the highest degree, and as a result her quiet voice can be heard and understood better than that of those who speak louder.</p>
   <p>Only one who attended yesterday's performance can appreciate the impression made by "Kogucina," portrayed by our dramatic actress a few moments after she had appeared as an elocutionist.</p>
   <p>Perhaps never so much as today have we had reason to regret that our Dziennik [Chicagoski] is so small a newspaper, that it has so little space within its pages; we are forced, however, to postpone conclusion of these notes suggested by last night's performance (we cannot call this a review) until tomorrow, for we cannot stretch our columns, no matter how much we would like to do so.</p>
