   <p>Great honor has been bestowed upon Poles of Chicago by the largest and strongest political party. Credit for this honor is due to the happy circumstance that the Poles in Chicago have in their midst a countryman who has been able to gain during the thirty-five years' stay in America great importance among the Poles and the deep respect of almost all nationalities in this great metropolis. He gained this importance and respect by meritorious deeds, his excellent character, righteousness, frankness, unusual abilities, and true love for both his native and adopted countries.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbasa was born on Oct. 13, 1838, in Swiba, Silesia, a part of Poland occupied by Germany. When he was seventeen years of age, he and his parents emigrated to America and established their residence in Santa Maria, Texas.</p>
   
   <p>As a boy endowed with great abilities, he adapted himself very quickly to the new life in the country. In spite of the hard work on the farm that he and his parents had to perform, he succeeded in learning, without a teacher, how to speak, read, and write English correctly. Besides this, he gained a fair knowledge of Spanish. He also continued to improve the German which he had learned in Germany. For some time he was employed as a clerk at Piedras Negras, Mexico, where he had the opportunity to study Spanish and commerce. Later on he passed a State teacher's examination and became the first Polish teacher of the first Polish school in America, at Santa Maria, Texas, where in a short time he gained great popularity and became a favorite of all in that vicinity.</p>
   <p>When the Civil War broke out Mr. Peter Kiolbasa enlisted in the U. S. Army and became a member of the 16th Reg. of Ill. Cavalry. His services were so satisfactory that he was made a corporal, a sergeant, and in a short time he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and later on to that of captain in the 6th Regiment.</p>
   <p>After the Civil War, Mr. Kiolbasa held many positions; he was a desk sergeant in the Chicago Police Department, later on secretary of the Chief of police, and in 1873 he was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue. He held this position eleven years and performed his duties very scrupulously.</p>
   <p>When the United States changed its administration by electing a Democratic President, he and his associates resigned and from that time until now he refused to accept any kind of public office.</p>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of the Poles in America to this, that Mr. Peter Kiolbasa did not forget that he is a Pole, even though he held important positions and was very popular; on the contrary, he associated with Poles and served them whenever and wherever he could; he lived in Polish settlements belonged to as many Polish organizations as he could, took active part in conferences and all kinds of activities, promoted the welfare of the Polish element, was devoted to the Polish cause, and above all he did not seek praises, honors, or distinctions, but followed the dictate of his heart and the urge of warm patriotism.</p>
   <p>He served the Poles not only collectively but also individually. His great experience, his extensive connections with different people, his accumulated knowledge, his familiarity with American laws proved to be of great assistance and benefit to his countrymen. The Poles, therefore, went to Mr. Kiolbasa for information, advice, and help. Frequently he had to give advice on family matters, which was some times very amusing, but a practical advice was given by him and on some occasions it was very severe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbasa does not like to handle anyone with silk gloves; he is not afraid to tell the truth and tells it so plainly and realistically that a person not acquainted with him would have the impression that he is angry.</p>
   
   <p>He has the frankness of a soldier and tells the truth whenever he thinks it is necessary.</p>
   <p>After his resignation from the Internal Revenue Department, Mr. Peter Kiolbasa enlarged his notary public office, and from that time on he devoted himself to the service of his countrymen. Many people found good advice and consolation in his office; free if they could not afford to pay for it. Many persons saved attorney's fees by applying to Mr. Peter Kiolbasa for legal advice, who rendered them valuable service for a very small compensation. We are certain that among the hundred thousand Poles living in Chicago, there are not a hundred who would not love him or at least respect him.</p>
   <p>His name is known to every Pole in the United States, and no other Pole is so popular, though many of them are richer and hold better positions.</p>
   
   <p>Besides the Poles in Chicago, Mr. Peter Kiolbasa also has many friends among other nationalities, which he made during his tenure of public office by associating with them, by being their mediator and on account of his noble character. This is the reason why every one is seeking his friendship. His frank and zealous defense of Catholicism has also gained him many friends among Catholics and respect among the enemies of Catholicism. Furthermore, he never denied his principles for any personal reason. Even Germans, especially Catholics, ask for stickers with his name on because they wish to replace Nettlehorst on Harrison's ticket.</p>
   <p>The following incident, which occurred last November, will prove how great is Mr. Kiolbasa's popularity. On account of the coming Archbishop's jubilee, Catholics of many nationalities held a mass meeting, at which they arranged for a big parade and chose a marshall. At that meeting the Catholics bestowed this great honor upon Mr. Kiolbasa, notwithstanding the fact that other nationalities are more numerous.</p>
   
   <p>It was worth while to see Mr. Kiolbasa supervising the parade through the streets. The reporters were amazed when they heard his command of English, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Bohemian, and other languages. Greatly astonished they asked: "How many languages does he speak?"</p>
   <p>His manly, handsome, and still young form, mounted on a horse, made a very imposing impression, though he is 52 years old. Americans had seen a form like his eight years before, when the painting "The Turks at Vienna" was exhibited on the two hundredth anniversary of that historical event, and on account of that they called Mr. Kiolbasa the king of Poland.</p>
   <p>He presented a magnificent and imposing appearance; yet he attracted everyone by his simplicity and friendly attitude. This friendly attitude is reciprocated by his sympathizers, who know him well and have a deep affection for him.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Peter Kiolbasa has not been very lucky in the true sense of the word, for he, too, has gone through many hardships. In spite of his hard work, he did not accumulate wealth. He experienced very unfortunate mishaps, especially in his own family. His beloved son died at the age of great hope, after receiving a good education, when he showed great abilities and expected a promising future. After his son's death and not so long ago, for it occurred in the last part of last year, he lost his married daughter, and now Mr. and Mrs. Kiolbasa have only one daughter left.</p>
   <p>All Poles sympathize with Mr. Kiolbasa and will give him their support. All Poles, regardless of their political affiliations, or candidates for whom they will give their votes for other offices, will vote for Mr. Kiolbasa by placing his name in the proper place, and thereby make him city treasurer. All Poles will endeavor, by all means, to help Mr. Kiolbasa gain victory in the coming election, which will in turn gain a great honor and innumerable benefits for all Poles living here.</p>
