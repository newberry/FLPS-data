   <p>Francis K. Baytel, part owner of a Warsaw trading company, who has been in Chicago for the past few weeks, has established a Polish importing and exporting agency here. His purpose is to import from Poland such articles as can be sold in the United States and to create a market for American goods in Poland. Much is still to be done in improving commercial relations with our homeland. Mr. Baytel has already established connections, so that the new company will begin its operations next week. Walter Jaworowski, also of Warsaw, will be the company's agent [Prokurent] in Chicago. The company's offices will be located in room 1012, Masonic Temple.</p>
