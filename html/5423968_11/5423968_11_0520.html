   <p>Along with millions of other Poles, we, the delegates to Commune 91, Polish National Alliance, St. Helen's Parish, express our most heartfelt sorrow at the death of the great author and spiritual leader of the Polish nation, Henryk Sienkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The death of so great a son of Poland as was Henryk Sienkiewicz is another painful blow to suffering Poland, which at the present time needs millions of sons of the caliber of the late author. Son of Poland, your body is dead, but your spirit lives and will continue to guide the Polish nation along those paths which you, great leader, showed that nation during life, until it finds that freedom for Poland which we had expected to hear proclaimed from your lips.</p>
   <p>Our love and honor to you, great leader! May you rest in peace.</p>
   <p>Committee: J. Kasprzyk, R. Wawrzecka, and S. Kilar.</p>
