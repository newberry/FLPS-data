   <p>Since the year 1795 Poland has been divided by her neighbors into three parts, each one subjected politically to a different aggressor: one to Austria, one to Germany and one to Russia. [Translator's note: Until united and set free during the so-called World War, 1914-1918.]</p>
   <p>Long before that time the nearly thirty millions of Poles have been anxiously awaiting and actively preparing themselves for the day, on which they will again become a politically independent nation. To that effect, besides other ways and means, they were organizing themselves into different national and political factions, at times misled or shortsighted in political orientation, but always with one common end in view, and with one undisturbed desire to shake off the threefold political yoke and to have Poland free of any enslaving bonds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>One of such factional organizations, and a very influential one in shaping national and political tendencies among the Poles in their motherland and abroad, was the so-called Polska Rada Narodowa - Polish National Council - in Galicia, that is, in that part of Poland, which was held under the domination of Austria.</p>
   <p>Because of the common interest and the continuous, intimate contact between the Poles in their motherland and those in the United States, it was very natural and advisable that the influence of the Galician Polish National Council would reach the Poles in Chicago and inspire them to organize, under identical name and for akin purpose, a similar body out of those Polish countrymen who sympathize with that particular orientation. And so there has been formed in Chicago another Polish National Council, affiliated with the first one in Galicia, and sponsored by the Polish Daily News; Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>Now, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, the Polish Alliance Daily, tries to prove that the two councils are incongruous - that the one in Chicago is not a true <span class="page-break">3</span>representative of that in Galicia - not even with the presence of two representatives of the Galician Polish National Council, Messrs. Cienski and Weckowski, at the Chicago Polish National Council's Convention, to be held July 7. In the opinion of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, all that the two councils have in common is only the name, with everything else in them fundamentally different. Therefore, says Dziennik Zwiazkowy, the local, Chicago Polish National Council should not boast that it is a true representative of the original and genuine Polish National Council in Galicia.</p>
