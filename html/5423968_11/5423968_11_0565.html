   <p>The fatherland is calling for help. Polish legions are shedding blood for Poland. Poland demands help from Polish colonies of America. Give what you can to the national treasury.</p>
   <p>Galicia put up five millions in one week. How much will the Polish-American colony donate? The general administration of the Union, P. R. C. U., is calling for donations for the cause of Poland. Give what you can, give the most, let societies, their administration and members give. Let's give, everyone and encourage others to give. Let's all give, father, mother, brother, sister, daughter.</p>
   <p>Send donations to this address: Leon Zamorski, Treasurer, 984-8 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago.</p>
