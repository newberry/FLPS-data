   <p>In May we celebrated with joy a great moment in our history, of which historians write, the poets sing, of which rings and thunders the Polish song. Yes, it was a great moment. The Polish sun was darkened, but in the end the rays of liberty and independence did appear. However, once more on the dark horizon of Poland came a radient morning encouraging the hearts of the doubting and despairing, giving them confidence an courage - for the future. About that great moment our Polish poets have to sing, that this bright morning-dawn will lighten forever our hearts and souls, never to be darkened.</p>
   <p>This morning - dawn is the Constitution of May the third. It is an act of high importance in the history of our people. Today the whole Polish nation weeps like Jeremiah, but possesses courage and hope for rebirth and resurrection. May we sing in all holy places. "O Father, Lord, thy children cry deserving a better fate, and we trust that a brighter fate will be ours."</p>
   <p>Of that we are assured, through the Blood of our martyrs, by our Polish songs.</p>

   <p>Our weapons will be the ideals of our nation. In the name of these ideals we will be victors.</p>
   <p>Today, in these dark hours, we turn to that bright morning dawn, to those radiant days.</p>
   <p>This great moment is a landmark, a fiery pillar between a fallen Poland and Poland young, full of new life, emerging from the grave.</p>
   <p>We must pray to God and the Holly Virgin to endow us with the faith in the Polish cause, to give us power and endurance for continuous work. To create in our hearts love for our Polish songs, which are a universal remedy for human pains and affliction of our souls.</p>
   <p>We must have faith that this great moment will come at last.</p>
