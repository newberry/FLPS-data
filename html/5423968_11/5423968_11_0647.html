   <p>Today, in these dark hours, we turn to that bright morning dawn, to those radiant days.</p>
   <p>This great moment is a landmark, a fiery pillar between a fallen Poland and Poland young, full of new life, emerging from the grave.</p>
   <p>We must pray to God and the Holly Virgin to endow us with the faith in the Polish cause, to give us power and endurance for continuous work. To create in our hearts love for our Polish songs, which are a universal remedy for human pains and affliction of our souls.</p>
   <p>We must have faith that this great moment will come at last.</p>
