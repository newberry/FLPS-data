   <p>As conditions in Poland become more and more stabilized, and all forms of social activity are subordinated to the will and the destiny of the nation, it is essential that immediate steps be taken to bring under proper control our irresponsible and arbitrary representatives in foreign lands, who thus far have accomplished very little good but on the contrary have caused a hundred times more harm.</p>
   <p>We wish to discuss this question from the point of view of an American citizen who because of spiritual and cultural ties with Poland feels deeply and with intense suffering that here and elsewhere in the world Poland is underestimated, not to say looked upon with scorn and disdain. This is due, in large measure, to improper or insufficient Polish representation abroad.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Let us divide this matter into two parts: the question of the official diplomatic representation of the Polish republic abroad and the question of its occasional, and temporary representation, as by delegations, and commissions sent here from Poland.</p>
   <p>First let us discuss the permanent representation, the diplomatic officials.</p>
   <p>Poland, as we know, has no school of diplomacy as yet and no diplomatic traditions; she has not been able, so far, to form such a school and so she is forced to send abroad "gentlemen" of all sorts, principally of the aristocracy, who represent Poland in the worst possible way. They deserve to be disciplined if not penalized for neglect of their duties. They are frequently preoccupied with profitable business deals of their own.</p>
   <p>We know of such cases, cases concerning which there is no doubt. And after all, it is nothing astonishing. In the first days of the newly reconstituted state, when Poland lacked everything, and everything had to be settled without much delay, errors in judgment were inevitable. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>diplomatic service was filled with titled personages of Polish-Austrian, Polish-Prussian, or Polish-Russian aristocracy because of an accepted belief, without foundation, that the Polish aristocracy had exceptional talents for politics and diplomacy. This is especially regrettable because they were to represent the truly democratic government of Poland, a country that belongs to the common people, a country with the most advanced from of government, at least on paper. Such aristocrats were sent even to the most advanced republics, their only qualifications for diplomatic posts abroad being a smattering of some foreign language and their wealth.</p>
   <p>The selection of personnel was frequently most unfortunate. We know of cases in which such gentlemen diplomats made veritable asses of themselves, assuming haughty airs and acting the role of princes and important personages. Foreigners who came into contact with them were filled with disgust at such examples of Polish diplomacy. We should not object to a certain amount of this posing and acting--foreigners seem to be impressed by it--if only the interests of the Polish republic were properly represented. Alas, it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>was just the opposite, the worst possible! As an example let us mention this fact, that when Poland was in her direst need, during the Bolshevik invasion, when foreign governments were waiting impatiently for some definite pronouncement from Polish representatives, these gentlemen were silent, and some of them even left for watering places and diverted themselves at seaside resorts, applying themselves to the diplomatic study of the superb costumes of the ladies of the world and of the demimonde there on parade and exhibition. At least it was so in America. But their diplomatic travail was amply remunerated in connection with activities carried on in the interest of Poland, such as speeches, business trips, and conferences for which disgracefully high expenses were charged to firms with whom they had dealings. By such actions they are bringing nothing but disgrace to the Polish people, and they are seriously obstructing the interests of the Polish republic.</p>
   <p>Such has been Poland's diplomatic service; such has been her representation abroad. We knew much about these matters, very much; we have frequently heard what official American circles think of them, how they despise them; <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>we know the opinion on this matter in the capital of our country. Today we touch only briefly on this question, but when the proper time comes, we shall not fail to take the necessary steps with the qualified authorities.</p>
   <p>And the actions of Ambassador Kowalski in the Vatican in the affair of Archbishop Theodorcwicz! Wasn't it a political scandal--have they not seriously harmed Poland and her government? Have they not brought shame and disgrace in the eyes of foreigners to the Polish republic?</p>
   <p>Many such incidents have occured, and many are still occuring; we believe that they will decrease. We believe that as Poland returns to normal conditions and regains her equilibrium, such misfits will be eliminated at an ever-increasing tempo from this so very difficult and at the same time so important service.</p>
   <p>Diplomacy is not for dilettantes or for amateurs! Just because the "better" born or rather "swell-dressing" idlers and parasites imagine that they were <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>born for parades and honors does not mean that the democratic Polish republic should recognize such claims and pretensions. The old aristocracy, abolished in the new Poland, must study and work just as other classes of society do. Otherwise let it die out as soon as possible, or let it continue to become completely denationalized; let it go where it will be better off, for there will be no room for it in the new Poland.</p>
   <p>Please understand us clearly. We are not against any group, class, or stratum of society; we love and honor tradition, and we have the highest regard for these of the aristocracy who know how to adapt themselves to the conditions and the demands of modern life, who forget caste privilege and work wholeheartedly, like brothers, with the rest of society for the good of the future new Poland and for the reconstruction of society along the only possible line, the truly democratic, genuinely progressive line which our present-day world understands, not the line which leads to a social organization like that of which numbskulls with coronets on their pinheads dream, those [nonentities] who because of their indolence and their in <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>competence have lost their estates and are now bankrupt. Today everybody, without exception, who wants to live must work; all opportunities should be open, and all praise should be given to civic merit, but there should be no place for parasites in any society, least of all in ours. We do not recognize any classes or class privileges. We are ready to condemn idlers and parasites of any other social group just as today we denounce the aristocratic parasites. Because of unfortunate circumstances we have centered our attention on this class which, having greater opportunities, should also have greater responsibilities and duties. If this class has proved itself incompetent, it should be replaced by a class more capable and stronger.</p>
   <p>We are writing on this subject, we do not hesitate to state that we have clearer ideas about it than others have who either have no opinion in the matter or lack the moral courage to express it. We are well aware that our voice will reach [Polish] government circles, and that there are people who will not like our opinions, but it does not matter. There may be some who will begin to think, whose eyes will be opened, and this <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>in itself will be for the good of society. In Poland this question is disregarded; they do not realize how much Poland is losing because of its improper, incompetent, and tactless representation abroad. Besides, many of them over there do not know how to arrive at the proper judgment of this matter, in spite of their good intentions, whereas we over here, Polish-Americans, who have been away from that narrow parochial environment these many years, regard this matter with clearer eyes and compare the actions of our compatriots with those of men of other nationalities. Sadly we must admit that "our" representatives and the Polish system are found wanting in this comparison. We would give much to ameliorate the situation.</p>
