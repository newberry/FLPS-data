   <p>In view of the fact that several memorials in behalf of Poland have appeared in our press, which were also to be sent to the President of the United States, there is a possibility that numerous imitators of that type of "diplomatic action" will appear. We therefore wish to call the attention of all Poles to the fact that the Polish Central Relief Committee was organized for the purpose of representing all Poles in America among the people of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Paragraph eight of the basic principles of this committee reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Polish Central Relief Committee tends to establish uniformity of opinion among parties and organizations on the political situation of our people. It also takes into its hands our relations with official circles in Washington."</p>
   <p>In the face of all this, let those at least who recognize the Polish Central Relief Committee refrain from taking action on their own responsibility. This <span class="page-break">\2</span>is all the more necessary because such action on their part may bring untold harm to our national cause.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee is ever watchful of this matter. It has established contact with Poland and its most prominent representatives. Whenever the Committee acts in such matters, it will do so in accordance with the wishes and suggestions of Poland and with an understanding with the most prominent people in the nation.</p>
   <p>Be careful, therefore, about memorials. A warning to this effect was recently dispatched from Poland to the Polish Central Relief Committee in Chicago. We cite the paragraph pertinent to this matter:</p>
   <p>"In general it is desirable that all our compatriots shall realize that at a time of such importance irresponsible individual action is improper, since in spite of the noblest and most patriotic intentions and desires one might spoil the plans of those in whom authority had been vested by Poland and bring about <span class="page-break">\3</span>inestimable harm to the national cause."</p>
   <p>We therefore state that the Polish Central Committee is ever thoughtful of these matters, that it always seeks information on the situation and is mindful of everything, and that it hereby asks our countrymen to refrain from rash impulsive actions.</p>
