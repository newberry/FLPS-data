   <p>Yesterday evening, the final propaganda meeting and concert, given by Thaddeus Wronski and his orchestra, was held at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall. Those who attended Wronski's first concerts know that the program was a splendid one, so that we will not take up space here to describe it. It is sufficient to name a few of the numbers....to show that the hearts of the listeners must have been stirred.</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Wronski deserves sincere thanks for everything he has done and for his carefully trained orchestra. Anyone who did not know might have supposed that this orchestra had been playing under Wronski's direction for years, for its music is such as we rarely have heard in the United States, or even in Europe. In a word, it is an orchestra that one could listen to every day, and always be satisfied and always be stirred in heart and soul, for it reminds some of us of our beloved homeland and awakens in others, who have never been in Poland, a desire to become acquainted with it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Wronski's address, spoken to the accompaniment of the orchestra, which played Moniuszko's "Lec Glosie Po Rosie" (Fly, My Voice, on the Dew), had a tremendous effect upon the audience. Tears were to be seen in more than one person's eyes and more than one noble heart found itself in Poland in thought, where old villages and cities have been destroyed, where beautiful meadows have been trampled, where ancient forests have been cut down by the Prussians as they spread their kultur. More than one listener was aroused, and vowed vengeance at the thought of the crimes committed by the Prussians on our mothers, sisters, and wives, of the mass hanging of our brothers, of the poisoning of the minds of Polish children.</p>
   <p>Today the time for vengeance has come. A Polish army is being created, and that army needs men who have vowed vengeance upon the Germans. That army is being created to avenge the wrongs perpetrated upon the Polish nation, to stand in defense of our rights, and, by the force of arms, to demand a free and independent Poland. Everyone of us who cannot enlist in the army, however, for family reasons, has also a means by which to seek vengeance; he can donate <span class="page-break">3</span>to the May Foundation (Dar Majowy), in order to raise the largest possible sum of money for the aid of that army which will defend our rights, which will sacrifice its young life for us, for the cause.</p>
   <p>Let us recall a few things that Wronski said: "Fly, O my voice, to Poland and say that the Polish element in America is creating an army that will protect your rights; say that the children in the schools here are praying, for your victory, but do not say that there are individuals here who are doing underhand work; say only that everyone works for Poland."</p>
   <p>It is no wonder that words such as those expressed by Wronski brought tears to many eyes, if only for the last statement, "but do not say that there are individuals here who are doing underhand work; say only that everyone works for Poland". This is the way it should be; we cannot even admit to ourselves that there are such individuals; we ought to forget about them because they are individuals who have been misled by a few to whom German marks are dearer than <span class="page-break">4</span>their homeland. "forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>
   <p>Let us forget all personal convictions or differences and work together toward one goal. Let us fulfill our duty to our homeland; that is, let us enlist in the Polish Army; let us support it by contributing as much as possible to the Third of May Foundation for our soldiers who, already on the battle front fighting for their freedom and ours, need our help. There should be no Polish man or woman whose name does not appear on the "Golden List". The name of everyone, even of the poorest, provided he is of good will, can appear on this list, for a two-dollar contribution is sufficient. After the war is over, the list will be taken to the Wawel [in Krakow] by Ignace Paderewski and deposited there among the ancient and important national treasures.</p>
   <p>The stamps which will be attached to a document that will be given to all contributors have been shown on the movie screens. The denominations of these stamps are from two to a hundred dollars, and they are of different colors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Besides these, each contributor will receive a picture of St. Mary of Czestochowo leading the Polish Army of America to battle.</p>
   <p>Let there be not one Polish man or woman whose name is not entered on the "Golden List". It is our sacred duty to support the Polish Army, to be concerned for the safety of the Polish soldier, to see that in case of sickness or wounds he will receive proper care, and to make sure that he will lack nothing. Let our motto be, "One for all and all for one". Remember the Third of May Foundation.</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. Zebrowski-Perlowski, well-known violinist, also participated in the concert, enchanting everyone with her beautiful music, for which she was applauded liberally.</p>
   <p>W. Rozycki, organizer for Center II, spoke in behalf of the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>We must touch upon one very unpleasant subject; namely, that there were a <span class="page-break">6</span>great many empty seats in the hall. It certainly cannot be that the price of admission was too high or that anyone feared that a collection would be taken up. We can only suppose that patriotism in Chicago is lagging a little. With the Third of May approaching, the time for action is at hand. We must show that we are Poles, that the Polish Army means everything to us, and that at present everyone is planning on making the largest possible contribution to the Third of May Foundation.</p>
   <p>So to work then, with the May Foundation in mind! Long may our free, united and independent Poland live, and long live the Third of May!</p>
