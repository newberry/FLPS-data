   <p>At the Republican meeting held in the 16th ward last Monday evening, Mr. John F. Smulski was nominated by acclamation as candidate for the aldermanic office. Mr. Smulski declined to accept the renomination, but after the ovation he received, the pleas of the people finally convinced him that they wanted none other for this office. Because of his splendid work in the past, he built up a strong friendship and love among all the people in the 15th ward.</p>
   <p>Not only the Poles but the Germans, Swedes and the Irish promised him their support in the future.</p>
   <p>The Municipal Citizens League had an article printed, showing the fine record and all he has done to make the 16th ward one of the best in the city.</p>
