   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa's visit to Washington has brought out a small but nevertheless important fact. A number of American newspapers have remarked that Mr. Kiolbassa could become governor of Illinois. This is a significant fact. We are not concerned here with Mr. Kiolbassa personally but with the idea that the American people are beginning to perceive that it is not impossible for a Pole to be elected to so high a public office as that of governor of a state. [Note.--Mr. Kiolbassa went to Washington as a representative of the Chicago Poles to protest against the United States extradition treaty with Russia. Editor.]</p>
