   <p>At last, after a long waiting, one public office was given to a Pole.</p>
   <p>A few days ago Governor Dunne appointed Dr. Adam Szwajkart a member of the State Board of Health. For the first time a Pole has become a member of this board.</p>
   <p>Dr. Szwajkart was born in 1860, in the province of Galicia, Poland, and has resided in Chicago for over 27 years; he is a noted physician and well known among Chicago's Poles, is a member of the Polish National Alliance, and for several years he was the physician-general for the Polish Roman Catholic Union. We hope that , as a member of the State Board of Health, Dr. Szwajkart will bring his countrymen a great honor.</p>
