   <p>It is already well known that on the strength of a decision reached by the Convention of Polish priests held in Chicago, all Polish parishes in the United States are to tax their members for the benefit of the great funds necessary today for Polish national matters. Today, when the existence of a free and independent Polish nation has been unanimously agreed upon by all the warring nations, when even the Germans agree to it, though according to Prussian norms, the time for gathering charitable contributions for Poland and her political needs has passed. Since everyone [the Poles] will benefit from a free and independent Poland both morally and materially, since furthermore, we have been recognized in principle as citizens of Poland without regard to whether or not we are citizens of the United States, is it not just and proper that as citizens, we pay to Poland as high a national tax as we can?</p>

   <p>The idea of this tax was conceived by Paderewski. The Polish priests, after discussing the merits of such an action, not only agreed to the tax, but decided to assume the duties of collecting it over the length and breadth of America.</p>
   <p>And the money is already flowing in. Not all of the parishes are as yet paying the tax, for the movement has only just begun, but as the secretary general of the Union of Polish Priests in America informs us, the tax is already being collected in more than three hundred parishes in the United States. The more active and more nationalistic parishes began collecting the tax in March, others did not start until April, still others will perhaps begin this work in May, and by the end of the year there will probably be not a single parish that will not be paying the national tax.</p>
   <p>As we mentioned above, the national tax is a lifesaver to the Polish cause, and if it flows in regularly, if it takes in everyone, it can accomplish miracles and will aid more than anything else in the liberation of Poland. Remember that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>every war costs billions, not millions of dollars. We cannot collect billions, but we must collect millions of dollars in order to achieve, and to see with our own eyes, a free and independent Poland. However, millions cannot be collected by charitable contributions; we cannot get the money from others, for they have their own great needs, and by fighting for themselves they are at the same time aiding us.</p>
   <p>Since we cannot look to anyone else, we must depend upon ourselves for strength, not only for military victory but to cover the costs incurred. Having created an army, we must give it care and see that the future of the Polish soldier and his family is safeguarded. In the agitation for the Polish cause in all of the capitals of the warring European nations, we must use all our efforts to bring it about that Poland will receive everything that belongs to her in the coming peace conference. We must conduct the most vigorous possible campaign in order to be victorious on all fronts; that is, nationally, politically, and economically. And since for every victory, as Napoleon once said, money, money, and yet more money is necessary, so our general victory needs money all <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the more. In order to get it, this national tax was decided upon. It has already been paid by several of our large organizations but, since all of us will benefit from a free Poland, the tax had to be generalized so as to take in everybody and was thus levied on the parishes. Furthermore, since millions of dollars are needed for effective Polish action, a monthly tax on each person was decided upon, not a charitable tax of five cents per person, but twenty-five cents, which, compared to the Bohemian national tax of one dollar per person per month, is still very low.</p>
   <p>Let us consider how much such a general national tax can bring in, counting only the parishes for the time being. Taking an average of six hundred families for each Polish parish in the United States, and counting only six hundred Polish parishes in this country, we would have three hundred and sixty thousand families paying the tax. The shortage resulting from the inability of many poor families to pay will be made up by those who pay more than twenty-five cents monthly. Since there are also a great many single people, we can figure easily on an income from the tax of about one hundred thousand dollars a month.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>In the course of a year, then, we will have over a million dollars from the above-mentioned source. This is not much, but it will be a considerable help, for with such a sum, more than one matter can be dealt with properly.</p>
   <p>The tax must be paid unconditionally, however; care must be taken that everyone pays; we must watch over ourselves and over others. Let us do this and pay this national tax, for in it lies our guarantee of victory and the resurrection of a free and independent Poland.</p>
