   <p>The executive committee in charge of collecting May contributions for Poland consists of the following: Mrs. Harriet Smulski, president; the Reverend Casimir Gronkowski, treasurer; Edmund K. Jarecki, vice-president; Mrs. J. Smietanka, secretary; the Reverend Felix Feldheim, chairman of the publicity committee.</p>
   <p>For the duration of the campaign the offices of the committee will be located at 1161 Milwaukee Avenue; telephone: Monroe 2886.</p>
   <p>All matters requiring immediate attention should be referred to the Executive Division of the National Department, 1309 North Ashland Avenue; telephone: Monroe 1257.</p>
   <p>All monies collected during the course of the May campaign, the contributors of which are to be listed in the "Golden Lists," are to be sent by the <span class="page-break">\2</span>reverend pastors to the Reverend Casimir Gronkowski, care of St. Adalbert's Rectory, 1650 West 17th Street; telephone: Canal 340.</p>
   <p>Lists of contributors and campaign details which can take up a large amount of space, and also such news as must be published for information, should be sent to the main office at 1161 Milwaukee Avenue, care of the Reverend F. Feldheim. In cases of emergency, the Reverend Feldheim can be reached by telephone at Evanston 2944.</p>
   <p>The main office has already received splendid pictures which will be given away as souvenirs, and has distributed them among parishes and organizations, so that everyone who contributes will receive one.</p>
   <p>The campaign was begun by the working people in the Polish parish in Evanston. At their Sunday's meeting they gave $532 as their first contribution in the May Campaign. It is a beautiful and praiseworthy beginning for working people. Imitate them, dear countrymen, in all Polish communities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>During the course of the month, we should remember, at every meeting, concert, reception, and so on, to agitate for the May Campaign and for the general [Polish] national tax, placing the money collected in the hands of the local pastor or treasurer of one of our larger organizations, who will send the money to Father Gronkowski.</p>
   <p>Every organization will be given credit for the contributions it collects, but in each community a complete record must be kept in the parish office, so that a control can be kept over those who attempt to evade their national obligations or delay in making payment of money pledged by them.</p>
   <p>Let us all get to work then, countrymen, and show other Polish settlements that that Poles in Chicago are unjustly accused of indolence. We ask you to accept the assurance that the Executive Committee for Chicago and vicinity will conscientiously see to it that not one penny will be lost and that all contributions will be properly receipted and recorded. Lists of contributors will be published in this column.</p>
