   <p>The Chicago 'Polonia" shall remember for a long time the eve of Dec. 17: last night's meeting. We admit that for a long time we haven't seen such fraternity, at which sight our hearts were filled with great joy.</p>
   <p>The Walsh Hall was too small to seat comfortably all those present; every seat was occupied, people stood in aisles, there was no room in the gallery either. The public behaved themselves accordingly, that is, quietly, and listened in earnest to what the speakers had to say.</p>
   <p>Besides the officials of various Polish organizations, we noticed many priests present.</p>
