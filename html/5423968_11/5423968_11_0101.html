   <p>The American Chauvinist opposition to immigration is growing daily and, through the pressure of this organization new restrictions and limitations are being adopted. The aim of the Chauvinists is to reduce immigration to minimum.</p>
   <p>The Commissioner of immigration at New York, acting upon orders of his superiors, is refusing entry to large numbers of immigrants, for various minor reasons.</p>
   <p>Ellis Island is the daily scene of grim tragedy. Wives are separated from their husbands, children from their parents, mothers from their children; here humanity is plunged into the darkest depths of desperation.</p>

   <p>Many unfortunates have already used up all the money they had, money which was saved or borrowed from friends, money which was to bring them to the promised land. And now that they have reached the shores of the land of their dreams, they have found only utter disappointment. They are told that they cannot enter here because of poor health, or lack of physical fitness, as any of which would render them incapable of earning their livelihood, or that they do not possess the prescribed amount of money, and they are further questioned as to why they came, if they have no relatives here willing to assume full responsibility for their entrance to the United States.</p>
   <p>If the United States government, through the influence of the Chauvinists, is determined to limit or to close its doors to immigration, it should at least be decent enough to endeavor to make these facts known in all the lands from which there is a possibility of emigration.</p>

   <p>Our representatives in all foreign ports, should inform the immigrants of the conditions and requirements before they board the ships. This would be a proper and humane method, and a great deal of suffering would be averted.</p>
   <p>It would be more convenient for the United States Government to place a few of its agents at the various ports of debarkation than to be compelled to fulfill the unpleasant task of refusing entry to these poor disappointed creatures.</p>
   <p>A very pathetic story was related to us here in Chicago, by a man who stated that he sent for a son that he left behind in Europe.</p>

   <p>The boy was seventeen years of age, apparently strong, and in good health. The immigration doctors, after examination, found this boy weak and unfit for manual labor, and decided to deport him.</p>
   <p>The father, mother, and two other boys, have been living in the United States for eight years. The father is a United States citizen and is steadily employed. He has accumulated some money and is willing to be responsible, and to assume all the obligations pertaining to the boy's welfare.</p>
   <p>He also provided the boy with the proper amount of money, and sworn affidavit, assuming all the obligations demanded of him. But it seems that the immigration authorities were not satisfied and were determined to deport this lad, and to separate him for his folks forever.</p>

   <p>The immigration authorities are guilty of barbarism. Even under the most absolute and despotic forms of government, such barbarism would not be tolerated. The goddess of liberty at the entrance of the port of New York, is blusing in shame for the inhuman actions of our lawmakers, whose fathers also were mere immigrants, seeking a refuge from oppression.</p>
   <p>According to the Tygodnik Polski, a weekly newspaper of New York, twenty newspaper men, representing various foreign publications in the United States, and headed by Mr. L. N. Hamerling of the Czecho Slovak publication, New Yorkkie Listy, are on their way to Washington to protest to President Taft, and to the Department of Immigration, against the discriminatory anti-immigration bill introduced by Congressman Hayes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The chairman of the delegation, Mr. L. N. Hamerling, read the protest, the contents of which brought to light the fact that 56% of the farmers in the United States are foreigners, that out of 890,000 miners in this country, 630,000 are foreigners, that of the 580,000 steel workers 69% are Europeans, and that 90% of those engaged in the construction of railroads are also foreigners.</p>
   <p>The protest was chiefly aimed at the greater restrictions on immigration that were proposed in the bill.</p>
   <p>President Taft let it be known that he is not in favor of the proposed bill, stating that it is easier for the real undesirable to pass the test of the immigration authorities than it is for the sincere and willing worker, without an elementary education.</p>

   <p>Assuming that the president is not opposed to immigration, will he be able to overcome the determined chauvinist senators and congressmen who have been moved to action by the press and the labor unions? It is very doubtful. Therefore, our only defense lies in American citizenship.</p>
