   <p>A birthday reception was given to Father Vinnent Barzynski at St. Stanislaus' parish by some of the outstanding parishioners last Tuesday. The purpose of the affair was to show the pastor the gratitude of the people for his untiring work done for the parish, and the Polish people at large.</p>
   <p>The school children's choir, under the able guidance of Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, presented a short musical sketch. Those in attendance had the privilege of witnessing an original creation by one of the school children. In many instances throughout the play, unusual talent of the boy was brought out. The action, the dialogue, and even the theme, showed interesting original creative ability. If the boy is tutored along the right directions, without doubt, he will bring honor to the Poles of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>During the course of the dinner, the toastmaster, Father K. Domagalski expressed the wished of the entire assemblage by extending Father Barzynski heartfelt birthday felicitations. The pastor in turn thanked the assembled friends, and wished them many years of happiness.</p>
   <p>After a short solemn speech by the celebrant, City Treasurer Kiolbassa took the stand. He gave a short history of the parish and presented a picture of the work accomplished by Father Barzynski for the parish, for the Poles in Chicago, and for the Poles in America. Peter Kiolbassa, as a representative of the Polish people, wished the pastor continued health and happiness and many years of active life.</p>
   
   <p>The pastor's earnestness in his work was shown three times at the reception. He received three calls during the course of the evening. Each time he rose from the table to handle the situation personally, never delaying the business until after the termination of the birthday reception.</p>
   <p>After the dinner, three children of St. Stanislaus Kostki's school, gave recitations in honor of the pastor. They were tutored by Leon Machnikowski.</p>
   <p>This completed the reception here. The entire assemblage left to visit the Holy Family Orphanage. Under the able guidance of the Notre Dame Sisters, the children gave a varied program of entertainment to the visitors. A mixed choir sang a number of songs, Polish and English dialogues were rendered also. The unfortunate children virtually called Father Barzynski their father, for his constant attention has given them moral, spiritual, and material help. Although many of the waifs entered the orphanage shabbily garbed, their attire at this occasion showed no sign of neglect. Their trim appearance was a good indication of the efforts of Father Barzynski. It should be noted that it was through the hard work of the pastor and his influence over pastors of other Polish churches that made this orphanage a possibility.</p>
   <p>The conclusion of the introductory entertainment introduced the gymnastic drill exercises of the children. Though commanded by a nun, a person familiar with military drills would envy these children as they executed each order. The highlight of the exercises was the sensational marching of a four year old boy.</p>
   
   <p>At the conclusion, the originator of the Holy Family Orphanage showed his honored guests about the entire building. Many expressed wonderment of the fine layout.</p>
   <p>Their reaction was a fine example, for it definitely showed how the contributions have been expended. No doubt was left in their minds about the efficiency of handling the funds.</p>
