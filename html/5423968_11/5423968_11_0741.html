   <p>The telegram protesting against the new American extradition treaty with Russia was dispatched to Washington yesterday in three copies, as decided upon at a recent mass meeting. Besides, President Grover Cleveland, Vice-president Stevenson, and Senator Palmer will each receive a copy. Today or tomorrow, the committee headed by Mr. Peter Kiolbassa will leave for Washington to support the protest personally. They will take with them an extensive memorial which the committee has already prepared. Regardless of the final results of this affair, we can always say to ourselves, "We have done our duty."</p>
