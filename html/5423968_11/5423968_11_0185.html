   <p>For the first time, the government port of entry has recognized the Polish nationality and has given it a place on the immigration reports. Previous to this the Poles were not classified separately. They were classed either as Russians, Prussians, or Austrians, depending upon what part of Poland they came from. Because of this, a majority of the people of the United States knew nothing of our existence. If they did, the news was only uncomplimentary, which invariably placed us as an ignorant, stupid and quarrelsome people. What is more, we are generally considered a group that cannot adjust itself to the cultural trends of the nineteenth century. Yes, they believe us to be slovenly and unmoral!</p>
   <p>No matter how small this present recognition is, it is to our advantage to be recognized by government records. The word "Polish" in government statistics and in newspaper columns is definitely a step forward.</p>
