   <p>At day before yesterday's meeting of the executive committee of the Polish Democratic League of Cook County, it was decided to send the following letter to President Wilson:</p>
   <p>"Honorable Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>"President of the United States of America,</p>
   <p>"Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>"Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>"In this hour of great trials through which the world is passing, you have candidly stated in your address before the Senate that no nation could seek to extend its power over any other nation or people, and that no right exists anywhere to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"We would be ungrateful citizens of this country indeed if we did not hasten to give expression to our feelings when you have so nobly lifted your voice in behalf of justice and liberty.</p>
   <p>"May we then record here our deep appreciation of the stand you have taken on the most vital question which confronts mankind, and may we as citizens of this country of Polish descent likewise record our thanks to you for mentioning the cause of Poland while dwelling upon the subject of lasting peace. Not only the Poles but other peoples who have suffered in the past under the yoke of oppression rejoice that the President of the United States in unmistakable language told the world of the rights of living nations.</p>
   <p>"With profound gratitude, we beg to remain,</p>
   <p>"Polish Democratic League of Cook County Illinois;</p>
   <p>"Frank P. Danisch, president;</p>
   <p>"John S. Derpa, secretary;</p>
   <p>"814 City Hall</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Illinois, January 24, 1917"</p>
