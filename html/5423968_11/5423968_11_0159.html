   <p>American newspapers have pointed out with some uneasiness the important fact that European immigration to America has been reduced. This is proved by statistical figures.</p>
   <p>According to these figures, only 311,404 immigrants came to this country during the twelve months between July 1, 1893 and the same date in 1894. This is the lowest figure for the last fifteen years. During the last fifteen years, the number of immigrants averaged approximately 400,000 to 500,000 a year. The year ending July 1, 1882 was the highest, 782,992 persons having arrived during that period, and the year ending July 1, 1886 was the lowest, when only 334,203 immigrants arrived. This shows that even the worst year was better than the last one. In comparison with the previous fiscal year, the <span class="page-break">2</span>year ending July 1, 1894 had 186,532 fewer immigrants.</p>
   <p>This is not all.</p>
   <p>American newspapers confirm another unusual phenomenon. They report that the number of persons who left the United States during the last few months exceeds the number of immigrants. According to the figures given by New York Tribune, 19,963 persons left New York harbor between July 4 and August 2, 1894 as third class passengers, while only 11,549 persons came through the same harbor during that time. And it is understood that only half of the latter are immigrants. The Tribune, therefore, is of the opinion that, during only one month, there was a "loss" of eight thousand persons through one port.</p>
   <p>This phenomenon is more important than the previous one.</p>
   <p>This condition has alarmed American newspapers, and they comment on the matter. Of course, the newspapers blame poor times for the reduction. It makes no <span class="page-break">3</span>difference in what manner the newspapers of one political party blame the opposite party for this condition. For us Europeans, who came to America, it is important to know that, in their deductions, the American newspapers consider this condition as a phenomenon harmful to the welfare of this country, and that they complain about it and blame one another for bringing about this undesirable condition.</p>
   <p>The crisis forced out from under the skin of proud Americans and chauvinists--who, for years, reviled the ignorance and criminal instincts of the "rabble" which came from Europe--the important admission that, without this "rabble," the United States would not be what it is today, and that the greatness and wealth of this Republic depends largely on the work of eight to ten million people who came to this country during the last fifteen years from foreign countries.</p>
   <p>This admission was made involuntarily by the greatest slanderers of so-called "immigrating rabble" when the slanderers became convinced that they may run <span class="page-break">4</span>short of this "rabble" and its sweat, which has made (and is still making) millions for them.</p>
   <p>This admission should be imprinted in our memory, so that we may use it, if necessary, in our arguments.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, these phenomena lead us, who are apart from the fights of the political parties in the United States, straight to the following conclusion: That the political and social situation in this country is getting serious; that the overgrown godless and unscrupulous American capitalism is debasing our social system; that corruption exists in American politics and that more and more people are being exploited by the few. Such conditions may change a free country into a land of slavery. These conditions should be fundamentally changed and improved. If this is not effected, the Republic represented by stars and stripes will be in a great danger.</p>
