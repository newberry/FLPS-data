   <p>We, the undersigned, represent thousands of Polish people in America, belonging to churches, societies and political organizations to protest Sen. Lodge's bill on Immigration.</p>
   <p>Due to the merciless persecution of the Polish people in their native land, it is not strange that they should emigrate in such large numbers to the land of freedom; where they can enjoy the economical and political advantages, that are denied them in their native land.</p>
   <p>It is not fitting that Senator Lodge, in his bill claims that a great number of illiterates are found among the Polish people.</p>
   <p>The illiterates in this country soon take advantage of our system of education and self-interest, and take it upon themselves to learn to read and write English.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is a convincing fact, if closely observed, that the Polish people are clean, orderly and law abiding citizens. At great expense they have established numerous schools, churches, libraries and places of recreation.</p>
   <p>They do not support any socialistic or anarchistic doctrines; and show the deepest respect for this country and its institutions.</p>
   <p>We have only a short time in which to prove that the figures quoted by Senator Lodge are far from being correct, about the Polish people.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. H. Jablonski, President of the Polish National Alliance of the United States of America, has received numerous letters from mayors, and police officials giving him their hearty support in the protest of Senator Lodges Immigration bill.</p>
