   <p>The Reverend Jack Ostrowski, who inspired young and old in athletics, has been transferred from the Five Holy Martyrs Parish to St. Josephs Parish, at 48th and Hermitage Ave. His departure from the Five Holy Martyrs Parish brought sadness to the younger set as well as to the adults; he was loved by all. All his time, after performing his duties at the church, was devoted to sports. We find very few who would engage so extensively in the field of sports, as did Father Jack.</p>
   <p>Fishing and hunting were his pet hobbies. He would return from these trips with many souvenirs for youths of his parish; at a glimpse of his living room, one would think he conducts a museum.</p>
   <p>The boys were not permitted to play an active game of football on our field, yet, the pigskin was kicked around and Father Ostrowski taught them the general principles of the game so that they could thoroughly understand it. In basketball we considered him a good tutor; courts were always put up at his request, because he knew the neighborhood possesed talent enough to form quintets, giving all youngsters an opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted with the game before reaching a stage of real competition. His great joy was in staging games between the youngest boys. Of all sports he loved baseball best. For the past eightyears-since <span class="page-break">2</span>Father Jack has been with us - there hasn't been a baseball nine in the vicinity of Brighton Park that could excell his aggregation in fielding.</p>
   <p>He has developed many youngsters whose ambition it was, to pitch. Ask some of the boys of the present day, where they received their knowledge of baseball, and they will tell you that many an evening and many days were spent by Father Ostrowski on the baseball diamond, teaching the boys to slide into bases, bunt, cover bases properly and field the ball. During his stay with us, baseball championships were won each year, and at not time did we have a team that rated lower than second place in the leagues in which Father Jack's teams participated.</p>
   <p>His departure will be felt throughout Brighton Park, because the boys are aware that no one can accomplish what Father Jack did. Although gone, he never will be forgotten.</p>
