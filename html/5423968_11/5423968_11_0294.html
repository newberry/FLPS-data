   <p>Surely every Pole interested in the affairs of our homeland knows that our army is fighting in France, gaining victories over our greatest enemy, the Prussian.</p>
   <p>One news item of this kind that appeared in the American papers and was reprinted in the Polish press stated that our army, or rather one regiment of our army, had defeated the Germans, taking 213 prisoners.</p>
   <p>Another item of interest to all Poles appeared on the front page of last Saturday's Daily News. It came from that paper's war correspondent in France. According to this item, a single company of Polish soldiers struck at the Germans and inflicted heavy losses, capturing 135 prisoners and twenty machine guns. In writing of the bravery of the soldiers of the Polish Army, the correspondent did not have words enough for sufficient praise. These news items are not yet very complete, and we expect that full details will arrive any day, which will make every Pole proud of the ability and bravery of our brethren.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately, our army is still too small, compared to the armies of America, England, France, and Italy. This is not the fault of those who are already in it, but of those who could enlist but do not, for reasons unknown. It is true that our army is small, but such as it is, it is composed of true sons of Poland who, taking advantage of the unusual circumstances, enlisted in order to avenge the wrongs that have been committed upon us for many years.</p>
   <p>That Polish Army consists of several tons of thousands of Polish young men who answered the call of their country and stand ready to give their lives for our ideals, our homeland. Unfortunately it consists of only a few tens, not hundreds of thousands, because many of our Polish young men, whose place is in the army and not here, are not answering our country's appeal, or heeding the whispers of the enemies of our homeland who call themselves Poles but are working to put Poland back at the mercy of its enemies, and have remained deaf to the pleading and begging of our sisters, mothers, fathers, and brothers in that poor war-torn homeland of ours, Poland.</p>
   <p>It is to those Polish boys who perhaps have not yet understood their duty to <span class="page-break">\3</span>Poland, or have been misled by Polish "bolsheviks" that this appeal is made. After all, you know that today, as never before, we have occasion to show how much we love our homeland and liberty. The eyes of the whole world are now upon us to determine if what we have always proclaimed is true. Today, the whole world must be convinced that we deserve freedom and the restoration of independence to Poland. Let us show, not by words but by deeds, that we are ready to prove that we are a nation which loves freedom above all else, and will sacrifice everything to retrieve our homeland from the hands of its oppressors.</p>
   <p>To arms, then, Polish youth! Let not even one among us, capable of carrying arms, stay peacefully at home while our brethren give their blood in our mutual cause. Let it not be that people of other nationalities should call us "slackers," and let not our countrymen call us cowards.</p>
   <p>At the present time, the American military commissions are moving foreigners from the fifth to the first class, and drafting them into the American Army. The heads <span class="page-break">\4</span>of these commissions are also working as hard as they can in the legislature to deport those foreigners who do not want to serve in the army. This is only the beginning of what awaits those who are trying to evade the draft. However, we believe that, in the face of this, the Polish spirit will awaken within us, and Polish boys will not permit this last measure to be applied to them. We are certain that, before it comes to that, our youth will have enlisted in the Polish Army as volunteers, while the authorities will take note of the fact that, among the Poles, there are more to be moved from the fifth class to the first, for they will all be in the Polish Army, thus bringing honor to American Polonia, and at the same time becoming heroes who, recognizing their duty to their home-land, have enlisted in the Polish Army as volunteers. Instead of being "slackers" who are taken into the army under compulsion, be volunteers to the Polish Army, and stand in defense of our silver-feathered eagle, and in defense of the rights of the whole world. Be real sons of Poland!</p>
