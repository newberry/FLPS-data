   <p>In yesterday's edition of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, we published a translation of the address of Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, which he personally read to the Senate, that is, to the highest lawmaking body of this country. This address is of the greatest importance, since it brings up many matters of great weight which will certainly be discussed at the future peace conference in which the United States will no doubt play an important part. In his address, President Wilson definitely stressed the fact that the American people must take an active part in this peace conference, since otherwise there would be no assurance that this peace would be a lasting one, or that new wars would not break out in the future which would make both hemispheres tremble.</p>
   <p>If America, or rather the United States, which is so closely tied through <span class="page-break">2</span>all sorts of interests with Europe, were excluded from the peace conference, who knows if within a few years some little country would not be tempted to attack America to seek compensation for the losses sustained by it in the present war. President Wilson foresees this and thus definitely demands that the [United] States have a voice in the peace conference in Europe. President Wilson has not forgotten the words of an important German statesman who audaciously declared in Berlin!</p>
   <p>"Just wait until we settle with our enemies in Europe. Then we will show the United States just what we think of their famous Monroe Doctrine, in return for helping the Allies through selling them arms and ammunition."</p>
   <p>And if the Germans were to win the war, who knows if shortly they would not attack the [United] States, because Teutonic greed and audacity are certainly known to the entire world. Therefore in order to insure his country against an attack by one or another European power, President Wilson demands that <span class="page-break">3</span>his Government, chosen by the American people, have a voice in the future peace conference, and there cause all the powers to guarantee that the peace will be a lasting one, and that no nation will dare attack another for the purpose of grabbing its resources and dominating its people.</p>
   <p>Further, in his historic address the President demands the freedom of the seas, that no power should have supremacy [on the sea] it can not, in the event of a dispute, out off the ocean routes, because this paralyzes international commerce and places great hardships upon the nations which are blocked off from the sea. The seas belong to the entire world, and not to one or another power. Therefore they should be free for everything which can benefit humanity.</p>
   <p>The United States has suffered a great deal in the present war through the closing off of commerce on the seas. On the one side England has intercepted all the mail and packages from that country, and on the other the German corsairs have sunk ships flying the Star-Spangled Banner of the United States, <span class="page-break">4</span>thus depriving many American citizens of their lives, not counting the material losses which this country has suffered through such tactics of the warring nations.</p>
   <p>But the most important point of President Wilson's address is his demand for equality and autonomy for all nations both large and small. The President demands justice for the nations which are ruled and oppressed by more powerful military nations which are greedy, and which actually trample upon all rights both of God and man. In the President's opinion, every specific nation, regardless of its numerical strength, has the right to its own independent existence and to govern itself in its own way. It has the right to a place in the great family of nations and to join in the work of general development for the good of the entire world. All domination and oppression by one country of another should cease, and each country should enjoy all the blessings of nature and have freedom in commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>Unequivocally the President points to Poland as an example "that statesmen <span class="page-break">5</span>everywhere are agreed that there should be a united independent and autonomous Poland"--or, in other words, that all three annexed parts, Russian, Prussian, and Austrian, should be united into one whole and should constitute a homogeneous country, which should be governed not by some foreign monarch or people, but [by] the Poles themselves, [who] should have the right of governing themselves.</p>
   <p>This is clearly and definitely stated in the President's address, which has tremendous bearing on our cause, since all governments and peoples must heed the voice of the President of this mighty republic. The question of Poland's freedom and unification was definitely placed before the forum of the whole world. Diplomats will be forced to discuss the Polish question in cabinets and parliaments; the press of all languages will begin commenting and we will begin calling in a stronger voice: "Give us our liberty! Give us back that which has been taken away from us by force. We are a nation of many people, a cultured nation loving our country and liberty; <span class="page-break">6</span>therefore we have the right to an autonomous existence and we do not need foreign governments".</p>
   <p>How the governments and people of the warring nations, particularly of those which have torn Poland apart, will look upon this address of the President, especially on the point concerning Poland, is another matter entirely. A thief is none too willing to return that which he has stolen, unless he is forced to do so by the police and the court. The public opinion of the world, following the suggestion of President Wilson, who speaks of the Polish question so clearly and openly, will constitute such a court.</p>
   <p>President Wilson displayed great wisdom when he refused to grant official recognition to the sort of Poland which the Germans graciously tossed us, without defining the boundaries of even this miniature country. Our half-baked "politicians" and lackeys of the Central Powers, the socialists and K. O. N. [Committee of National Defense], demanded that President Wilson <span class="page-break">7</span>recognize this reduced Poland graciously granted us by the Germans and Austrians, but the President gave them a powerful setback, since he wrote his proclamation demanding not a miniature but a whole, united, free, and autonomous Poland long before the idea of asking the President to recognize what the Germans and Austrians tossed us as a favor, without returning the lands which they seized from us and which are incontestably our property, occurred to these rattle-brained socialist and K. O. N. gentlemen.</p>
   <p>Such sallies of fanatics speaking in the name of the Poles on the devils own authorization do more harm than good to our cause.</p>
   <p>The President, in his address, has virtually told them: "Go in the corner and sit still, because it will not be the likes of you who will decide the peace terms and delimit the boundaries of specific nations."</p>
