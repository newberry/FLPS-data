   <p>Yesterday was indeed a day of festivity for the Poles on the Northwest Side of Chicago. It was a day of feting and bidding farewell to Dr. Emil Habdank Dunikowski, distinguished delegate from our beloved country.</p>
   <p>The festivities in honor of the Doctor took place at the St. Stanislaus School hall; they consisted of a banquet at 1 P. M., a special program by the school children at 5 P. M., and a general meeting later in the evening.</p>
   <p>Long before the time set for the banquet, long tables had been arranged and covered with tempting appetizers and the spacious hall had been decorated with banners and flowers. All the arrangements were in charge of Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, B. Klarkowski, S. Zahajkiewiez, and the committee. Many prominent Poles were already in the hall before <span class="page-break">2</span>1 P. M., when Reverend Barzynski and the committee entered. The guest of honor, Dr. E. H. Dunikowski, made his appearance a little later.</p>
   <p>All the guests received fresh flowers to be worn as boutonniers. At about 1:30 P. M. everyone was seated at the decorated tables. In the middle of the horseshoe arrangement was Dr. Dunikowski, with Reverend Barzynski at his right and W. Smulski at his left. Priests from Chicago and out of town were seated along both sides, as well as many prominent members of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>We will not waste space in describing the menu; suffice it to say that everything was tasty and plentiful, just as in the olden days of Poland.</p>
   <p>After the meal, Mr. Smulski called upon Reverend V. Barzynski to greet the honored guest. The pastor, in a few words, said that the greeting was in reality a farewell. In his speech, which was interspersed with a touch of humor, the pastor elaborated upon the Polish accomplishments in America, pointing out the moral stand of the Poles, mentioning some of their defects, and expressing <span class="page-break">3</span>hopes in the future of the Polish community. He said that although there was some evil among our people, it could be eradicated if we would stick together. "When this occurs," he said, "it then can be said: Evil was among our people, passed like lightning, and is no more."</p>
   <p>Dr. Dunikowski was next to speak. He began by expressing his appreciation for the cordiality shown him during his short stay among the Poles of Chicago. He told the assemblage how fortunate he felt to be among real Poles in America, in Chicago. Then he began to talk about Poland.</p>
   <p>"When Poland was greedily divided by our enemies", he said, "it was thought that she was dead forever, but she is alive and will continue to live. Today the vast expense of the ocean does not separate us so much--only on paper. The Poland along the Vistula, along the Warta, and along Lake Michigan is one and the same."</p>
   <p>When Dr. Dunikowski arrived in Chicago, he was amazed at the size of our Polish <span class="page-break">4</span>community. Later during his stay, he accepted an invitation for a trip to other Polish communities in Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>
   <p>"In your community lives Poland," he continued.</p>
   <p>As the delegate from Poland looked about the entire hall, he was astonished by the number of Polish-American young people who had come to pay homage, not to an individual, but to an ideal. He saw the officials of the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Roman Catholic Union. "Why, the names of their organs alone explain their purpose: Wiara i Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland) and Zgoda (Concord)," he said. "Could there be better and more loftier watchwords? Verily, eternal faith and imbedded love for the fatherland should be the foundation of our existence, as suggested by the title "Wiara i Ojczyzna". "Zgoda," too, means a great deal, for concord is essential to our well-being and with it we will become strong. Respect one another, work together, cast aside individualism, and if there are noble aims which require the efforts of two factions, get together and reach an understanding," continued Dr. Dunikowski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The guest of honor concluded his speech with a toast, in which he expressed the hope that the light of agreement would penetrate the barrier between the two Polish factions on the shores of Lake Michigan. The audience was greatly impressed by his words. Enthusiastic applause greeted Dr. E. H. Dunikowski as he made his bow.</p>
   <p>E. Z. Brodowski was next to speak. He said that the Poles in America and the Poles in Europe are more interested in each other every day. According to him, this mutual interest is an outgrowth of their love for the fatherland, a love which constitutes the thread that ties the immigrants to their huts and fields, as in their old country. The immigrants, leaving one country for another had in mind the hope of finding a better fatherland. Their thoughts are based on Ibi patria ubi bone (There one's country [is], where [one fares] well). But in this lies only half the truth, for every immigrant brings a part of the old country with him in his heart. The generations flowing out of this spring become important historical and social factors. After pointing out a means of mutual reciprocation between the old country and the immigrants, Mr. Brodowski <span class="page-break">6</span>gave a toast.</p>
   <p>"I raise this goblet in honor of our fatherland, which I hope may never die in our hearts, in honor of our common interests abroad and in this country. I quaff the nectar of this cup in honor of our distinguished guest, who brought to us the thought and confirmation of this co-operation!"</p>
   <p>The young Polish attorney, M. Drzymala, was also called upon to say a few words He spoke in English and said that he represented the class of young Poles born in this country who never saw the Polish fatherland; he thanked the parents, the local priests, and the local teachers for keeping the ardor for the true fatherland alive in them. The speaker was greatly applauded at this point. Mr. Drzymala touched upon the Know-nothing party, saying that the latter would like to give this patriotic feeling a death blow. He pointed out that the love for our adopted country, as well as for the country of our origin, was too strong to weaken under any attack. He urged all to oppose any such moves against them, for they are unconstitutional. In conclusion, Mr. Drzymala spoke of the <span class="page-break">7</span>future possibilities for us in America, saying that we can take part in its government and at the same time work for the benefit of our people and our country.</p>
   <p>H. Lubienski drank a toast to the Polish-American press, and also pointed out its weak spots and suggested a remedy to eliminate them.</p>
   <p>Another toast was given in honor of the Polish clergy in America by Michael Osuch, who spoke about their accomplishments.</p>
   <p>"The Polish priests are responsible for the building of many beautiful churches and schools which help preserve and propagate our religion, nationality, and traditions. But this is not all. Our priesthood, considering it imperative, entered every field of endeavor in America with one purpose in mind: to keep our people together. All of them are performing their missions with zeal and should be commended for it," said Mr. Osuch.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was A. Satelecki, who said that the aim of the Polish National <span class="page-break">8</span>Alliance is [to preserve] "Faith and Fatherland"; he offered a toast in the name of the Alliance to the good health of Dr. Dunikowski.</p>
   <p>Another toast was given in honor of the Polish Sokols and Polish Knights of America by Casimir Zychlinski. Beginning his toast with the words, "With strong body and strong mind," he went on to speak of the importance of building the body by means of gymnastic exercises and drilling in military tactics. This kind of training, said the speaker, is invaluable to any people under our circumstances. Mr. Zychlynski cited the example set by the Sokols of Lwow, which spread their wings far and wide over Galicia and took thousands of Polish youngsters under their protection. He also spoke of the introduction of the Sokols in America, concluding his speech with "Long Live Poland! Long Live the Polish Sokols!"</p>
   <p>"Every cup contains a drop of bitterness," said Dr. Dunikowski, who was called upon to speak again, "and the bitter drop on this splendid occasion is the thought of parting." With warm words, the Polish delegate promised that he would tell his countrymen what he had seen in America. His words of farewell <span class="page-break">9</span>were said softly, slowly, and sadly.</p>
   <p>After a few words by Reverend Kobylinski of Hammond, Indiana, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz rose to offer the last toast of the evening. His toast was, "love one another". This noted Polish writer said that only love lifts us toward heaven. The atmosphere in the hall was permeated with this feeling.</p>
   <p>"I wish I could make this feeling of brotherly love permanent," declared Mr. Zahajkiewicz." There are different factions and different opinions among us, but in spite of all this there can be a common feeling in regard to general affairs. We can travel on various roads, but let these roads lead us to only one Rome--love for our fatherland. Love one another!" concluded Mr. Zahajkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The banquet ended at 4:30 P. M. Because of lack of time [to prepare for the children's program], an effort was made to clear the banquet hall of photographers. Little success was gained in this direction.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The school children's farewell program in honor of Dr. E. H. Dunikowski was the highlight of the afternoon; it began at 5:30 P. M. and continued until 7: P. M.</p>
   <p>The boys of St. Stanislaus Kostka's School were the first to present themselves proudly to their honored guest. A speech of welcome was delivered by Mr. Pawlowski, teacher, after which the boys' choir under the direction of Szczesny Zahajkiewicz sang a medley of Polish melodies. Next in line were gymnastic drills by various groups. Kopczynski, one of the pupils, gave a recitation, and the choir sang two numbers--"Marsz Sokolow" (March of the Sokols) and "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>The rest of the program was taken up by pupils of the section for girls and small boys under the care of the Sisters of Notre Dame. The girls' church choir opened the program of welcome with "Wielki Jest Pan" (Mighty Is the Lord), after which Casimir Adamowski recited the beautiful sonnet "Dworek" (Little Manor House). The choir sang two more songs, the Misses Kosinska, Jankowska, <span class="page-break">11</span>and Carrel played piano solos, and a small boy, Victor Kolakowski, recited a poem in English.</p>
   <p>The girls' gymnastic drill, called "Columbian Drill," in which a score or more of small girls garbed in native costumes and colors participated, received a storm of applause. Their movements were so remarkably executed that one could not but marvel at their perfect rhythm. These demonstrations showed not only that the school was capable of producing scholarly students but also that it built their bodies by means of systematic gymnastic exercises.</p>
   <p>To complete the program, three girls--Literska, Kubicka, and Jechorek--offered Dr. Dunikowski a basket of beautiful fresh flowers, with an inscription, wishing him a happy farewell, from the school teachers. The three girls, who had memorized the farewell piece, recited it simultaneously to their guest of honor. The words were actually both of welcome and of farewell. The girls asked Dr. Dunikowski to remember them when he returned to Europe and to tell the Polish people that they were studying Polish and praying for the fatherland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>This warm feeling of patriotism moved not only the guest but everyone present as well.</p>
   <p>The curtain fell on the afternoon's entertainment with the singing of a patriotic song by the girls' choir. One could not help feeling a thrill before this demonstration [of patriotism] on the part of our Polish-American youth.</p>
   <p>Although the children's program was one to be long remembered, the mass meeting hold that very same evening was also a great success. Over six thousand people jammed the hall, and the only regret was that there was not enough time to present the program that had been arranged in its entirety, in spite of the fact that the meeting lasted until 11:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>Soon after the children's program was over and the place prepared for the evening crowd, hundreds of ardent Polish patriots began to fill the hall. The main floor was soon filled and then the gallery; all available standing room was crowded and hundreds of people had to be turned away.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>Escorted by Polish soldiers [uniformed members of societies], Dr. Dunikowski made his way to the stage through the main aisle. These soldiers, in full regalia, were made up of representatives of all the Knighthood societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>After the orchestra under the direction of Rudolph Henzle had finished playing a stirring Polish march, Reverend Vincent Barzynski opened the meeting, expressing his sincere appreciation to the audience for its enthusiastic co-operation. After informing the audience of the purpose of Dr. Dunikowski's visit to America, Reverend Barzynski concluded his speech by urging everyone to fulfill his duty concerning national problems, to remain loyal, and to safeguard the Polish spirit in our hearts.</p>
   <p>August J. Kowalski said that he considered his appointment as president of the program an honor and thanked all for their confidence. Thereupon he asked S. Zahajkiewicz, secretary of the program, to take his place.</p>
   <p>After the singing of a number of Polish songs by the men's choir under the <span class="page-break">14</span>direction of A. Kwasigroch, the president called upon Reverend Barzynski to deliver the first speech of the evening. After a short introduction in which he spoke of the solidarity of the Poles in America and Europe, the pastor went on to the object of his speech and pointed out that the Poles' greatest misfortune is lack of unity in their ranks.</p>
   <p>"We are divided and, consequently, there is always dissension among us. The unity we lack is not necessary for any diplomatic or warring purpose, far from it.....But twenty million people of Polish blood, solidly unified, would most certainly be greater than any diplomatic or military front....Are there, however, twenty thousand, or two thousand unified Poles, solid and strong of character? Alas, there are not! Poland fell because of the faults of her mis-government, by the will of Providence. Until we heal ourselves of this undesirable sore spot, we will somehow remain a loss in the school of experimentation. To us this school is the United States. Upon this democratic soil, we ought to learn that disagreement and lack of unity and brotherhood are detrimental to us and lower our standing in the eyes of other people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>"Because of necessity," continued Reverend Barzynski," we are learning self-help. But we ought to teach ourselves national unity and solidarity, which is power. We ought to have the same objectives and the same rights, and support those of us who have withstood the test. We ought to be able to find, respect and obey such men. Our honored delegate from Poland is offering to co-operate. Let us come to a better understanding, reach unity, and there will not be enough bayonets and czars in the world to annihilate us.....But as things are today, separated like dust by the wind, nothing of importance can be accomplished. True, we are of dust, yet we can turn to the fear of God, to the realization that God will judge us by our deeds, [and this is] especially true of those who sin in public affairs, for they cause wrong to their children and their children's children...."</p>
   <p>Such was the essence of Reverend Barzynski's speech. Lack of space prevents us from giving it in its entirety. The audience was greatly moved by the speaker's fervor and applauded him generously.</p>
   <p>After the pastor left the rostrum, the orchestra played a number of Polish songs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>John Nehring took the speaker's stand when the orchestra's last note faded away. He implored the Polish delegate from Europe to tell the Polish people [in Poland] how the Poles in America live, how they work for their daily bread and strive to achieve national ideals. He also begged Dr. Dunikowski to mention the fact that Polish-American youth is not lost, for it feels the spirit of Polish patriotism and supports the banner which bears the slogan "Faith and Fatherland," that it has not forgotten the Polish tongue, and that it cherishes the Polish national songs. Mr. Nehring concluded his speech with the cry, "Poland is not yet lost!"</p>
   <p>Drills by the military societies [Cadets, Knights, etc.] were remarkable for their precision. The first person to reward the Knights with applause for their flawless execution was Dr. Dunikowski.</p>
   <p>Vincent Jozwiakowski, with his customary ardor, recited "I Am Proud to Be a Pole", a poem by Szczesny Zahajkiewies.</p>
   <p>At this point of the program, Dr. Dunikowski came upon the stage accompanied by <span class="page-break">17</span>a group of girls dressed in white, several Polish priests, and the presidents of the Polish societies. After all were seated on the stage, Dr. Dunikowski arose to speak about the purpose of his mission.</p>
   <p>His speech, which was the longest he delivered during his stay in Chicago, dealt, as did all his previous ones, with the need for creating a feeling of unity among all Poles. He spoke of a thing which is very close to our hearts--our people. We regret that we cannot quote his speech verbatim.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor began his address by saying that he felt very happy at seeing this demonstration of loyalty. He praised the Chicago Poles for their hospitality and character.</p>
   <p>"A person who goes away from his native country to live in a strange one, cherished the memory of his country, which, in case of need, may offer him succor. This person, when occasion calls, is proud to boast of his country's power and beauty. This feeling is imbedded in all of us. We love Poland, in <span class="page-break">18</span>spite of the fact that she is torn apart on three fronts, shackled, and prisoned....And because of this, our loyalty is far nobler," said the speaker.</p>
   <p>Dr. Dunikowski told the audience how he had gone to a church and to a cemetery where the bodies of the valiant Poles who shed their blood for the freedom of Poland rest, to pray and seek help for the fulfillment of his mission. He also said that he had talked with the small hills on the far frontiers of Poland and with the Sigismund Bell in the tower of the Wawel Cathedral. According to him, it seemed as if all these memorable places had told him to send their best regards to the Poles in faraway America.</p>
   <p>"I came here with fright, for I was afraid to have my spell of loyalty broken," declared Dr. E. H. Dunikowski, "but to my surprise I found more than I anticipated. Polish life is growing everywhere--churches and schools are being built, societies organized, and singing groups are being formed to preserve Polish songs. This ant-like work will not be forgotten by my people when I return." Then he went on to explain his purpose in America, saying that he had <span class="page-break">19</span>come here to strengthen the relations between the Poles of Europe and those of America and to elevate the Polish name.</p>
   <p>The Polish delegate closed his speech by approving the present plans for the Kesciusko Monument. He also praised the Poles for their great work in Chicago. His last words were: "Work, and the fatherland will rise once again!"</p>
   <p>S. Zahajkiewicz commended Dr. Dunikowski for his wonderful speech and passed comment on it, pointing out again the ideals of the Polish representative. He mentioned the fact that the Poles in America are like an undesirable seed that was east aside but sprouted and bore fruit. Much of this fruit on this free soil learned to feel and think in Polish continued Mr. Zahajkiewicz. "After the honorable words of the Polish delegate, we now await results from our country," concluded the speaker.</p>
   <p>Some of Chicago's oldest Polish citizens were presented [to Dr. Dunikowski]. Each was called to take a bow. John Arkuszewski, Anthony Rudnicki, and <span class="page-break">20</span>Jacob Mucha spoke of their efforts when they were the pioneers in the Polish community, and painted a picture of the times prior to the erection of St. Stanislaus Kosta's Parish and of the struggles that followed. Their language was simple but to the point. Their speeches served as an example of the Polish spirit in Chicago to the delegate.</p>
   <p>The lateness of the hour made it impossible to complete the rest of the program. The national song, "God Save Poland", <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
