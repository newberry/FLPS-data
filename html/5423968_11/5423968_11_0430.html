   <p>A banquet was held yesterday evening in the great dining hall of the Morrison Hotel. The banquet was an official reception for Paderewski and the Polish Military Mission, and was arranged by the National Security League and several prominent Poles. There were about a thousand persons present. Phrenetic applause and cheers greeted Paderewski as he entered the hall with his wife and the Polish Military Mission.</p>
   <p>The invocation was read by the Reverend Nawrocki, after which the food was served (no liquor). The program of this memorable evening then followed.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with a lengthy address by John W. Thomas, vice-president of the National Security League, after which he called upon John F. Smulski to act as toastmaster. After delivering a short and pertinent address, Smulski called upon each of the prominent speakers at the main table.</p>
   <p>An abundance of beautiful speeches flowed to anguished Polish hearts, filling <span class="page-break">2</span>them with new hope and faith in the rebirth of the Polish nation. Never before in this country had so many friendly and sincere words been spoken of Poland and her sons as at the demonstration at the Coliseum and later at the banquet.</p>
   <p>[Text of speech by Capt. Wagner of the Polish army omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Paderewski, in his address, praised the efforts of American Poles for the Polish cause, the presidents of organizations being singled out for special praise. Among others, he mentioned Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance. He called all of them his friend and thanked them for their efforts thus far. The text of his splendid address will appear in tomorrow's issue.</p>
   <p>The speeches alternated with the numbers on the program of music, during which the Philaret Choir sang several times, receiving well-earned applause. Mrs. H. Smulski sang beautifully, as usual; she was heard in "Piekna Basia" [Beautiful Basia] and "Peace Triumphal," received a storm of applause. Thaddeus Wronski, <span class="page-break">3</span>our famous operatic singer, also sang, and was forced by the audience to return for several encores. In the end, Wronski and Mrs. Smulski sang a beautiful duet, which the applause of the audience forced them to repeat. The piano accompaniment was played by Edgar Nelson. B. A. Rybowiak directed the Philaret Choir.</p>
   <p>Severyn Kujawski played the anthem "America" on the organ while the audience rose to its feet and sang. The banquet was concluded with the singing of "America" and "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zbinelm" [Poland is Not Yet Lost].</p>
   <p>It should be added that at the beginning of the banquet, toastmaster Smulski read three letters and telegrams expressing the best wishes of Secretary of War Baker, Colonel Le Pan, Commandant of the Polish army training camp at Niagara on the Lake, and Colonel Martin of Washington, all of which were enthusiastically received by the audience, for they were very sincere.</p>
   <p>Address by J. F. Smulski</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The following is the text of the speech by J. F. Smulski, president of the National Committee:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Chairman: It was in the first days of the great World War and before the time when our country decided that it was necessary to join with the Allies against the Prussian threat that thinking people of this country created the patriotic organization known as the "National Security League". It was this organization that first raised the cry for preparedness in this country. It spread warning after warning in order to awaken the country and to prepare it for the inevitable. Persons active in public life, our most ardent patriots, both men and women, sacrificed much time and effort to accomplish that aim: namely, to create an organization that would stand guard over the sentiments and loyalty of the many peoples of the United States in those trying times, that would overcome unpatriotic tendencies, that would give new spirit and enthusiasm to indifferent Americans, and that would awaken the interest and fire the patriotism of those whose Americanism was never externally displayed and whose loyalty was never put to a test. This organization accomplished an enormous task, for it awakened the spirit of the American nation, which, for many, many <span class="page-break">5</span>years had lain dormant, stifled by political quarrels or by the chase after gold. However, the greatest accomplishment of the League was the discovery that among the citizens and residents of the country was a contingent of people heretofore ignored, unrecognized, and often even ridiculed, the so-called aliens of American or foreign descent. To the amazement of native Americans, the League discovered an element consisting of millions of people--and I really mean millions, although it sounds unbelievable--both men and women of many different countries, speaking many languages, of many religions, and of a variety of views and tendencies, who are filled with an ardent patriotism for America and its institutions. Upon being properly informed, they [these many peoples] easily understood that in America lies the future of the world, that upon the independence of America depends the independence of the world, that American democracy must become world democracy, or else Prussian barbarism will put the world into chains of slavery.</p>
   <p>"And thus the League opened wide its gates and invited foreign-born residents of the United States to its counsels and to participate in its patriotic work. As a semiofficial American body, the League has welcomed representatives and <span class="page-break">6</span>delegates from many different countries, as well as representatives of the Allied governments. Today, the League welcomes with much pleasure and real sincerity the great representative of the Polish National Committee [in France], recognized by the Allied governments and by the United States in November, that great artist and indefatigable worker, that great statesman, benefactor of humanity, and champion of liberty, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. (Applause)</p>
   <p>"It is with sincerity and honor that we greet the Polish Military Mission from France in the person of Major Joseph Kozlowski, a volunteer in the French Army ever since he was eighteen years old. Major Kozlowski was in active service in Africa, Madagascar, and Europe for a great many years; he was decorated for bravery many times, and rose from private to corporal, sergeant, adjutant, and finally, captain. For bravery under fire, he was made a Cavalier of the Legion of Honor. He was transferred to the Polish Army in France with the rank of major</p>
   <p>"We greet Captain John Henry Wagner, a professional soldier, who returned to the French service in 1914 and served in the infantry in Normandy. He took part in many battles, including the battles of the Marne and the Some, where, although <span class="page-break">7</span>his leg was riddled with the enemy's bullets, He refused the aid of his conpanions and continued to lead his company in battle. He was made a member of the Legion of Honor, and in December he was transferred to the Polish Army with the rank of captain.</p>
   <p>"Captain Stanislaus Grodzki fought in the famous Eleventh Regiment of the Russian infantry. Wounded several times, he was decorated for bravery in one of the fiercest battles with the Hindenburg forces at the Mazurian Lakes. Only three regiments survived the battle. Of that battle, however, Captain Grodzki, although he was badly wounded, is the only one alive today."</p>
   <p>(Voices from the audience): "Thank God for that." (Applause)</p>
   <p>Smulski continued: "However, his wounds were so serious that the doctors doubted that he would recover. (Applause)</p>
   <p>"Lieutenant Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski enlisted and served in the French Army. He served capably as a courier between the battle front and Paris. He <span class="page-break">8</span>was wounded four times, and was awarded the Cross of Service by the French government. Poniatowski was transferred to the Polish Army in France with the rank of lieutenant. (Applause)</p>
   <p>"Finally, one whom we cannot omit to mention--Lieutenant Jack O'Brien, who was decorated for bravery in battle; he was incurably crippled in the battle of Verdun. O'Brien was assigned to the Polish Military Mission by the French government. (Applause)</p>
   <p>"These men, and the Poles who are fortunate enough to find themselves on American soil, as well as those in Poland who for a hundred and twenty-five years have been oppressed by three tyrants, who in each generation have protested by force of arms and sacrifice of blood against the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs, and Romanovs, and who have been on the Prussian battle front for ten centuries--all of them understand the meaning of loyalty to the United States. They understand our great President Wilson (applause), and they understand that no matter how much sacrifice is necessary for the Allied cause, there can be no peace without victory, there can be no freedom for the persecuted nations of the world until <span class="page-break">9</span>the real symbol of freedom, the Star-Spangled Banner, wins a decisive and final victory.</p>
   <p>"At this moment, Mr. Thomas has informed me of a letter addressed to the National Security League from Secretary of War Baker, expressing his warmest regards to today's gathering. The letter arrived late because of a delay in the mails."</p>
