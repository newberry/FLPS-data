   <p>Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, a man of letters, pedegogue and a very deserving worker in the field of Polish schools, Polish theatricals, and an organizer of Polish youth in Chicago, died in this city on October 2, at 2:25 A. M., after long suffering.</p>
   <p>His name is known with certainty in every important Polish colony in America, especially through his numerous popular stage productions so desirably played on the amateur stages; in Chicago the news of his passing away was the cause of great mourning among the widest circles of his foster children and students, today already holding prominent positions, as well as the many co-workers in the field of science and many Polish organizations.</p>
   
   <p>Born in April, 1861, at Stanislawowo in Galicia, he attended schools in Kolomyi and Horodenko, and later in Stanislawowo the professional secondary schools and the teachers' seminary. From the time he was 13 years of age he was forced to take care of himself through giving private lessons. He received his school certificate with honors and became a teacher first in Dolino, and afterwards in Stanislawowo, finally in Lwow, at the S. Piramowicz School. At that time he wrote several books for the public, in the Polish and Ruthenian languages, recommended by the Provincial School Council; besides this he wrote pamphlet verses, especially for humoristic publications, and for a few years he was editor of Swiatelko (Light), a periodical for children and youth, established in Stanislawowo and afterwards edited in Lwow.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz came to Chicago in 1889, brought here as a teacher to St. Stanislaus Kostka School by the Order of Resurrectionist Fathers on the recommendation of His Excellency Rev. Puzyna, the later cardinal, famous in his very first years for his literary works and his activity among the youth.</p>
   <p>The funeral of the late Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz was held on Wednesday from his home at 901 Newton Street to St. Stanislaus Kostka Church with interment at St. Adelbert's Cemetery.</p>
   <p>May he rest in peace.</p>
