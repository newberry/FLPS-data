   <p>"We, the delegates to Commune II, Polish National Alliance of the United States, gathered here in meeting at Pulaski Hall this sixth day of December, 1916, saddened by the distressing news of the death of Henryk Sienkiewicz, pay homage from the bottom of our hearts to that great son of Poland who, in the field of literature, urged the Polish nation onward in its struggle against its enemies, holding up as an example the most trying times of the past, when the strong faith and unity of the Polish nation defeated its enemies and turned back the wave that threatened to engulf our native land.</p>
   <p>"We honor the memory of the man who taught us that we must count only upon our own strength, and that by our own strength we can triumph. We honor the memory of the man who wrote the Trilogy and the Knights of the Cross, in which he portrayed the spirit of the Polish nation in all of its nobility.</p>
   <p>"We honor the man who used the influence of his international fame, during <span class="page-break">2</span>that terrible time when Poland faced destruction, to save the children and the people of Poland from death by starvation. We honor the man whom the whole Polish nation honors today, and we want the whole nation to give proof of its love for him by reading his immortal works, and by fulfilling his most ardent wishes. It is our hope that the people will come to know and love Poland as he loved it, and as he wished the people to love it.</p>
