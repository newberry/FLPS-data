   <p>On the 8th day of December, 1920, Father Jan Obyrtacz, a member of the Resurrection Fathers of Chicago, will celebrate the silver jubilee of his priesthood.</p>
   <p>Father Jan Obyrtacz distinguished himself in the field of national and religious activities.</p>
   <p>Father Jan Obyrtacz was born in Poland (under Austrian rule) on the 26th day of May, 1873. He attended a parochial school at Chocholow, grammar school at Nowy Targ and a Gymnasium in Nowy Sacz, Poland. He joined the Order of the Resurrection Fathers on the 15th day of March, 1889. He studied philosophy and theology first in Cracow and Lemberg, Poland, and later in Rome, Italy. He distinguished himself by his unusual abilities in his studies. For that reason he completed his theological studies at the age of 22, a few months before the canonical law allows the ordination of a priest.</p>

   <p>He was appointed to America and came to Chicago on the 24th day of August, 1895, as a deacon. He was ordained a priest on the 8th day of December, 1895, in Saint Stanislaus church, by Bishop P. A. Feehan. He remained in this parish as an assistant priest till the year of 1896. Then the church authorities transferred him to St. Hedwig's parish, also as an assistant. After two and a half years he returned to Saint Stanislaus parish, where he performed the duties of an assistant till the year of 1901.</p>
   <p>In 1901 he took charge of St. Stanislaus parish in Chicago, as the pastor left for a conference in Rome. After the return of the pastor from Rome, he was appointed pastor of Saint Stanislaus parish at Cragin, Ill., where he remained seven years, gaining the popularity and love of his parishioners. In 1909 he was transferred to Saint Hedwig's parish, also as a pastor.</p>
   <p>On the 12th day of October, 1920, Father Zapala, the new general of the Resurrection Fathers' Order, transferred him to the Saint Stanislaus <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>parish, the biggest Polish parish in Chicago, appointing him a pastor of that parish and simultaneously a superior of the Resurrection Fathers in Chicago, the largest in America.</p>
   <p>As we can see, Father Obyrtacz was ordained a priest in St. Stanislaus Church, performed the duties of its assistant, pastor and superior. It is only fitting that here he will celebrate his silver jubilee.</p>
   <p>Father Jan Obyrtacz is a clergyman of great merit and an excellent character. He is sincere, sympathetic, broad-minded, merciful, benevolent, hospitable, patriotic and devoted to the church. He performs his work systematically. He is interested in everything. He likes order. He knows his parishioners and is interested in their welfare, trying to penetrate into their difficulties and assist them even in small matters. He keeps the books of the parish himself; in other words, he is a tireless worker. He will listen to everyone, giving necessary advice and assistance. This is the reason he is so popular, so well liked by his parishioners, the priests of his order and other clergy.</p>

   <p>He treats all alike and is friendly towards all. Quite often the church dignitaries and delegates from Poland stop and stay at his place. He is active in religious, national and social life, but he does not seek any honors or applause.</p>
   <p>As we stated before, Father Obyrtacz was a pastor of St. Stanislaus parish at Cragin, Ill., for seven years. It was a very small and poor parish, numbering only 80 families, at the time of his appointment as a pastor. It was too far from the large city of Chicago to receive any help from other Poles. In spite of these difficulties, Father Obyrtacz accomplished wonders; for in seven years he bought the ground and built a church, sisters' house and school; he also organized church and national societies. At the time of his transfer, the parish numbered 300 families. His religious and patriotic spirit is still there; so is the attachment of the parishioners to him and the church. The future development of the parish is also assured.</p>

   <p>His Activities At St. Hedwig's Parish.</p>
   <p>When Father Obyrtacz came to Saint Hedwig's parish in 1900, there were only 26 families supporting it. In a short time Father Obyrtacz reconstructed the old school, built a new one two stories high, rebuilt the rectory, remodeled the church, bought new furniture and paid off the parish debt of $75,000. He enlarged the membership of the parish to 4,000 souls. He also organized many societies. Today Saint Hedwig is one of the best parishes in the city. The Saint Hedwig's parish school is one of the finest. His parishioners greatly protested when he was recalled to Chicago.</p>
   <p>His Activities in the Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>Father Obyrtacz joined the Polish Roman-Catholic Union in 1906. He was a vice chaplin and very active there. He was also a member of the Polish Educational Aid Department, which maintains one of the largest libraries in America.</p>

   <p>His National and Religious Activities.</p>
   <p>Father Obyrtacz is always active in the religious and national fields, but he does not care for the honor of leadership. He may be seen at massmeetings, parades, conventions, national and church festivities. He keeps up the religious and national spirit.</p>
