   <p>All church societies of the Saint Stanislaus Kostka's Parish in Chicago adopted the following resolution at the meeting on December 13, 1891.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our enemy is not satisfied with the partition of our motherland but fills it with rivers of blood and throws her most noble children into the cold dungeons of Siberia, dooming them to suffer for life or exiling them to a life of wandering, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The audacity and barbarity of the Russian government are increasing every day and becoming a madness, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Czar of Russia tortures our countrymen through his henchmen and tramples under his oppressive heel everything that is dear and sacred to us, and</p>
   
   <p>"Whereas, He is trying by all means to deprive us of our faith and our native tongue, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, He is falsifying history and is evidently bent upon the destruction of the Poles as a nation, therefore</p>
   <p>"Be it Resolved, That we can no longer remain silent, for if we do, it will appear that we approve of and consent to the injustices of the tyrant.</p>
   <p>"The lips of our countrymen in our native land are sealed by bayonets, but here in America we are at liberty to speak.</p>
   <p>"We are positive that every true Polish heart is deeply affected by the atrocities committed upon our countrymen and indignant over the ruthless and inhuman acts of our enemy. Let us act by voicing our indignation! Let every Polish heart appeal to heaven. Let our appeal be heard throughout the world.</p>
   
   <p>Let this appeal serve as a protest against the inhuman treatment of our enemy. Let it reveal to the whole world the injustices perpetrated against us by our oppressors. Let our appeal awaken the conscience of all civilized nations and of those Russians who are noble. Let our appeal guide public opinion, that it may condemn the Russian government as the divine and human laws do.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we invite all members of every Polish society, and every well-thinking Pole to the great mass meeting to be held at 2 P. M., January 1, 1892, at the Saint Stanislaus Kostka's School Hall, near Bradley Street. There they may express their indignation and sympathy and make a protest against the inhuman and barbarous acts of the Muscovite government.</p>
   <p>"After the meeting there will be a solemn worship at the Saint Stanislaus Kostka's Church in behalf of our motherland. After appealing to humanity, we will appeal to the throne of the Highest King, and, following the example of our great forefathers, we will beseech Him for His grace and mercy. The whole world may be deaf to our entreaties but God will hear us.</p>
   <p>"In the name of our Holy Faith, let us act.</p>
   <p>"In behalf of all societies, Anthony Rudnicki, A. Lampkowski, Francis Zagrzebski, Jacob Obert, Jacob Tomaszewski, Szczesny Zachajkiwicz, Joseph Klatecki, Francis Wleklinski, John Gniot, Jacob Mucha, Albert Tomasik, Walenty Piterek, John Czekala, Members of the committee.</p>
   <p>Rev. Vincent Barzynski, chairman,</p>
