   <p>We, the Poles and Lithuanians living in Chicago, gathered here on the 26th day of May, 1918 at a great meeting in Pulaski Hall for the purpose of discussing the political future of our nations, have come to the conclusion, after the present state of affairs had been clearly stated and after careful consideration, that, no matter how good the intentions may be, the efforts of our national leaders in seeking the separate independence of each country even at the hands of the Germans could be ruinous to both countries.</p>
   <p>Through this resolution, we appeal to everyone, both in this country as well as in the homeland, who belongs to the nations that composed the republic of Poland before its partition, namely, the Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians, that, standing beside the United States and the Allies, they co-operate in helping the republic of Poland regain its independence, its boundaries to include all the territories that it held before the partitions, with the understanding that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>government of the new-born republic will be a democratic, a peoples' government, with unlimited tolerance for the needs and desires of individual peoples even to the extent of autonomy. A strict union must be maintained, however, for protection against the possible aggression of neighboring enemies.</p>
   <p>Taking advantage of so numerous a gathering, we take this occasion to express our loyalty to the United States and our gratitude to its great president, Woodrow Wilson, for his sincere, humanitarian efforts to tear the weaker nations from the grasp of the powerful, aggressive invaders.</p>
   <p>All hail the United States!</p>
   <p>All hail the great-hearted Nation!</p>
   <p>Long live the United States!</p>
   <p>May the nations of the Poles, the Lithuanians, and the Ruthenians arise free and independent, bound together by brotherly ties and united, to the dread of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>their enemies!</p>
   <p>S. J. Rokosz,</p>
