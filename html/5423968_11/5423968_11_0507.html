   <p>The board of directors of the Polish National Alliance sent President Wilson a telegram this morning thanking him for putting the Polish question before the world. The telegram translated into Polish reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Illinois, January 23, 1917.</p>
   <p>"His Excellency Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>"On behalf of one hundred and twenty thousand members of the Polish National Alliance of the United States of North America, permit us to express to you our profound gratitude for your enunciation before the Senate yesterday of the imprescriptible right of Poland to a united, independent, and autonomous existence. Your noble and high-minded speech is the most cheering message the Polish people have received from such an exalted position of authority since the Partition of Poland. It will mark an important event in the history of that unhappy land. It will be a source of comfort to an innocent people who <span class="page-break">2</span>have suffered unparalleled losses and endured unheard-of hardships in the course of the present war. It will revive their hopes and strengthen their hearts and spirit. God grant that it may also herald the dawn of a brighter and happier era not only for the Polish people but for humanity in general.</p>
   <p>K. Zychlinski, president</p>
   <p>J. S. Zawilinski, general secretary</p>
   <p>J. Magdziarz, treasurer"</p>
