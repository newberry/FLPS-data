   <p>Tomorrow is the thirtieth anniversary of the January Insurrection in 1865.</p>
   <p>We celebrate it without hindrance in this land of liberty, where patriotism or a desire to keep alive our language and faith is not considered a crime.</p>
   <p>It is different in Poland. News of fresh persecutions reaches us every day. Even today's cablegrams bring accounts of the outrages and lawlessness which the scoundrel Hurko, Governor-General of Warsaw, permits himself in downtrodden Poland. If this news is only partially true--as is sometimes the case with hasty dispatches--it would still be a terrible reminder of the awful misery of our brethren at home.</p>

   <p>But coming as it does on an anniversary as significant as this, such news should waken greater resentment against the oppressors of Poland--it should produce a deeper realization of the need for work and sacrifice among us, as unhampered Poles in America.</p>
   <p>The sufferings of our brethren in Poland say to us: Be Poles in heart and in spirit, that we may have power when the decisive time comes. Work for Poland, for Poland is your mother. Who does not honor his mother is a blackguard. Be ready to sacrifice your family and your lives as did the heroes of 1830 and 1863, for without sacrifice there can be no triumph. Most of all, give up for her sake the internal hatreds and quarrels that tear you apart, so that in the decisive moment you may be united hand in hand with brotherly strength. And when this is done, God will grant that weary, unfortunate Poland will rise again.</p>
