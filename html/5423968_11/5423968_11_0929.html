   <p>Yesterday Mayor Harrison nominated two members to the board of education, one of whom is our well-known countryman, Dr. Stephen R. Pietrowicz.</p>
   <p>Because he has distinguished himself in the medical profession, he was recently nominated superintendent for the home of the feeble minded in Dunning.</p>
   <p>The office which has been taken over by Dr. Pietrowicz was vacated by Attorney Juliusz Smietanka in order that the latter might give all his time and attention to the duties of revenue collector.</p>
   <p>We hope that Dr. Pietrowicz will be an ardent advocate and mediator in the efforts to introduce the Polish language into all public schools attended by Polish children.</p>
