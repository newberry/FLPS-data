   <p>Thousands of Chicago Poles paid tribute, Sunday, Oct. 14, to the memory of the hero of two worlds, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, on the 100th anniversary of his death. At the same time they witnessed the consecration and delivery of the war standards, offered to the 1st regiment of the Polish army by Ignace Paderewski and the Polish women of the United States. The first celebration on of the day was the consecration of the standards, which was fulfilled at St. Joseph's church, at 48th and Paulina Sts.</p>
   <p>The consecration ceremonies started at 3 P. M. Almost all the homes and business places in the section called Town of Lake were adorned with Polish and American colors. At one o'clock already thousands of people filled the streets in front of the church and by 2 o'clock 48th street, between Wood and Marshfield, resembled literally a sea of people.</p>

   <p>A few minutes before 3 o'clock the standards were carried into the church. The standards were accompanied by the members of the Franco-Polish War Commission, Lieutenant Gasiorowski, Prince Poniatowski, Sergeants Szaniawski and Zekiecki; behind them walked the sponsors and volunteers of the 1st regiment of the Polish army from the United States. After entering the church, the procession was led down the center aisle before the sanctuary by a number of young girls dressed in white.</p>
   <p>When the standards were put in place the choir intoned "Veni Creator"; after which the act of consecration, with the assistance of the diocese consultant, Rev. L. Grudzinski and the pastor of Sacred Heart church, Rev. F. J. Karabasz, was fulfilled by the pastor of St. Joseph's church, Rev. S. Cholewinski.</p>
   <p>After the act of consecration, the pastor of St. Mary Magdalene church in South Chicago, Rev. E. Kowalewski, spoke, beginning with the words, "In hoc signo vinces" (By this sign you shall conquer).</p>

   <p>After explaining the meaning of the standard and next the blessing which flows down from the consecration in an emotional manner, he assured the first volunteers that the clergy as well as the people will send their pleas to the Lord for blessings of the Polish army and that the priests will pray to God so that all will experience the abundance of heavenly blessings, courage and strength, so that all shall carry on high these standards on the field of battle, until they will wave over a free and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the most holy sacrament and the blessing, at the end of the holy devotion all those present sang the Polish anthem, "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>After the consecration of the standards the parade took place through various streets in Town of Lake and all the way to the Dexter Pavilion in the Stock Yards, at 43rd and Halsted St.</p>
   <p>Early before the assigned hour the public began to gather in great <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>throngs, mainly Polish but there was no lack of representatives of other nationalities. About 5:30 P. M. the platform was filled; there came upon it representatives of governments and the armies of the United States, France, England, Ireland, and from the Poles, the Central Polish National Committee with Mr. Paderewski and his wife and a good sized representation of the clergy. The platform was beautifully decorated with flowers, palius, festoons and national colors: it was adorned by a large portrait of T. Kosciuszko, and on the sides those of Lincoln and Wilson and a large bust of Washington. From the stage hung a great many American flags and on the side French, Polish, and others.</p>
   <p>The celebration of the anniversary was opened by citizen Mr. Perlowski, president of the Citizens Community. He in turn called upon citizen J. Smulski, president of the National Department of the P. C. K. R. to act as chairman, who asked the Rev. Zapala, rector of St. Stanislaus College to say a prayer and invoke the blessing.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Following the invocation, the chairman presented to the public all honored guests, and therefore Mr. Paderewski, members of the Polish Commission from France, Mr. Gasiorowski and Prince Poniatowski, and further the representative of France and its army, Lieutenant Eskenfelder (an Alsatian), the representative of England and its army, Lieutenant A. Murray, a member of the parliament, from Scotland, Major Stanton; representative of the United States Army, T. P. O'Connor; representative of Ireland and members of the British parliament. After that, telegrams were read from Secretary of War Baker, from the ambassador of France, Jusserand; from the ambassador of Russia, Bachmatjev; from the ambassador of England, Spring-Rice, from Bishop Rhode and others.</p>
   <p>Then followed the singing of a beautiful war hymn composed by Mr. Paderewski. It was sung by the Filaret Choir under the direction of Thaddeus Wronski, artist singer of the Boston Opera. The hymn was so well liked that the Filarets had to repeat it.</p>

   <p>Next followed the main speech by Mr. I. J. Paderewski, interrupted time and again with unceasing applause; it lasted over an hour. Mr. Paderewski, in a very affable way, truly the people's way, re-enlightened and rebrightened in the comprehension of the listeners the radiant portrait of the "Hero of two worlds." After the speech by Mr. Paderewski came the delivering of the flags, carried out by the Polish women of Chicago. The volunteers were lined up in ranks before the platform with Mr. Gasiorowski and Prince Poniatowski at their head. On the elevation stand, Mr. Paderewski rendered a short talk, wishing the Polish soldiers to go under the sign of the White Eagle to a victorious and wholly successful step into a free Poland.</p>
   <p>Next, delivering to the officers the flags, he pressed their hand and kissed them heartily. The moment was truly emotional. After that the band played the Polish national anthem, "Poland is not yet dead"; the American Star Spangled Banner; the French "Marsellaise," and other anthems.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Then the representatives of the various governments rendered their speeches; Mr. Rathbone, from the Defence Department of Cook County, made a powerful talk and finally, Mr. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, spoke briefly.</p>
   <p>The most important moment of the celebration was the taking of an oath by the new volunteers.</p>
   <p>The celebration in Dexter Pavilion ended about 9 o'clock. It was certainly one of the greatest Polish demonstrations given in this country and will be remembered in our political life over here as a moment in which there was manifested among our emigration the spirit of the regeneration and resurrection of Polish knighthood, starting out to battle for freedom and the glory of Poland.</p>
