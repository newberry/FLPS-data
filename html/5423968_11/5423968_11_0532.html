   <p>At the last assembly a resolution was made by members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union to pay every month by every member 5 cents assessment, to help our unfortunate brothers and sisters who are suffering from the effects caused by the war in Poland.</p>
   <p>The collection amounted to over $4,000 per month. The main office is sending them every month to the hands of Mr. H. Sienkiewicz, Grand Hotel, Vevey, Switzerland.</p>
