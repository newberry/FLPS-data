   <p>The affairs of the Polish League have become of great interest to the Polish papers of Europe.</p>
   <p>During a time when the Polish League is being mocked and ridiculed by various persons and organizations in America, who even go so far as to exert diplomatic influence to suppress it, the people of Europe, unprejudiced and clear thinking, are of the opinion that the program of the Polish League to unite the Poles of America along party lines, as well as on nationalistic principles, toward cooperative work for their common good, both morally and materially, does not deserve censure but is worthy of the support of all.</p>
   <p>Various Polish papers of Posen are in accord with the above idea.</p>
   
   <p>At present a new voice has declared itself in this matter. An article has been written by Dr. W. Ungar under the title: "Walka O Idee" (Struggle for an Idea) in the Przeglad Wszechpolski (Polish Universal Review). The author deals with the controversy over the newly organized Polish League and the Rapperswyl Fund.</p>
   <p>The article is too lengthy to be reproduced in full; however, some of the more important details are reprinted. The introduction is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our emigrants, especially those who have settled in the United States of North America, have been occupied for some time in a stubborn fight over the "National Funds" [drives for the national cause]. The subject in dispute is: whether the collection of funds among the Polish people should be turned over to the Polish Fund of Rapperswyl, or whether a separate Polish-American National Fund should be created for the purpose of uniting the Poles in America, organizing schools, public institutions, banks, agricultural colonies, etc.</p>
   <p>"The representative of the first project is the well-known philanthropist Erasmus Jerzmanowski, who was recently appointed commissioner of the Rapperswyl Fund; the other proposal is represented by the newly organized Polish League.</p>
   <p>"The rivalry between the two funds is not a question which can be handled easily, or one which concerns only the Polish-American people. The struggle over these two funds is a battle over ideas, which thus far has been nurtured unknowingly by the emigrants--yet, it vitally concerns all the Poles. The trouble over the two funds is an affair that concerns the common Polish people.</p>
   <p>"From this point of view we, therefore, take an interest in this affair and give voice to our feelings, although generally we adhere more strictly to the principle of not mixing in local affairs."</p>
   <p>The author then delves into the past, as far back as a hundred years, of the Polish emigrants in America--and observes in their accomplishments a continual struggle over two attitudes, the strictly political and that of colonists.</p>
   <p>The political attitude has always been successful, for it regarded the immigrant as a tool of the political mission of the moment which was working for the rebirth of Poland--and waiting for the very moment of this resurrection. Historical events show that this awaiting has failed, and have shown that the one-time strong political immigration has faded into oblivion. This outcome would have been different, according to Dr. Ungar, if the immigrants had adopted the attitude of colonists.</p>
   <p>During the time, however, when the political immigrant group began to wane, a new immigration began to appear. It was an immigration motivated by economic conditions; it was composed of the masses which settled permanently in America "and began to cultivate the germ of a new Poland".</p>
   <p>"Tribute should be accorded to the initiative of our people," continues the article in the Lwow paper Przeglad Wszechpolski, "for the idea of colonization in the Polish people began slowly to put down deeper roots in America as well as in Europe. It became so commonplace that it was necessary to direct all the energy of the League toward the support of the Polish people in their newly adopted country; that this aim necessitated the concentration of energy; that it was necessary to strive further toward reviving their spirit through organization, and by organizing the immigration movement into certain centers. In short, it became a daily issue.....</p>
   <p>"....Last year the Polish League was organized at a conference in Chicago. The aims this league adopted are in the main to support and spread Polish national life in America through the organization of schools, the extension of Polish culture, the organization of financial and social institutions, etc. To fulfill these aims the Polish League created the Polish National Fund for which contributions were to be collected.</p>
   <p>"When the philanthropist Mr. Jerzmanowski came to the support of the Polish League it seemed as if the idea of colonization would contribute greatly to the prosperity and growth of the Polish people.</p>
   <p>"In the meantime the progress did not follow a straight line, and soon conditions took on an entirely different aspect.</p>
   <p>"Upon his departure for Europe, the president of the Polish League, Erasmus Jerzmanowski, accepted the post of Commissioner of the Polish National Fund of Rapperswyl, and, on his return, he resigned from his presidency and gave out an enthusiastic appeal for funds for the Rapperswyl Fund. This would not have been an unsual step, for the president of the Polish League had the privilege of leaving his position and accepting an office with the Polish National Fund of Rapperswyl The chief object of concern in this matter, nevertheless, is the motive for this fundamental change of front and the propaganda which sets forth this point of view and agitates for the exclusiveness of the Rapperswyl Fund.</p>
   <p>"When Mr. Jerzmanowski resigned as president of the Polish League, he made an appeal. In this appeal he requested the exclusive right to collect contributions for the Polish National Fund of Rapperswyl, and at the same time opposed the idea of Polish colonization, by plainly stating, 'Poland should be rebuilt in Europe and not in America.'</p>
   
   <p>"With these words he steps out to fight the idea of colonization with that of the old idea of Polish political immigrants, considering the immigrants in the nature of am army and an advance national guard, ready to return to the homeland at the slightest call. This idea received great support during its time, considering the prevailing political conditions, from the enthusiastic political immigrants. Today, the attitude of colonists, forced upon the people because of economic reasons, is just as reactionary (sic), though it is contrary to national interest, for it is harmful to the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>"It would be utopian today to dream about the return of the immigrants to their native country. Under present social conditions such re-emigration has no place, and, if it were possible, it would cause an economic disaster to the native land. What then should be done with these masses? Should they be renounced? Should they be left a loss to the national cause and a prey to Anglo-Saxon influences, or should work be started among them in order to keep them together, to establish and spread Polish nationalism; in other words, should a Poland be built in America?</p>
   
   <p>"Mr. Jerzmanowski is opposed to the building of a Poland in America, and favors the exclusive collection of funds for the Rapperswyl Fund. At the same time he condemns the thought of a drive for Polish aims in America because it would involuntarily harm the Polish cause, since it leans toward the denationalization of the Poles in America.</p>
   <p>"The Dziennik Chicagoski, tying the matter to the words of Mr. Jerzmanowski relative to opposing the thought of building a Poland in America but rebuilding Poland in Europe, (sic), presents the following views":</p>
   <p>[Excerpts from articles of the Dziennik Chicagoski, motivated by Mr. Jerzmanowski's appeal, point out that it is not only our duty to build a Poland in America but it is also our duty to rebuild Poland in Europe. Comment on the above words in the Dziennik Chicagoski continue as follows in Przeglad Wszechpolski.]</p>
   <p>"Under the present circumstances the right is definitely reserved to oppose the Rapperswyl Fund. On the other hand the need and advantages of such an institution are recognized.</p>
   
   <p>"Opposition, however, is given to the tendency toward exclusiveness, and of collecting funds only for the Rapperswyl Fund--and the overlooking of a drive for Polish-American purposes. Such exclusive propaganda can only be harmful to the Polish cause, and it is believed that the initiators of the Rapperswyl Fund never had the intention of standing in the way of spreading the idea of Polish colonization.</p>
   <p>"In the second place, recognition must be given to the spirit of colonization which is propounded by the Polish League, and credit should be bestowed for its initiation of a Polish-American National Fund. Consequently, nothing else remains but to encourage Polish-American society to support this idea of colonization."</p>
   <p>Such are the views expressed in the article in the Przeglad Wszechpolski.</p>
   <p>We wish to point out with emphasis that this is a paper which no one can say is hostile to the Rapperswyl Fund, for it often gave favorable mention to this drive. But in spite of this, perhaps for the same reason as motivates us, the Przeglad Wszechpolski came to the conclusion that the Rapperswyl Fund is truly necessary, but that the Polish League is equally necessary, along with the realization of its aims.</p>
