   <p>Thanks to Congressman [Adolph] Sabath, who has been most carefully guarding Slavic interests in Congress, especially Polish-Czech matters, last Monday afternoon the House of Representatives ratified a bill giving the soldiers of the Polish army in France, who on leaving were not citizens of the United States, the right to return to this country at the close of the war.</p>
   <p>We have already touched upon the importance of this bill in a previous issue, but it is too important not to discuss it more broadly. It is a step toward the final unqualified and official recognition of the Polish Army as a separate ally, with all rights under international military laws, by the United States.</p>
   <p>Primarily, the bill has covered--to use a military term--the Polish soldiers!</p>

   <p>retreat. There were and still are a great many men who did not enlist in the Polish Army simply because they were afraid that their return to the United States at the close of the war would be barred. It would be all right, they said and thought, for a soldier who came out of the war well and whole. Even as noncitizens, these men could return to America without any great trouble, even as immigrants. But who would take care of those who might be crippled and unable to work? It would still be all right if the Allies were completely victorious and Poland won complete independence. In such a case the Polish government would look after its defenders and liberators. But supposing the Allies should lose the war, or that Poland failed to obtain her objectives, what then? Return to the United States would be impossible, for the immigration laws do not permit entry of cripples into the country. These would be nothing left but to wander over ruined Europe begging alms.</p>
   <p>Such was the reasoning of many who would willingly have served the Polish cause and given their lives for it on the battlefield, but having obligations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for the future, they shuddered at the thought that, instead of a help, they might become a terrible burden on their own relatives or upon someone else, to say nothing of their own awful fate.</p>
   <p>In the first phase of the organization of the Polish Army, we really had no answer to the above-mentioned arguments. In truth, we assured the people that efforts were being made to bring about the official recognition of the Polish Army, and we expressed complete faith in the victory of the Allies, but we could not give any guarantee as to the fate of the Polish soldier regardless of how the war might turn out. In addition, official recognition for the Polish Army was difficult to obtain, for who will recognize as a power an army that is just being organized? Then too, before the army could be officially recognized, Congress would have to take up matters connected with that recognition. It is no wonder, then, that we were helpless in the face of the above-mentioned arguments.</p>
   <p>This matter was finally taken up in a practical way by Sabath, representative <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to Congress from a predominantly Czech-Polish district, and was successfully carried through in the House of Representatives. This measure, which safeguards the noncitizen Polish soldiers' return to the United States, without regard to whether he is returning healthy or crippled, immediately solves the whole problem. Now no one need have any fear as to his future even in case of disablement that would prevent him from working. In ratifying a bill providing for the return to America of every Polish soldier, Congress also takes upon itself the moral obligation to provide for those who may need help. Together with American Polonia, the American Public will see to it that ways and means are provided to make this aid complete and permanent.</p>
   <p>The most important obstacle to organizing the Polish Army, then, has been removed. The return to this country is guaranteed. The fears, not of the enthusiasts, but of those who analyze the matter with pen in hand, have vanished. With this guaranteed re-entry, we have a much easier task of obtaining volunteers to the Polish Army.</p>

   <p>But this is not all. Congress has already said "A"; it will be forced to say "B". We want the Polish Army to be officially recognized by the United States through Congress, by which the soldiers of that army will have equal rights and privileges with the soldiers of the regular army, and will be recognized by the international military convention. As a matter of fact, Congressman Sabath will shortly introduce a bill to this affect, and he has already gained the support of a number of Congressman who sympathize with the Polish-Czech cause; however, on our own side, we must exert all our efforts to help Sabath to secure the passage of this bill in the House, and later in the Senate. Congressman Sabath may be most enthusiastically inclined toward our cause, he may use all the influence he commands, and yet, as it nears success, the measure may be defeated. For this reason it should have the full support of American Polonia. Our deciding elements should appeal to all of the Representatives and Senators so that the Polish Army, having already gained so much, will gain official sanction. In addition to the enormous political importance of such sanction, it will give far-reaching benefits to the Polish Army, for besides giving the Polish soldiers the same <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>rights and privileges enjoyed by soldiers of the regular army, it will make it obligatory, not only for the Poles and France, to finance the Polish Army, but for the rest of the Allies, also, with the United States in first place. In such a case, even the insurance of the Polish soldiers will be relatively on the same basis as that of American soldiers. The Czechs see the necessity and are acting. Let us, too, act immediately.</p>
