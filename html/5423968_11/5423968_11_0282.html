   <p>Suum Cuique (To each his own) is the motto we have stood by. That is why we always have, and always shall, recognize anything that is rightfully German. Whenever a sympathetic note was found, it was not disregarded nor overlooked. We have never, nor shall we ever, permit ourselves to be blinded by hatred and revenge. It has always been our policy not to imitate the Germans, who, because of their characteristic inclinations, always try to be odious, spiteful, and vengeful, however wasted these efforts may be. Their only purpose is to bring evil unto us. They would be happy if they could wipe us off the face of the earth. Articles[in newspapers]that would bring about a better understanding between us are few and far between. The majority of them seek revenge against us. One can hardly blame us if we do not write much about the Germans; for the Polish individual finds little consideration among them.</p>
   <p>One of the comparatively few newspapers that print articles which are fair to us is the well-known daily, Zukunft. It is managed by the popular German journalist, Maximilian Harden, who has boldly taken it upon himself to point out a way which will lead to a better understanding of the differences between our country and his. He has pointed out to the German people their mistakes many times, and has shown them that their attacks [on the Poles] are futile--that they lead them on the wrong read.</p>
   <p>The Silesian question was also discussed. Just recently Mr. Harden took a bold step by declaring to the German people that Silesia is a Polish country; and that the annexation of this land by Poland would not endanger Poland's relations with Germany. He also stated that an historical wrong would be rectified in this way. Furthermore, the future of Germany would be benefited a great deal. The cessation of the present attack against Poland would bring about a closer relationship and understanding between both nations. Co-operation would be the motto; not hatred and revenge.</p>
   <p>A recent article by Mr. Harden entitled "The Last Sacrifice" discussed in great length the decision of the Entente concerning the Upper Silesian question. Harden pointed out that the lamentations by the Germans and the harangues and indignation of the press were only a result of an illusion which was created and supported by the German press. "From the German point of view," stated the brave and bold Mr. Harden, "Upper Silesia is pro-German, despite the fact that the names of the villages and towns reveal that the area once belonged to Poland." Yet the[German]people were continuously fed with this idea, and the whole world was told that this land was entirely German.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, the plebiscite revealed that three fifths of the votes cast favored Germany, while two fifths were for Poland. But Germany tried to hide this fact, and claimed that the unanimous vote favored her and, therefore, the entire country should belong to her. The Versailles Treaty was also ignored. This pact specifically stated that Silesia would be divided according to the results of the vote.</p>
   <p>When the German government signed this pact it accepted this agreement of of division. Yet the pre-war propaganda and the post-plebiscite articles opposed any division of the Silesian territory. The result was that the greater portion of the German people were not aware of the treaty agreement, and were placed under an illusion by the "no-split" propaganda. "This illusion," writes Harden, "works like a disease in German politics."</p>
   <p>The loss of the World War has cured the German people of many such illusions. The loss of the most important part of Silesia has cured them of this illusion also. Harden further states: It is hoped that the settlement of the Silesian Question between the two nations will mark the beginning of a period of normal, neighborly co-operation and feeling. Poland above the Vistula, Warta, and Oder rivers, and below the Vistula river must come to an understanding with Germany. The German government must also arrange for a trade agreement with Poland. At the same time, Berlin's bureaucratic organizations which forbade the exportation of goods to Poland must be dissolved before they endanger German industry and trade. The coalition gave Poland the most important part of Silesia in order to make possible the rebuilding of industry in that part of the country, and to make Poland a stronger nation--a country to be reckoned with. Therefore, Germany ought to take quick steps to bring about a better understanding with Poland.</p>
