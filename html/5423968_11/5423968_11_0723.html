   <p>The secretary of the Polish Central Committee, formulated to stimulate the attendance of American Poles at the Lwow Exposition, received a letter from Mr. A. Schreiber, secretary of the C. Pulaski Society in Brooklyn, in which a check was inclosed for $4.45, which was contributed by nineteen persons in sums of from five to fifty cents, to aid the fund for building a Polish American pavilion.</p>
   <p>The members of the C. Pulaski Society are to be commended for their action.</p>
   <p>If all of our Polish societies here in America did likewise, then we would have no further worries about the Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition.</p>
