   <p>From the visit of the former president of the United States, Mr. William H. Taft, to the parish of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Reverend F. M. Wojtalewicz, pastor of the parish of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, has a very precious keepsake in his treasure chest, and that is the snapshot of the visit of Mr. William H. Taft, former president of the United States, who personally inspected the parish buildings and also spent more than one hour in the pastor's house with priests and parishioners.</p>
   <p>The above snapshot shows former President Taft leaving the pastor's house surrounded by his retinue together with Rev. Wojtalewicz. The visit of the president of the United States will forever remain in memory because it was the first case in history that the president, while in office, ever visited any Polish parish and spent there more than one hour.</p>
