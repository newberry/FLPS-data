   <p>Countrymen!</p>
   <p>From Brzesc Litewski, where peach negotiations between the Central Powers and Russia and Ukraine were conducted, comes the news, confirmed beyond and doubt, that the German government as well as the Austro-Hungarian government never had the smallest intention of settling the Polish question agreeably with Polish demands for independence and with the vital interests of the Polish nation. Even the declarations of both rulers made on November 5, 1916, as well as later proclamations establishing a regency in the Kingdom [a section of Poland] were merely scraps of paper to the Germans and Austrians.</p>
   <p>In treating with Ukraine on the boundaries of that new republic, Germany and Austria, in return for concessions made them, gave Chelm and Galicia to Ukraine, without any consideration for the fact that even the Russian Duma, hostile to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Polish interests, had declared through the most prominent representatives of the Russian government of that time that the population of these territories was seventy to eighty per cent Polish and that therefore these lands were essentially Polish.</p>
   <p>This seizure of unquestionably Polish land for the benefit of Ukraine is a painful blow to the Polish nation, in that it will give rise to constant disagreement between Poland and Ukraine. The Polish nation wholeheartedly agrees to Ukraine's independence, and would like its relations with that republic to be not only free from future irritations and hostility but to be established upon the friendliest possible basis.</p>
   <p>But the seizure of this Polish land--land that not even Empress Catherine dared to touch, land that is drenched with the blood and tears of the defenders of our faith, land that is so dear to us--represents in itself an act of inimical and contumacious autocracy, entirely disregardful of that spiritual union which binds this land to the rest of the Kingdom, making impossible any satisfaction <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>at the ostensible independence of those parts of Poland left to us.</p>
   <p>Austria and Germany effected this plan of theirs without informing even the regency which they established in the Kingdom; showing clearly that they do not regard this regency as the Polish government, and that they do not regard it as competent to be treated with on plans for the future of the nations.</p>
   <p>At the same time, the Austrian government issued, through its military authorities, an order to the command in Przemysl that the Polish officers and men who were members of the Legions, and who were to united with the Polish Army, should be included in the Austrian army and sent to fight the Italians and the French--and this despite the specific protests of the Polish Circle and the whole populace of Galicia and the Kingdom. This shows that Austria is far from permitting the independence of our nation.</p>
   <p>In addition to the above-cited act of Austria, the German press clearly and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>brazenly states that the "German" Lodz and rich mining region of Zaglebie Dabrowskie are to be taken from Poland.</p>
   <p>We cannot accept this in silence. If we do so, we will help the conquerors spread the opinion that we agree to these outrages and partitions.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the Executive Committee of the National Board, in accordance with the suggestion telegraphed here by Ignacy Paderewski, turns to all Poles in America, to all organizations, societies, parishes and settlements, to the priests, the citizens, the youth, the Polish women, and urges that with all possible expedition a great mass meeting of our countrymen be held in order that a solemn protest may be instituted against the new partitioning of Poland. Collections can be taken up at these mass meetings for the benefit of the National Board and placed in the hands of the secretary of the Executive Committee. Collections made in the parishes can be turned over to the Reverend W. Zapala, secretary-general of the Union of Polish Priests, Holt and Division Streets, Chicago. Resolutions passed at these mass meetings should be signed <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>by all those present and submitted with all possible haste to the secretary of the Executive Committee.</p>
