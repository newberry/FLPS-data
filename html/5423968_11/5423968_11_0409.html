   <p>Chicago Polonia again gave proof of its political maturity--as was generally expected. Even in spite of poor means of transportation and in spite of the obstacles that were to be expected on a holiday, the public arrived at yesterday's demonstration in such numbers and so punctually as to exceed even the expectations of the committee in charge of arrangements. Even the communities located farther from the center of the city were relatively well represented, with the exception of the Polish settlements in the neighboring towns, which probably did not send their representatives because of the great distance.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's demonstration will long remain in the memories of those who participated in it. We greeted the delegates of the Polish Army in France: Major Kozlowski, Captain Wagner, and Lieutenant Prince Poniatowski; and also the first official representative of the Polish nation in Washington, recognized alike by the United States as by the other Allied governments. In addition, we <span class="page-break">\2</span>greeted the representatives of other nations--above all, those of the United States; we entertained them with pomp and splendor. We proved to these distinguished guests that despite our antagonists, despite the dangers that ever threaten our national existence, despite our continuous struggle, we have not ceased to be what our Mother Poland always expected of us--we have not ceased to be Poles.</p>
   <p>In reality, Chicago Polonia celebrated a great holiday yesterday, the echoes of which will undoubtedly resound across the ocean in the blood-and tear-soaked land of Poland.</p>
   <p>A truly Spring day favored by ideal weather did much to make yesterday's celebration a success. The sun shone from early morning, and there was not a aloud in the sky all day. The Polish communities in which societies were gathering for the parade were decorated with Polish and American flags. At the time appointed by the committee in charge of the demonstration, the societies which were to march in the first division began to gather at the Polish <span class="page-break">\3</span>National Alliance Building, those of the second division at Pulaski Hall, while those of the third division arrived by streetcar and train at Michigan Avenue and Randolph.</p>
   <p>Not all of the societies complied with instructions, however; instead of gathering at the designated points, they went to the place at which the third division had gathered. Others, mentioned below, arrived so late that there was no place for them in the hall.</p>
   <p>First Division</p>
   <p>The first division, which was to gather at the Polish National Alliance Building, left the gathering place at eleven o'clock in the morning in the following order: Platoon of police; Polish Army Cavalry from the South Side and from Town of Lake; representatives of the Polish Army; Company of Polish Falcons (men and women); representatives of the Polish press; Polish Army Organizer Rozycki; a banner with the inscription "Free Poland With An Outlet To The Sea"; <span class="page-break">\4</span>Scouts; Illinois National Guard; Alliance of Polish Military Societies; Women's Falcon nests; military societies from the North and South Sides; civilian societies from the North and South Sides; Polish Army Lieutenent Palaszewski; the Polish Democratic League of Cook County; and the Polish Citizens' Club. The parade moved down Division Street to Ashland Avenue, down Ashland to Jackson Boulevard, and down Jackson to Michigan Avenue, where it joined with the second and third divisions already waiting there.</p>
   <p>Second Division</p>
   <p>The second division was to consist of the military societies from the parishes of St. Adalbert, St. Anne, St. Casimir, St. Peter and Paul, St. John of God, and Heart of Jesus, and from Bridgeport and Hawthorne. The societies from these communities and parishes were to gather at Pulaski Hall at ten o'clock in the morning, but only a few of them were present at the appointed time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The Falcon societies of Town of Lake--that is, Nests 37, 100, 105, and 133 of the Polish Falcons' Alliance--gathered at ten o'clock at Slowacki Hall on the corner of 48th and Paulina Streets and Joined the first division at Ashland and Jackson.</p>
   <p>At about the same time, Branches 18, 64, 65, and 67 of the Polish Young Mens' Alliance in the Land of Washington left Slowacki Hall for their gathering place at Michigan Avenue and Randolph.</p>
   <p>Members of Council 39, P. N. A. [Polish National Alliance], individual groups, societies affiliated with the K. Brodzinski Library, and national and church societies of the parishes of St. Joseph, St. John of God, and Heart of Jesus, gathered at Slowacki Hall at twelve -thirty. They left at one o'clock on chartered streetcars for Jackson and Michigan, where they were to join the other divisions. The marshal of the second division was Joseph Kukulski. The parade proceeded in the following order: Marshal of the Citizen's Committee of Town of Lake; Citizen's Committee; the administrators of Council 39, P. N. A.; <span class="page-break">\6</span>the J. Slowacki Library; and the K. Brodzinski Library. Following these were members of individual societies, numbering several thousand and led by three bands.</p>
   <p>The national and church societies of St. Anne's Parish and Council 87, P. N. A. met in front of Chopin Hall, 19th Street and Hoyne Avenue at eleven o'clock in the morning. They left at eleven-thirty by elevated train to meet the rest of the parade at Michigan and Randolph. St. Adalbert's and St. Casimir's parishes were not very numerously represented. Only a few societies and individual P. N. A. groups could be seen in the parade, and these had joined it downtown. The largest of the groups were the Businessmen's and Craftsmen's Society, P. N. A. Group 3, and the Citizen's Club of St. Adalbert's parish.</p>
   <p>The division from Town of Lake arrived at the Coliseum so late that there was no place for it in the hall. Only Kukulski was allowed to enter with the standard-bearers: I. Scigalski with the Italian flag, F. Koralewski with the Polish flag, Joseph Krusinski with the English flag, I. Cegielski with the <span class="page-break">\7</span>American flag, and John Podborny with the French flag. The Citizens' Committee was also given seats in the hall, but the rest of the marchers had to return to their homes. There were a few societies belonging to this division that managed to take part in the parade and that were given seats in the hall. These were: the Thaddeus Kosciusko Sharpshooters' Society, Group 352 P. R. C. U. [Polish Roman Catholic Union], of St. Peter and Paul Parish; the Pulaski Uhlans, Group 1, P. R. C. U., of St. Peter and Paul Parish; the Polish Young Men's Alliance in the Land of Washington; the Vistula Legions, Group 1416 P. N. A.; the Wilno Youth Society, of St. Adalbert's Parish; and the Third Division of the Polish Army, Commanded by S. T. Wlosinski.</p>
   <p>Third Division</p>
   <p>The third division, which was generally expected to be the smallest, for a great many societies from outlying communities were not expected to participate, was the largest, contrary to all expectations. This was due to the fact that many societies assigned to the first and second divisions joined with it. The <span class="page-break">\8</span>third division consisted of the following societies: St. Florian's Society of St. Casimir's Parish; Society of Bernard Abbot, Group 329 P. R. C. U.; Przybylski's band; St. Adalbert Bishop and Martyr Society, Group 104, Association of Poles in America; Lobzow Society, Group 1165, Council 3, P. N. A; Council 75, P. N.

   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>The Guard Marshal of the South Chicago societies listed above was F. Rydzewski, who was assisted by Sikorski. The South Chicago societies arrived at the gathering place in twelve chartered cars.</p>
   <p>A few minutes before the program began, a few more societies were allowed to enter the hall, but as there were no empty seats, they had to content themselves with standing room. These societies were: Dawn of Liberty Society, Group 234, P. W. A. [Polish Women's Alliance of America]; and the Under the Banner of Pulaski Society (women). The members were all dressed in Cracovian costumes. One society from Kensington was also permitted to enter.</p>
   <p>At three o'clock, Dr. W. Kuflewski, Grand Marshal of the parade, escorted Paderewski, the latter's worthy wife, and other guests to the platform. A veritable storm of applause and cheering arose as they mounted the stand. A moment later, the Polish delegation from France entered the hall and took their places upon the platform amid tumultuous applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>They were accompanied by Lieutenant O'Brien, interpreter for the delegation, and a lieutenant of the Serbian army, especially delegated to attend this demonstration.</p>
   <p>Program of the Demonstration</p>
   <p>The program of the demonstration was carried out as follows:</p>
   <p>The gathering was called to order by John W. Thomas, a member of the American Patriotic League, who called upon Jacob M. Dickinson, president of the National Security League, and former Secretary of War, to preside. Chairman Dickinson then called upon the Reverend W. Zapala, chaplain of the Polish Army, to read the invocation, following which the chairman delivered a speech.</p>
   <p>"America" was then sung by the Philaret Choir and the audience, accompanied by Kipkowski's band. Following this, the audience sang the Polish national anthem "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], accompanied by the band, after which the <span class="page-break">\12</span>band played the "Marsellaise". From this point, the program proceeded in the following order:</p>
   <p>Address by Ignace J. Paderewski.</p>
   <p>Philaret Choir, singing a battle hymn composed by Paderewski.</p>
   <p>Address by Clarence Darrow.</p>
   <p>Address by Major Joseph Kozlowski on behalf of the Polish Army in France.</p>
   <p>Address by Lieutenant Skobel on behalf of the Serbian army.</p>
   <p>Address by J. J. Zmrhal on behalf of the Bohemian National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Address by Dr. A. Zisnkini on behalf of the Southern Slavs.</p>
   <p>Address by T. M. Helinski on behalf of the Polish organizations, the National Committee, and the Polish Military Commission.</p>
   <p>Reading of the resolutions by John F. Smulski, which the gathering unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the audience sang "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland is Not Yet Lost] to the accompaniement of the band, and followed with "Boze Cos Polske". The demonstration ended at 6:40 o'clock in the evening. The greater portion of <span class="page-break">\13</span>those in the audience left for their homes, while those having tickets for the banquet to follow, proceeded to the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>On the whole, it can be said that the mass meeting, as well as the demonstration in the streets, turned out unexpectedly well. The inspiring speeches stirred us to even greater efforts in the cause most dear to us and gave us courage and hope that liberty will soon dawn for our unfortunate homeland.</p>
   <p>[Addresses by Jacob Dickinson, Clarence Darrow, and Major Kozlowski omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Speech by T. M. Helinski</p>
   <p>"Mr. Chairman, honored guests, honored clergy, and countrymen: Since the hour is already late, I will not keep you with a long address. This is a day for <span class="page-break">\14</span>our friends, our brother Slavs, and so we have permitted them to describe to us their feelings in regard to the Polish nation. We are celebrating an unusual event today, unusual because it is the first of its kind to be celebrated by Chicago Poles. Today we are greeting and paying homage to our representative of the National Committee in Paris, our representative of the Polish nation to the government of the United States. That representative is a worthy man, a man of great heart, a man whose fame resounds throughout the world, whose genius has in the past won respect for Poland, and today, when the fate of that nation hangs in the balance, has secured aid for her. This noble man is the beloved and worthy Ignace J. Paderewski.</p>
   <p>"We greet and pay homage also to the honored guests from across the ocean who have come to us from the hospitable land of France in order to become acquainted with us, to join hands with us in mutual effort. These are our countrymen, soldiers who have the love of their country not only upon their lips, but have proved it indeed, for they have already upon their lips, but have proved it indeed, for they have already risked lives; they were willing to sacrifice their lives for the <span class="page-break">\15</span>freedom of our country. They have come here to tell us that the Polish army in France exists, that it is growing with each day, that this army is ready to take its place at the Allies' side so that together they can destroy our enemy.</p>
   <p>"Beloved and worthy Mr. Paderewski! It is a source of great joy and honor to me to express gratitude for your fruitful efforts on behalf of the National Committee and therefore on behalf of all of the Polish organizations represented by this Committee, and to assure you that four million Poles stand behind you and are ready to accept your leadership; they are ready to work with you until Poland is free, independent, and united!</p>
   <p>"And you, honored guests from Europe, accept our assurance that we welcome you with open hearts, the hearts of Poles who will work with you willingly. Your mission is to increase the number of men in the Polish army. We will help you in everything. We only ask that you take good care of the soldiers we are sending you from America, and I have hopes that when you return to Europe, you <span class="page-break">\16</span>will take your places at the head of their ranks and that under the banner of the White Eagle you will lead them to liberate Warsaw, Krakow, Poznan, and Danzig; that you will lead them over German bodies to our Poland, united and free from the Carpathian Mountains to the Baltic Sea."</p>
