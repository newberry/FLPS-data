   <p>Under such a heading The Chicago Socialist reprints from the Jewish paper, The Nation, an article of the following contents:</p>
   <p>"Poland is a good child. She is trying to follow the example of the similar but relatively older militarism and reaction taken on a form of anti-communistic law'patterned after the older sister, Jugoslavia.</p>
   <p>"This law forecasts a penalty of death for every effort to abolish the government and a 20-year imprisonment for taking part in any revolutionary preparedness, and which might mean everything.</p>
   <p>"This law forecasts that the execution of sentence falls automatically after the courts decide the penalty.</p>
   <p>"According to the Berlin correspondent of The New York World, this law <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is construed in such elastic words that it can be applied to everyone and to everything which is not sympathetic to the government. It forbids the taking part in the election of any party which is in opposition to the present form of government. Directed primarily against the Communists, it can readily be used against the whole labor movement.</p>
   <p>"Even the famous anti-Socialistic laws of the 'Iron Chancellor," and tsarist decrees cannot be compared with this law.</p>
   <p>"Poland is therefore a wise child who exceeds its parents.</p>
   <p>"The original plan of Clemenceau, to fence off the Russian bolsheviks with a barbed wire fence, has fallen. Now Poland proposes a wall of gallows."</p>
   <p>Such is the way the Jewish Communists and anarchists with their Christian agents are wailing over the fate of their brothers in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Poland, because Poland does not want to surrender to socialistic anarchy, but wants to live and develop itself.</p>
   <p>"Poor Poland," cry the Socialists, because it does not voluntarily want to commit suicide!</p>
