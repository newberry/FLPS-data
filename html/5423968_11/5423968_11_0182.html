   <p>The following statement has been sent to the Polish-American papers:</p>
   <p>"For a long time complaints about the Polish Immigration Home of New York City have appeared in the Polish papers. The Polish priests, at the annual meeting of the Polish Roman Catholic Union Diet, held in Manistee, approached Reverend Gramlewicz, president of the Polish Immigration Home, relative to these complaints.</p>
   <p>"Reverend Gramlewicz took the stand in defense of the Home. He claimed that a careful investigation of the newspaper complaints was made, which proved them to be false. He further proved his claim by introducing letters from Polish citizens living near the vicinity of the Home and from Polish Immigrants who were given assistance.</p>

   <p>"The assembled brethren recognized the support given to these rumors by some of the credulous Polish newspapers. Because of this, the Polish priesthood is admonishing the Polish papers against giving too much credence to the correspondence they have received about the Polish Immigration Home, warning them to be wary of these reports in the future.</p>
   <p>"We, the undersigned, make a plea, in the name of all Polish priests belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union, to all the Polish papers to be very careful about the stories they receive pertaining to the Home.</p>
   <p>"The best way to combat these false stories is to have them checked by the office of the Polish Immigration Home before having them published. The president, Reverend Gramlewicz, will investigate and inform them promptly as to their validity.</p>
   <p>"The false correspondence and statements already published in some of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>papers have done irreparable damage to this worthy and beneficial enterprise. This is not a good way to get support for the Polish Immigration Home.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski,</p>
   <p>Reverend J. F. Szukalski."</p>
