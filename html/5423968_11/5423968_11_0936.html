   <p>Another bright Polish star has appeared on the American horizon; one more student and worker, Dr. K. Zaremba from Riverside, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In the past twenty years, Dr. K. Zaremba has made many expeditions into Mexico, in search of the remains of an extinct race of people, their culture and civilization.</p>
   <p>This tireless scientist discovered on Santa Catalina Island the origin of an Indian tribe, the Aztecs, about whose beginning the archaeologists were in disagreement for many years.</p>
   <p>Dr. Zaremba's collections of skins, parchments, hieroglyphics and other objects, bring to light many facts pertaining to Aztec migrations and their permanent settlements.</p>
   <p>He also unearthed crypotograms relating to their origin, life and development. Many of these manuscripts cover the period from the sixth to the sixteenth centuries and contain most interesting information.</p>

   <p>This discovery will enrich us with the heretofore unknown history of the early inhabitants of Mexico. Dr. Karol Zaremba's scientific collections are now on exhibition at the Newberry Library in Chicago.</p>
