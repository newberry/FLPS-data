   <p>In accordance with our promise given to the readers of Dziennik Chicagoski, we return to a discussion of the Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition of 1894. We are leaving the article in the Emigration Review on the side for the time being, and turn oar attention to the letter received by Mr. Peter Kiolbassa from the directors of the Exposition.</p>
   <p>The letter, from its text, constitutes a formal invitation of the Poles in America to participate in the Lwow Exposition. The letter justifies our participation by the fact that 1894 is the hundredth anniversary of Kosciuszko's insurrection; that we should use the-results of our peacetime efferts as evidence to outsiders that we continue to exist and that we have a right to exist. On this principle, the directors of the exposition intend <span class="page-break">2</span>it to be not merely a display of provincial talent, but instead, a general manifestation involving all provinces of Poland, as far as political conditions will permit, of course.</p>
   <p>American Polonia has already been characteristically christened as the "fourth partition" by people in the old country. It is the least known "partition," if we may call it thus, for it has only recently been discovered by our brethren in Poland. But it attracts wide interest in Galicia and Poznan; it is discussed secretly in Russian Poland. In spite of the increased facilities of communication, in spite of the fact that we seek to acquaint our countrymen in Poland with our activities in many different ways, they still seem to be inaccurately informed. Until not long ago, they were completely unaware of our existence and development; today they probably overrate our strength and significance. If once we accept the premise that Poles living in America ought to retain their nationality, that they are under obligation to their mother country, we must admit that closer relations between American Polonia and its homeland are imperative. These relations ought to begin with mutual understanding. We admit also that occasion for such an understanding is presented by the Lwow Exposition, which, as we see, <span class="page-break">3</span>is planned on a broad scale and which will, no doubt, draw numerous visitors from all three divisions of Poland. And so it is quite logical that the directors should turn to American Polonia with a request that we submit examples of our work here to the Exposition. We ought not be unrepresented in this "national exhibition," as the letter describes it, since we consider ourselves a fragment of the Polish nation. And so, we ought to accept the invitation tendered by the directors of the exposition and prepare ourselves for participation in it. This is how the matter presents itself to our minds. We hope, too, that this neighborly viewpoint will be accepted by the Poles in America generally.</p>
   <p>More complicated are the questions: What form will our participation take? Who is to direct it? How large a fund is necessary for this purpose and how shall it be raised?</p>
   <p>While the letter from Lwow presents the matter in a general way, yet it already speaks of a Polish-American pavilion. In our opinion, this desire is a bit too bold. Obviously, the directors of the Exposition cannot be <span class="page-break">4</span>accurately informed, and hence they propose a project which presupposes that the Poles in America are able to carry a considerable expense. This is not true. We know well that our people in America are poor people, already weighed down with a great many burdens. Again, our people are almost exclusively workingmen, though a few are engaged in business. There are practically no independent Polish-American manufacturers. We have no industrial specimens to offer, therefore; even craftsmen are rare among us. Thus it can readily be seen that we would have too few specimens of manufacture, handicraft, etc., to necessitate a separate pavilion for their display. In place of this, our exhibit should give our brethren across the ocean a picture of our religious, intellectual, and national life. We build schools and churches, we publish books and newspapers, we organize societies for every conceivable purpose; this is the phase of our existence most interesting to our mother country, and we should strive to create the clearest possible conception of it. Our exhibit might consist of photographs of Polish schools and churches in America, bound volumes of our newspapers, books published here. We might show them the constitutions of our societies, their emblems, brochures, and in some cases, handwritten manuscripts. Such a <span class="page-break">5</span>collection would not be difficult to assemble, it could be sent to Poland at low cost, and a place could be found for its display at the Exposition. Best of all, it would give a clear picture of our life here. It may be that this picture would not altogether be complimentary, but at least it would be a truthful one. Obviously, aside from the above-mentioned exhibit, the completion of which would be more or less a public duty, it would be left to the initiative of private individuals, if such willing persons could be found, to supply specimens of industry, handicraft, etc. So much for the form which, in our opinion, our participation in the Lwow Exposition should take.</p>
   <p>The two remaining questions present no serious difficulties. Who shall direct it? Obviously, our newspapers first, and afterward, people of good will and action. Mr. Kiolbassa requested that we publish the letter he received and that all other Polish newspapers reprint it in order to disseminate the idea--to open discussion of the matter in the newspaper column. After it has been thoroughly discussed from all angles, Mr. Kiolbassa will call a mass meeting of Polish-American citizens to talk the matter over. It is practically certain that volunteers will be found to lend their services to <span class="page-break">6</span>the cause. This procedure should be followed by other Polish colonies, and eventually a central committee could be formed to take charge.</p>
   <p>Should the exhibit be arranged according to the lines we have proposed, the fund required would be small. The task of raising the money required would be comparatively simple; the fund could be satisfied partly by public donation and partly through the efforts of the individuals and societies most concerned.</p>
   <p>The matter of representation of our newspapers in the Exposition is primarily a question for newspapermen. We will leave its discussion for another time.</p>
