   <p>A great political massmeeting took place last night at Andrew Schultz's hall, 697 Noble Street. The meeting was a very important one in that it was called to name a committee for the 16th Ward Democratic political organization. Elected for this committee were Mr. John Arkuszewski, president; Victor Bardonski, vice-president; and J. Kendziorski, secretary. An executive committee was also formed of which the following persons were elected members: John Czekata, E. Z. Brodowski, M. Michalski, Frank Murkowski, Joseph Pytlak, W. Tomasik, and John Biniak. Mr. Peter Kiolbasa was picked out as candidate for alderman of the ward. Mr. Kiolbasa, we think, will get all the votes of the Poles and also many votes from other groups, because his ability and righteousness are well known not only to the Poles but also, to the Americans and the Germans. The committee will have its meeting next Sunday night.</p>
