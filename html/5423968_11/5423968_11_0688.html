   <p>Dr. Statkiewicz gave a talk on the influence of alcohol on the human system.</p>

   <p>A declamation, "Must", was given by Mr. Ciechowicz.</p>
   <p>Seven-year-old Eugene Janiszewski and little Mary Bauer recited several Polish <span class="page-break">2</span>verses.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, N. L. Piotrowski induced Reverend Krawczunas, who was in the audience, to say a few words. The priest praised the Poles for their wonderful patriotic functions and urged them to keep up their fine work.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: These patriotic exercises were staged in connection with commemorating 1895 as a year of national mourning; for it marked the one-hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland.]</p>
