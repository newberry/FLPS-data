   <p>Mr. Thaddeus Sleszynski will enter upon his new duties as manager of the Business Extension Department of the Madison and Kedzie State Bank on Saturday, July 7th, 1928. In view of the fact that this bank has practically no Polish clientele, Mr. Sleszynski is to be congratulated for receiving recognition for his ability and past experience from an institution in a community in which he is entirely unknown.</p>
   <p>The Madison and Kedzie State Bank has grown very rapidly in the last few years, and it is today one of the five largest neighborhood banks of Chicago. It is this rapid growth that has made it necessary to employ someone of Mr. Sleszynski's qualifications to reorganize the Business Extension Department so that the work can be done more systematically and effectively.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sleszynski's added responsibilities will no doubt, force him to be less active in the various Polish organizations with which he has been indentified for the past fifteen years.</p>
