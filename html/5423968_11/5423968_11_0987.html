   <p>Mr. Victor Karlowski, former editor of Gazeta Polska, published by Mr. W. Dyniewicz, who disappeared some time ago, is dead.</p>
   <p>He was a victim, it now appears, of a railroad accident.</p>
   <p>On April 27, the coroner of Oneida County in the State of New York, wired the chief of police of Chicago, asking him to find out the name of an unknown man, who was killed on April 25, by a train in Vernon, New York. While searching the clothing of the victim, a Polish prayer book was found, in which, in two different places, the names "Franciszka Karlowska and Wladyslaw Dyniewicz, 532 Noble Street, Chicago, Illinois" were written.</p>
   <p>The local police gave some publicity to this accident, and, the wife of the missing editor, Mrs. Marcyanna Karlowska (whose present address is 34 Fleetwood Street) made inquiries, and at once came to the conclusion that the dead man was her husband, Victor Karlowski. The prayer book belonged to Frances, a daughter of the deceased, who had written her name in it.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Karlowski expects to bring the body of her husband to Chicago for burial.</p>
