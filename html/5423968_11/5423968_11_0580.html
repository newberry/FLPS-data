   <p>Yesterday evening several groups of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America arranged a mass meeting at Julius Slowacki Hall at 48th and Paulina Streets in Town of Lake. Despite the inclemency of the weather, a great many people attended this independence mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Wrzesinski, who called upon Mrs. W. Jankowski, wife of the director of the Polish National Alliance, to act as secretary. Mr. K. Zyechlinski, "father of the Falcons" and president of the Polish National Alliance delivered the first address with his usual ease and vitality. Ardently and sincerely he called upon those assembled to collect a fund for the reconstruction of our homeland, which must soon be free and independent. The audience enthusiastically applauded Mr. Zychlinski's rather lengthy speech.</p>
   
   <p>The speaker earnestly advised the Falcons to prepare for the time when they will hear the notes of the Golden Horn, which will be the herald announcing the action for which the Falcons here have been waiting for twenty-six years. [Translator's note: This refers to Wyspianski's "Wedding". The Golden Horn is to sound the signal to take up arms for Poland's independence.]</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Mr. J. Przyprawa, explained what duties and service we owe the homeland and, in accordance with the literary master's words, "It is time to act", exhorted those assembled to action.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. J. Rybicki, president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, in his speech demonstrated how much the Poles born in the United States love the homeland in spite of never having seen it. As a Falcon, he advised the Falcons to be disciplined and to await the command from headquarters to go wherever the homeland might desire. He said that this moment might be even closer than we imagine. Mr. Rybicki's speech was welcomed enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>The collection yielded $33,25 for the Kosciusko Fund. With the singing of "Drowsy and Lazy" and "Poland Is Not Lost" this inspiring mass meeting of the Falcons in Town of Lake was adjourned.</p>
