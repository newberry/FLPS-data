   <p>The American newspaper the Chicago Tribune has printed several articles on Poland and Poles. Professor George A. Dorsey, a correspondent of this newspaper who has spent a considerable amount of time in Slavic nations, especially in Galicia, has taken Cracow, the former capital of Poland, as his main topic. From Cracow Dr. Dorsey relays his observations and comments, which he provides with adequate descriptions. The above-mentioned paper publishes his work without editing; it has complete faith in its correspondent. It is possible to surmise from Mr. Dorsey's articles that he bases his arguments upon information that he obtains directly. Because of this factor these articles are more or less permeated with sincerity and sympathy toward our people. At first Mr. Dorsey was evidently being misinformed, and hence he made several mistakes. At that time he judged our people rather severely, especially our past history, although it must also be <span class="page-break">\2</span>admitted that a great deal of truth was contained in his comments. More recently, however, after studying local conditions more carefully entering into spheres where he could find adequate and truthful information, the correspondent has struck a favorable tone and has begun to enclose articles that are rather interesting and profitable to us, especially here in the United States.</p>
   <p>One article of Mr. Dorsey treats matters pertinent to Polish migration to the United States. Here Mr. Dorsey uses Mr. J. Okolowicz as his source of information. The latter was an editor of the Polish periodical the Polish Emigration Review, which supplies priceless material for a professional man who sincerely dedicates his time to emigration questions. Mr. Okolowicz explained to Mr. Dorsey that although the immigration laws of America are good, immigration officials give these laws their own interpretation. This leaves the power to admit or reject people from other countries entirely to the approval of the officials. Thus, one immigrant can be given permission to enter America even if he does not comply with all the rules and regulations, <span class="page-break">\3</span>while another can be sent back, although he completely satisfies all conditions of the law. Any insignificant pretext--even the appearance of an immigrant not pleasing to a commissioner--is a sufficient basis on which to deny admission to the unfortunate and force him to return to Europe. Consequently many poor immigrants are condemned to unheard-of miseries because they have sold all their earthly belongings and gone into debt to obtain passage money, only to find, upon their arrival at Ellis Island, that a commissioner deems them undesirable and orders then to return from whence they came. Such action is a grave injustice, which the immigration law does not order to be committed against the unfortunates. Immigration medical authorities sometimes issue reports stating that immigrants suffer from trachoma--that is, a contagious inflammation of the eyes--although the doctors of Europe and the port authorities on the other side of the ocean stated that the same immigrants had completely healthy eyes. This is caprice and chicanery on the part of doctors opposed to immigration.</p>
   <p>In the same way, it depends upon the caprice of an immigration commissioner <span class="page-break">\4</span>whether re-entry is permitted to immigrants who lived in America for several years without obtaining citizenship papers and then left for a visit to their native land.</p>
   <p>There is the ease of a certain Pole who left for a visit to Europe. This person had lived in America for fifteen years, had a place of business in Chicago, and had quite a considerable estate. When he returned from Poland, an immigration commissioner asked him whether he had his citizenship papers. When he replied in the negative, he was ordered to return to Europe. All explanations of this man--that he had a family and a business here, that he had sufficient money for his maintenance, that he would not be a liability to this country, and that he was healthy and would willingly become a citizen--were to no avail. The commissioner ordered his deportation and that was final. This unfortunate man went to England, and from there he returned to Canada, whence he finally succeeded in entering the United States to join his family.</p>
   <p>In another instance a commissioner rejected a healthy, young Pole simply because <span class="page-break">\5</span>the latter showed a letter from his brother giving the information that conditions had changed for the better in America and that, if he could come to this country, employment could be found for him. The "wise and judicious" immigration commissioner considered this to be importation of a worker on a contract to work, and therefore ordered the young Pole to return to Europe.</p>
   <p>There are numerous such occurrences and abuses on the part of immigration commissioners. This behavior is condemned by Mr. Dorsey, who considers it to be a grave injustice. It is well that this question should find its way into the columns of the English-language press through the efforts of an American correspondent. This can have a favorable influence that will change port conditions with respect to accepting immigrants into this country. Our people will await further articles of Mr. Dorsey. Although at first he scratched us a little, figuratively speaking, his subsequent works completely reinstate him with us. He now obtains all of his information about our people and our nation from reliable sources.</p>
