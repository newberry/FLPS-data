   <p>The Chicago Times has published population statistics of the various nationalities residing in Chicago based on the census of 1890. A first glance reveals that the total number of Polish people in Chicago is falsely stated. It must be remembered that a great number of Poles born in Chicago have given themselves the title of Americans. There is also a great number of Polish people who have given their nationality as German, American, or Russian. This is possible for we have come across this many times. A certain Pole will say that he is a Russian-Pole, a German-Pole, or an Austrian-Pole, or of that extraction. The census taker did not bother about the Polish as much as the German or whatever the prefix was and listed them in that category.</p>

   <p>When will the Poles realize that no Russian-Poland or German-Poland exists but only a Poland under the rule of the Austrians or Russians? There is a great difference.</p>
