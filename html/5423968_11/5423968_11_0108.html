   <p>There is no doubt that America is filled with people; and for that reason there is a movement to restrict European emigration. The tendency to restrict immigration is growing stronger and stronger. This tendency is expressed by all kinds of laws, among them are the following:</p>
   <p>Every immigrant must have a certificate of deportment, issued by authorities of the town in which he lived. An immigrant must have an elementary education, that is, he must be able to read and write well. A plan is also being devised to limit the number of emigrants from every country to 50,000 persons. According to this plan, every country, large or small, would be priviliged to send the same quota of emigrants to America. Small countries such as Greece or Serbia could send the same number as larger Austria, France, Russia, Germany, and so on.</p>
   <p>The proposed regulation, that an immigrant possess a certain amount of education was rejected by Congress a few years ago. This measure, called the intelligence test regulation, would in the greatest degree, effect the Slavs and Italians who are employed to do that kind of work which does not necessitate the knowledge of reading and writing. Taking for granted that illiterate immigrants are not admitted, who will dig our canals, who will work on railroads or dig sewers?.</p>
   
   <p>Coal mines, where thousands of miners-perish every year because of gas explosions and other accidents, would be considerably affected. There are no means by which such accidents can be prevented; the coal barons care very little for their working men and the government, does not give them the proper legal protection. Among the victims of the coal mine tragedies were thousands of immigrants who were illiterate but physically capable, and industrious.</p>
   <p>Who will replace them? We admit that restriction is necessary, but that restriction should be reasonable and practical.</p>
