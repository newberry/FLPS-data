   <p>We have received a number of letters from various parts of the United States requesting information about the economic conditions of the State of Parana, one of the twenty-one states of Brazil, South America, and the possibilities for those who might settle there.</p>
   <p>The editorial department is in no position to answer all queries relative to this matter, however, we wish to say that those persons interested in settling in Parana should have a substantial capital to take there with them. There are opportunities for tradesmen, craftsmen, industrialists, and businessmen, but they all must have enough money to finance their undertakings. Farmers also have opportunities; nevertheless, the same advice applies to them--they must have money.</p>
   
   <p>We also wish to add, relative to the extraordinary development of the Polish element in Parana, which in time may become a dominant factor in the affairs of that state, that a stronger influx of Polish-American industrialists, tradesmen, and farmers who have been trained in the rigorous American schools is required. This is the answer to our best interests in the State of Parana, for the incoming immigrants will find support from the local Polish people already established there. Such support will help to build a permanent foundation for the future development of the Poles.</p>
   <p>Detailed information about Parana and southern Brazil may be found in the following books:</p>
   <p>1. Description of the State of Parana, translated by Professor Dr. J. Siemiradzki. This book contains a map of the Polish colony. A copy of this book may be obtained for fifty cents.</p>

   <p>A large map of Parana has also been published. It contains special details of the Polish colony. The map measures one meter and sixty centimeters in length and one meter and ten centimeters in width. The cost of this map is $1.50, postpaid to America.</p>
