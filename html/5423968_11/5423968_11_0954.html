   <p>The city counselor, Mr. John F. Smulski, has the support of nearly all the Republicans in Chicago. Last night a Republican banquet was held in the Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
   <p>Among those present were: James Reddick, Judge Serenson, Peter Olson, J. Himas, J. Devine, Brundage, Williams, Senator Haas, state counselor Healy, Abel Davis, Judge McEwen, Oscar Hebel, Hohn Lynn, Phillip Garner, Senator Campbell, George Anderson, James Pease, Alderman, Raymer, Larson and Sitts.</p>
   <p>When the question was asked as to the next mayor in Chicago, there were yells of "John F. Smulski, John F. Smulski."</p>
   <p>The uproar became an ovation.</p>
   <p>Short speeches were made by James Reddick and Judge McEwen indorsing Smulski, and Williams proposed a toast.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smulski spoke briefly, omitting mention of politics.</p>
