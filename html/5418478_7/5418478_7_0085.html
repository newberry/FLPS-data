   <p>One of the largest and most impressive gatherings in commemoration of the one hundred and eighty-fifth birthday of George Washington was recorded in the Sokol hall on Ashland Avenue last night. The Ladies' section of the Pilsen Sokol held their celebration in the grand style, which has become the standard for these yearly representative and patriotic festivals.</p>
   <p>After a musical introduction rendered by the Sokol orchestra, Mrs. Ottilie Splavec, our foremost actress, and head of the Ladies' Sokol organizations, recited a prologue. Following this the well-known pedagogue, Prof. Jar. J. Zmrhal delivered the address of the evening, in which he emphasized the undaunted courage and the vigor with which Washington inspired the colonial army in time of greatest despair for the Yankee cause. He pictured Washington as he really was, and not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the light of superhuman glory shed upon him by the fancy of historians.</p>
   <p>The academic part of the program contained classic dances performed by pupils of Miss Libuse Bartusek, and of Mrs. Helen Klaus Mikuta. Besides music for the piano, there was a large number of songs and pieces for the violin rendered by artists, and some excellent amateurs. The atmosphere of the brilliant evening was surcharged with American patriotism, so essential for the upkeep of sentiment in these portentous times.</p>
