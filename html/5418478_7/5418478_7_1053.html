   <p>In the regular meeting of the Bohemian National Cemetery Board held last night, Mr. Smejkal proposed that no grave be maintained in order and decorated with flowers as long as an amount of at least one hundred dollars, has not been deposited for that purpose. Members who have paid a part of that amount are to pay up to the figure required. The motion was carried.....A report on finances shows $26,689.84 in the treasury.....</p>
