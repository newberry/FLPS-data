   <p>All Bohemians and all liberal-minded citizens of this country received a great deal of satisfaction when the telegraphic news was issued from the National Capital that our countryman, the well-known president of the Atlas Brewing Company, Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, had been appointed United States Ambassador to the Balkan states of Serbia, Bulgaria, and Rumania. Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, who sent us this news yesterday, said at the end of his wire: "I consider this a great victory for our people and for all right-thinking, liberal-minded men."</p>
   <p>Everybody agrees with him in this respect. As soon as it became known that Mr. Vopicka was a candidate for an ambassador's post and that he had a good chance of receiving the appointment because Senator J. Hamilton Lewis, Governor Dunne, Mayor Harrison, and many other prominent Democratic leaders in Illinois had given him their endorsement, the "dry" element throughout the United States started a storm of protest. Wherever there was a convention, a meeting, or any <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>other gathering, the "drys" never neglected to pass a resolution against Mr. Vopicka's nomination. All this because Mr. Vopicka is connected with a brewery. The "drys" kept sending protests to President  Wilson, Secretary Bryan, and the Senate, without whose approval the nomination would not be valid. They had been relying particularly on Bryan, whose dry convictions are only too well known. They have failed to sway him, have failed in regard to the President, and it seems most likely that they will also fail in the Senate, in spite of the fact that they are bombarding this body with the most vicious protests.....</p>
   <p>In addition to Bohemian Democrats, the United Societies for Local Autonomy have supported Mr. Vopicka's cause and thus may consider his victory as their own. They had sent a memorial letter in which they pointed out that the brewing industry is a recognized and legitimate business and that the Federal Government, which derives a considerable part of its income from the brewing industry, must not consider men who engage in it as second-rate citizens. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>letter says further: "We do hope that in considering the nominations for any office, the Government will consider the man's ability and character rather than his business, as long as such business has not been declared illegal. We trust that the law and the honest convictions of right-thinking, unprejudiced men will prevail over the loud accusations of narrow-minded fanatics against a man who is particularly suited for the office. We trust that the President of the United States and his Secretary of State will consider the nomination of Mr. Vopicka from an unbiased point of view." There is no doubt that the expressed opinion of an organization as powerful and as influential as the United Societies must have received full consideration.</p>
   <p>If the Senate approves the nomination of Mr. Vopicka, we American-Bohemians will have one of our own men in an office which has never before been held by a Bohemian of a nonaristocratic family even in the old country. Now, after the war with Turkey, the office of ambassador to the Balkan states is of special importance, because these states now have a much greater political significance than ever before. In his office Mr. Vopicka will come into contact with the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>best diplomats of European powers, because only such individuals will be sent to the Balkans from now on. The salary connected with the office of Ambassador to Serbia, Bulgaria, and Rumania amounts to ten thousand dollars a year. But, as in the case of any other ambassador, our Ambassador to the Balkans will have to spend much more money in order to represent our Republic properly. Mr. Vopicka is well aware of the fact that he will not make any money at his new post and that it will require many sacrifices on his part. But he is gladly willing to make them in order to serve our new country and enhance the prestige of the Bohemian nation of whom he is a loyal son.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel (Charles) J. Vopicka was born at Horni Hbity near Pribram, November 3, 1857. Here he attended the public school. He was sent to Prague, where he studied at the Gymnasium and the Bohemian-Slavonic Academy of Commerce. There after he received the position of accountant with the firm of J. Prokopec at Vinohrady (a suburb of Prague), and he held this job for four years. Unable to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>resist the temptation of the country overseas, he came to the United States in 1880. At that time he was a young man of twenty-three, full of ambition and indomitable energy. But the first few years of life in this new country brought him just as bitter experiences as those of thousands of other young immigrants. Soon he found that he could not get a position in keeping with his training, but he was ready to seize any opportunity that offered a living and a chance to get experience on which his active, penetrating spirit could build further. At first he worked at the dry goods store of Ludvik Zavadil on Twelfth Street, but soon thereafter he became a notary public and engaged in the real-estate business. Later, with his brother-in-law, Otto Kubin, he founded a real-estate firm of his own, of which he made a remarkable success in a few years. In 1891, the building of a brewery, the Bohemian Brewing Company, was started. Now it is known as the Atlas Brewing Company, and to this day Mr. Vopicka is its president and one of its most active officers.</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that he devoted most of his attention to the brewery, he became interested in many other large enterprises and for years was also active <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in politics. He is not only a stockholder, but also an officer in several important business and manufacturing firms. Among these the new Chicago Bonding and Surety Company should be mentioned, of which he is the treasurer. Also his political activities are widespread. Even during the administration of Governor Altgeld he was a member of the West Park Commission, the first honorary political office he had ever held. He has been a member of the Chicago Board of Education, a member of the Commission on Local Improvements and, in more recent years, his name used to be mentioned in connection with the nominations for various high offices.</p>
   <p>In 1904 he was nominated by the Democrats of the Fifth Congressional District as candidate for Congressman, and under normal conditions this nomination would have meant as much as election. But that year the whole State of Illinois was swept by a Roosevelt wave, because of which the first Bohemian Democratic candidate for Congress was defeated by a majority of a mere few hundred votes. This failure, however, did by no means deter Mr. Vopicka from continuing in his <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>political activities, and he has always been considered an important factor in all of the inner councils of the Democratic party in the State. He has enjoyed the personal friendship of Governor Dunne, Mayor Harrison, and many other Democratic leaders. For this reason his appointment to the highest office ever given to a Bohemian was strongly supported by many men of great influence in the Democratic party. Mr. Vopicka holds membership in several clubs and associations, both Bohemian and English speaking, and he is a Sokol (member of the gymnastic union of Sokol). He married Miss Victoria Kubin, and they now have six children.</p>
