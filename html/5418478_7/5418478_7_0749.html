   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery) was held last night in the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) Hall, West 18th and May Streets. In the absence of the president (Mr.Pecha), the vice-president, Mr. Stanislav Simecek, presided. The minutes....were read by Mr. Viktor H. Filip, the secretary, and, after a brief debate, were approved. It was Mr. Zrust who gave rise to this debate by objecting to the inclusion of certain remarks made in the previous meeting which referred to gifts of flowers which were to be made to certain ladies' organizations. [Translator's note: The Jednota Geskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union) asked the Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery to send them some freshly cut flowers gratis. These flowers were to be used as table decorations for a banouet which was to be given by the Ladies' Union in honor of the delegates to the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood). Objections <span class="page-break">\2</span>were made to this request on the ground that the Ladies' Union is wealthy enough to afford paying for such table decorations, and the objections were included in the minutes. Evidently the objecting delegate did not wish the remarks to be published, and hence his objection to the recording of the same.] The matter was put to a vote, and Mr. Zrust's objection to the inclusion of these remarks was overruled and the minutes were allowed to stand as read.</p>
   <p>Certain bills, which were submitted for payment by the financial secretary, Mr. Jan Kozak, led to a discussion, but all of them were finally ordered paid. The reading of letters followed.</p>
   <p>The Delnicka Akademie, (Bohemian Workingmen's Academy) which is an educational organization of the Czechoslovak workingmen [in Czechoslovakia], sent a letter in which the Academy thanks the Sbor for a gift of 2,500 Czechoslovak crowns which were transmitted to them by Mr. Jan Pecha in the name of the Sbor while he was on a visit in the homeland.</p>

   <p>A letter was received from the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Community) announcing that on September 10, 1922, at 2:30 P.M. there will be a service commemorating the death of F. B. Zdrubek, the former president of the Obec and the foremost pioneer of Free Thought in America. This memorial service is to be held jointly with the Sbor as per previous agreement. The patronat (managing board) of the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola F. B. Zdrubek (F. B. Zdrubek Bohemian Free Thought School) of Irving Park is also to take part in the services. The Sbor gladly gave permission to the Obec to use the large hall of the crematory for the [memorial services]. Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, the offical spokesman of the Obec, was present in this meeting, and requested the Sbor not only to attend in full number, but also to appoint a speaker for the memorial service who would acquit himself well on that occasion which celebrated the memory of the Nestor of all Bohemian freethinkers in America and a co-founder of the Bohemian cemetery. Mr. Petrzelka also suggested that it would be fitting to place a wreath on the urn bearing the ashes of F. B. Zdrubek. On motion made by Mr. Smejkal, the whole matter was referred to the board of directors which will manage all details relating to the services.</p>

   <p>The next letter was a request for flowers made by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools). The Federation will hold a Staroceske Posviceni (old Czech celebration) on September 17, 1922. The Posviceni is to be for the benefit of the Bohemian Free Thought schools of Chicago, and flowers will therefore be needed for the occasion. The Sbor allowed a gift of ten dollar's worth of flowers for this school organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. H. Filip (the secretary) read a letter from the Mr. J. J. Jelinek who, because of the necessity of leaving for Omaha, Nebraska, was unable to attend this meeting. In this letter Mr. Jelinek made a request to cancel a bill of ten dollars for flowers ordered by the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of [Bohemian] Freethinkers) on the occasion of a mass meeting of Bohemian freethinkers on July 2, 1922....This bill was therefore cancelled and the flowers considered a gift [by the Sbor].</p>
   <p>Mr. Smejkal, reporting for the board of directors, announced that the receipts of the flower department of the cemetery for the past month totaled $1,860.25; the <span class="page-break">\5</span>disbursements made by that department were $417.25. The board [of directors]also collected $2,637 in bond interest, etc. According to information received from Mr. Jan Pecha, president of the Sbor, it will be impossible for him to take part in the annual inspection of the cemetery which is to be held on September 10, 1922, a date on which he will still be absent from Chicago. In view of this fact, and to accede to the wishes of the president, the [proposed] inspection was postponed until September 17. At this juncture arrangements were also made concerning refreshments, etc. [a buffet lunch], which is customary on such occasions. The board of directors also reported that, due to an increased amount of work, it was unable to settle the matter of a pumping station for the cemetery, and that all the details connected with it will necessarily have to be postponed until the next meeting. The purchase and installation of a new boiler for the heating plant was referred to the same board. Three bids for this job reached the offices of the Sbor and were read in this meeting: One from Mr. John Mracek whose bid was for $420; another from Mr. Josef Babka whose price for the job was $695; and the last from the Rozner Boiler Works which quotes the price of $550.</p>

This news was gratefully received. [Here follow the names of persons who had the deeds for their cemetery lots transferred to other persons.
