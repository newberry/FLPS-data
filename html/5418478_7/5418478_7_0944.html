   <p>There were no deaths during this year, and three new members were initiated. Altogether there are 479 members. There are 12 members who have, their cremation dues paid in full; 72 members who pay their cremation dues on time; 44 contributing members of good standing. The other 351 members are in arrears with their dues. Apparently, negligence is the reason for this situation. This negligence can be found right in the ranks of those 351 members. In the first place, every member should furnish the secretary with his correct address. Much time could then be saved, and everybody would receive his statement in time. Secondly, everyone of our meetings is advertised in our Bohemian Free Thought newspapers a week before the meeting is held, so that nobody can say, "I do not know when the meetings are held." But mainly, every member should remember the time when our meetings are held, because he is paying for himself only. No member should let it go so far that he is suspended.</p>
