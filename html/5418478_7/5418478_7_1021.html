   <p>Once a year, usually on a Sunday, the representatives of the societies and associations which maintain the Bohemian National Cemetery, inspect the premises where our dead are laid to rest. These inspections show the improvements made, and we are not surprised that Mr. L. Tuma, the manager, the executive committee, and its chairman decided to make a change this year and shift the date of the inspection until sometime during the summer. They took into consideration the fact that at this time, the cemetery grounds are especially beautiful. The inspection was, therefore, held yesterday. </p>
   <p>At ten o'clock in the morning, fifty-two representatives of the organizations which maintain the cemetery, assembled at the main gate. They represented about three-quarters of the plenum, and they began, therefore, to inspect the grounds. Their first steps led them to the offices, where they lingered only a short time, and went on, with Mr. John Pecha, chairman of the executive committee, at their head, the members, and cemetery manager, Mr. Tuma, and Mr. Bastyr, cemetery gardener, following. The latter presented each person in the party with red and white carnations.</p>
   <p>The visitors paid special attention to the hothouses, which were not a particularly pleasant place to linger on a hot day. The cemetery tools were carefully examined, the necessary information being supplied by the guides. After a leisurely but instructive stroll through the crematory, the party was treated to some refreshments in the form of so-called soft drinks. A short meeting was held in the small hall of the crematory, during which Mr. Pecha pointed out that last year the number of delegates still alive equaled the number of those dead. This year the number of delegates still in action was decreased by the death of four worthy members.</p>
   <p>The party was informed that the grave of each departed delegate had been decorated with an American flag. As they walked through the cemetery, the members of the inspecting party paused at those graves, and remembered the dead.....Since it was getting late, the party went on to Mr. Bezvoda, where dinner was served and a few speeches were made.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Kriz reminded the delegates of the Czech Old People's Home and Orphan Asylum which was located nearby. A collection made for the benefit of that institution yielded $17.23.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Klaus informed the delegates that the Cemetery's property has increased by $59,478.78 in the past six months, so that the total is $863,327.13. This proves conclusively that the business of the Cemetery is conducted on thoroughly sound principles. The appeal of the Old People's Home and Orphan Asylum for assistance so that it can meet its financial obligations, was given due consideration.</p>
