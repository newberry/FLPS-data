   <p>The moment the Catholic circles of Czechoslovakia learned about the projected expedition of our Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Association of Bohemian Catholics of America) they began arranging extensive activities preparatory to our arrival there. At the same time they appealed to the Svaz asking us to form a third delegation which would continue the Catholic action so successfully begun by the previous ones. In the old homeland an action has been started to separate the church from the state, and to that end members of all political parties of Czechoslovakia contribute by their suggestions and propositions. Various delegates have been sent to Czechoslovakia to prepare the ground. The Council of Czechoslovak Catholics, located in Prague, has emphatically asked the Svaz to send another delegation which, by means of lectures and counsels, would aid the Catholic people of Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>For nearly four months the Svaz has been receiving letters from Catholic dignitaries of Czechoslovakia asking us to decide to form this third delegation <span class="page-break">\2</span>so that the work, which was so fruitfully begun by our first and second ones, could be continued on the soil of the Republic.</p>
   <p>The Svaz deliberated over this matter, and, as a result of the appeals sent us, decided to send a delegation to Czechoslovakia in full knowledge that the work awaiting us there will be difficult. The delegation, which will consist of four members, will leave together with our expedition on May 13, 1922 from New York on the steamship "Rotterdam". The Members of the delegation are experienced workers of the Czech Catholics. They are well known to us, and are the following: Reverend Josef Janecek, parish priest of the Saint John of Nepomuk Parish of Detroit, Michigan; Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, chaplain of the Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius Parish of Chicago, Illinois; Messrs. Jan Straka and Frantisek Sindelar the last named being the former office manager of the Cleveland branch of the Svaz.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that the Bohemian Catholics of America will welcome this decision of the Svaz and the formation of this third delegation.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>They are all men who will tackle the work imposed on them with a great tenacity of purpose and perform the important work which awaits them in Czechoslovakia. The successes which the third delegation will be able to gain at a time so difficult for all Czech Catholics, will go to the credit of our Svaz, and will be an additional proof that the Bohemian Catholics of America are able to make any kind of sacrifice when the problem of strengthening the rights of Catholicism, which is the birthright of all Catholic people in the Republic of Czechoslovakia, confronts them.</p>
