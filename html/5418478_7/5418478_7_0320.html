   <p>Tel. Jed. Sokol (Gymnastic Union Sokol) and Svob. Obec (Republic) arranged a joint celebration in memorial of the unfortunate battle of White Mountain, last Saturday. Although it rained all day and the evening was equally unfavorable, the public arrived at the hall in sufficient numbers, and the celebration itself was very dignified. It was especially pleasing that our young people were in attendance in such numbers; this circumstance proves, that the White Mountain Tortures Memorial has become a praiseworthy custom with us, that our people remember the sad defeats as well as the glorious deeds of our ancestors and value their memory.</p>
   <p>Music for the occasion was furnished by Kalec's band. There were several speakers. Later, by means of a slide-lantern, various scends and portraits of Bohemian leaders of the Husite period, were shown.</p>
