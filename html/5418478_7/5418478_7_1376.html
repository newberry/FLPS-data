   <p>Extensive preparations are being made by residents of Homan Avenue between 24th and 26th Streets for a great celebration, the raising of a Service Flag on which the number of stars symbolizes the number of men of the neighborhood serving under Uncle Sam's banner for world democracy.</p>
   <p>The ceremony proper will take place Sunday next at 2:30 P.M., at Homan Avenue and 25th Street. We are sure that the neighborhood, and indeed our entire community, will take a most active part in the event.</p>
   <p>The cost of the flag was defrayed by parents whose sons are in service, and by contributions from other residents of the neighborhood. The collections were made by Mrs. Nilada Konopasek, Miss Ricker, and Miss Korinek,who also took care of the purchasing of the flag.</p>
