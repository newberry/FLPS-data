   <p>The enemies of "foreigners" in America maintain that immigration laws are a legitimate and necessary barrier to the influx of non-American people flooding this country. One thing, however, is certain: The laws are inhumane and in direct opposition to the principles propounded by president Wilson in his notes to Germany in which he said: "Humaneness above everything else".</p>
   <p>Some time ago the Eastern newspapers discussed the case of one Nathan Cohen, thirty-five years old and insane, who for some time had been transported from one port to another because no country would permit him to land. Finally he landed on Ellis Island and has not been heard of since. Cohen, we hear, immigrated from Russia to Brazil and thence to the United States in 1912. About a year later he became insane and, in accordance with the humanitarian laws of the United States, was sent back to South America. But Brazil would not have him because he had lived in that country only a short time and he belonged to Russia. But Russia would not have him, either, so he travelled back to New York. He was sent back to Brazil with the assurance that his relatives would take care of him there. But Brazilian authorities again refused him admittance and the unfortunate man was returned to New York.</p>
   <p>Of course, the immigration officials cannot be blamed for this cruelty. All they do is execute the law. The blame rests with the Congressmen who pass laws permitting, or necessitating such inhumane treatment. But it is really not cruelty or inhumaneness that Congress is guilty of; it is rather a lack of order, a carelessness. Laws are passed carelessly, nobody thinks them through, nobody cares what will happen when they are enforced to the letter. Laws should be worded so as to allow a certain leeway for such unforseen instances as the above-mentioned case. "Humaneness above everything else," has said our President to the Germans. Therefore, why should it not apply to the immigration law?</p>
