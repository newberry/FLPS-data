   <p>The third and last day of the third general convention of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) was an unusually busy one. The work of the convention went on uninterruptedly, except for the midday hour, until late at night. All the problems which occupied the minds of the delegates were discussed. The sessions were characterized by several lively debates, which did not lack in interest. These concerned chiefly the resolutions and the constitution and bylaws, and the deliberations concerning the passage of this or another section or paragraph often led to a protracted and tiresome debate, which became stormy on occasion. Always there intervened, however, the calm voices of diplomacy, which, stressing the necessity of co-operation, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>succeeded in quieting down the storms of words, so that deliberations could proceed in an orderly fashion.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the launching of the morning session, the audits committee submitted its report through its chairman, who announced that his committee found all the books of the Svaz in excellent order and complimented the officers who had charge of them. On a motion made by Dr. Lorenz of Chicago, a vote of confidence was given to all the officers of the Svaz; this vote thus approved their activities between the second and the third general conventions.....</p>
   <p>This was followed by the report of the committee on the constitution and bylaws.....The chairman of that committee stated that the charter of the Svaz needs to be changed, and supported his statement by pointing out that the charter was published by and for a revolutionary organization, and that at present it does not fit the work of the Svaz, the present mission of which differs from its revolutionary activities [of the war period]. The activities of the Svaz will from now on be confined to purely cultural pursuits; it is necessary, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>therefore, to change the charter.</p>
   <p>The chairman thereupon made a number of recommendations as to changes to be made in certain articles of the constitution. These changes were to simplify the entire organizational work of the Svaz, and since these technical details would only bore our readers we shall omit them here altogether. One question, concerning the founding of new parishes, was briefly debated, and was ultimately defeated. Later, when the same committee reintroduced the same question in a new form, it was unanimously approved. Its new form, which satisfied the opposing sides, was as follows: "Wherever and whenever possible parochial branches of the Svaz should be organized; where it is found impossible to organize such branches, however, matters should be allowed to stand as in the past."</p>
   <p>Since the committee on complaints had no report to make, not having received any complaints, the financial committee was asked to present its report. Miss Kesner, as chairwoman of that committee, announced that all the bills, totaling $1,100, were in order; these, consequently, were ordered paid.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The report of the resolutions committee followed. Its chairman, the Very Reverend Prokop Neuzil, O. S. B., recommended that a telegram of greeting be sent to the Holy Father. This was unanimously approved, as was also the sending of a similar telegram to Mr. Warren Harding, President of the United States. But when a recommendation was made that Mr. T. G. Masaryk, President of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, be similarly remembered, a storm of protest broke out. Among the loudest protests were those voiced by several priests, who maintained that they were not at all enthusiastic about the person of Mr. Masaryk. In the stormy debate which followed, this matter was finally put to a vote. The vote, which may be considered significant, was as follows: For the sending of a telegram of greetings to President Masaryk there were twenty-four ayes; against it there were twenty-one noes. The telegram was therefore sent.</p>
   <p>The good activity of the St. Cyrill and St. Methodius apostolate was reported to the convention, which recommended its support. The resolution on the Bohemian college at Rome met opposition. It was chiefly the Milwaukee delegate who did not wish to sanction the rebuilding and equipping of that seminary <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>at Rome, claiming that its expenses will be considerable. He had good reasons for not wishing to approve [this responsibility]. His views were as follows: It is well known that Czechoslovakia for its self-protection entered into a treaty of alliance with Yugoslavia. In case of war between Yugoslavia and Italy--and the speaker claimed that this possibility is near at hand--the latter country, though illegally, would confiscate the property of the Bohemian college at Rome. After the war, to repossess that property an enormous sum of money would have to be paid to the Italian government.</p>
   <p>During the course of a debate which followed, and in which it was pointed out that the Bohemian college in Rome is not the property of the Czechoslovak Republic but of the Bohemian bishops, the Chicago archbishop, George W. Mundelein, entered the convention hall; this important matter had to be postponed therefore.</p>
   <p>The church dignitary was welcomed in the name of the Svaz by the Reverend Father Jedlicka who, in choice and fluent English, expressed his great pleasure and that of all the members of the convention at this visit. After the formalities of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>introducing the officers of the convention were completed a group photograph was taken with the archbishop in its center. This was followed by an address by the archbishop himself. With a smiling face he thanked all the members of the convention for the welcome accorded him, stating in his introductory remarks that he is well acquainted with our countrymen, and particularly with the Bohemian Catholics. He claimed to be well acquainted with our conditions, both here and abroad, and expressed his pleasure at being given an opportunity to attend and address such an important organization as the Svaz, assembled in its convention. According to his Grace, the credit for the assimilation of our people into the life of America goes--erroneously--to other factors, but he knows that it belongs chiefly to our Bohemian priests, who really deserve both the credit and praise for the work which they are doing for our people.</p>
   <p>Sincere applause greeted the concluding remarks of the archbishop who, after blessing the convention, left the hall. After his departure the problem of the Bohemian college at Rome was reintroduced. The support to be given to that institution was finally approved. One resolution recommended that the Svaz pay at least one half <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of the expenses of two itinerant instructors, who would visit parishes and care for the revival of the numerous local groups of the Jednota Katolickeho Sokola (Union of Catholic Sokols), and could thus spend at least two years staying at least two months in each such parish, where they would give instruction to the Sokols and to the young people....Consideration of this resolution was deferred until the youth problem should have come up for discussion. This ended the morning session and it was time to adjourn for the noonday meal.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session began shortly after 2 P.M. The following resolutions were presented and quickly disposed of: (1) on the selection of two Serbian-American writers (women) who would be willing to serve the interests of the Svaz by publishing in the large American dailies certain informative articles about the violent attacks made by the Hungarian press upon the Czechs; (2) on the question of increasing the circulation of the organ Hlidka (Sentinel), the present circulation of which is about four thousand copies, the running expenses of the publication being about five hundred dollars per issue; (3) on the enfranchisement of women and their right to vote; that is, that that right ought to be <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>more exercised; (4) a resolution dealing with the Bohemian-American women who express their sympathy for the women of the old homeland who are still being exploited by the males, and for whom hope was expressed that they would soon attain to the high social position which the women of America enjoy; (5) on the projected collection to be made for the benefit of the needy Czechoslovak legionnaires.</p>
   <p>A resolution was also read dealing with the dissatisfaction felt by all the members of the convention because of the manner in which some Bohemian Free Thought periodicals attacked Mr. Jan Straka, president of the Svaz, the article published by the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) coming up for particular discussion. Mr. Straka explained the situation as follows: While on a trip through Bohemia he often lectured, and while lecturing it was his chief concern to tell the truth. He seemed to have caused some displeasure by stating publicly that the [Bohemian] Catholics used the term "republic" in their [organizational] work earlier than the [Bohemian] Freethinkers. And that is the truth. He recalled the meeting of May 16, 1917, in which the Bohemian Catholics <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>used this term. It is said that Vojta Benes and his party had then in their minds some kind of a monarchical form of government with possibly an English duke as its head. In the meeting just mentioned it was Hynek Dostal, a representative of the [Bohemian] Catholics, who wrote the agreement between the Catholics and the Freethinkers concerning their co-operation, and who was the first one to use the words "ceska republika" (Czech republic). The Freethinkers are said to have smiled at this, continuing to dream about a "Kingdom of Bohemia". Mr. Straka further explained that his speeches in Bohemia were distorted by various tendentious newspapers, and that these distorted versions were the ones which reached America. He was threatened in some of the newspapers with arraignment before some kind of a "people's court". Well, he is here and is ready and willing publicly to defend himself.</p>
   <p>This declaration made by Mr. Straka called forth great applause, and the resolution was tabled. Mr. Straka was then given a unanimous vote of confidence.</p>
   <p>The committee on the constitution and bylaws then recommended to this convention <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>the election of nine trustees who would, from their own number, elect the chief officers of the Svaz. This was carried unanimously. A resolution was accepted which provided that no gifts or support to be sent abroad might exceed ten per cent of the membership dues; the balance of ninety per cent must be used only for America.</p>
   <p>A stormy discussion followed the introduction of the problem of our youth and how to salvage it, the young being our only hope in this country. The problem was debated for a long time but it was finally agreed that all Catholic scouts as well as all the [Catholic] cadets and Catholic Sokols should combine into one organization, at least as regards some [common] points [of interest] and, thus united, should work for the common good of our young generation. Permission was granted to use three thousand dollars for this purpose, and the plan itself was unanimously approved by the delegates.</p>
   <p>Among the other items which came up for discussion, the difficulties encountered by Americans leaving Czechoslovakia and travelling through Europe were also <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>touched upon. It seems that Americans face all kinds of difficulties when travelling in Europe. The speakers who mentioned this fact were Messrs. Sindelar and Straka. It was decided that certain of these irregularities shall be brought to the attention of the United States Government.</p>
   <p>The next convention is to be held in June, 1924, and the convention city is again to be Chicago. The precise date [of the next convention] will be published later.....</p>
   <p>The salaries of officers of the Svaz were fixed as follows: The president, secretary, treasurer, and chaplain of the central office shall receive one hundred dollars each per year. The trustees and the vice-president shall receive twenty-five dollars annually.</p>
   <p>A nominating committee was elected, consisting of the following delegates: The Reverend Father Hroch, Mrs. Tuchacek, Dr. Lorenz, the Reverend Father Mikolasek, and Mrs. Kavan.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>The following were nominated as trustees: The Reverend Father Jedlicka, Mr. J. Straka, Mr. Josef Kopecky, Mrs. Rosalie Nedved, Dr. Lorenz, Mr. Josef Janda, Mrs. Novotny, Mrs. Vaclav Radous, and Mrs. Antonie Vondracek. The above have from among their own number elected the following as the future officers of the Svaz: Mr. J. Straka, president; Mr. A. V. Tesar, secretary; Mr. Josef Kopecky, treasurer; the Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, chaplain; Mrs. Rosalie Nedved, vice-president. The oath of office was taken by each new officer and administered by the Very Reverend Prokop Neuzil, O.S.B. Also the following were elected as honorary vice-presidents: Mr. Josef Masek for Cleveland, Ohio; Mr. Hynek Dostal for the Southwestern United States; the Reverend Vaclav Jelinek for Omaha, Nebraska; and Mrs. Jurka for Texas. Thereupon the convention was declared ended and the national anthem,"Kde domov muj" (Where is my home), was sung.</p>
