   <p>The board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) held its regular monthly meeting yesterday.....</p>
   <p>Finally the report of the crematorium building committee was read. This report disclosed the fact that the committee accepted the bid of the Olson and Nelson Company for stone work. This firm's offer amounted to $15,475 and was some $6,000 lower than the second lowest bid. This situation caused the committee to make a careful investigation of the firm and draw a binding contract with a guarantee.</p>
   <p>The brick work was contracted for with the Bohemian firm of Jos. Rus and Son for $8,598. Here also there was a considerable difference between the lowest and the second lowest bid--almost $4,000. The least difference was found among the bids for the hardware. The bid of $9,795 of the firm of Cerny Pikas <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and Company was accepted in preferance to one which was only $105 higher. A member of the committee then read the text of the contract with Mr. Randak, the committee's architect. An amendment was added to the contract to the effect that the crematorium must be finished by November 1, 1914......</p>
   <p>Income and expenditure reported in the meeting: $5,222.15 and $4,412.34 respectively.</p>
