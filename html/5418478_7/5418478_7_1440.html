   <p>Doctor Jaroslav F. Smetanka, secretary of the English language department of the Czech National Alliance, and member of the joint Military Committee of the Alliance and Czech Sokol community, received the following letter from Captain F. R. Kenney, United States Army, chief recruiting officer for the district of Chicago:</p>
   <p>Dear Doctor Smetanka:</p>
   <p>I beg to convey the thanks of the War Department for the remarkable results of the endeavor of the Czech National Alliance, Czech Sokols [gymnastic societies] and all the Czech-American citizens; their efforts manifested themselves in the enlistments of your sons for military service. The answer of your people to my call for enlistment in the Army was most satisfying. I am glad to testify that no stratum of the population here has responded voluntarily <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as the Czech-Americans have to the appeal.</p>
   <p>Permit me to entreat you in the name of the Government to proceed in your patriotic work by inducing men to offer their services to the Army which constitutes the backbone of our defense, and is the highest institute of military training of the nation.</p>
   <p>Your country is calling on you now.</p>
   <p>F. R. Kenney,</p>
   <p>Captain United States Army,</p>
   <p>District Commander.</p>
