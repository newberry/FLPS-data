   <p>We are in receipt of news from Jefferson Barracks where the first contingent of Czech recruits went last Monday. They were examined by Army surgeons, and we are glad to report that they were found to be in perfect form. They are boys who have been trained in our Sokol gymnastic societies, and it is a foregone conclusion that they will represent themselves in the first ranks of the United States Army. Many recruits from other nationalities were rejected in Chicago at the first examination, and others at the second in Jefferson Barracks. The Czech Legion can point to only a small percent of rejections at the first examination in Chicago, and none at Jefferson Barracks. The news of the latter good record was sent to us by Mr. Jos. Vavra, who at the same time thanked us in the name of his comrades for the copies of the Denni Hlasatel which help to keep the volunteers in partial contact with Chicago.</p>
