   <p>The Damsky Odbor Plzenskeho Sokola (Sokol Pilsen Ladies' Auxiliary), well-aware of the duties of the Bohemian people both to their old homeland and to their chosen new homeland, arranged a splendid celebration of George Washington's birthday in the Pilsen Sokol hall last night. There was a rich musical program, a number of dance exhibitions, and several short addresses. The principal part of the program was given to a speech presented by Judge John C. Karel of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who spoke in English. Starting with an analogy between America's struggle for freedom in pre-Washingtonian days and the present efforts of Bohemian people for liberation from Austrian domination, he continued with a tribute to Washington's mother, enlarging upon the great merits of all good and worthy mothers. He then eulogized women in general as mothers, sweethearts, and wives, stressing their influence on the life of a nation. The second part of the speech was devoted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the person of George Washington, ending in an appeal to the Bohemian people always to keep George Washington in their memory.</p>
