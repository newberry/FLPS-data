   <p>The fourteenth annual convention of the Czechoslovak Baptist Young People's Union of America was held in the Slovak Baptist Church in Chicago, Ill., on Saturday, June 26, 1937.</p>
   <p>The convention activities started with the singing of songs and choruses under the leadership of Mr. Clifton Gregory of Cleveland; Miss Ann Fatula read the 100th Psalm; and Mr. Michael Stancik, National B.Y.P.U. president, prayed.</p>
   <p>Reports from the Central, Western and Northern Districts were given by Clifton Gregory, Leslie Nechvatal and Dan E. Lasky, respectively.</p>
   <p>A general discussion of dues followed. A motion was passed that letters be sent out to those societies which are delinquent in paying their dues, asking them to pay their dues or give reasons for not having paid them. From <span class="page-break">2</span>these letters it will be possible to determine the wishes of these societies.</p>

   <p>A letter from the Bohemian Baptist Church of Goodrich, Wis., extending greetings to the convention and describing the progress of the Lord's work being done there, was read.
