   <p>On October 28, the anniversary of Bohemian independence for which the Bohemian-American Freethinkers put forth their best efforts, a collection of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych (National Tax of Freethinkers) will begin, according to the resolution of the last Bohemian Freethinkers' convention.</p>
   <p>At the next meeting of the executive committee of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers which will be held Tuesday, September 14, a detailed plan of preliminary arrangements will be approved. As a matter of principle, this Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych must not be thought of as a payment of alms or charity, but a voluntary registration of all Bohemians of America, adherents of Free Thought. Therefore, every Bohemian-American Freethinker should send an amount in proportion to his financial standing as a voluntary registration fee for himself and his family, and he should not wait until the time when the committee calls on him. All the amounts collected will be published in our journal, the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), where everyone will see his <span class="page-break">\2</span>name. It was agreed that this system would be the best. To publish these statements in daily and weekly newspapers, under the present circumstances in the printing trade, would only spell trouble for our newspapers. A typographer could easily miss one line of the statement and such a mistake would cause a misunderstanding. But if the statements are published in the Vek Rozumu, the editor will see to it that these statements are correct. The Free Thought newspapers will be asked only to support this Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych by publishing the appeals and instructions.</p>
   <p>By introducing the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych, the last convention of Bohemian Freethinkers has accomplished something for the Free Thought movement of America which has always been neglected by conventions in the past and that is to give our movement a chance for proper growth. Money is needed to carry on the cultural work. We must publish expensive books and pamphlets; we must awaken interest in lectures; we must strengthen our Free Thought organization; we must build Free Thought institutions; we must support the Free Thought schools. To do all this, we must have money. To obtain the money by beggary and by similar <span class="page-break">\3</span>methods is a disgrace to the Bohemian Free Thought movement of America which is already seventy years old. The adherents of the Free Thought movement should help to make this work possible by a voluntary tax which will be collected only once a year.</p>
   <p>Well, we shall see! This first Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych will be an acid test of sincerity and enlightenment of the Bohemian-American Freethinkers.</p>
   <p>For the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America,</p>
   <p>V. K. Soukup, Secretary.</p>
