   <p>Saturday, July 7, the memory of Jan Hus was solemnly celebrated in the Pilzen Sokol Hall. As a start there was shown a dramatic play by J. Kaj. Tyl, entitled "Jan Hus" presented very successfully. The main characters were in the hands of experienced ameteurs: Sophie, wife of King Vaclav IV, was played by Mrs. H. Stejskal; the part of Marketa, Hus' mother, was presented by Mrs. M. Vaskova; Jan Hus by F. B. Zdrubek; Jan Zizka by A. Pregler; Petro Angelo, Cardinal and Pope's delegate, was played by Jos. Zak. All these amateurs were well-known as dramatically experienced.</p>
   <p>Strange as it may seem, the editors of Svornost were partaking in the play and each was very busy with the interpretation of his part in the drama - as Zikmund, the German Emperor; the Roman Catholic Pope, Jan XXIII, the Archbishop of Praha, and consequently, all our editors condemned Jan Hus, portrayed by the chief editor, F. B. Zdrubek.</p>
   <p>It is so impossible for us to give the correct details or the real criticism of the play because every one of the editors was so absorbed with his own <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>part that is was simply impossible for him to observe critically the interpretation of other actors and it is not our wish to praise ourselves. The hall was over-filled. All intelligent Bohemians were present; we don't know what had attracted the public more - the drama or the editors of Svornost.</p>
   <p>The second part of the celebration, the dance, finished late in the night, will be remembered for a long time by the countrymen.</p>
