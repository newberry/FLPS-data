   <p>The second convention of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) was called to order in Chicago yesterday with a somewhat altered program from that which was originally set forth. The convention was called to order in the morning, although the original time was set for 2 P.M. This happened because the High Mass which preceded was concluded much sooner than had been expected. The High Mass was attended by numerous clergymen and all of the delegates who came to participate in the convention. The Right Reverend Valentin Kohlbeck, abbot of the Saint Procopius Abbey in Lisle, Illinois, was the celebrant, and he was assisted by Reverend Mikulasek, Reverend Liska, and Reverend Cerveny of Cleveland, Ohio. Reverend Frantisek W. Jedlicka was the preacher.</p>

   <p>Immediately after the High Mass all the officers and delegates went to the Bohemian-American Hall where the convention was called to order. Reverend F. W. Jedlicka offered a prayer, and Mr. Jan Straka welcomed the delegates with a brief speech. The manager of the Alliance headquarters, Mr. Antonin V. Tesar, read the names of the officers. Then the committee on credentials was appointed. Mr. Frank H. Bicek was appointed president, and Mr. K. Dvorak and Mrs. Anna Bicek were named members of the said committee. Mr. Hynek Dostal, editor of the Hlas (Voice) of St. Louis, Missouri, and member of the second mission which was sent to Czechoslovakia by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe, then related his experiences. Soon afterward the session was adjourned and most of those present went to the Palace Inn for lunch.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was called to order by the chairman at 2 P.M. He requested the committee on credentials to read the names of the delegates. The report showed that 14 officers and 72 delegates were present. [There follows the list of delegates].</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Mr. Antonin F. Tesar and Mr. Joseph Kopecky were elected secretaries of the convention. The chairman, Jan Straka, who was authorized to appoint members of various committees, then read the names of delegates whom he appointed:</p>
   <p>The constitution and bylaws committee: Dr. M. E. Lorenz, chairman; Reverend K. Dvorak, Mr. Frank Pintner, Mr. Karel Prochazka, Mr. Frank H. Bicek, Mrs. Marie Hynek, and Mrs. Marie Yurka. The grievance committee: Mr. Pavel Pastyr, chairman; Mr. Joseph Kratochvil and Mrs. Anna Sevcik. The resolutions committee: Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, chairman; Reverend V. F. Mikolasek, Mr. V. F. Jelinek, Mr. A. J. Kallus, and Mrs. Karolina Tuhacek. The finance committee: Mr. J. L. Masek, chairman; Mr. J. Kesner, Mr. J. L. Kapoun, Mrs. Terezie Nouza, and Mrs. A. Holub. The press and publicity committee: Mr. Frantisek Sindelar, chairman; Mr. Hynek Dostal and Mr. V. B. Havel. The committee on petitions: Reverend Leo Steffl, chairman; Mr. F. J. Fencl, and Mrs. Alzbeta Souhrada. All the appointments were unanimously approved.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Jan Straka, then read his own report and message, at the conclusion <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of which he made a few remarkable recommendations. His speech was rewarded by noisy applause. The report was approved as read. Also approved was the report of the secretary, Jan Vohler. The report of Mr. Frantisek Sindelar, former manager of the Alliance headquarters, was very interesting; he is far better posted on the activities and office routine of the Alliance headquarters than either of the two men who succeeded him. His report showed that he managed the headquarters' office until November 15, 1919, when he was succeeded by Mr. A. Rezek. Mr. A. Rezek was recently succeeded by Mr. Antonin V. Tesar of Halletsville, Texas, who just returned from Czechoslovakia and who now resides in Chicago. In his report Mr. Frantisek Sindlar, who is now editor of the American (American), a Bohemian daily newspaper in Cleveland, Ohio, mentioned first the reorganization of the National Alliance and the Alliance headquarters. The last meeting of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku executive committee was held March 7, 1919. On that day the officers who were elected at the plenary <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>conference were installed. The old executive committee was authorized to take care of the subordinate foreign department as per decision of the plenary conference. The sum of $5,000 was transferred into the treasury of the new National Alliance, and the rest of the money was transferred to the "Zahranicni Odbor Narodniho Svazu Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (Foreign Department of the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America). The aid activities were taken care of by the new executive committee, and the political activities will be taken care of by the foreign department. The new officers immediately commenced to work on problems, especially that of organization, which was the greatest and most difficult. This work was very extensive and should now be accomplished by the convention.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sindelar then made a general report on the struggle against adverse bills which advocated the exclusion of the Bohemian language from Bohemian Catholic parochial schools, institutions, and societies. Luckily the adverse actions were stopped in time and were suppressed. Mr. Sindelar further reported on the Catholic missions. He stated that at the time of the plenary conference session, the first mission of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe to <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Czechoslovakia left New York. Monsignor E. A. Bouska of Tabor, South Dakota, Reverend Oldrich Zlamal of Cleveland, Ohio, and Mr. Frank G. Hajicek of Chicago, Illinois, were members of this mission.....</p>
   <p>Finally Mr. Sindelar reported on the aid activities as follows:</p>
   <p>"The aid activities which the new National Alliance inherited from the old one are not fully accomplished as yet, although it has been more than a year since they were begun. The participation of our National Alliance in this activity may not have been the largest, but certainly it was not the smallest. The colection undertaken for the benefit of widows and orphans in Czechoslovakia was not as large as had been expected, because during the past three years the resources of our people have been exhausted. Besides that, many of our people have sent boxes of the most needed provisions directly to their relatives in the old country, the value of which has reached the total of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our National Alliance supported this direct aid not only morally but also materially. The aid activities were inaugurated by our National <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Alliance with a gift of $18,350 to the Czechoslovak Red Cross.....</p>
   <p>"Our National Alliance contributed the sum of $10,000 which the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America) distributed among the legionnaires of the Czechoslovak army in France who were returning home ragged and penniless.....</p>
   <p>"The total amount contributed by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe toward the aid activities is the sum of $90,000....."</p>
   <p>In concluding his report Mr. Sindelar mentioned the various small contributions of the National Alliance which are impossible to trace or to record. He expressed the hope and is convinced that, in the future, the National Alliance will broaden its activities not only in the interest of the Catholic people in the United States, but also in the interest of all Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>Then the financial report of Mr. Joseph Kopecky, who was not present, was read.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The report, which the auditing committee found to be correct, reveals the generosity of our Bohemian Catholic people of the United States. The reports of the treasurer and the auditing committee were read and approved.</p>
   <p>The chairman then requested the delegates to present reports of their respective district and parish alliances. Most of the reports voiced the assurance that the respective organizations are willing to co-operate to the best of their abilities with the National Alliance, and that the good and meritorious work of this organization is fully recognized....</p>
   <p>The second session was adjourned at 6 P.M.</p>
   <p>Denni Hlasatel, June 3, 1920.</p>
   <p>Prior to the third session of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe, a requiem in honor of the deceased members was held, after which the session was called to order by Chairman Jan Straka at 9 A.M.....</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>The Reverend Frantisek W. Jedlicka then presented his report on the second mission to Czechoslovakia.....Reverend F. W. Jedlicka supplemented his report by a financial statement. He called attention to the gifts which the second mission presented to Pope Benedict XV, to President Thomas G. Masaryk, to Archbishop Kordac, and to various Catholic institutions and organizations. About 150 institutions and 25 families were remembered. A gift of 10,000 liras was given to the Pope; 100,000 Czechoslovak kronen to President Masaryk. The total amount distributed by the second mission represented the sum of 650,000 Czechoslovak kronen.....</p>
   <p>The Reverend Oldrich Zlamal then presented his report on the first mission to Czechoslovakia.....</p>
   <p>Then various departments of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe presented their reports. Reverend Oldrich Zlamal spoke for the department on religion. He referred to the work which was accomplished in the interest of the <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>aged priests in Czechoslovakia.....</p>
   <p>The fourth session was called to order by the chairman at 2 P.M. In this session various committees presented their reports.....</p>
   <p>Denni Hlasatel, June 4, 1920. </p>
   <p>The fifth session was called to order by the chairman at 9 A.M. Mr. Masek presented the report of the auditing committee, according to which the total assets of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe amount to $31,550.89. The books were audited and found to be correct. The report was approved. Reverend Dvorak then urged the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe to do something for the poor Bohemian parishes in the United States. In answer to his request, the chairman remarked that he had presented the same recommendation in his message and that this matter falls into the sphere of the department on religion. Dr. Lorenz advocated that the same department should <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>encourage the activities of the district and parish alliances by arranging series of lectures for social programs. The matter was referred to the resolutions committee for the preparation of a resolution. It was recommended that the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe co-operate with the Bohemian free thought organizations in all problems which fall under the jurisdiction of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America). Reverend F. W. Jedlicka advocated the publication of a new journal which would inform the parish alliances about the activities of the national and district alliances; about what is going on in Czechoslovakia; and one which would create a better and closer contact between the national and subordinate alliances. The idea was approved and the National Alliance was authorized to inform the subordinate alliances in the best possible way and as often as necessary. The chairman then recommended the publication of a new book similar to Tomas Capek's Czechs in America, because although this book is not anti-Catholic, it is not just, for it does not mention the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe at all. The matter was referred to the executive committee. Mr. Radous informed the delegates that the organization <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>of which he is the representative authorized Mr. Sindelar to write a book describing the activities of the Bohemian Catholics of America during the liberation period. Reverend Nekola recommended the publication because such a book is wanted in Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>The chairman then read a communication from the Narodni Sdruzeni Slovenskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Slovak Catholics of America). In this communication co-operation and aid were requested, because the organization was founded to promote the same principles among the Slovak people which the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe advocates among the Bohemians. Reverend Rehor Vaniscak spoke about this request and gave a more detailed explanation. The motion of Reverend Oldrich Zlamal to promote closer contacts with the Narodni Sdruzeni Slovenskych Katoliku v Americe in problems of religion and of morals was adopted. Questions of politics, especially questions concerning autonomy, should be set aside. Because of this decision the future executive committee will take the necessary measures.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Reverend O. Zlamal and Mr. Fr. Sindelar then demanded of the Narodni Sdruzeni Slovenskych Katoliku v Americe that discipline be introduced and enforced in its own ranks and especially among the various Slovak newspapers which grossly attacked the Bohemians a short time ago.</p>
   <p>Then the matter of the time and place of the next convention was discussed. Chicago, Illinois, and Omaha, Nebraska, were recommended, and the former location was selected. The next convention, according to the amended bylaws, will be held on the second Tuesday in June. The motion to adjust the bonds of the chairman and the secretary of the executive committee to $500 each and the bond of the treasurer to $5000 was adopted. The motion that these officers shall receive a compensation of $1 a year was adopted. Chicago was again selected as seat of the executive committee. Then the elections of the executive committee followed. Reverend Fr. W. Jedlicka was unanimously nominated and elected chaplain. The following delegates were unanimously nominated and elected as members of the executive committee; Mr. Jan Straka, chairman; Mr. J. L. Masek, first vice-chairman (Eastern groups);</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>Mr. V. F. Jelinek, second vice-chairman (Western groups); Mr. Hynek Dostal, third vice-chairman (Southwestern groups); Mr. Kopecky of Texas, fourth vice-chairman (Southern groups). Reverend Frantisek Bozenek and Mr. Jan Voller were nominated for the office of secretary. Mr. Voller waived the nomination and Reverend Bozenek was unanimously elected. Mr. J. Kopecky of Chicago was elected treasurer. Mr. J. J. Janda, Mr. Novotny, Mr. Kadlec, Mrs. Nedved, and Mrs. Novotny were elected trustees....</p>
   <p>Reverend Innocent Kestl, honorary chairman of the National Alliance, then received the pledges of the newly-elected officers.</p>
   <p>The chairman then thanked the Bohemian newspapers for publishing reports of the convention and also expressed his thanks to the delegates for their co-operation and enthusiastic work.</p>
   <p>The convention was adjourned about 1:30 P.M.</p>
