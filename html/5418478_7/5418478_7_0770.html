   <p>The local branch of the Town of Lake of the Sdruzeni Svazu Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers), to commemorate the first year of its existence, decided at its last meeting to give a party for our local settlement in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 48th and Honore Streets. All truly freethinking countrymen and individual organizations and clubs are asked to contribute to the success of the party. The local Sdruzeni did a good piece of work during the one year of its existence; lectures were given as well as theatrical performances, and a picnic for the pupils of the local Free Thought school. Remember, all of you, that success comes only with hard work.</p>
   <p>At the party there will be many attractions. There will be music and a dance. Bohemian gingerbread, pickles, ice cream will be served. Come, all of you who like to enjoy a real Bohemian party and at the same time to contribute to a good cause.</p>
