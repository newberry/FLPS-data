   <p>We are informed that Congressman A. J. Sabath succeeded in having a measure approved by the Committee for Immigration. He proposes a change in the immigration law so that alien soldiers who are fighting in Europe may be admitted to this country if they wish to return.</p>
   <p>A law was passed in February, 1917, which forbids the admission of persons who do not meet with certain requirements. The proposed change would authorize the admission of aliens who have spent some time in the United States and are now fighting against a power with which the United States is at war, provided they want to return within two years after the end of the war. They will be admitted even if disabled if they have served in any of the Allied Armies that fought the Central Powers. Should it become necessary to place them in an institution for care, the expenses will be defrayed from the funds of the immigration authorities.</p>
