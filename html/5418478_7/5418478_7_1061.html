   <p>Czechs of the Baptist faith met in their Church on 24th Street and Millard Avenue on the evening of April 12 to discuss the creation of a new branch of the Czech National Alliance. Mr. Vaclav Kralicek opened the meeting with a talk on the battle on the Bila Hora (White Mountain) as a result of which the Czech nation lost its independence. It was in the time of the Thirty Years' War. He dwelt on the exertions of Komensky and the Bohemian Brethren to help the Czechs regain their liberty through the Westphalian Peace Treaty. All this endeavor came to naught, and the Czechs were kept in subjugation not only by Austria, but by Germany as well.....</p>
   <p>In closing, the speaker voiced the hope that during this War all the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Czechs would form a united front, and that the Czech Baptists would not fail to do their bit.</p>
   <p>A lively conversation developed then concerning the methods to be applied in the creation of a new branch of the Czech National Alliance. At the close of the meeting fifty-four members of the church decided to form such a branch on the spot, and so they did. Mr. Kralicek was elected president. The organization's aim will be to collect money to propagate the cause of the Czech people.</p>
