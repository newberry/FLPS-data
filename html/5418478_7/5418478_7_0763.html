   <p>As is well known, the patronat [Svobomyslne Skoly] of the Frantisek Palacky (Free Thought School Frantisek Palacky) was to have a picnic on August 20, 1922....It has been decided, however, to cancel it because on the same Sunday the Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage) is to be held in Pilsen Park. The school management, after duly considering these facts, decided to cancel the proposed picnic at Lyons, Illinois, and hopes that our public will not object. All tickets, already purchased, may be returned to: Mr. Ludvik Svarc, 4113 West Grenshaw Street.</p>
   <p>For the patronat of the school</p>
   <p>Jan Musil, president;</p>
   <p>Ludvik Svarc, secretary.</p>
