The financial report, submitted by Mr. Joseph Jurka, showed a gross income of $33,033.50; $10,137.77 paid out; and $44,239.72 in the treasury. Seventy-eight workingmen are employed at the Cemetery at present.</p>
   <p>A letter from the Umelecky Klub (Artists' club) suggested that work on buildings and other structures for the Cemetery be given in competitive contract, for this will assure higher artistic standards.</p>
   <p>A motion to pay $25 for the Cemetery Association's life membership in the Red Cross was adopted. Routine business closed the session.</p>
