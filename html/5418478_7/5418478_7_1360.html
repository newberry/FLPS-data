   <p>Dr. J. Rudis Jicinsky, well-known Sokol and national worker, returned to Chicago yesterday, after spending almost nine months in Siberia. Well-known Bohemians greeted him at the Northwestern station. He wore the uniform of a captain of the American Red Cross when he arrived.</p>
   <p>He looks well, after all the trying experiences of his profession, working with the American Red Cross. He was active first in the Russian army, then with the Czechoslovakian army, and finally with the American Expeditionary Forces, and reports that he is well satisfied with the work accomplished.</p>
   <p>While in Vladivostok, he was asked if he preferred to go to the newly created Czechoslovakia, or with the American transport to the United States. Knowing that the legionnaires of the Czechoslovakian army are very anxious to go home, he decided to go to the United States. He knows very well that it will depend on the United States as to how soon the legionnaires will go home, because this all important matter is to be financed by the United States.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jicinsky wishes to be active in the future, and in order to speed up the negotiations, he asks our representatives in Congress, who admire our Czechoslovak legionnaires, to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
   <p>He said very little about himself. After a short rest to recover his strength, he is very anxious to start on the above-mentioned task.</p>
