   <p>Perhaps never before has such importance been ascribed to American citizenship as in these times of European war, and never before have we received more inquiries as to the rights and privileges of American citizenship from countrymen who would like to return to the old country and do not know whether they are subject to military duty.</p>
   <p>Many people have erroneous ideas in this respect, and some of them think that the possession of citizenship papers--second papers, as they are frequently called--is an absolute guarantee of safety in every respect. Such confidence may easily lead to trouble, as was shown in the case of a countryman who was arrested in Bohemia because of something he had said in this time of war.</p>
   <p>The principal mistake of many people is that they do not know that American citizenship itself affords no protection whatever to anybody, and that any protection an American citizen may be entitled to is based on mutual treaties that our country may have closed with another country.</p>
   
   <p>Accordingly, the protection which his citizenship gives to an American varies greatly from one country to another; in some places it is greater than in others, depending on the provisions of such treaties. There is only one thing in which there is no difference whatever: No country recognizes the first papers, that is, the declaration of intention to become an American citizen. The possession of these papers does not free a man from military duty in his country, or from any other obligation, and does not give him any privileges whatever. That, of course, is only natural, because the first papers are not equivalent to citizenship. It may seem less logical that full American citizenship does not mean the same thing the world over, but it is a fact. Each European country has reserved for itself by treaty certain rights toward its former citizens or subjects, and these rights must be respected both by the United States and United States citizens.</p>
   <p>In these times, the treaty dealing with military duty is of greatest interest to us, because it determines the relationship between an American citizen of Bohemian origin with the government of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.</p>
   
   <p>There has been in existence for many years a treaty between the United States and Austria by which the Austrian government recognizes as an American citizen a man who has lived in the United States at least five years and has obtained his citizenship--second papers--in a lawful way. In regard to military duty, however, the Austrian government reserves its rights toward its former subjects in cases where the man emigrated while (1) a recruit and under call to active service; (2) in service in ranks, or on furlough during service; (3) on leave of indefinite duration or in the reserves, after having been summoned to active service; (4) under call to service by a public proclamation; (5) after a proclamation of war. Briefly, this means that the Austrian government has the right to punish an American citizen only if he left Austria during a war, or in the time of his active service in the army, or after being recruited and called to service.</p>
   <p>In this respect, our treaty with Austria is of much greater advantage to American citizens than similar treaties with other countries. The Immigration League of New York has prepared a compilation of respective treaty provisions with various countries. According to the treaty with Russia, no Russian subject can become an American citizen without permission from the Russian government and as long as he is not completely free of his military duties. If a Russian immigrant secures American citizenship without the consent of his government, he is subject to punishment upon his return to Russia.</p>
   <p>A Frenchman who has acquired American citizenship between his twentieth and thirtieth birthday, during which time he is subject to three years of active service and ten years of service in the reserve, must return to France upon a call to arms. Should he not do so and thereafter should return to France, he may be arrested and put in prison or otherwise punished regardless of his age.</p>
   <p>A German subject who emigrated from Germany prior to his seventeenth birthday may return to Germany only for a visit; otherwise he may be deported, because he emigrated in order to evade military service.</p>
   <p>A Belgian who has secured American citizenship is automatically released from military service, provided that he is not a deserter.</p>
   <p>Serbia recognizes American citizenship only in the cases of men who have fully complied with all their military obligations before leaving Serbia. Otherwise, even American citizens are subject to prosecution upon their return to Serbia.</p>
   <p>In Italy, it is also necessary for an emigrant to secure the permission of his government to acquire the American citizenship, which otherwise does not free an Italian-born American citizen of his military duty.</p>
   <p>Turkey has the simplest and best provisions which are certainly obvious. The Turkish government does not recognize the American citizenship of its subjects, unless Turkey has given its consent. And the consent is given only on the condition of the applicant's pledge that he will never return to Turkey. This of course, effectively disposes of the question of any military duty.....</p>
