   <p>The meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association) which took place yesterday in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) began promptly at 8 P.M. The meeting was opened by the president, Mr. J. Pecha.....The meeting was characterized by many important matters......</p>
   <p>Communications were read by the secretary, Mr. V. F. Filip. Among these was a letter from the Ceska Svobodna Skola F. B. Zdrubek (F. B. Zdrubek Bohemian Free-Thought School), of Irving Park, Chicago, Illinois, in which the school thanks the Association for its contribution. The next letter caused a lengthy debate. It was written by the Statni Vybor Svazu Svobodomyslnych (State Committee of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers). In it the Association was politely asked to permit the Federation to give a series of lectures during the summer months in one of the halls of the cemetery crematories. The lectures would be arranged <span class="page-break">\2</span>by the Federation, and would be both educational and freethinking in content. Those who took part in the debate were: Messrs. Ilich, Zrust, Jelinek, Kronbauer, Nosek, and others. After an exchange of opinions about this request, the matter was left to the discretion of the executive committee of the Association.</p>
   <p>The next letter dealt with a collection which was started by Mr. Frantisek Zajicek for the benefit of Deyluv Ustav Pro Slepce v Praze. (Deyl's Institute for the Blind in Prague). This letter brought about a long and warm debate which mostly revealed the uniform sentiment of the delegates. Mr. Zajicek in his letter asked for financial contributions for the benefit of an institution which shelters the unhappiest of the unhappy in our old homeland. Had not the friends of that institution defended it in yesterday's meeting of the Association, it is a question as to how Mr. Zajicek would have fared with his appeal. Thanks to the several delegates, who approved the work of the Prague Institute, a gift amounting to $50 was sanctioned. The required two-thirds <span class="page-break">\3</span>majority of votes carried it but not until a second ballot was taken. The act will bring honor to this, our most prosperous Czechoslovak body in America, and it is expected that this piece of news will furnish a powerful stimulus to further deserving work in behalf of the Deyl's Institute for the Blind, an institution which is still suffering from the havoc of the great war.</p>
   <p>The secretary then reported and asked the representatives of the local newspapers to publish the fact that Mrs. Anna Danihel deposited the sum of $500 for the perpetual care of the graves of Alexander and Anna Danihel and Frantisek Millian. It seemed that there was some misunderstanding about this on the part of the said Mrs. Anna Danihel, and the request was, therefore, granted.</p>
   <p>The files of the flower department show that during the past month $965.75 were collected, and that the amount received in interest on expired bonds was $21,598.75. An expense estimate for plotting out and surveying a section of <span class="page-break">\4</span>the cemetery was then read by Mr. Josef A. Smejkal Jr., who was willing to undertake this work for $650. This offer was referred to the executive committee. Various building and renovation expenses amounted to the large sum of $71,272. The executive committee recommends that a steel vault for certain valuable papers and documents be procured....The Safe Cabinet Company of Marietta, Ohio, made an offer to furnish such a vault for the sum of $638.55. The delegates decided to refer this item too to the executive committee....[Translator's note: Here followed the names of persons who deposited various amounts for the perpetual care of certain graves. The total thus received was $4,300].</p>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav Cipra, after a lengthy talk, mentioned a loan of ten million pounds sterling which is to be granted to the Republic of Czechoslovakia by England and America. The loan was considered a very profitable one by the financiers of both countries, and is well covered by about ten per cent of the gold of Czechoslovakia besides being guaranteed by other incomes, such as the customs <span class="page-break">\5</span>receipts and the tobacco monopoly. The loan will earn eight per cent to the subscribers, and the subscription will begin today. The speaker appealed to the assembled delegates, who, aside from performing a patriotic duty which in itself should be a powerful stimulus to buy these bonds, should purchase them in large numbers because of their interest-bearing nature. This time the delegates without any debate unanimously decided to participate in the profitable venture by a subscription of $10,000.</p>
   <p>The March salaries and wages of the employees of the cemetery amounted to $7,354.35. The income for the month of March was $41,233.15 and disbursements were $23,375.71. For nineteen cemetery lots sold, the Association received $4,459, and for one urn sold, $96. The amount of $882.32 was deposited in the reserve fund. One hundred and forty persons were buried and twelve cremated.</p>
