   <p>The great ballroom of the Auditorium on Michigan Avenue was filled to capacity yesterday afternoon. The final ceremonies of the exhibition of United Presbyterian Churches of Chicago were held there, and the series of public meetings were held in six different parts of the city. Yesterday's meeting in the Auditorium was addressed by the Secretary of State of the United States, William Jennings Bryan, who came from Washington to Chicago for this occasion. He spoke on the topic "Right Is Might". Over one hundred Presbyterian clergymen were seated on the platform, all dressed in their academic gowns, and the front part of the main floor was filled with more than one thousand officers of Chicago Presbyterian churches. Delegates and invited guests were seated in boxes and in the balcony.....</p>
   <p>An important attraction of the meeting was a group of twenty-four Bohemian children dressed in Bohemian national costumes who were led to the stage and introduced to the cheering and applauding audience by the Reverend Vaclav Vanek.</p>

   <p>Mr. Alois Solar's children, the six-year-old Jiricek (Georgie) and ten-year-old Alois, presented as a musical offering the hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee," played most skilfully on chimes. At the close of the meeting, the children were lined up under a large Bohemian flag on the platform and were photographed. The Bohemian children received a great deal of praise from the principal speaker of the day, Secretary of State Bryan.</p>
   <p>In addition to the Bohemian group, there were Belgian and Serbian children, also dressed in national costumes.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian children made a deep impression. The group consisted of pupils of the Bohemian Settlement and the Lawndale Bohemian Presbyterian School, both of which are under Reverend Vanek's spiritual supervision. The children sang Bohemian national and folk songs at six different places in Chicago during the past two weeks, and three groups of girls dressed in national costumes danced the well-known Bohemian square dance, "Beseda," under the leadership of Miss Anna Baumruk. The dancing was generally admired. On three occasions, Reverend <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Vanek presented speeches on the history of the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>At the Fourth Presbyterian Church on Lincoln Park Avenue at Deleware Place, a church to which the elite of American society people of Chicago belong, Reverend Vanek arranged a "Bohemian Day". It was attended by 816 people, and the program was entirely Bohemian. It consisted of musical selections presented by Chicago Bohemian artists.....Dr. F. J. Smetanka delivered a speech about the Bohemian people and accompanied his lecture with seventy-five colored stereopticon slides. All this has stirred up great interest in the Bohemian nation among thousands of Americans who attended these functions, and Reverend Vanek, who was the organizer of the events ought to be congratulated on the success with which his efforts have met.</p>
   <p>Such meetings should be organized more frequently. They have done a great deal of good and have removed many prejudices. They constitute a fine piece of effective national work.</p>
