   <p>In that memorable meeting in the Hubbard Memorial Church last Thursday, it was resolved to make Protestant America acquainted with the hopes and national exertions of the Czech people. The meeting, as reported in an earlier issue, was called by Czech Presbyterians on the occasion of the celebration of the three hundred and twenty-fifth birthday of Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius). After the main address by the Rev. Joseph Krenek, of Silver Lake, Minn., the Rev. Dr. John Timothy Stone, minister of the Fourth Presbyterian Church, delivered an address in the English language. He is a sincere friend of the Czech-Americans, and of our people abroad as well. It was during our late celebrations to commemorate the name of John Hus that he was sent the historic gavel by the Reformed Protestant Church in Bohemia. He was at that time a moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.</p>

   <p>Doctor Stone spoke enthusiastically of Komensky. "We owe Bohemia many great things. The whole world reveres Comenius as an educator and reformer. Harvard University offered the presidency to him. The Protestant world honors in him the last bishop of the church of the Bohemian Brethren, the church that came nearest to the ideals of the church of Christ, which, banished from Bohemia, lived within the Moravian church which was one of the most active missionary churches in the world.</p>
   <p>'Now, that the fate of the nations is in the balance, just as it was during the Thirty Years War, when the hopes and the sighs of the suffering Czech people were heard all over the world, it shall be our aim to realize the hopes of Komensky, which are the hopes of the Czech people, and bring about the liberation of the nation. You Czechs are deserving of it because you. are so loyal to this country, and because you defend the heritage of your forefathers. Your country is the cradle of religious freedom. We love you for your sacred and national ardor, and I hope that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>when the War is ended, the voice of the Czechs, calling for freedom of conscience and rights, shall be heard, and you shall be an independent nation. Would that the free Bohemian country accept the creed of religious and national loyalty as preached by their patriotic and spiritual leaders Hus and Comenius."</p>
   <p>At the close of this meeting, which will ever be remembered, a committee of five was named, whose task will consist in acquainting the main Protestant churches of America with the aims of the Czech national movement.</p>
