   <p>A genuinely patriotic spirit reigns in the Zabavny Klub Ceska Koruna (Amusement Club Bohemian Crown). There are manifold proofs for this statement, one of the recent ones being the enlistment of four members for service in the United States Army. These four were entertained at a farewell party given them by the club, which was held at Zastera's Hall, 19th Street and Blue Island Avenue last Saturday night. A beautiful valedictory was delivered by Brother Cenkovic. It left a deep impression upon everyone present. A collection netted $11.00, which will be sent to the Czech National Alliance to be employed in the pursuit of our great patriotic aims.</p>
