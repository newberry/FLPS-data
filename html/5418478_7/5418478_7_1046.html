   <p>The Prvni Ustredni Jednota (First Central Union) is the foremost organization of Czech Roman Catholics in the United States. Its members and representatives are now in session here. Vincent Kolda is president; F. J. Adam is the secretary, to whom two assistants, Messrs. August P. Sobotka and Joseph H. Vana, are detailed.</p>
   <p>Discussions revolved about changes of bylaws and routine matter.....The reserve fund amounts to $256,722.78, a high figure considering the number of members.....The death benefit fund reaches $11,723.04; the general fund has $10,116.45.....The number of members in all the branches is 5,472, distributed all over the United States.....Six committees to take charge of the agenda were appointed.....</p>
   <p>There was a preliminary session yesterday forenoon. An invitation to the <span class="page-break">2</span>banquet to be given to honor the memory of Sv. Vaclav (St. Venceslas), Czech national saint, arrived from the Narodni Svaz Katoliku (National Catholic League).....</p>
   <p>Two resolutions were passed: one to express loyalty to President Wilson representing the United States; the other to express loyalty to the Pope.</p>
   <p>....A St. Venceslas flag was presented to the Union by Mr. Anton Polek. It was made in Prague fourty-six years ago and was the property of the first St. John Czech Catholic Society of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The conference is going to be continued.....</p>
   <p>The First Central Union received a communication from the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. "The executive committee of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics takes pleasure in extending greetings to the Czech Roman Catholic First Central Union.....This portentous time has created a problem for us. Free nations of Europe, and also those longing for liberty, are now <span class="page-break">3</span>engaged in the struggle against the enemy of freedom who has made it his goal to subjugate the entire world.....All signs indicate that our people will be liberated and will throw off the shackles that have held them in bondage for over three hundred years.....Our people in the old country are helpless, for any attempt to free themselves is met by armored Prussian militarism.....Czechs and Slovaks are rallying in France to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Allies for the freedom of all nations, and, therefore, for the freedom of Czechs and Slovaks as well.</p>
   <p>"....We in America are fighting a bloodless, but nevertheless highly important battle for the liberation of Czech lands. Our representatives are in contact with Government circles and other influential groups who will have a weighty word to say in the peace negotiations. By word of mouth and through the press we hope to attain our aims.....All this means heavy demands upon our finances, for the old country is reduced to penury and cannot contribute.</p>
   <p>".....We Czech Catholics in America refrained from participating in the movement for the liberation of Czech lands up to the moment when we saw that our attitude <span class="page-break">4</span>was incompatible with our standards of honor; then we had to join the ranks of the fighters.....In the short span of time since the initiation of our action, we have, under the leadership of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, accomplished enough. At least we will not be pointed at for having remained inert during the crucial time when our old homeland needed us most.</p>
   <p>"We, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, have been doing our duty....We intend to do more, because we are preparing for a pilgrimage to the Eternal City, Rome. Here we will submit our just demands to the ambassador and minister plenipotentiary of Christ himself, invoke his good will, and solicit his mighty influence in favor of the Czech people.....</p>
   <p>"We need the moral and financial support of all Czech Catholics in America. First of all, however, we wish the Catholic organizations to do what some of them have already done--openly declare themselves for the action begun by the National Alliance of Czech Catholics.</p>
   <p>"Innocent Kestl, Chairman.</p>
   <p>"Signed: Frank Sindelar, head of main office."</p>
