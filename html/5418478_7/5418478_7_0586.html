   <p>The great yearly convention of the United Societies of Chicago was held yesterday in the hall of Sokol Chicago. It was presided over by President George Landau and attracted an unusually large crowd of members and delegates.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the last convention and a presentation of the annual report by Secretary Anton J. Cermak, the chairman of the assessment committee, Cyrill Jandus, addressed the meeting and remarked that the present State's attorney, Maclay Hoyne, is the first State's attorney to pay attention to this problem of assessments.....</p>
   <p>The United Societies have been working since their inception to achieve equitable assessment of rich and poor, of large corporations and small businessmen alike. But, all their efforts had been in vain, for other State's attorneys just laughed at the organization's officers who lodged complaints in this respect.....</p>
