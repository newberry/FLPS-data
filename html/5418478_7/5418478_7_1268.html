   <p>P.1--The Bohemian National Cemetery, the pride of Chicago Bohemians, was subjected to the regular annual inspection yesterday, which met with the best results. It could not be otherwise, because the Bohemian National Cemetery is actually one of the most beautiful cemeteries in Chicago. Indeed, we can readily say, that our National cemetery can be ranked among the finest in America. In asserting this fact, we do not wish to flatter the representatives of the National Cemetery Association, neither the officers of the Association nor the employees of the cemetery. We merely establish the fact that all of them perform their duties faithfully, honestly and unselfishly. For that reason they can point with pride at their united work, that is all. Yesterday's inspection was participated by thirty-seven representatives. They were escorted by Mr. Pech, the Association chairman and Messrs. J. Smejkal and W. Kolacek of the management committee. The chief gardner Mr. Leopold Ine, explained everything that needed explanation to the representatives. There was little to explain, however, for everything on the cemetery is so practically and simply arranged, that you <span class="page-break">\2</span>can see at a glance, that the cemetery is governed by the hand of a specialist. The National cemetery looks more like a luxurious park, in which magnificent lawns, many colored flowers and green trees greet the eye. How pleasing are the innumerable, artistic monuments and vaults that lie amidst the trees, the flowers and the shrubbery. Let us picture for one moment that sublime quiet, disturbed here and there by the twittering of a bird; no wonder, that man does not fear death, for he knows, that he will rest there some day. Let us return however, to the inspection itself. The members visited the office, where they expressed their satisfaction to Mr. Husak, the accountant of the cemetery. The green-houses, the boiler-rooms, the water-system, the barns and stables were inspected and everything found in excellent order. The representatives found that it will be necessary to enlarge the quarters of Messrs. Ine and Husak by building additions, and very likely a resolution to this effect will be introduced at the next meeting of the Association. Finally the representatives stopped at the gate and inspected the site, where a spacious waiting room, with all conveniences, will be built, as soon as possible. Such a place is urgently needed at the cemetery, and for that reason we hope, that although it has not yet been decided upon--the Association will resolve upon the quick construction of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>building. It often happens, that visitors are caught in the rain--for example, it so happened yesterday--and people are forced to flee from the cemetery in confusion. This and other inconveniences will be eliminated by the construction of a waiting-room.</p>
   <p>After having completed the inspection, the delegation had dinner, and praised highly the culinary art of Mrs. Scheiner.</p>
