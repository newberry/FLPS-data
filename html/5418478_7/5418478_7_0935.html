   <p>Although the collection of the Svatovaclavska Dan 1920 (St. Wenceslans Tax of 1920) has already been completed, additional sums have been received by the central office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) for the same cause. [There follow the list of names and amounts contributed.] Total, $456.80.</p>
   <p>We hereby officially end the collection of the Svatovaclavska Dan, the proceeds of which amounted to almost twenty-two thousand dollars. The collected amount will be used to support our cultural and religious causes here and in our old homeland. The report on the collection, as far as states are concerned, was already published in our newspapers, and the work on the detailed report is still in progress. This report will be published in our journal, the Hlidka (Sentinel), as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Those societies and individuals who would still be willing to contribute to <span class="page-break">\2</span>our cause, are requested to send their contributions directly to the central office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku, 3205 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois, and not to various individuals.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku, we once again express our gratitude to all who worked in any manner whatsoever in behalf of the Svatovaclavska Dan 1920, and to all of our societies and individuals who contributed to this tax.</p>
   <p>With a countryman's greeting for the special committee on the Svatovaclavska Dan 1920,</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Reverend Frantisek Bozenek,</p>
   <p>retiring chairman.</p>
