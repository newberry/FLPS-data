   <p>The festive commemoration of Karel Havlicek [an early Bohemian writer and patriot] was held yesterday afternoon under the auspices of the Druzstvo Havlickova Pomniku (Havlicek Monument Society). It was organized by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol V Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools in Chicago). The original celebration was held some time ago on the anniversary day of Havlicek's death. Because at that time our children had their vacation, the celebration was split, and the second part was reserved for school children only.</p>
   <p>Thus, the children assembled in their respective schools yesterday, and from there they marched with their teachers to the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola Vojta Naprstek (Bohemian Free Thought School Vojta Naprstek) at West 26th Street and Homan Avenue. When the pupils of all our schools were assembled, a column of fours was formed, at the head of which were members of the Sdruzeni. These were followed by a band of youthful musicians who played gay and snappy <span class="page-break">2</span>marches, and behind them marched the school children under the supervision of their teachers. Each class had a standard with the name of the school and the class, to which a wreath, bought with contributions, was attached.</p>
   <p>The parade started shortly after two o'clock in the afternoon and marched through the principal streets of Bohemian "California" to Havlicek's monument, where a large group had already gathered. There the standard-bearers formed a semicircle around the festively decorated monument, and all of the other children assembled before the terrace.</p>
   <p>The ceremony proper was inaugurated by the president of the Druzstvo, Mr. Sedlacek, who presented a short address of welcome to the children. Then Dr. J. E. Roberts delivered a speech in English about Havlicek.....</p>
   <p>The youthful group sang the American national anthem, and Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan presented a Bohemian lecture on Havlicek's work and his significance. Then the children sang the Bohemian national anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where <span class="page-break">3</span>Is My Home), and Mr. O'Donnell, a member of the West Park Commission, spoke on the Commission's behalf.....</p>
   <p>More than twenty schools and over six hundred children participated in the celebration.....</p>
