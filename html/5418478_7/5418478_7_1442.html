   <p>Large numbers of young members of the Sokol Slavoj [gymnastic society] have enlisted for service in the United States Army to fight against savage militarism. [Follows list of twelve who joined the Czecho-Slovak Legion.]</p>
   <p>The Sokol Slavoj is going to give an evening to its departing members to be held in Mr. Semeradek's place 1333, South Komensky Avenue. Extensive preparations are being made. Mr. Povolny's orchestra will furnish the appropriate music.</p>
   <p>The volunteers will depart on April 23. Fifteen automobiles have been placed at their disposal for their ride to the depot from whence the recruits will be transported to the training camp at Jefferson Barracks, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>St. Louis, Mo. The Sokol Slavoj, by furnishing new recruits, is following the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs, the larger organization. Its example will, no doubt, be emulated by other Sokol organizations. The Sokols will thus prove that they have grasped the responsibility which they owe to their new homeland.</p>
   <p>Volunteers from other Czech-American settlements are arriving in Chicago to join their comrades, coming from Detroit and from as far as San Francisco.</p>
   <p>About sixty new men have enlisted in the Pilsen Park recruiting station. They will be examined tomorrow. This new contingent will leave Monday evening, and it is hoped that they will be given due and appropriate attention by the Czech settlement.</p>
