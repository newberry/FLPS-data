   <p>With a large public attendance on hand, a ceremony dedicating the monuments of Czech soldiers who fell during the Spanish-American war was held at four o'clock yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Fifty-two members of the Cesko-Americky Vyslouzilci, Tabor C. 30 (Bohemian-American Camp No. 30, Department of Illinois, United States War Veterans) were present in uniform at this ceremony. Altogether eight monuments which were placed over the graves of Czech veterans Cada, Krasny, Kudrny, Petrik, Ripka, Lisy, Schmetler, and Votruba were dedicated. The monuments were donated by the War Department in Washington and were provided with suitable inscriptions in memory of these soldiers, these victims of war. The parade paused at the grave of each of our Czech heroes, where Mr. Joseph A. Paul delivered a memorial sermon in the Czech language in these ardent words: "Dear Comrade! We meet here every year in order to adorn thy grave on Decoration Day, but today we have decorated thy grave with a monument given <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to thee by the Government in reward for thy honorable service in time of war. Let this monument be an ornament of thy grave forever, and rest assured that we shall not forget thy grave, and each year, as before, we will visit thy grave and decorate it with flowers. Rest in Peace."</p>
   <p>The speaker decorated each grave with an American flag in testimony of respect and remembrance.</p>
