   <p>Mr. Vlach, an ambitious teacher at the Czech language school Vojta Naprstek, a Free Thought institute, founded a club for adolescent graduates of that school. The club pursues the purpose of preventing former pupils from becoming estranged, forgetting the Czech language, and straying away from the mother tongue of their parents. This purpose is, therefore, a noble one.</p>
   <p>To make former pupils better acquainted with each other, an entertainment, which proved to be very successful, was arranged last Friday in the schoolrooms. Mr. Vlach explained the aims of the club and why the founding of other clubs of this kind should be promoted. The club's orchestra, consisting of two violins and a piano, played popular Czech songs. Mrs. Ludmila Veselska, a well-known worker in Czech school affairs, delivered a lecture on "The Significance of Czech Schools". Miss Helen Weiner sang Czech and other Slav songs, and Miss R. Martinek recited Jablonsky's poem, "Three Periods in the History of Bohemia". After Mr. Richard Dusil, president of the trustees of the school, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>had spoken, there were more recitations and music.</p>
   <p>The program closed with "The Star-Spangled Banner" played by the orchestra and sung by the audience with great enthusiasm. Miss Jelinek then made a collection for the benefit of soldiers in the Czechoslovak Army which yielded $11.04.</p>
   <p>The attendance was large. The club intends to form a group for vocal music--a regular club chorus.</p>
