   <p>The memorial celebrated last night will be recorded in golden letters in the history of the Czechs' struggle for independence. Czechoslovaks of Chicago remembered their fellow-countrymen who gave their lives on the battlefields in foreign lands in order to help the cause of liberty for Czechoslovak soil. They honored the memory of the men of the Czechoslovak brigade who fought on the Russian side against Austria, and which was annihilated at Tarnopol, a Polish district of Austria, in a recent offensive.</p>
   <p>The streets in the neighborhood of Lawndale Avenue and 26th Street began to fill with crowds as early as 7 P. M. The home of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs [gymnastic society] is located there, the rallying point of the Sokols, who started a parade, led by Doctor A. Mueller, and accompanied by Rubringer's band, went to the pavilion in the Pilsen Brewery Park. Over one thousand persons were in the procession. There were Sokols, members of the Beseda Fric [a patriotic society], and others. They were loudly acclaimed by sympathizing bystanders.</p>
   <p>The pavilion was decorated with American, Czech, and Russian flags, also those of the Allied powers. The "Star-Spangled Banner" opened the program, the throng of four thousand men and women joined in the singing with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig Fisher, the first speaker, explained the purpose of the gathering: "We have met here in deepest grief which gripped our hearts when we learned about the fate of our Czechoslovak warriors. You have only recently heard how bravely they fought during the beginning of the offensive, but who, alas, are no more today. Theirs is the lion's share in former successes upon the plains of Tarnopol; their deeds will forever shine brilliantly in our history. All honor to them!</p>
   
   <p>Three Czech regiments stood like rocks, while the Russian armies gathered around them wavered, and began to retreat. They struggled with the enemy who had encircled them through treason, but they did not give up. To be dutiful was their only thought; twelve centuries were looking down upon them, and millions of Czech eyes gazed, imploring them: 'Do not give up!' The fighters answered: 'Let us show to our Czech people here and across the ocean that we are fighting for their liberation and their independence!'....It is our turn now to unite and work for a happy future of our Czechoslovak nation!"</p>
   <p>The ever beautiful anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" [Where my homeland is....], was sung then, accompanied by the orchestra. After this, Mr. Ondrej [Andrew] Sustka took the floor: ".... Painful emotions now, but joyous ones at the same time, are throbbing in our hearts--our Czech and Slovak young men have made the supreme sacrifice. We are asking ourselves whether we, too, are as strong as they were--those who fell in the battle against the Austrians.... Our Sokol gymnastic organization has given our youth the education necessary to accomplish what our men lost at Tarnopol.... Had not the World War started, neither you Czechs nor we Slovaks would have ever had any hope to escape Austrian tyranny. Let everyone of us--sons and daughters of the Czechoslovak nation--work together, for this is the only road to honor and victory!" (Thundering applause--the orchestra plays "Columbia".)</p>
   <p>Two choruses, "Veno" [Dedication] by Bedrich [Frederick] Smetana, directed by G. Houdek, and "Uboj" (Forward into the fight!) by Zajc, were rendered by the Delnicko-Pevecky Spolek [Workingmen's Singing Society].</p>
   <p>The Reverend Fr. Jedlicka, one of the most popular speakers and best known patriotic workers, was introduced by Doctor Fisher. He is a native American, but he masters the Czech language perfectly. He spoke in the name of the Czech Catholics, and was warmly acclaimed. "Our foremost efforts must be bent toward working in harmony toward the goal--to liberate our old homeland. Today we are mourning. Figuratively, we are singing a requiem. These are the obsequies in memory of the tragedy of Tarnopol..... We must make a common cause with our brethren, the Russians. .... All the Slavonic nations must unite.... Let us be loyal to America, but do not let us forget the old homeland. We can be good Americans and at the same time remain sincere children of Mother Bohemia....." "Hej Slovane," the other Czech national anthem, was sung at the close of the Reverend Jedlicka's address.</p>
   <p>Following this speech were two songs by the mixed chorus of the Slovak American Sokol [gymnastic societies], whereupon Mr. Novak, representing the Czech branch of the Social Democrats stepped forth. He said: ".... This is a question of the very existence of the Czechoslovak nation. We are bound to exert our power to the utmost to destroy the militarism of the Kaiser. Let us quit making excuses, but let us consider that at Tarnopol, as well as elsewhere, our comrades have died to be worthy of the name of our forebears. We cannot do anything for our cause on this side of the ocean except help financially. We have decided to send our delegate to Russia with our message, and encourage them to hold out and fight on for the liberation of the small peoples..... Forget your petty quarrels! We shall be with you to the last man until the Czechoslovaks have won complete liberty."</p>
   <p>The mixed chorus of the United Slovak Gymnastic Societies, known by the name, Detvan, presented two songs. These were followed by the "Star-Spangled Banner," played by the orchestra.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Mueller spoke for the Sokol [gymnastic societies], beginning with the declaration that the Sokols [members of the Sokol gymnastic societies] are "soldiers in the service of the nation", and that Sokol discipline has proved its worth upon the battlefield of Tarnopol, which reminds us of the Thermopylae Pass with its three hundred dead Greek heroes.....</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, followed. He called the battle of Tarnopol one of the most significant events in Czech history; and appealed to his fellow-countrymen to hold out until the independence of the Czech nation is assured.</p>
   
   <p>The new Russian anthem, composed by Glinka, was then played for the first time in America, Mr. Rubringer's orchestra performing. Dr. L. Fisher mounted the platform to read the numerous manifestations of sympathy. They came from the following: New York Branch of the Czech National Alliance, Ferdinand Pisecky, the Workingmen's American Sokol Organizations, M. Stefanik of the Czech National Council, and others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Palandio then spoke for the Serbians. An unforgettable moment, defying depiction, arrived. Thousands of men and women thronged toward a group which had just entered, and headed by a Sokol guard of honor--they were delegates from the great, free republic of Russia, led by Professor Oronowsky, who is a colonel in the Russian army, and Boris Bachmetev, the Russian ambassador. The multitude greeted them with frenzied applause..... Several speeches were made.....</p>
   <p>The "Star-Spangled Banner" closed the commemoration, which included the dedication of a flag by Czech-American women to the Czechoslovak army fighting abroad with the Allies for the independence of the old homeland.</p>
