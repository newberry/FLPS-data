   <p>The Czech Catholics have donated a considerable sum of money to the Cyrilo-Metodejsky fond (Cyril and Methodius Aid Fund). They are now joining in a concerted action for the liberation of the Czech people. To this end, they have opened an office from which the work will be systematically directed, not only over the Chicago districts, but all the Czech-Catholic settlements of America. The patriotic action will follow the declaration of the following principle: To work for the liberation of the Czech people towards the best possible results, and with all our strength available.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (Czech Catholic League) consists of P. Innocence Kestl, P. Frank Jedlicka, and others. Mr. Frank Sindelar is in charge of the office. He has come from Cleveland to Chicago for that specific purpose.</p>
