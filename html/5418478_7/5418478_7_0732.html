   <p>So that all out-of-town delegates will not waste time looking for the convention hall, the following information is given for their benefit:</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovenska-Americka Sin (Czechoslovak-American Hall) is located at 1436 West 18th Street, half a block west from Blue Island Avenue. On Blue Island Avenue run streetcars marked at the front, "26-Kenton," and on the sides, "Blue Island". If you board this car going downtown it takes you west to 18th Street. You get off at 18th Street and walk only half a block west. The elevated trains, which take you to this neighborhood are marked "Douglas Park".</p>
   <p>After arriving in Chicago it is advisable to take a taxi to your hotel. The delegates to our previous conventions favored the Fort Dearborn Hotel which is situated next door to the La Salle Street Station. Delegates who will use the New York Central trains (Lake Shore) will arrive at this <span class="page-break">\2</span>station. Also those traveling by the Rock Island or the Nickel Plate railroads. It is easy to go from the Fort Dearborn Hotel to the convention hall, since there is an elevated railroad station directly opposite the hotel. The clergy that will come to this convention will be the guests of our parishes. The offices of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) are located in the Lawndale State Bank (a Bohemian enterprise), 3207 West 22nd Street, near Kedzie Avenue. The telephone is Lawndale 1909.</p>
   <p>See you at the convention!</p>
   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku.</p>
