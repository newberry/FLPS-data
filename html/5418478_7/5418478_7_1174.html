   <p>In spite of the sudden change in weather--it turned unusually cold--a great number of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) and their friends assembled yesterday afternoon in order to witness the laying of the cornerstone of the first Bohemian crematorium in the world. It is the first one in the whole world because the Austrian government, in its subservience to the Catholic Church, prohibits the Bohemians from building a crematorium for themselves in the Old Country. A great deal has been said and written about the steps which led to the decision to build a Bohemian crematorium in Chicago. Most of it is contained in the reports of the meetings of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, and, therefore, our public is well aware of the fact that the board hesitated for a long time before it decided to embark on such a huge undertaking. At last the happy decision was made but the board was of the opinion that an adequate crematorium could be built for much less than the board is spending on <span class="page-break">2</span>the present structure.</p>
   <p>The building was begun in October, and now the foundation is all ready and several feet of the main walls have been built. If the weather is favorable, at least to some extent, the rebuilding of the old chapel will begin soon.</p>
   <p>Since the venture has reached its present state of development, the moment has arrived for the special ceremonies decided upon by the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov--the commemoration of the laying of the cornerstone. Within this cornerstone will be placed important documents referring to the life of the Bohemian colony in Chicago. This is a significant moment [in the lives of]Chicago's Freethinking Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The representatives assembled yesterday shortly after 1:00 P.M. in the offices of the cemetery, where all documents to be put into the cornerstone, were made ready for the ceremony. The assembled delegates and guests proceeded to the site of the building near whose northwest corner a speaker's platform had been <span class="page-break">3</span>erected. The cornerstone was placed on the platform while the chairman of the board of representatives, Mr. Jan Pecha, opened the ceremony. He greeted all those present and said:</p>
   <p>"Friends! A moment of rare significance has arrived. It is the historic moment when we, Bohemians of Chicago, are laying the foundation of an undertaking which symbolizes our liberal principles and crowns the work we have done in trying to make this cemetery worthy of our nation.</p>
   <p>"Cremation is the most advanced, most progressive method of interment. This, therefore, is a red-letter day in the history of Chicago Bohemians; this is the day when we lay the cornerstone of the first Bohemian crematorium in the whole world. Our brothers in the old country are under a reactionary government, a government dominated by the Roman priesthood. They are forbidden to build a crematorium in their country and are obliged, therefore, to take the bodies of their enlightened men abroad in order to give them the funeral to which <span class="page-break">4</span>they are entitled, a funeral by fire.</p>
   <p>"It is with gratitude that we today remember our friends who, in the seventies of the last century, founded this beautiful cemetery of ours, upon which we are now building a crematorium. Many of us remember clearly the beginnings of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov. And for possession of one of the most beautiful cemeteries, not only in Chicago but in the whole United States, we have to be thankful to--priests. When Bohemian lodges and societies began to try to free themselves from the yoke of priests, an attempt caused by the confiscation of the church property of the St. Wenceslaus Society on De Koven Street, Mr. F. B. Zdrubek, at that time the chief editor of Svornost, suggested in his speech of January 7, 1877, the necessity of a cemetery for Freethinking Bohemians. The idea took root among the lodges of the Cesko-Slovenske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), and their leaders started looking around for a site where the bodies of their friends could be laid for eternal peace. The Illinois Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske <span class="page-break">5</span>Podporujici Spolky, composed until that time principally of representatives of the Lodges Vernost (Fidelity) No. 8, and Praha (Prague), No. 13 and Rovnost (Equality) No. 14, soon found a suitable location and purchased sixty-three acres of ground for a cemetery. But the plan of using this property for burial purposes was abandoned when three other benevolent societies, the Cesky Narodni Podporujici Spolek (Bohemian National Benevolent Society), the Pokrok (Progress), and the Cesky Delnicky Podporujici Spolek (Bohemian Workingmen's Benevolent Society), joined the Illinois Grand Lodge, which at the meeting of February 12, 1877, decided to lay the foundation of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov. Soon the necessary ground was acquired, and the cemetery begun. It grew rapidly and soon was larger than any other Bohemian institution in the United States. The more recent history of the success of the cemetery is well known to all of us. Today we may point with pride to our accomplishments in connection with this monumental enterprise. Let us then express the hope that any and all undertakings of Freethinking Bohemians may meet with similar success.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"Before concluding, I consider it a pleasant duty to thank all Bohemian periodicals which helped and supported us in our efforts. My thanks go also to all members of the board of representatives, past and present, who have done all they could to assure success to our 'field of eternal peace,' and to make the cemetery a dignified final abode for our friends. Permit me to express our appreciation also to all patrons and supporters. I am sure that our sentiments of gratitude to all those I have mentioned are fully shared by everybody who is interested in the Bohemian community life in America, and all those I greet with a sincere 'Na Zdar' (To Success)!"</p>
   <p>This speech received a very warm reception, in spite of the prevailing "Sibirian" cold. The whole audience replied with a resounding "Nazdar," and the principal speaker of the day, Dr. Frantisek Iska, took the platform. In view of the extreme cold, he shortened his speech to a few minutes, but put into it all the feeling and significance that he would have put into a long oration. He said:</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"The building whose cornerstone we are laying today, is to symbolize the fulfillment and culmination of our national cemetery. In the comparatively short space of a lifetime,the cemetery has grown from a humble beginning to a huge enterprise, the size of which is a testimonial to the numerical strength of the freethinking group among the Chicago Bohemians. The total cost of all that has been used here for the adornment of individual graves and of the cemetery as a whole,runs into millions of dollars. This cost is eloquent testimony to the economic progress that has crowned the efforts of Chicago Bohemians, their ability, their diligence, their courage, and their perseverance. And the general appearance of the cemetery, as well as that of individual graves, speaks for the cultural progress of our people, who have said good-by to all those funny little things which decorate the graves of those whose lives are still rooted in superstition. Our stones and monuments are of considerable artistic value, and with the beautiful floral decorations, prove the Bohemians' sense of real beauty. These cultural values will be enhanced by a monumental structure; the board of representatives will stint no money, but will enable the architect, contractor, and all those who are working on <span class="page-break">8</span>the building to create an edifice of permanent beauty and value. Let us remember that this building will survive us, that it will stand when those who speak our beautiful Bohemian language are probably fewer in number. And if, by the cessation of immigration and by the complete assimilation of our fourth or fifth generation into an American nation of one single language, the Bohemians should disappear in this country, this building will remain as a permanent monument to their efforts and to their Bohemian characteristics, the most marked feature of which is courage--courage to seek truth and to fight for liberty.</p>
   <p>"I am sure that I speak for all Freethinking Bohemians, not only in Chicago but throughout these United States, when I offer an expression of thanks to the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov for helping, by building this Crematorium, to preserve in America a permanent evidence of the fact that our Bohemian people here were progressive at a time when all around them, reactionary influences were still strongest. May this crematorium in a Bohemian cemetery proclaim to all those who come after us, that <span class="page-break">9</span>Bohemians in America were the pioneers of progress in their methods of burying their dead, as well as in every other way."</p>
   <p>Dr. Iska's speech received enthusiastic applause. He was followed by a member of the board of representatives and chairman of the building committee, Mr. Mencl, who thanked his committee and the whole board for their cooperation.....He read the names of all the organizations that had sent in something to be placed in the cornerstone....[Some seventy organizations are named, including the periodicals Denni Hlasatel, Svornost, Spravedlnost, Vesmir and Svojan.] The ceremonies were then concluded.</p>
