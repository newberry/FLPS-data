   <p>Yesterday throughout the country the American people joined in the celebration of the anniversary of the birthday of one of its greatest sons, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was outstanding in his deeds, his sufferings, his warmheartedness, his noble character, and in every trait of his personality. This is why he secured for himself an everlasting place in the hearts of the American people, nay, in the hearts of mankind. It is only natural, therefore, that the citizens of the state of Illinois, particularly those of the city of Chicago, should manifest, in a solemn, sincere manner, their love for a great President and a great man. For a long time Lincoln was a citizen of our state, and within these borders he matured and established himself. It was Chicago where he was nominated for the presidency, and it was Chicago to which he felt attached and for which he foresaw a great future.</p>
   <p>Yesterday there was a general holiday in our city, and the many flags spoke of devotion in every home.</p>

   <p>All of the various nationality groups held joint or separate celebrations. That the Chicago Bohemians did not falter in this respect was to be expected. They held numerous patriotic meetings, and among these the especially large gathering of the ladies of the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen gymnastic society) in the hall on Ashland Avenue deserves mention for the splendid program offered to the participants.</p>
