   <p>The Jan Hus celebration, which was arranged by "Tel. Jednotow Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) last Saturday turned out successfully even though a larger crowd would have been better.</p>
   <p>The hall was richly decorated with Native and American flags. In the center of the gallery was a large painting of "Jan Hus" the fine work of our countryman, Mr. Zajicek.</p>
   <p>The program included a festive speech by Mr. Frant.Bol. Zdrubka, Concert selections by Mr. J. Novak's band, gymnastic exercises and singing by the singing club, all of which were carried through successfully to the satisfaction of all present.</p>
