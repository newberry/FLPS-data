   <p>A new lodge, which was named George Washington Lodge No. 53 of the Jednota Taboritu (Taborites), has recently been organized. It consists mostly of junior members of the Taborite (Taborites), and thanks to their unusual zeal in getting new members, it now boasts of a membership of seventy-five people.</p>
   <p>Recently this new organization was honored by a gift of a gorgeous silk American flag from the parent organization, the Narodni Hlavni Loze (National Grand Lodge) Jednoty Taboritu. This flag will be officially presented [to the young organization] on Sunday, and the hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, located at 26th Street and Lawndale Avenue, has been rented for this occasion....</p>
