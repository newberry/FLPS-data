   <p>Immigrants of all nationalities are preparing to celebrate the Fourth of July in a particularly impressive manner. The celebrations will serve as manifestations of loyalty to the United States, to its Government, to President Wilson, and to the American people in general.</p>
   <p>It is imperative for all citizens of Czech descent, who cherish the freedom of the new homeland, to participate as intensively as possible so that our manifestation will excel all others. To make the right start, we invite all representatives of our organizations to assemble at the hall of Sokol Chicago, 2345 South Kedzie Avenue, Monday evening, June 17, where outlines and details will be discussed for a dignified commemoration of Independence Day.</p>
