   <p>The meeting of the United Bohemian Building and Loan Societies was well attended and a total of seventy-three delegates was present. Reports were made by the chairman, secretary, and treasurer, all of them were accepted. The chairman, Mr. R. Mulac, reported that he was present at all meetings, that he visited the Polish societies, which united at the same time as the Bohemian societies, and which announced that all forty-eight Polish societies will soon be in the union, and members of State League of Building and Loan Societies of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Secretary Konrad Ricker reported that in today's meeting five additional societies applied for membership in the United Bohemian Building and Loan Society, and there are now seventy-four societies in good standing <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the Union. Further, he says that during the last year forty-nine new Building and Loan Societies were organized in the State and calls attention to the fact that the State Auditor in his report indicates that of the forty-nine new organizations in the State, thirty-two were formed in the southwestern part of Chicago. The auditor cautions the public against such action because there are a sufficient number of such societies in this section, and these should be strengthened instead of creating new ones. This whole business will not benefit in that way. All of the delegates agreed with this. The secretary further announced that some societies are delinquent in the payment of their dues to the State League and to the United Bohemian Building and Loan Society. All of the delegates promised to bring the matter to the attention of their respective societies and see to it that the dues are remitted on time hereafter.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. F. G. Hajicek, reports that during the period from <span class="page-break">\3</span>June 3, 1907 to November 23, 1910, the total receipts were $769.00, and disbursements amounted to $744.60. There remains on hand in the treasury $24.90. In the disbursements are included all expenditures for publicity, advertising, rent of meeting hall, fees to the State League, delegates' expenses to three conventions and salaries of officers amounting to twenty-six dollars a year.</p>
   <p>The auditing committee compared the report with the vouchers and receipts and accepted it, whereupon the meeting proceeded with the regular order of business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jos. A. Smejkal, who was to speak about appraisal committees, was not present, therefore, the matter was laid over to the next meeting. The so called "Voucher System" was placed before the meeting for consideration and Mr. Keclik's specimen copy was unanimously accepted. Mr. Keclik took it upon himself to have copies printed and to distribute them to all <span class="page-break">\4</span>Bohemian Building and Loan Societies free of charge, so that all officers can familiarize themselves with this class of orders, because this system will no doubt be introduced in all Bohemian Building and Loan Societies. It is recommended by such experts as Messrs. Janda, Jos. Rousek, and Frank G. Hajicek.</p>
   <p>On the motion of Mr. J. J. Janda, which was generally approved after a short debate, it was agreed to found classes "C" and "D" in accordance with the permission granted by the laws of the State of Illinois to the Bohemian Building and Loan Societies in which shares are set at $65.00 each, so that it will be possible for depositors to deposit a larger sum of money with the Building and Loan Society and derive the same benefits as one who deposits only small sums. All such shares may be purchased by paying a fee of twenty-five cents for each share and are to be known as single payment shares, which any delegate will cheerfully explain.</p>

   <p>At the conclusion of the discussion of these matters, the meeting proceeded to the election of officers for the United Bohemian Building and Loan Societies for the year 1911. The following gentlemen were elected: Rudolf Mulac, president; Karel Kopecky, vice-president; Konrad Ricker, secretary; Frank G. Hajicek, treasurer. As members of the Board of Directors, the following were elected: John L. Novak, J. J. Janda, Frank J. Petru, A. Vanek, and F. J. Mancl.</p>
   <p>On the motion of Mr. Karel Kopecky, the newly elected officers were immediately installed for the year 1911.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Kopecky expressed the opinion that no reflections be cast upon any society, if through unavoidable circumstances all matters are not in the order they should be, and when these conditions can be corrected by the united effort of the honorable directors of said society. It was unanimously agreed not to found any new societies where they are not <span class="page-break">\6</span>needed because all societies suffer thereby. The public is advised that if there are several societies in any neighborhood which already have existed for some time to deposit its savings in and support these proven societies. It must be otherwise where there are no such societies.</p>
   <p>Five new societies joined the United Bohemian Building and Loan Society at this meeting. Six became members during the past six months. For these societies which have not yet joined the central organization, this should serve as an incentive for them to do so at the earliest opportunity.</p>
