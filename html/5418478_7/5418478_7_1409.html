   <p>The main topic of the conversation in the "Czech California" district is the parade which will be held tomorrow prior to the mass meeting in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, South Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street, to honor our boys in the United States Army. This anticipation will be easily understood, for the entire community is eager to see our boys, who are the pride of the Army and are expected to be its backbone when they arrive in Europe to meet the Germans. They surely will prove that they are worthy of their Czech descent and will contribute to the glory of the Czech name. They will show the defiant Germans that America has found boys upon whom she may rely in this critical hour, and of whom she will be as proud as we are now.</p>
   <p>Our appeal to the residents of the "Czech California" district was not in vain. Our people have decorated their houses and have even induced their neighbors of other nationalities to do likewise. Czech and American colors will prevail.</p>

   <p>The starting point of the parade will be the home of Sokol Chicago; the terminal point the home of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the municipal court, and Mr. Vaclav Jelinek are in charge of the arrangements. The purpose of the parade and the mass meeting is purely patriotic.....Lieut. Perigold of the French Army, speaker at the meeting, has mastered the English language perfectly, and our fellow countrymen will hear him tomorrow. But everyone should be at the parade today and hail our soldier boys when they march from the depot.....</p>
