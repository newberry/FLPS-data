   <p>Practically all of our associations hold their annual meetings in December, at which time new officers are elected for the coming year, and many important national and associational matters are discussed. It is greatly to be desired that these meetings enjoy the largest possible attendance; that a very large percentage of the membership show an interest in the association and its activities; and that the members make their personal contributions to the proper solution of matters taken up by such meetings.</p>
   <p>To all such meetings, letters have been addressed by our national and charitable institutions, such as the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Relief Committee), and many others, with requests for support of their causes. These causes are all very well known to us, are recognized as important, and we all believe that they <span class="page-break">2</span>should be most generously supported. But many of us find it impossible to make individual, personal contributions. However, everyone of us is a member of one or another association whose treasury is easily able to spare a substantial sum of money once a year to institutions whose existence and success are essential to our national existence, or whose upkeep is a dictate of our humane feelings. Therefore, every enlightened member should see to it that such a contribution is made by his association, and with that purpose in mind should attend its annual meeting.</p>
   <p>A large attendance at annual meetings has a most beneficial influence upon the association in many other respects also. Its officers become aware of the members' interest, and are spurred on to energetic work, while indifference on the part of the membership results in the officers' becoming indifferent, also. Poor attendance at meetings is an old complaint of most of our associations. The only valid excuse for absence from an annual meeting should be nothing less than a truly insurmountable obstacle. At least this year, all idle excuses should be stopped and everybody should do his duty.</p>
