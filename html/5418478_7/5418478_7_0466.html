   <p>Numerous members of the lodges of the C.S.P.S. (Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek--Czecho-Slav Aid Society) gathered in the Pilsen (Plzensky) Sokol Hall yesterday to welcome delegates who are arriving from all over the United States to attend the sixteenth general meeting of their brotherhood.</p>
   <p>An "academy" [an affair with music, recitations, and other high-class artistic entertainment] was given in their honor. It began with the overture "Narod Sobe" (The Nation's Gift to Itself), directed by Brother J. V. Soukup, and an address by Brother Jan (John) Pecha, president of the Illinois Grand Lodge of the C.S.P.S., which had arranged the academy. Mr. Pecha extended a welcome and presented Mr. Maclay Hoyne, State's attorney of Cook County, who greeted the delegates in the name of Cook County, as is done in all important rallies in Chicago. The speaker praised the patriotic spirit of the Czechs and their vigorous participation in the Liberty Bond campaigns and in other activities in which they have proved their loyalty. He called attention to the large number of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Czechs in the United States Army and Navy, to which the C.S.P.S. has contributed no less than seven hundred of its members up to today.</p>
   <p>After the address, which was received with heartfelt applause, a little girl from the Bohemian Orphanage recited an inspiring poem with youthful aplomb, and Miss Emily M. Kozeluh let her soprano soar in two songs which added new brilliance to the record of her achievements. Our unsurpassable Delnicky (Czech Workmen's Chorus) placed its tenor soloist, Mr. Malik, at the disposal of the program. He sang his two numbers splendidly and had to give an encore. Mr. Soukup's orchestra merits high praise for several patriotic numbers.</p>
   <p>Brother J. J. Jelinek delivered his speech in the Czech language; it attracted general attention. The audience was entertained by a burlesque, "He Does Not Want to Smoke," in which Messrs. Joseph Jurka and Frank Ort and Mrs. Emily Zahrobsky acted. Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" closed the welcome to the delegates, who will begin their meetings in the Pilsen Sokol Hall today at 9 A.M.</p>
