   <p>After the first session the sixteenth rally of the Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek (Czecho-Slav Aid Society), known as the C.S.P.S., in which matters pertaining to organization were chiefly discussed, the most important points were taken up in the second session yesterday. Brother Vojtisek [spelled Wojtisek in report on the first session] proved himself an excellent presiding officer by his impartial decisions and won the full confidence of the assembled delegates. The latter are obviously giving painstaking attention to the proceedings. They view their various tasks and assignments very seriously. As a result of their devotion, some of the most ticklish questions are being treated in an unbiased, competent <span class="page-break">2</span>manner, tending to promote the interests of the entire brotherhood. Some of the problems before the delegates required much time, which is easily comprehensible in view of the manifold divergence of opinions.</p>
   <p>The entire forenoon yesterday was spent on the proposal to abolish the grand lodges and the office of State trustees and the motion to establish child insurance, which has already been introduced by some Czech brotherhoods and by some of other nationalities. There were many other questions which could not well be discussed, since the various committees, in spite of zealous endeavor, were not ready with their respective reports.</p>
   <p>The session was opened by Mr. V. W. Vojtisek at 9 A.M. The minutes of the first session and the congratulatory messages were read. Of the latter a large number had arrived. They gain in importance by the fact that many contained recommendations in regard to nationalistic, patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>One of these communications came from the American Sokol community's <span class="page-break">3</span>executive committee. It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"We are offering our most cordial wishes for the success of your convention. But we are also approaching you with the request for moral support for our Sokol aims. These turbulent times may have convinced every Czech and enlightened him on the fundamentals of Sokol principles. The results of Sokol education are apparent. They cannot be concealed. A majority of our members and of yours, the pick of our men, are on the battlefield today. Only we old men, youngsters, and women are left behind here. It is up to us to bring up our young people in the true Sokol spirit and to enlighten them concerning their duty toward themselves, our new homeland, and the land of our forefathers.</p>
   <p>"What we request of you is that you point out to your members that our children belong in the Sokol halls, where Czech sentiment will be instilled into their hearts where they will improve their health, where free men and women will be reared from whom your own ranks may be filled again. You know that we are not organizations bent on material profit. You know that dues <span class="page-break">4</span>collected for the membership of children would not, by far, suffice for the maintenance of our Sokol halls. You also know that we offer you no competition because we conduct no insurance business. Do we deserve your support? Assuredly we do!</p>
   <p>"We ask you to give to our request some consideration and to urge your members to send their children to our Sokol halls. Sokol drill should be introduced in all of your Free Thought organizations. You have accomplished much in the sixty years of your brotherhood's existence. You should crown your work by extending your assistance to the Sokol organizations."</p>

   <p>Mr. Prak, secretary of the committee on bylaws, made a report on the proposed abolition of the grand lodges and the State trustees and on child <span class="page-break">5</span>insurance. The delegates voted for the preservation of the grand lodges as a necessity. The motion to abolish the State trustees received 50 votes against 32 opposed, which did not amount to the two-thirds vote required. The State trustees will therefore remain. Child insurance was favored by 72 delegates against 9. The special committee was directed to work out preliminary plans. The question of age limits for membership was referred to a committee.</p>

   <p>The committee on resolutions, the chairman of which is Brother Choma, and Brother Machacek, the secretary, submitted a resolution recommending that request by the Czech Sokol community of America be granted, and that the support needed be given to the Sokol, so that the moral and physical <span class="page-break">6</span>strength of our children may be not only maintained but expanded and augmented.....</p>
