   <p>The payment of all bills, mostly for building work done during the month--including the building of the crematorium--was approved. President [Jan] Pech cautioned the secretary to make a separate record of the latter bills, in order to determine the exact cost of the crematorium as easily and as accurately as possible.....</p>

   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society) has sent in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a letter protesting against the remark of one of the representatives who charged that the Society was supporting people who do not deserve it.

   <p>Mr. Hladovec expressed the wish that a priest, or a Protestant minister, might be tolerated in the Cemetery as a private person, provided he did not use any ceremonial clothing, i. e., that he appear in civilian attire.

As long as neither Freethinkers nor the Cemetery are offended, we should keep hands off.....If a president of a Free-Thought society is permitted to conduct a funeral service, regardless of his inexperience or lack of knowledge, and to behave as clumsily and shamefully as you please, there should be no objection to letting a sectarian present a decent sermon, providing he does not offend anybody. The board agreed with this interpretation.....</p>
