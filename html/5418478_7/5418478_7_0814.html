   <p>As usual the last meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (board of delegates of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association) was held in the hall of the Cesko Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets. The meeting began at 8 P.M. with Mr. Jan Pecha presiding. The secretary, Mr. V. F. Filip, read the minutes of the previous meeting....which were approved. A report of the Decoration Day committee was likewise read and approved. The latter report dealt mainly with the details of the program for the Decoration Day celebration which this year will be unusually entertaining. A letter was received from the Rad Narodni Osvety cis. 27 (National Culture Lodge No. 27) of the Spolky in which a protest was made against the proposed use of the crematory building for lecture purposes. The crematory hall was to be used for such purposes by the local Sdruzeni Svazu Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) during the summer months. As is known to our readers, this question was discussed at the previous meeting of the delegates and left to the decision of the board of directors of the Association. Following a motion made by Mr. Illich "to give the matter a try," Mr. Smejkal, who is a member of the board of directors, announced that the whole matter had been taken up by the proper authorities, and that the board had permitted the lectures [to take place in the crematory building]. During the month of April, $2,775 was received from various individuals for the perpetual care of certain graves, and $50 for the temporary care of certain others. [Here follow the names of these individuals and the amounts in detail] Mr. Smejkal also reported on the financial state of bonds owned by the Association.....A letter was read from the Sbor Ostrostrelcu (Bohemian Sharpshooters) in which it was announced that the organization had disbanded and that it would like to withdraw its membership from the board of delegates of the Association in favor of the board of delegates of the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). After a lengthy and very lively debate in which Messrs. Illich, Smejkal, Zrust, Suchy, Hroch, Rothbauer, and Forst took part, it was decided that this whole affair be deferred till the next regular meeting at which definite steps will be taken. Mr. Smejkal reported that the tower clock is now installed.....The steel safe for the office of the cemetery has likewise been ordered. After all the regular business of this meeting was covered, the president, Mr. Jan Pecha, announced to the assembled delegates that he was leaving for Czechoslovakia to stay two or three months. He asked the delegates to excuse his absences from the meetings of the Sbor and appointed as his representative the vice-president, Mr. Simacek, who will take charge of all meetings. No one doubted the ability of Mr. Simacek to perform the necessary duties. The president also took the opportunity to recall the hard beginnings of the activity of the board of delegates, mentioning some of its oldest workers, about eighty in number, who having passed on ought to be remembered during the celebration on Decoration Day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smejkal, speaking for the entire board, wished Mr. Pecha bon voyage, whereupon the former vice-president, Mr. Ringl, proposed that a sum of money be turned over to the departing president to use according to his own discretion as gifts to indigent Czechoslovaks abroad. In response to this motion the sum of $500 was voted on. Forty-three of the delegates voted for this motion. It was acertained that among those present was Mr. Vojacek, the new delegate of the Moravsky Podporujici Spolek (Moravian Benevolent Society). The new delegate was officially received and welcomed at this time.</p>
   <p>The income [of the Association] during the month of April was $64,401.13; the disbursement for the same period was $31,216.23. Fifteen cemetery lots valued at $4,648 and five urns valued at $592 were sold. One hundred and twenty-five individuals were buried and nine cremated; $960.44 were deposited in the reserve fund. The salaries and wages of the ninety-two cemetery employees and the three officials amounted to $7,992.66.....</p>
