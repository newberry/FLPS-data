   <p>Early in the morning of Decoration Day the Northwestern Depot on Clybourn Avenue was filled with huge crowds of people, some in civilian clothes and some in uniforms, who arrived in a procession and boarded the train to Norwood Park. From there, our Catholic countrymen walked under a bright, shining sun to the St. Adalbert Cemetery, where the yearly ceremonies of Decoration Day were to be performed.</p>
   <p>The celebration was participated in by the united associations of Bohemian Catholic Cadets, the Veterans of Field Marshall Filipovic (First Company), and Camp No. 30 of the Bohemian-American Veterans of the Spanish-American War. These started out from the Cesko-Americka Sin (Bohemian-American Hall) on 18th Street at 8:00 A. M. and, accompanied by the music of the Veterans' Band, marched in a parade through the Bohemian Pilsen district.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>While the members of the associations were boarding the train at the Depot, where they were joined by large numbers of unattached countrymen, quite as large a number of our countrymen and of Poles took streetcars to the end of the Milwaukee Avenue line, where they transferred to cars standing there ready to take them almost to the gates of the Cemetery. All the roads leading to the Cemetery were crowded by other visitors who came in automobiles and in horse-drawn vehicles of all descriptions. All of them were being accosted by ladies who had taken upon themselves the disagreeable duty of soliciting contributions for three different organizations: The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), which held there its usual "Tag Day," the organization of Polish Pani A Divek (Married and Single Women), which collected contributions for the war-devastated parts of Poland, and the united Bohemian Catholic Cadets organizations, who were collecting for the fund to finish Jurecek's splendid monument of Sv. Vaclav (St. Wenceslaws), which it is expected will grace the St. Adalbert Cemetery next year. There was, then, no lack of opportunity to do a good deed for those who, in addition to good will, <span class="page-break">3</span>had well-filled pocketbooks.</p>
   <p>The ways to the Cemetery were lined with stands where the passers-by could purchase flowers, bouquets, flags, and other items for use at the Cemetery, in addition to the indispensable refreshments of various kinds.</p>
   <p>Finally, after eleven o'clock, the roads became less crowded. The multitude had spread throughout the Cemetery, stopping at monumental mausoleums, beautiful statues, and simple crosses adorning the graves along the lanes, walking singly and in colorful groups, so that the whole cemetery gave the impression of a field full of blossoms over which, at short intervals, salvos were being fired in honor of those who died while fighting for the liberty of their new country.....</p>
   <p>Finally, the whole Cemetery resounded with a funeral march played by the <span class="page-break">4</span>Veterans' Band at the main gate to the Cemetery, an indication that the parade had started marching from the old to the new part of the Cemetery, and to the speakers' platform erected upon the elevation directly in front of the Chapel.</p>
   <p>The uniformed associations took their stand in the rear of the platform, posting their flags and standards on the sides, while the multitude stood in front. When the dignitaries had mounted the platform, the celebration proper began with a musical selection, after which the Right Reverend Val. Kohlbeck addressed the audience. He discussed the significance of the celebration, and said that, while it is sweet and proper to die for one's country, it is also proper for the country not to forget those who have given their lives for her. This, he said, is the reason why it is customary in all great nations to honor the memory of their heroes. This was done by the Romans, by the Greeks, by nations that followed them as leaders in civilization, and it is being done by present-day nations, who honor not only their generals, but also their private soldiers <span class="page-break">5</span>who have given their lives for the liberty and prestige of their country. America, too, has set aside a day to honor her fallen warriors. It is Decoration Day, a day on which good Americans assemble in parks of eternal peace in order to honor the memory of their dead--especially soldiers who have lost their lives in the service of the country--and to decorate their graves with flowers. Remarking that the religious and the civic significance of the day will be discussed by other speakers, he introduced, as the first speaker, the Right Reverend Innocent Kestl, vicar of the parish of Blahoslavena Anezka Ceska (Blessed Agnes the Bohemian).</p>
   <p>After remarking that Decoration Day is principally a civic holiday, but that the Church and God had an important part in it, Right Reverend Kestl pointed to the fact that in this cemetery we are standing at the graves of members of three great armies of warriors. One of them is the army of our ancestors, who came into these parts when the country was wild, inhospitable, uninhabited prairies and morasses, where life consisted of one constant struggle with <span class="page-break">6</span>nature, the climate, and various local perils. They came here because of love of liberty and freedom, and waged these struggles in order to prepare the ground for a better, more peaceful and contented life for their descendants. All these first settlers are already in their graves. They were valiant fighters and the first to whom goes our appreciative remembrance. Quiet and peace cannot be had without preceding struggle, and even the most peaceful ones among them had to engage occasionally in a fight, because they lived among fighters who considered it their business to provoke fighting. Next to the Jews it was particularly the Slavs who never sought a fight. History tells us about Sv. Vaclav (St. Wenceslaus), against whom a war was declared by Radslav, the Duke of Zlicko. But St. Wenceslaus, in an endeavor to save the blood of his people, offered Radslav a duel which Radslav accepted and in which Radslav was defeated. This example should be emulated by all of us, because it implies that we should love others enough to protect them, to suffer for them. America, too, had to undertake many a struggle, but most of <span class="page-break">7</span>America's struggles were for liberty, for freedom, and many a noble, gallant soldier lost his life in these struggles. Among these were our countrymen, and they constitute the second army whose members fill the graves of this Cemetery. It is to them that our appreciative remembrance goes in the second place. The third army is composed of all others, all soldiers of Christ who fought their fights with their physical bodies, with the devil, and with the world. They also have found here their eternal peace. They have preceded us in order to serve us as an example. May they be blessed....</p>
   <p>He concluded his speech by calling attention to the statue of St. Wenceslaus which will grace this beautiful Cemetery next year.</p>
   <p>After another salvo, the Right Reverend Kohlbeck introduced Judge John Courtney, who spoke in English. Judge Courtney was substituting for the former Judge Owens, who had sent an excuse. Judge Courtney remarked that it was his particular pleasure to express his congratulations to the Slavs, and particularly to the <span class="page-break">8</span>Bohemians, on the wonderful progress they have made in their new homeland. This progress is due mainly to their love of God, of home, of family, and of education, all of which is apparent in their churches, beautiful dwellings, schools, and many civic and humanitarian institutions. If the Bohemian people will go on as they have so far, they will have a most beautiful future in America, for which the speaker gave them his very best wishes.</p>
   <p>He was followed by the last speaker, Assistant State's Attorney Vaclav Vavra. He selected for his speech the following topic" Silence in a cemetery is golden, for more eloquent are the lives of those who rest therein than any words can be, because their death was nothing more than a transition from the earthly life into eternal glory". He discussed the significance of Decoration Day as a civic and national holiday, and said that the Catholics have an especially important reason to celebrate this American holiday because America was discovered by Catholics--such men as Columbus, Erickson, Joliet, Marquette, La Salle, Duluth, Hennepin, and others are witnesses to that fact. He finished by an <span class="page-break">9</span>appeal to all those present to give substantial contributions to the fund for the completion of the monument of St. Wenceslaus. In this monument the saint will not be shown with a sword in his hand, but as a prince of peace, with his right arm outstretched as in blessing, and the blessing is to his nation, the nation of St. Wenceslaus.</p>
   <p>After another salvo, a community prayer was offered, led by the Right Reverend Innocent Kestl, and a musical selection gave the signal for disbandment.</p>
   <p>Thus ended the beautiful and successful celebration of Decoration Day at St. Adalbert Cemetery. Many participants left for Chicago soon after. But many lingered in the vicinity of the graves in order to visit them again in the afternoon, and spend the beautiful day in the open, with nature, close to the silent, eternal peace....</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Most impressive and stately were the Decoration Day ceremonies at this Cemetery, where so many of our countrymen sleep the sleep from which there is no awakening. This usually so quiet and melancholy necropolis was teeming with a sea of visitors from early morning on, and their numbers increased by every car arriving from Chicago. The ideal weather which prevailed this Decoration Day was the reason that more visitors passed through the Cemetery gates than in any other year. </p>
   <p>The ceremonies were preceded by a parade which started at the parish church of St. Cyril and Methodius at West 50th Street and Hermitage Avenue at 9:30 A.M., and was led by Mr. Jos. R. Vojtech as marshal. The paraders included uniformed members of the Veterans of Field Marshal Baron Filipovic, the Slovak Veterans of Crown Prince Rudolph, led by Mr. Jos. Kovac, a police squad, and the bands <span class="page-break">11</span>bands of Mr. Ferd, Lhotak and Mr. Cerny. The parade marched through Town of Lake and 47th Street to Western Avenue, where streetcars were boarded which took the paraders to the Cemetery. Here the parade was awaited by a great multitude of people, who marched with it to the platform erected in the center of the Cemetery. There the ceremonies opened with the playing of the Bohemian National Anthem.</p>
   <p>The multitude was welcomed by Mr. Jos. R. Vojtech, who was the principal Bohemian speaker. Mr. Vojtech is known as an accomplished orator, and his speech was excellent, indeed. Said he:</p>
   <p>"Reverend Father, Judge McGoorty, dear friends! I welcome you in the name of all those who rest here in the Lord, and thank you for having come here in such large numbers to honor our departed friends. It seems that the attendance <span class="page-break">12</span>at this celebration is growing from year to year. We Bohemians and Slovaks celebrate Decoration Day, as good Americans, in the American manner. Our great Republic celebrates Decoration Day, the thirtieth day of May, in commemoration of the end of the Civil War, when, in 1868, the Commander in Chief of the American Armies, General Logan, issued an order by which the thirtieth of May was dedicated to the memory of heroes who had lost their lives in that war. Two years ago, from this platform, I talked about our brother Slavs, the gallant Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bulgarians, who fought so valiantly with their archenemy, the Turk, defeated him completely, and chased him almost entirely out of Europe, leaving him only a small piece of land from Chatalja to his Capital. Constantinople. What happened next? Through intrigue and misrepresentations, German diplomacy instigated a war between the former allies, Serbia and Bulgaria, with the result that the Turk has taken back almost everything he had previously lost to them. This year we have a war which is almost universal and every one of us follows eagerly the gigantic struggle between the nations of the world. One single ruler is waging a war for supremacy with <span class="page-break">13</span>practically the whole of Europe, and may be waging it with the whole world in the near future. And again the small Serbian nation is involved, solely because it is not willing to become destroyed and annihilated by a much stronger foe. If that aggressor should win this war, it would have most terrible results for our dear old country--for the people in beautiful Bohemia, rich Moravia and Silesia, as well as Slovakia. They would not be permitted to use their--our own--native language in the streets, would not be able to send their children to schools where their language is used, and so our nation would disappear.</p>
   <p>"Hence, we again express the wish that our Slavic brothers may come victorious out of this terrible war. Here I should like to ask one thing, that next year, and all years thereafter, this may be a common celebration, participated in both by the Bohemians and the Slovaks. The way it is now is not the proper way, and the celebration loses a great deal of its dignity--in fact, it is <span class="page-break">14</span>being spoiled. The reason is that the Bohemian and the Slovak platforms are too close to each other. After a Slovak speech, the band may start playing, drowning the voice of the Bohemian speaker, or vice versa. It is still worse when things happen as they did last year. The Slovak celebration was through before the Bohemian one, and the Slovak parade marched with music right close by the Bohemian platform where the Reverend Thomas J. Bobal was just delivering his sermon. He had to stop and wait--a really unpleasant occurrence...</p>
   <p>"I should like to ask our clergymen to help us bring this about. I should also ask all our Bohemian Catholic, uniformed and non-uniformed, men's organizations to participate, as bodies, in this celebration next year, and always in the future.</p>
   <p>"Now, I thank you, our dear comrades--veterans, for visiting every year on this day the graves of our brothers. There are fourteen of them buried in this Cemetery. Decorate their last abodes with American flags! Now you will hear our <span class="page-break">15</span>English speaker, Judge McGoorty, and after him our Reverend Bobal will preach a sermon and offer prayers for all those who rest here in peace."</p>
   <p>Mr. Vojtech's speech was listened to most attentively and made a deep impression on the whole audience. After the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," Judge McGoorty was introduced. His selection as speaker was a most fortunate one. Judge McGoorty is a very strong and sympathetic speaker, his talks are always profound, and all his thoughts well presented. His speech was marked with a great deal of patriotic enthusiasm, and was very flattering to us, the Bohemians. Therefore it is given here in full.</p>
   <p>"The remembering of the dead is a beautiful custom. Today we have gathered together to honor the heroes who have given their lives for their country. This is a moment when patriotism is being awakened, when the love of one's country is being strengthened, when the atmosphere of American liberty inspires deeds of patriotism.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>"Many times the question has been asked why the Bohemian people have migrated from their beautiful country, away from her lovely mountains, valleys, and rivers--a country rich in glorious history, a country whose literature entrances the whole world.</p>
   <p>"There is only one answer to this question: On the western shores of the Atlantic Ocean a government has been created in which the people alone have the ultimate decision--this Western Republic, with a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. Since its very beginning, our country has beckoned to the people of all lands, telling them that this United States is a country of hope, a country of freedom, a country of opportunity. And thus, with people of other lands, the Bohemian people also have come to us. First the great Herman and Filip came, and hundreds and thousands have followed.</p>
   <p>"There are today over 150,000 Bohemians in Chicago, and they have become a most important factor in our municipal life. The Bohemian people have been, <span class="page-break">17</span>and are doing a great civilizing work. They are building churches, schools, and colleges; have their own important newspapers printed in the Bohemian language; have their own music festivals. I have been many times entranced by their folk songs, the rich melodies of their music, the culture and civility of their people when gathered together to celebrate one of our American, or one of their own Bohemian, national holidays.</p>
   <p>"This wonderful city of ours, with its cosmopolitan population composed of all nations of Europe, is the soul of the United States. No citizens of ours have been more loyal, and more gladly willing to defend this country when her Star-Spangled Banner was in danger than those whose cradle stood abroad. A few months ago I, as chief judge of the Superior Court, was presented by our veterans with a beautiful silk flag. It is one of my duties as a judge of the Superior Court to issue citizenship papers to our immigrants. It is an inspiring moment when the applicant for citizenship grasps the pole of that beautiful flag and, in the overcrowded courtroom, swears, with his right hand <span class="page-break">18</span>raised to the sky, allegiance to his new country.</p>
   <p>"Today, our Bohemians, hand in hand and heart to heart with their American fellow citizens, celebrate the memory of our dead. Let us honor those dead for the sacrifices they have made, for the bravery they have proved, and may glory be to their memory. Inspired by their devotion we thank God that peace and happiness is supreme in this country at a time when the great countries of Europe are covered with a shroud of death. We are happy to enjoy friendly relations with our neighbors and with the whole world. May God strengthen the hand of our President in this most serious period in the history of the whole world, so that he may make the United States shine as an example for the whole world, that the blessings of peace may be always ours, that we may always remain loyal to the principles of liberty which we have inherited from our forebears, and which our constitution guarantees."</p>
   <p>The inspiring talk of Judge McGoorty was followed by a choral rendition of the <span class="page-break">19</span>Slavic hymn presented by the group of singers led by Mr. F. B. Broma. The formal sermon of the celebration was preached by the Right Reverend Thomas J. Bobal of the Bohemian parish of St. Cyril and Methodius, one of our patriotic priests who never misses an opportunity to show his love of everything that is Bohemian. He gave a most excellent sermon, which was followed by prayers for the deceased who have found their last resting place in the Resurrection Cemetery.</p>
   <p>The program on the platform was concluded by a musical selection played by Mr. Lhotak's band, and the multitude dispersed to visit the graves. The Bohemian veterans decorated the fourteen graves of their deceased comrades with flags in the American national colors, all others with flowers. They all, however, stopped in silence and remembered their departed friends with a kind, prayerful thought.</p>
