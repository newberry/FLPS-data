   <p>Today we can call the grave decorating ceremonies on the Bohemian National Cemetery a national May celebration.</p>
   <p>Our Bohemian people meet every year on the 30th day of May in this holy place to pay homage to the memory of our departed countrymen, who took up arms in defense of the Union and to further encourage sound activity in the national field.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's celebration was attended by such a large number of Bohemians, that it was necessary to dispatch two trains for the accomodation of the visitors.</p>
   <p>When the first shots in defense of this Union of ours were heard, it was again the inflamable heart of the Slavic race, which answered and hundreds of Bohemians took up arms in defense of the freedom of this land. We repeat once more that judging from the many laudatory notices here and there, the May celebration hereafter will be our most popular national celebration.</p>

   <p>May 30th will be dedicated to the visiting of the National Cemetery and we expect the attendance to be even greater next year.</p>
