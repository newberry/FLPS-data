   <p>The great American nation declared its independence on the fourth day of July, 1776. It placed the fate of its great Republic and the government of its affairs into the hands of its free people. The country of the free became the refuge of the weak and oppressed. Multitudes from every corner of the world wandered to the shores of the promised land to live a free and more beautiful life than could be offered them by their subjugated countries.</p>
   <p>One million sons and daughters of the land of our birth live under the starry banner today, under the light and sun of this beautiful land. They have built their houses on the fertile soil of the farms, and in cities as well. And here they are rearing their children. We have been rearing them to revere both the old homeland and this country which has become our new homeland.</p>
   <p>This new country of ours has lovingly supported us and has taught us to brave whatever life may bring. It has instilled into us the joy of life in a free country. This country has never taken our rights away from us, it has never obstructed our path in the pursuit of cultural progress. Like a good mother it has extended a helping hand wherever needed, and has given lavishly of material and spiritual goods.</p>
   <p>A new time has come. Noble as ever in its glorious history, this Republic has risen to fight for a better future for mankind. The same banner that the people waved in 1776 is being held aloft over the whole world by President Wilson. The ideals for which the best sons of the Republic shed their blood in 1776 are held up today by the President as the ideals of the entire world.</p>
   
   <p>This country has been intrusted with a noble task. Its children have come from all over the world to escape slavery. The soul of America is therefore the soul of the whole world, and the pains of the world have ever been soothed here.</p>
   <p>During this vast struggle it was America which opened the gates for the sad children of the world to Americanize them in the noblest sense of the word, i. e., to give them bread and to give them liberty.</p>
   <p>The Czech people of America are proud of being called on to assist in this great task and to work under their beloved President for his glorious aims. The Czechs pledge themselves to unwavering fealty; and they promise to persist for the sake of ultimate victory.</p>
   <p>The history of our nation reveals a continual battle for the ideal promulgated by President Wilson on April 2, 1917, before the American Congress and the whole world: The world must be saved for democracy! Sons of the Czech nation died for this principle when they fought under the banner of John Hus. Our brothers are suffering for it now on the banks of the Vltava in Russia, on the banks of the Marne, and on the banks of Piave. </p>
   <p>We are happy that we can stand, our hearts filled with joy, behind the flag of the United States--united in the sacred struggle for the sacred rights of mankind.</p>
   <p>Therefore, on the Fourth of July, the Czech people, a branch of the subjugated nations, will step before America and its President to testify to their loyalty to, and their reverence for, the country which is making such magnificent sacrifices upon the altar of mankind. They want to proclaim their adherence to the nation whose President has lifted right over might, love over violence, and good over evil.</p>
   <p>On the Fourth of July all Czechs should show that their men, women, and children stand in solid, serried ranks behind their President, ready for any sacrifice. Let there be not one Czech soul who would not deem it the greatest obligation to bow before the glorious traditions and the spirit of the American nation. Farmers, as well as people from cities, should remember that the slogan of July the Fourth is:</p>
   <p>He is not a good citizen--that Czech is an enemy of this country--who will not participate in the manifestation of the Czechoslovak people to the Republic of the United States and its President.</p>
   <p>Our celebrations will be held everywhere. We are calling on all Czech settlements to celebrate in an impressive, dignified manner. We are asking them for the sake of the Czech name which has won such praise for all that we have done for our new country in this war, at the time when the country's honor and the liberty of the world are at stake. This call should be heard in Washington--a call of trust, love, and determination to persist until the moment when the President's great presage has come true, when the nations will rejoice over the possession of their free land, and the world will be safe for democracy.</p>
   <p>The manifesto of loyalty by the Czechoslovak people will be heard in all places where Czechoslovaks live. Go there in numbers of thousands so that you too may be counted among those who bear on their emblem this slogan:</p>
   <p>The Czechs are the first in contest, the first at work, the first in sacrifice, and they surpass all other nations in gratitude to their new country.</p>
