   <p>Yesterday's sessions terminated the second interdenominational convention, which was held in Chicago from the 21st to the 25th of this month. In the forenoon a meeting was held at the Bohemian Settlement by the Presbyterian workers, together with the secretaries of the various boards of the Presbyterian churches. A committee for the commemoration of the anniversary of the burning at the stake of Jan Hus was elected at that meeting. A dinner was served at the First Methodist Church, after which the delegates returned to the Settlement. This was followed by a sight-seeing trip, on which the delegates became acquainted with the beauties of our city. A stop was made at the luxurious new Presbyterian church, on Lincoln Boulevard at Delaware Street, where at present the general assembly of the Presbyterian church is in session, and where more than twelve hundred delegates from the Presbyterian churches are in attendance.</p>
   <p>A committee, composed of Dr. V. Pisek, Reverend J. Pokorny, Dr. V. Losa and Reverend V. Vanek, was introduced to this gathering at about four o'clock in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the afternoon. After the emotional speeches of Dr. V. Pisek and other Bohemian speakers, it was decided to discuss the Jan Hus Memorial celebration. Americans expect to honor our great leader in the following manner: In the sessions of the general assembly which will meet during the month of May next year, one day will be set apart for the exclusive celebration of the memory of Jan Hus. In addition to this all Presbyterian churches will designate the first Sunday in May of next year for the same purpose. The American churches also intend to collect about $100,000, which will be delivered in 1915 by American representatives of the church to the Bohemian churches in Bohemia.</p>
   <p>In the evening a lecture was given, illustrated by stereopticon views of Bohemia. The lecturer was Reverend K. V. Miller of New York, who, prompted by love for our people during his short stay in Bohemia (altogether about thirteen months), learned the Bohemian language. The lecture was the more interesting because it expressed the viewpoint of an American and also because it enabled us to see pictures of our dear native land,an opportunity we have <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>not had during previous lectures. All the members of the audience were amazed by the correct and perfect knowledge of the Bohemian language shown by Miss E. Davis, who is the principal of a school in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. It is wonderful what love for a people and God can accomplish.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the lecture all those present were invited to participate in the excursion to Bohemia, which is to take place under the leadership of Dr. V. Pisek in June of next year, at which time, in accordance with the desires of all delegates, and God willing, there will be held in New York the Convention of the United Slavonic Evengelical Churches of America.</p>
