   <p>We heartily welcome the participation of the Czech Catholics in the action for the liberation of our people. Their activities are of paramount importance. They are too dear to every Czech heart to allow us to become split into diverse parties and sundry camps, antagonistic towards each other When the peace negotiations shall be settled we shall be in a position to show that every Czech, regardless of creed or political convictions, stands resolutely for the liberation of the Czech nation, and for the right to guide its own destinies, so that it will cease to play the role of Cindrella in its own homeland. Had the Czech Catholics not emphatically declared themselves for Czech independence, the enemies of our nation could have pointed out that there is a powerful party among the Czechs which is satisfied with the present conditions. Now, however, the Czech-American Catholics are spokesmen and representatives of the Czech Catholic people, just as are all <span class="page-break">\2</span>other Czechs, who demand the liberation of the nation. This concord of voices will surely be heeded.</p>
