   <p>All Czechoslovak Legionnaires who desire their demobilization papers in the English language are asked to call for them in the office of the secretary of the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Czechoslovak Legionnaires, Chicago Post). You may come on any day after 5 P. M. except Saturday. On Saturdays the office is open until noon only. Every local Chicago Legionnaire should call personally, for only out-of-town papers will be mailed.</p>
   <p>With fraternal wishes,</p>
   <p>Albert Houska, secretary,</p>
   <p>3222 West 23rd Street, </p>
