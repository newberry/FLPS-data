   <p>The unjust treatment meted out to John Huss by the Council of Constance is a matter of deep regret to all just and upright people.....</p>
   <p>Therefore, every just and upright man and woman has the right to commemorate the anniversary of John Huss' martyr death. He should be celebrated as a martyr for the cause of freedom of conscience, freedom of investigation and research in religious and philosophical matters, and as a victim of human injustice.....</p>
   <p>In order to make a proper celebration possible for every freethinking Bohemian, the Ustredni Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Spolku Pro Oslavy Husovy (Central Association of Free Thought Associations for Commemoration of John Huss' Anniversary) <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>has issued some beautiful pictures of John Huss. These pictures are reproductions of drawings by J. Kosar. The price is low, only fifteen cents each.</p>
   <p>By the publication of these pictures the Ustredni Sdruzeni endeavors to help in making the John Huss celebrations dignified in every respect. John Huss' picture should not be missing in any freethinker's home. It should have the first place among all other pictures in the home, so that at the first glance all those in the home and those visiting the home may be reminded of the celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the death at the stake of John Huss, and of the future duties of every freethinker.</p>
   <p>The Ustredni Sdruzeni makes an appeal also to the general Bohemian public to decorate their windows and all the windows in Bohemian stores with the pictures of John Huss. Let us make this action so general that there will not be a house, a building of any description, without a John Huss picture. Every non-Bohemian coming into a district inhabited by Bohemians must become aware that something unusual is taking place, that this is the Bohemians' great holiday. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>decoration should also awaken the interest of those among us who, up to that time, have remained indifferent.</p>
   <p>That the proper decoration will make the celebration more colorful has been best recognized by our countrymen in Hawthorne. Their [sic] secretary, Mr. Zaloudek, writes us: "We agreed in our recent meeting that all our members will decorate their windows with pictures of John Huss, and will require all other Bohemians in Hawthorne to do likewise."</p>
   <p>The same principle should be adopted in all of our other districts. The secretary, or any other member, should pick up the pictures at Brother Prudik's at 1850 South Allport Street, or at the office of the Sdruzeni, and distribute them among all Bohemian families in his section, at the same time collecting the small amount of their price.</p>
   <p>It is expected particularly that our California, and our Plzen (Pilsen) will be richly decorated.</p>
