   <p>The collection of the Svatovaclavska Dan (St. Wenceslaus Tax), destined to be used for the benefit of our Catholic press, our poor students, and our cultural-religious causes in general, which our Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) started in the last week of September in the entire United States, progressed very slowly. At some places, for various understandable reasons, the collection was poor, and therefore the financial success of the Svatovaclavska Dan has not been as great as we expected. But the moral success of the Svatovaclavska Dan is really great, and the heart of every Bohemian Catholic of America is filled with joy and hope for the future. The collection of the Svatovaclavska Dan was concluded in December, 1920.....</p>
   <p>The total amount collected for the Svatovaclavska Dan of 1920 is nearly twenty-two thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>First place in this collection goes to the Chicago district, where the sum <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of $5,334.84 was collected; the Texas district is second with $2,632.20; the Nebraska district is third with $1,919.40; the Cleveland district is fourth with $1,626; the St. Paul district is fifth with $1,485.64; the St. Louis district is sixth with $1,291.75; the Kansas district is seventh with $1,283.50; the New York district is eighth with $1,130.37; the Detroit district is ninth with $812.05; the Wisconsin district is tenth with $759.34; the North Dakota district is eleventh with $746.25; the Baltimore district is twelfth with $672.05. [There follows a long list of districts in the order of their ranking in the contest.]</p>
   <p>That is the preliminary survey of the results of the collection of the Svatovaclavska Dan according to districts. As far as individual parishes are concerned, we will publish the detailed report later in our monthly organ, Hlidka (Sentinel). We publish this report so that our people may be correctly informed about the results of the collection of our Svatovaclavska Dan, and so that they may form their own opinions about how various districts worked for this noble project of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku.</p>

   <p>But before any judgment is passed, it is absolutely necessary to know how many parishes there are in this or that district, as well as the financial condition of the various districts. Only then will such criticism be just.</p>
   <p>For the special committee of the Svatovaclavska Dan, </p>
