   <p>In the most beautiful weather and with the delegates in a holiday mood, the annual inspection of our National Cemetery was held yesterday morning. The delegates, led by the officers of the association and the members of the Board of Directors, had an opportunity personally to inform themselves concerning the work accomplished at our Cemetery during the past year of which they have only heard at the monthly meetings of the association; they also learn of the work which is going to be undertaken for the improvement of our national park in the future. Yes, park indeed, because our Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) is a beautiful place where there is nothing which would depress the mind, nothing which would call to mind the thought that you, step by step, are passing the grave of either a friend or of an unknown countryman, who in their graves are quietly dreaming in their eternal sleep.</p>
   
   <p>A sublime quietude prevails around; the weeping willows bend down above the graves and a line of grave and silent men winds through upon the white roads of the Cemetery. They are the delegates of our national societies and organizations who, besides their obligations toward their own societies, have also taken upon their shoulders another responsibility, that is, the management of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov. It is a real responsibility because the Cemetery is growing to enormous dimensions, and whoever has seen the great new section, which has just been prepared and is now ready to be opened, will agree with us. The number of employees is also increasing, and anyone who is not familiar with the prevailing conditions would have been surprised to hear the superintendent's remark that, during the recent hot weather period, there were almost forty-five men employed daily to sprinkle the grounds. The great consumption of water also brought forth a question concerning the regulation of the river, which needs to be deepened in order that plenty of water shall be on hand for the use of the Cemetery during the hot summer months. The chairman explained this matter, and called the attention of the delegates to the fact that the Board of Directors had decided to tackle the job itself with the Cemetery personnel for the reason that, in the first place, as he said, there is a chance to save some money by not awarding the job to a contractor, and in the second place, jobs will thus be provided for our unemployed countrymen.</p>
   <p>Special attention was given to the inspection of a peice of land owned by the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), which piece of land is being offered for sale by the said association to the Cemetery. An impartial observer has carried away an opinion that the well-known Spice (Point) is not suitable for cemetery purposes, and the majority of the delegates were of the opinion that the entire piece of land should be bought, of course, as the chairman said, if the price is reasonable. The price must be reasonable, not perhaps that the Board of Directors would not take into consideration the fact that in this transaction it would be dealing with a fraternal charitable institution, but in order that the Board of Directors should not be blamed, some time in the future, for lack of business acumen. If the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec is to be given a donation, then it should be done in the form of a gift and not by overpayment for land. But in general the mood which prevailed among those who were present and among the members of the Board of Directors seemed to be favorable toward the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, and every supposition that a disagreement exists between the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova and the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcinec is not true. Since it was then past noon, the delegates, pretty well tired out, were invited by the members of the Board of Directors to a dinner which was prepared for them in the cozy restaurant of Mr. Bezchleba.</p>
   <p>After the excellent dinner, a friendly conversation followed. In the course of the conversation a little surprise was arranged for one of the oldest delegates and members of the Board of Directors, Mr.[J.] Smejkal. Mr. Smejkal, who celebrated his sixty-second birthday anniversary yesterday, was presented by the superintendent of the Cemetery with a bouquet of sixty-two beautiful roses. The chairman of the association, Mr. Jan Pecha, also made a brief speech, in which he outlined the record of Mr. Smejkal's activity as member of the Board of Directors in behalf of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov for the past twenty-five years. Evidently touched, Mr. Smejkal thanked the delegates, and in his speech described the hardship which they had had to go through at the beginning of the association, which at that time was four thousand dollars in debt. He also said that he had been a delegate for the past thirty-four years, and that he hopes to be a delegate for another sixteen years, when, as he said, he will retire......</p>
   <p>The delegate and orator of the Svobodomyslna Obec (Bohemian Free Thought Community of America), Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, at the invitation of the chairman, then took the floor and said that the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov is not only beautiful but its beauty is centered in the deeds of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova, which supports all our national and charitable causes. He also expressed the firm hope that continuous support will be given by the Sbor to these causes in the future. The chairman, Mr. Jan Pecha, replying to the speaker, thanked him and commended him as an orator and lecturer. The chairman himself then took the floor. In his speech he defended his activity and the activity of the entire Board of Directors, which never does anything without the the approval of the Sbor. He correctly stated that the entire power lies in the hands of the delegates, who have the right to elect to office any man they wish, and the right to reject any proposal which they do not like; that the Board of Directors must submit to their decisions. All that had been accomplished had been done with the consent of the delegates. That his speech was comprehended was proven by the tremendous applause.....</p>
   <p>The chairman then bade the delegates adieu and adjourned the meeting.</p>
