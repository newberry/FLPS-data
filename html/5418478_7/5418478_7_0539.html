   <p>A meeting of three hundred representatives of Czech organizations, members of the Czech National Alliance of the Chicago district, was held in the hall of Sokol Havilcek-Tyrs, Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street, last night. It was called for the purpose of debate and discussion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Jakoubek, chairman of the Chicago district of the Czech National Alliance, explained that the purpose of the meeting was to instill enthusiasm into the patriotic work of our fellow citizens, in order that the activities of the Czech National Alliance may produce the best results. He introduced Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, who addressed the gathering as follows:</p>
   <p>"At the outbreak of the war when the Czech National Alliance was created, we communicated with Professor Thomas G. Masaryk and joined him in the work for the liberation of the old homeland. There were tremendous obstacles which confronted this organization during the early days of its existence. Since the English-speaking Americans did not recognize us, the burden of financing the enterprise rested mainly upon the shoulders of the Czechs in America. The next step was to convince the American people that, though we are a small nation, we are not 'Bohemians' in the sense that the term is used by some nations of Europe, to designate the gypsies. We had to convince America that We were a highly civilized and cultured people. This was a difficult problem. The Austrians, Poles,and Italians had succeeeded, by continuous effort in being regarded as distinct nations; they had large amounts of money at their disposal and were well known in their communities. The names of these nationalities appeared in the largest dailies, but we--we were unknown.</p>
   <p>"The foreign countries, especially Western Europe, did not know us, simply because the label "Austrians" disfigured our foreheads. However, because of the untiring efforts, first of individuals and then of groups, we have gradually succeeded in reaching our goal. Now, after more than ten years of strenuous effort, we have reached the position enjoyed by other nations.</p>
   
   <p>"Life and blood as well as money are necessary to continue the work which was begun in America.</p>
   <p>"This work must be brought to a triumphant finish! Thanks to the fact that our people have grasped the significance of the situation, Masaryk was not disappointed by us, and I firmly believe that he never will be disappointed. All the money goes through the hands of that man and through nobody else's. We have to create new funds which must be larger and more extensive. An immense task looms before us and, when the peace negotiations begin, we shall sit up and watch intently.</p>
   <p>"The Magyars and the Germans are working against us, and our extreme efforts are needed to overwhelm those deadly enemies. The Jugoslavs possess one million dollars, and we Czech-Americans must not lag behind. The goal which New York set, the collection of one million dollars, we Chicagoans must also adopt. Mr. Joseph Tvrzicky, our secretary, and Vojta Benes, our organizer, will inform you about the work to be done.</p>
   
   <p>"What we have accomplished was done for the homeland and for you, Czech-Americans. The work which was begun after a struggle of two years, often against our own people, is beginning to bear fruit. We were being brushed aside as 'Gypsies' and 'Bohemians', scorned, and disrespected. We did not show our force. We prided ourselves on our sufferings and exhibited only our shackles. We did not show that we wanted to shed them; we did not think of liberty. Thousands of our people were dying on the gallows, and, in the beginning, we had to look on powerless.</p>
   <p>"A change has taken place in America and abroad; great newspapers, which would hear nothing of us before, now devote long editorials to our people. Washington [D.C.] has recognized our right to liberty. Publicity is necessary in the movement for the liberation of our old homeland, and every Czech should therefore become a member of our organization. I am not the only man who declares this, for prominent native Americans are of the same opinion. History will show the great value of the work in military and political fields done by the Czech National Alliance. (Thanks to our Sokol organizations! They were the first to grasp the great importance of the task put before the Alliance, and they will be among the first to give their blood on the battlefields for our old homeland and for our new one as well. These remarks are supplied by the reporter of this newspaper.) We never expected to tread a path strewn with roses; quit the reverse, for we knew that there would be obstacles placed before us and aspersions cast on us. Unfortunately this was done even by our own fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>"This does not astonish me. In the first place our people were disappointed repeatedly. However, I can proudly declare today that this gap, caused by distruct, is bridged now. In the second place, there was the unsavory affair of Dr. Iska, now forgotten as far as we are concerned. There was, in addition, the Duerich-Horky affair, about which I have previously issued public statements. Duerich was expelled from the Czech National Council in a conference presided over by Thomas G. Masaryk himself. Duerich's malfeasances came within a hairsbreadth of wrecking the whole structure of the work accomplished during the last three years by our leader Masaryk. We had no hand in the expulsion. We had no right to set ourselves up as judges, but Masaryk will stand up before our nation and give the reasons for this act. Our duty and our appeal to you are contained in the words, 'Continue in the performance of the work as begun by the Czech National Alliance!'.....Gratitude will be the reward to Czech-America for having so thoroughly grasped the task of liberating our dear old homeland."</p>
   <p>It was evident that Dr. Fisher's address made a deep impression upon the listeners.</p>
   <p>Vojta [Adalbert] Benes, schoolteacher, untiring worker, and undaunted fighter for our cause, now addressed the gathering: "Two considerations led us to ask you to be present at this meeting: First, the war which the United States has entered; second, the realization that an important affair has arisen--the Horky-Benes case. I shall not speak of it, although it involved me and my family to such a degree that a blot was placed upon our name. If my name is blackened no one can remove the blemish; and neither you nor anybody else can pass judgment on me. The time will come, however, when it till be determined what I really was. If an army has poor generals, they are replaced by others. The Czech National Alliance has the right to decide upon the continuance of its policy, and whether, after three years of work, we should step aside and let others take our posts. A clever speaker might be able to present a sugar-coated lie to you, and you would be willing to sacrifice your life for it. Therefore, I say to you: 'Go home, fathom your conscience, and then pass judgment on me or someone else.'</p>
   <p>"Our Czech people have won a victory over themselves; they have learned that liberty is what they need most. Ten millions weep in Bohemia--fourteen days ago they risked their lives because they had become surfeited with the conditions there.....Doctor Iska was not a friend; he did take the attitude of an enemy but was looked upon as such by your people. Horky, on the other hand, was a friend, and this fact warns us to be more cautious. I may have hurt him, but I benefited him still more. Today nothing else remains but to drop the whole affair.</p>
   <p>"The work done in Chicago rested upon the shoulders of individuals who labored day and night. Our bazaar, though a great success, was criticized because certain things did not turn out as they should have. One must consider the short space of time--four weeks--available for the preparations and preliminary arrangements which exhausted the most zealous workers. It was our first event of this kind, and it demanded a colossal amount of work. We will have to create fixed organizations of workers and prominent men among us for this sort of endeavor. Every organization in and around Chicago should select a man or woman to join other representatives in a permanent committee which will take care of bazaars and similar events. We intend to give a Posviceni (Czech National Feast) in Chicago.....</p>
   
   <p>"We are now working on an address book of the Czech inhabitants and businessmen of Chicago. New York has outdone us in some respects. It has fifteen thousand members of the Czech National Alliance. How about us? There are 150,000 Czechs in Chicago. We have bankers who keep funds in their vaults. Let us ask them to help us, for instance, to print a wall calendar. It should be a Czech National calendar for the year 1918. Let us do everything to show our people how the work of our organization is being executed.</p>
   <p>"Ask the organizations for speakers--we shall be ready for you and tell you all about the work. We are being reprimanded for not revealing where the money goes. We answer this as nearly as we can: All the money is entrusted to Professor Masaryk and no one else. We also print various publications, some of which cost twenty to thirty thousand dollars per year. One of them if the Monde Slave (Slavonic World) published by Professor Denis in Paris, France. We publish booklets which we send over the whole world. Ten to fifteen thousand copies go to England, Italy, Russia, and even to Japan. We maintain a press bureau in Rome, Italy, to show the Italians that we are not their enemies, a fact of which they are aware by now. We support our representatives properly so they will not be mistaken for delegates from a nation of beggars. You are at liberty to question Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanke about the struggle it cost us to get into the English language press. That is where our money goes. We show the figures only, but let us remember that a revolution of any nation costs money. Neither Dr. Fisher, nor I myself, nor anyone else knows where the remainder of the money goes, except that it goes to our trusted Masaryk; that is sufficient for us. We will not expend our valuable time in finding out, for we have work to do and we hope that you will support our activities.</p>
   <p>"May this meeting bring about a concerted action of all our organizations.</p>
   
   <p>If, within two or three months, each group will select a committee which is willing to work, then we are certain that every Czech and every one of our organizations is fulfilling its duties to our people. Let our slogan be: Always dutiful to the homeland, to the nation; always in readiness for service to the Czech National Alliance!"</p>
   <p>It is needless to state that Mr. Vojta Benes's address was received with great enthusiasm and the heartiest response by the assembly. No less hearty approval was evoked by the following address delivered by Mr. Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, which we are quoting as accurately as possible.</p>
   <p>"Three years have elapsed since, on the eve of the World War, Czech Chicago demonstrated against the attack by Austria on the small Serbian nation. Everyone felt that this assault was not aimed at Serbia alone, but at Austria's own Slavonic peoples, particularly the Czechs. The dormant sentiment of hostility toward Austrian tyranny, fanned by elemental forces, resounded in a tempestuous demonstration such as Czech Chicago had never before witnessed. That manifestation of protest and sympathy for the Serbian nation and for our own was soon to be transformed into the nucleus of a powerful unit in a worldwide movement for Czechoslovak independence. Our awakening resulted in the salvation of Czech-America, for we found within ourselves a powerful impulse, impetuous at first, and then settling into a firm and stable stream of outstanding accomplishments. Today our accomplishments are demonstrated not only in the life of Czech-America, but also in the opinions which America and the Allies have formed about our Czech-American branch. Let us admit to ourselves that our work for Czechoslovak independence is putting down new roots. When was it that Czech-America ever felt so united, powerful, and full of virility?</p>
   <p>"The Czech National Alliance has done its duty. In its early days our organization consisted only of representatives of our Czech National Council, comprised of the Czech American Press Bureau, and the Auxiliary Committee [for the relief of war-stricken Slavonic countries]. Later its spirit found a way into the widest strata of our people. It was only natural that during its initial activities the Council was accused of hide-and-go-seek tactics; of breach of neutrality; and also of assuming the responsibility for a movement which threw men into prison and drove them to the scaffold. Those were bitter moments when it was impossible for us to explain, argue, or prove our case.</p>
   <p>"The Czech National Alliance, which was founded to accomplish actual work, considered it its sacred duty to continue in the pursuit of the original aims. A large part of the work has benefited not only the old homeland, but the new one as well. Not only did the Alliance abide by the neutrality laws, but it also prepared citizens of Czech descent for the advent of the United States into the World War. Not only did the Alliance uphold the interests of the States, but it also rendered valuable services to the cause of democracy. These services are being recognized more fully by our friends abroad than by ourselves.</p>
   <p>"Even the most severe censure that was ever directed against the work done by the Czech National Alliance has lost its validity today. With their eyes focused upon the future, our workers had been anxiously awaiting that historic moment which occurred a few days ago. I refer to the moment last month when the Czech writers in the old country openly declared themselves for the independence of Czech lands. It was an event of extreme gratification to us.</p>
   <p>This declaration was soon followed by others from Czechs of all walks of life who welcomed the United States as an ally of our brothers, the Russians, who just recently were rejuvenated as a nation. The Czech representatives in the Austrian parliament openly proclaimed that a union of Czech and Slovak lands into an independent state was their program.</p>
   
   <p>"When all this happened, the satisfaction of the Czech National Alliance was complete, and this organization began to work with renewed zeal and vigor.</p>
   <p>"All strata of the Czech people are united now, and we in America can say the same for ourselves. If there is still a trace of opposition, here and there, against our movement, it only serves to prove the rule. We are bound together today, not by mere agreement and harmony alone, but by common duty as well. We do not have to make sacrifices; we have only to fulfill our simple obligations.</p>
   <p>"The Czechs in the eastern part of the United States have set as their goal a fund of one million dollars. The Czechs and Slovaks of Chicago will surely do their duty. The startling enthusiasm which burst forth three years ago will certainly lead to victory and the independence of the old homeland. We are determined to follow that road to the realization of our purpose."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Fr. Jakoubek then invited the assembly to a discussion of the best ways and means of furthering the aims of the Alliance. Dr. Pecival made a motion that each organization send a representative to a conference which will be named "Podnikovy Vybor" (Committee on Enterprise and Trial). The motion was carried. Mr. Langer stated that speakers will be delegated to all organizations which desire their services. Mr. Ort (a reporter of the Denni Hlasatel), in words of patriotic ardor, moved that the Czech National Alliance be given a vote of confidence. This motion was passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>Several other members spoke. Since their names were not recorded, they cannot be mentioned here. Mr. Dolezal, vice-president of the Czech Sokol Community, moved that all Czech organizations and associations publicly comdemn the actions of traitors to the Czech cause. During the ensuing debate Professor Kral complained that our thoughts are so occupied with other problems that we have neglected our schools. Messrs. Vojta Benes, and Veverka, as well as Professor J. Zmrhal rose to refute this contention, declaring that the salvation of our people in the old homeland should he of paramount importance, because our schools will not be abandoned.</p>
   <p>The meeting closed at a late hour. It proved our unity, and it inspired us to further endeavor. Let us follow Professor T.G. Masaryk toward our goal.</p>
