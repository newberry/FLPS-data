   <p>The Closing Session</p>
   <p>The closing session of the Bohemian-American National Committee was held yesterday. Peter V. Rovmianek of Pittsburg opened the morning session with an address on the "Progress of the Bohemian Nation." Paul Albiera, a playwrite and author of Prague, Bohemia, in a short speech declared his intention on his return home of writing a history of America in the Bohemian language, that his countrymen might know more of the land to which so many of his people have immigrated. Mrs. R. L. Pitte of Chicago, President of the Bohemian Women's Benevolent Association, which has a membership of 4,000, delivered a short address, in which she assured the National Committee that the Association which she represented was ready to lend moral and financial support to any object which would tend to elevate the Bohemian nation.</p>
