   <p>The meeting of the Statni Vybor Svazu Svobodomyslnych (State Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) took place on November 13, 1922. Those present were: Brothers J. Musil, F. Strunc, J. Pecha, O. Rajtora, K. Studnicka, and Sisters M. Blazek and M. Zeman [sic]. The minutes of preceding meetings were approved as read. The matter of the mass meetings to protest the proposed amendment of the Illinois state constitution came up for discussion. [A list of such meetings, held in the various parts of Chicago, in which the Bohemian people are concentrated follow:] Bohemian California, 34 people present; Town of Lake, 123 people; Cicero, Illinois, 154 people, including about 100 school children who filled the program of the evening with their songs. In the Pilsen Park pavilion there were 168 people; the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor Lyra (Lyre Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) was fully represented and sang marvelously. It was decided to send the Lyre a letter of thanks.</p>
   <p>As regards the constitutional amendment, it was decided to have articles <span class="page-break">2</span>published in our Czech newspapers before election day, December 12, 1922.</p>
   <p>In regard to the systematic propaganda which advocates an official severing of church relationships and the canceling of church membership, it was decided to postpone that activity until the month of January, 1923, at which time most clubs and organizations will be installing their newly elected officers. But any individuals who wish to leave the church now may do so, and the Federation will furnish the necessary blanks on request.....The Town of Lake delegate announced the organization of a class in public speaking which started on November 24, 1922. It was decided to publicize this school before the entire Czech public of Chicago in order that the class may be well attended.</p>
   <p>The delegate from the Ceska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Fraternal and Benevolent Union) announced that the Grand Lodge of the Jednota will hold an important meeting on January 19, 1923. The meeting, to which the State Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers is invited, will take place in the Vojta Naprstek Bohemian Free Thought School and will be held in the afternoon.</p>

   <p>Brothers O. Vasku and F. Strunc were delegated to this meeting. It was likewise decided to send a delegation to the convention of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union) which will begin on December 8, 1922.</p>
   <p>A lengthy discussion was devoted to the report on the joint session of the executive committee and members of the Svaz. It concerned the publication of the periodical Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason) which henceforth is to become a weekly magazine. Brother O. Vasku was appointed editor, and Brother Strunc is to have all other responsibilities connected with the publication, sale, circulation, etc., of the organ. A committee consisting of nine people was appointed to act as an editorial committee of the Vek Rozumu. This committee will be responsible to the executive council of the Svaz of America. It consists of the following: Messrs. Vojtech Cada, Josef Musil, F. H. Studnicka, O. Rajtora, and Mr. M. Hajek, and Mesdames M. Blazek, M. Stepanek, and M. Mirovsky. Mr. J. Pecha is to assist this committee when his assistance is needed.</p>
   <p>The committee agreed to work without any remuneration. The officers of the <span class="page-break">4</span>publication, however, because of their dealing with business and financial matters are to be paid one dollar a year each according to the requirements of the law.</p>
   <p>The weekly magazine will have twelve pages and an ordinary newspaper format. Its yearly subscription price will be $3. Being cognizant of the fact that the success of the periodical will largely depend upon the co-operation and support of the members residing within the Chicago area, the delegates and officers decided to address and circulate a letter to all the local branches of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers, asking them to start publicizing the periodical. It was also decided that the local Federation should send letters to all the local Czech clubs, societies, and other organizations which are represented in the local Federation; and to such others as have no representatives in the Federation, to renew their representation or to appoint delegates to the local Federation.</p>
   <p>The financial condition of the Illinois State Federation then came up for discussion, and it was made clear that the treasury is depleted.....The executive committee of <span class="page-break">5</span>the Federation will be requested to contribute a sum of money to facilitate operations, or at least to advance a loan to the State Federation so that it may function properly.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Strunc, secretary.</p>
