   <p>Yesterday was a day of surprises. It brought a change in the weather, and this was not the least of reasons for the really great success of the annual Memorial Day festivities which took place at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery).....</p>
   <p>The celebration started at 8:30 A. M. with a parade led by Marshall F. Schultz through the streets of our Bohemian Pilsen district to the Cesko-Anglicka Svobodna Skola (Bohemian-English Free Thought School), 18th and Robey Streets. There the marchers boarded the streetcars and proceeded to the cemetery. At the head of the parade marched the Civil War veterans, followed by the band of Mr. Brousek, members of the board of representatives of the Narodni Hrbitov, Bohemian-American veterans of the Spanish-American War, <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Sharpshooters, and the Bohemian-Slavonic veterans. The parade excelled in orderliness and was acclaimed along the entire line of march.</p>
   <p>The first part of the celebrations at the Cemetery was another parade, one section of which arrived from the Ceska Svobodna Skola F. Zdrubek (F. Zdrubek Bohemian Free-Thought School) on Crawford Avenue, and was joined on the way by the section marching from the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The section marching from the Zdrubek School consisted of the Cesko-Americky Sokol (Bohemian-American Sokol) with its ladies' auxiliary and its drum and bugle corps, and the Sokol "Rozvoj" with its drum and bugle corps. On the way to the Utulna it was joined by the Sokol Cechie, and at the Utulna it was joined by the main section that had formed there. To the music of Mr. Brousek's band, the several groups marched to the Cemetery and stopped at the monument erected to the memory of Bohemian soldiers fallen in the Civil War. The participants aligned around the monument and witnessed a short ceremonial drill in honor of the Bohemians who died during <span class="page-break">\3</span>that internecine period. The ceremony ended in a salvo fired by the Bohemian-American veterans. The paraders disbanded and made a tour of the Cemetery, decorating the graves of the soldiers. In the meantime, the ceremonies at the speakers' platform were going on. The platform was reserved for the members of the board of representatives of the Hrbitov, the speakers, the inmates of the Utulna a Sirotcinec, and invited guests.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the board, Mr. J. Hladovec, explained in a brief address the reason for the celebration of Memorial Day. He welcomed those assembled, and called their attention to the picture post cards showing the crematorium which were being sold for the benefit of Bohemian Free Thought schools. His address was followed by a musical selection, and little Barbora Klecka, an inmate of the Sirotcinec, presented A. Zeman's poem, "Ku Oti Zdobeni Hrobu" (To the Decoration Day). Her splendid declamation, ending in the line," love to the living, honor to the dead," was most impressive. The poem was followed by the Bohemian national anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home), sung by the inmates of <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Sirotcinec. Mr. Hladovec then introduced the English-language speaker of the day, the Speaker of the House of the Illinois General Assembly, Mr. David A. Shanahan. Because of its length, we do not reproduce his speech verbatim, but the following will give an adequate idea of his address:</p>
   <p>.....Among these heroes there is a large number of sons of Cechie ["Cechie" is a personification of the Bohemian nation.] who, together with the rest of the American soldiers, fought for Liberty.....The speaker mentioned the first Bohemian immigrants who came to Chicago more than fifty years ago, at a time when Chicago was a village on the lake front. Now Chicago is the third largest Bohemian city, having more than two-hundred and fifty thousand Bohemian-Americans in its population. He compared the area of the Kingdom of Bohemia to the size of some of the states of the Union, and explained the reasons for the emigration of Bohemians from the old country to America in 1848, a year which marks the abolition of serfdom in Austria. The first Bohemians to arrive in this country brought with them a hatred of serfdom and slavery, and for this reason <span class="page-break">\5</span>they sided with the North in the Civil War.</p>
   <p>When, in 1867, the Bohemians were given permission for unlimited immigration, they made good use of it. Many of them came to America and joined their country men who were already settled here, and that year marks the beginning of mass Bohemian immigration to this country. History tells, however, of a number of prominent American Bohemians long before that date. Komensky (Johann Amos Comenius), Augustin Herman, and others have played important roles in the public life of this country and thus made their contributions to the development of this great, free, happy nation. A Bohemian, William Paka, was present at the most significant moment in the history of the United States, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The Bohemian' contribution to the world's culture are their efforts toward personal and religious liberty, and John Huss, through his efforts in just this respect, has become one of the foremost representatives of the Bohemian nation in world history. In the field of arts the Bohemians are in front with their Dvorak, Smetana, Fibich, Kubelik, Svoboda, Manes, and others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Bohemian literature is one of the oldest forms; Bohemian poetry is of the most beautiful; Bohemian history is one of the richest on heroes and great men of whom it has a very great number. The Bohemians gave Kopernik (Copernicus) to the world before the birth of Newton. John Huss was burned at the stake for his convictions before the appearance of Luther, and Komensky (Comenius), one of the greatest pedagogues, lived and worked before Froebel and Pestalozzi. The beloved Bohemian patriot, Vojta Naprstek, lived for a while in America, and having returned to the old country, made important contributions to the national self-esteem and conception of liberty from his American experiences.</p>
   <p>What the Bohemians did for their new country during the great Civil War is proudly commemorated by the monument that graces the center of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov. They were among the first to recognize the danger threatening the country, the first to offer their services and everything they had to protect it. In the first regiments organized in Chicago in 1861, there were Bohemians, although, at the time, there were very few Bohemians in the United States. But <span class="page-break">\7</span>all this has not made the Bohemians forget their old country. When, in 1902, Antonin Dvorak's sixtieth birthday was celebrated in the National Theater in Prague, and all Slavic nations were represented in the ballet by their national costumes and flags, and while a storm of applause was raging in the audience, the last to complete the picture was a man from abroad with the Star-Spangled Banner. He was welcomed by Cechie as her own beloved son; it was this scene that received the greatest ovation of the evening and has remained in the memory of all those present. The scene was symbolic of the Bohemian heart, the Bohemian-American heart, true to its old country and loyal to its new country. Because of their diligence, their adaptability, their thriftiness, and other excellent qualities, the Bohemians make very desirable citizens of this country. Among the results of the application of these qualities is the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, founded in 1877, where we now observe Memorial Day. The celebration is a matter of moment, not only from the Bohemian, but also from the American point of view, because a nation cannot do better than show herself proud and appreciative of her dead by decorating their graves.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>At the conclusion of his speech, Mr. David E. Shanahan recited the text of the Bohemian National anthem, "Kde Domov Muj," in its English translation. We are happy to say that his was one of the best English speeches every delivered as part of the Memorial Day celebrations at the Narodni Hrbitov. Accordingly, it was received by the huge audience with long applause. In spite of its length and use of statistical and historic data, the speech was a lively one, a sincere one, proving that the speaker felt exactly as he talked. His sincerity in giving the Bohemians their due has a rather interesting explanation. As Mr. E. Smejkal has told some of the members of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, Mr. Shanahan's wife is Bohemian, the former Miss Eva Mares.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian speaker of the day, introduced by Mr. Hladovec, after the presentation of another musical selection, was Dr. A. Mueller. Because of lack of space in today's edition, the full text of his address will be published tomorrow. His speech, fully appreciated and applauded by the audience, was followed by the <span class="page-break">\9</span>recitation of the English poem, "The Burial of the Soldier," by an inmate of the Sirotcinec, little Viktorka Kaspar, who is well known for her talents. She recited the poem with such feeling that many an eye in the audience was moist with tears before she ended. The singing of the national anthem by the inmates of the Utulna a Sirotcinec was very successful. The program was con-cluded by a medley of Bohemian folk songs played by Mr. Brousek's sixteen-piece band. The entire program was quite flawless.</p>
   <p>As we previously stated, the bright sun, after a long period of poor weather, attracted many of our countrymen to the cemetery, and the attendance at the ceremonies was unusually large. The celebration proper, and the whole day at the cemetery, passed without an untoward incident; its dignity was fully in keeping with the character of the purpose--the decoration of the graves of those who have been called to eternal rest, and who have left fond memories in the hearts of their dear ones. Every grave--the grave of the wealthy and the grave of him who had to struggle to keep body and soul together--was dressed in a <span class="page-break">\10</span>gown of flowers. But the graves of those who had lost their lives in the Civil War had an added distinction. These were decorated with small American flags, a token of honor which has become a tradition at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was doubly significant for two of our national institutions, the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov and the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). While those who have departed forever were honored at the Hrbitov, the second celebration manifested the importance of those who are with us, living among us. The main part of this celebration was laying of the cornerstone for the new building of the Sirotcinec (Orphanage). Our Sirotcinec is justly pointed to as an institution where those of our children who became orphans at an early age get the best substitute for their morther's love and their father's care. Therefore it is only proper that our associations should be constantly reminded to make contributions and keep building this, the finest monument of progressiveness and love of neighbor. The Utulna a Sirotcinec has <span class="page-break">\11</span>grown from small and difficult beginnings, under the diligent and unselfish care of our national workers, into an outstanding national institution, an institution where a number of our future men and women citizens of Bohemian origin are given an opportunity to enjoy in their youth, if not maternal love itself, then at least its best substitute--the love of one human being for another--and to grow up to be fine men and women who will go out into the world with the proud knowledge that they had been raised in a Bohemian freethinking institution, in an institution founded and maintained by the sons and daughters of a branch of the Bohemian nation for the purpose of educating other sons and daughters of that branch to become good and loyal citizens of this great country, the free United States of America.</p>
   <p>The ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone for the new building of the Orphanage started at two o'clock in the afternoon. At that time the grounds around the Orphanage were crowded with groups of our countrymen who eager to give their approval of the step which the board of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec had taken after thorough study and deliberation of all important conditions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>The board has taken upon itself a great responsibility, but after yesterday's success it will be encouraged to continue in the work that has been so propitiously started. The large attendance showed that the public approved of the idea of enlarging the Orphanage, and it was an assurance that our public and our national bodies will see to it that the board will be provided with the means of bringing their work to a successful conclusion.</p>
   <p>The ceremonies were opened by the chairman of the board, Mr. V. Suchy. He opened in his own characteristic way, briefly and with a sincerity which reflected the fact that he has been giving all his time and all his thoughts to the institution. He spoke from a platform erected in a corner of the building for which the cornerstone was being laid. He introduced the contractors, members of the board whose duty it is to supervise the building activities, Mr. Charvat and Mr. Rezny, the building committee with its chairman, Mr. Jan. L. Novak, and a number of invited guests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>Mr. Novak was next to speak, and he addressed the audience as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear friends and esteemed patrons of the Utulna a Sirotcinec: On behalf of the building committee, I welcome you most cordially to today's ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone for this stately building. This building will serve a noble end, because it will, in many respects, replace the parental care and the lost home of many a Bohemian orphan.</p>
   <p>"It is in the halls of this building where they will be educated for their future vocations, where they will be taught and given such foundations as will prevent them from becoming renegades, where they will be prepared to grow into good Bohemian-Americans and useful citizens of the world.</p>
   <p>"Today's celebration is a very important one, and it will be entered in red letters into the annals of Bohemian-Chicago. Our founding of charitable institutions proves that we are trying to take good care of our less fortunate, lonely <span class="page-break">\14</span>countrymen and orphaned children. It proves that the Bohemian people are progressive, unselfish, and endeavor to do what is noble, right, and inspiring.</p>
   <p>"I hope it will not be considered out of place if I mention briefly a few facts in connection with the origin of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, because this day carries us back to years long passed. A number of enthusiasts founded the Sbor (board) of the Utulna a Sirotcinec, July 22, 1894. I was elected treasurer, and I am the one who receipted the first contributions toward the realization of our aim. At that time, of course, I did not have any idea that I should be privileged to participate in a celebration such as the one we have today. The Sbor had to overcome many obstacles before it succeeded in the realization of its plans. It took many years of hard work, but its members knew that they were working on an enterprise of merit, and have been doing their duties with diligence, gladly and unselfishly. And, lo and behold! as the result of their work, not only the Old People's Home was erected, but an orphanage was also founded. Carefulness and thriftiness in management of these institutions have</p>
   
   <span class="page-break">\15</span>
   <p>made it possible to lay the foundation of a new building for the Orphanage, and in that way prepare for the acceptance of many who apply but who cannot be taken in because of lack of necessary space. Now, this building will serve exclusively as an orphanage, while all the rest will be adapted for the use of our aged men and women.</p>
   <p>"The completion of the new building and all the changes made necessary by the new plan will necessitate a great deal of work and money, but the members of the board of representatives are glad to undertake it, knowing that they can rely upon the good will of the patrons of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec who are sure to provide the necessary means for the completion of the work that has been so auspiciously started, and which will be just as auspiciously finished.</p>
   <p>"I am now using this opportunity to address the inmates of our Orphanage, asking them to mind carefully their duties, to show themselves obedient to their <span class="page-break">\16</span>teachers, and to remember, when they grow up, that this institution had been their home where they were taught to do justice to their obligations and remain faithful and loyal to their Bohemian language and Bohemian nationality. If, at some time in the future, any of you, our young inmates, should come to a position where you will have a surplus to be used for doing good, do not forget the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec.</p>
   <p>"My dear friends, I thank you for your kind attention, and I wish the institution a full measure of success! Na Zdar! (To Success)."</p>
   <p>Another speaker, introduced by Mr. Novak, was Mr. R. J. Psenka, editor of Svornost, who addressed those present as follows:</p>
   <p>"As the golden rays of the cheery sun penetrate the heavy clouds of anxiety and darkness, so gladness and bright hopes have been let into these difficult, fateful times by this celebration of ours. These difficult times have come to mark <span class="page-break">\17</span>the quincentenary of the martyred death of the greatest Bohemian, John Huss. This year the Bohemian nation is undergoing one of the most difficult tests of its whole existence, and its American branch its called upon to prove that it has a right to be called a living part of Huss' nation, and to disprove--as it is occasionally believed--that it is a dead limb of the nation, separated from the main body and of no good use at all.</p>
   <p>"If there is anybody in this year of Huss to give account of his work and derive inspiration for future activities, it is principally that part of the Bohemian-American public that calls itself 'freethinking,' that claims John Huss as one of its own men, and esteems him as its model, as its spiritual leader. This year, the John Huss year, should once and for all dispose of the frequently heard reproach that our freedom of thought is a negative quality, that it is not positive, that it wrecks without knowing how to build, that it is destructive instead of being constructive, as it should.</p>
   <p>"Those who have been active on this project, those who have today their redletter <span class="page-break">\18</span>day, are fully entitled to say that they have forged their link in the chain of deeds which, let us hope, will deprive the mentioned reproach of all justification. Here, there are no empty words, no shining phrases, no passioned and useless speeches, no dead walls. Here, there are deeds that speak. If it is necessary to convince someone who is sceptical of the liveliness, constructiveness, and initiative of our freethinking element, we could take this one by the hand and lead him to Bohemian Chicago, to the Prague of Bohemian-America, to the many Sokol halls, the headquarters buildings of various of our associations and lodges, to our Free Thoughtschools, and tell him how proud we are of all this. Then, we certainly would not forget to take him to this green corner of our city, to this beautiful Narodni Hrbitov, to this splendid crematorium, the first Bohemian crematorium in the whole world. And, above all this, the principal point to which we shall introduce our sceptic is this isle of pure love and charitableness, an island of mercy in the sea of the cool American world of intensive work, the proverbial chase after the dollar, the impersonal calculative American business world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\19</span>
   <p>"These two buildings standing here (the third is now being built), these shelters which make a home for our aged men and women who have nothing but a bit of love from their countrymen, and, principally, a home for our Bohemian children who are not fortunate enough to have a home of their own and a mother to lead them by their soft, fine hands, these buildings are the most valuable, the most outstanding documents of the constructiveness of our Free Thought, our liberal principles. If there were nothing to show but this island, it would be enough to prove wrong everybody who maintains that our freethinking, liberal element is incapable of constructive activities, that all it does is wreck.</p>
   <p>"Of course, seeing as how there are many among us who claim that they are liberals, or freethinkers, or that they belong to this or that organization, there should be many more of such documents, several of such islands. The fact that there are not is just a proof of our human weakness, our insufficient development in following the principles of free thought living, a proof that many of us are freethinkers only by name, that our service of freethinking <span class="page-break">\20</span>principles is nothing but lip service, which stops short of the pocketbook or checkbook. It is not an indication of a lack of the lofty ideals of liberalism and freedom of thought founded five hundred years ago by John Huss through its opposition of the antiquated, outlived, and putrid order of things; nor does it indicate a lack of the liberalism and freedom of thought cultivated here, in our new country, by Klacel and Zdrubek. The proof that our freedom of thought is not dead, soulless, or destructive, is right here before our eyes. May it become just one link in a chain of great, noble deeds of Bohemian America!</p>
   <p>"In these stirring times, during the horrible war which has spilled a sea of blood over Europe and spread a blanket of suffering, need, and death over millions of people, when eerie echoes of it are reverberating also in this country and signs are rife pointing to the danger of this new homeland of ours being likewise pulled into the dance of death, a new slogan, 'Away with all "hyphenated" Americans,' has been issued. 'There should be no Anglo-Americans, no German-Americans, no Polish-Americans, Bohemian-Americans among us. Let us be nothing <span class="page-break">\21</span>but whole Americans!'</p>
   <p>"If we approve of this slogan, we have to ask ourselves some questions: What right have we, then, to call ourselves 'Bohemian-Americans?' What right have we to found new units of our great Sokol organizations, to form Bohemian associations, publish Bohemian newspapers, build Bohemian schools? What right have we to take these orphans away from the stream of American life and put them into this Bohemian institution, teach them the Bohemian language, make them acquainted with Bohemian history, cultivate in them the Bohemian spirit, Bohemian ways of thinking? What right have we to try and make of them Bohemian-Americans, not only-Americans?</p>
   <p>"The answer to this question shall be put in the form of other questions: Is a Bohemian-American only a fifty-per-cent American? What does Americanism consist of? What is the substance of 'being an American'? What does the citizenship of this country mean, a country which had not yet been touched by the foot <span class="page-break">\22</span>of a white settler in times when our great John Huss was burning at a stake for his convictions? If 'being an American' depends on a long line of ancestors settled in this country, then we, immigrants and children of immigrants, can never become Americans. But if 'being an American' consists of appreciating the precious heritage of personal and spiritual liberty left to us by the great founders of this nation, such as Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington, of maintaining the American principles of equality and progressive-ness, then it may be said that the average Bohemian-American is a much better American than the majority of Americans who were born in this country and have a long line of ancestors who lived in this country, and who only too often let the immigrants defend the principles of American liberty against those who are trying to abolish it.</p>
   <p>"Among those who most love the Star-Spangled Banner, a banner composed of the same colors as our old country's flag, who think most of American liberty, who offer the most strenuous opposition to subversive elements endeavoring to <span class="page-break">\23</span>abrogate that liberty and reinstate a medieval order of things, are primarily, the Bohemian-Americans. In the long, and still only partly won, fight for personal liberty, in the fight against those who would make Sunday not a day of rest and pleasure and recreation, but a day of sobbing and gloom, against those who are dragging religion into public life, in the fight for keeping the influence of churches excluded from our public schools--in all these fights in which the true, long-settled Americans should be the leaders, it is the Bohemian-Americans who have usually assumed the leadership. We do not need to go far in order to find examples of this. Not so long ago, the Catholic teachers in our public schools, by instigation of Catholic priests, conducted a wild propaganda in almost all schools, trying to herd the children into churches and confessionals. Who was it that declared a war against such teachers and the would-be captors of children's souls who were backing them, and who finally succeeded in causing the superintendent of schools to issue a strict order to the teachers prohibiting any such activity? It was the Bohemian-Americans, and only the Bohemian-Americans, quite alone, without any help whatever, who conducted <span class="page-break">\24</span>this fight from the beginning to the end, a fight, the result of which is of extraordinary importance. More than 350,000 children will be protected against the influence of sly papists and will enjoy the protection guaranteed to them by the Constitution of this great country which prohibits any church influence in the public schools.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, if anybody should imply that, being Bohemian-Americans, we are not full Americans, we may proudly tell him that a bit of Bohemian blood in the veins of every American would be a mighty good thing, that it would be of great benefit to this country because as a result of it the people of this country would come closer to the ideal of liberty set out for them by the founders of this nation. Three hundred years of political, religious, and economic persecution have taught the Bohemians to value liberty above everything else. A wide-awake Bohemian is in a position to give a lesson in democracy and republican principles to many an enthusiastic admirer of the starry flag who delivers tirades against 'hyphenated' Americans, fifty-per-cent Americans, and while <span class="page-break">\25</span>doing so, permits the enemies of American liberty, rights, and progressiveness to conduct a subversive, anti-American propaganda campaign.</p>
   <p>"Well then, you, children, you inmates of the institution, we are building here for you; try to be always good Americans by remaining good Bohemians. A wide-awake, liberal-minded, true Bohemian cannot become a traitor of the great principles of liberty, equality, and justice which are the foundation of true Americanism. Be always admirers of Paine, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Lincoln, but at the same time value above all the heritage of John Huss, Komensky (Johann Amos Comenius), and Havlicek.</p>
   <p>"And now a word to you who have come to attend these ceremonies, you workers and members of the board of this Utulna a Sirotcinec--you, representatives of lodges and various associations to whom credit belongs for the progress of this institution and for making possible this new expansion of it--to you, individual contributors. Please, go on, continue in this great work. Do not look for any <span class="page-break">\26</span>other compensation for your work, your sacrifices, your monies, than the knowledge of having done a good deed, the pleasure of seeing the fine results of your co-operation. Do not permit yourself to discontinue your support.</p>
   <p>"Let there not be one single person among us who would try to find an excuse for discontinuing his contributions in pointing to the fact that there are so many other collections at this time which call for his contributions. If times are such that unusual sacrifices are required, it is necessary to redouble every effort, to give more than usual. It would be a sad evidence of moral weakness to donate to one cause what has been taken away from the usual contribution to another cause. May there be no people among us who would stoop to such an action!</p>
   <p>"If we are true, real freethinking Bohemians, if we care to merit the name of a John Huss nation, let us not permit this beautiful institution of which we are so justly proud to have any lack of funds. Let us supply it with enough for <span class="page-break">\27</span>both, for a continuous existence and for continuous expansion.</p>
   <p>"Let us be proud of being able to commemorate the John Huss anniversary in this most beautiful way, by a great deed; and let this Orphanage, this institution, be a constant reminder that for us, every year should be a John Huss year!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Psenka's speech was frequently interrupted by spirited applause which broke out spontaneously when he concluded. There followed addresses by men and women representatives of the several associations and lodges interested in the Utulna a Sirotcinec. The first among them was Mrs. Klara Klaus, representing the central committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity).</p>
   <p>The laying of the cornerstone was performed by Mrs. Klara Klaus, after which the children sang the Bohemian national anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where is My Home).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\28</span>
   <p>The festivities were concluded by an address of thanks by Mr. Novak who expressed his appreciation to all those present. The children presented another song or two and Mr. Dusek, superintendent of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, announced that documents from fifty associations, newspapers, and other organizations had been enclosed in the cornerstone, and that $1,541 was received in donations during the ceremonies. The names of organizations who had documents enclosed into the stone, and a detailed receipt of contributions will be published in the Bohemian newspapers in the near future.</p>
