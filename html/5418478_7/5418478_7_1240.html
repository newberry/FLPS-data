The bill was approved after this debate, and ordered paid.</p>

   <p>Mr. Halik, secretary read a letter from the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, and an offer of an adjacent 60 acre Louis Farm for $55,000 or $900 an acre.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Kralovec and Smejkal explained that this farm had four owners, who now have reached the age of heritage, and that three of these consent to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the sale, the objections of the fourth heir, however could be overcome. Formerly they asked a much higher price, now they lowered their demand, and the managing board recommends action in this matter and by the purchase of this land would secure sufficient ground for the future. A few individual representatives have differed on this reccomendation. A motion was made and the majority voted to buy this land.</p>
   <p>The motion provided a clause to instruct the managing board to make certain if the law allows the expansion of cemetaries, and if it does, should immediately make the purchase of this land at the very lowest price obtainable.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smejkal, member of the managing board also reported that surrounding the Parental School, adjacent to the cemetary, is a wooden fence, 8 feet high. This fence has a gate, through which the association permits the teachers and other employees of the school who have keys to enter.</p>

   <p>Last but not least another member of the managing board, Mr. Kopecky, reported, that new difficulties have arisen between the National Cemetary Association and one of it's neighbors, Mr. Scheiner, through whose property with his permission drainage tile was laid, leading to an adjacent creek, serving as a drainage in the cemetary grounds.</p>
   <p>However, as it happened last year, the water seeped into the well through these tiles, and the management of the cemetary could have made use of this water, and Mr. Scheiner, wishing to do a favor, closed the tiles at the creek.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the water washed this filling away and again ran into the well in the cemetary.</p>
   <p>During the prevailing hot weather, Mr. Tuma, saw water in the well and made use of it, saving the water of the creek for time of drought. Mr. Scheiner, however learned of this and immediately gave orders to his workmen to dig out the tiles and destroy them; this was done under the supervision of Mr. Scheiner, Jr. Ten feet of tiles were thus dug out, broken, and thrown back, covered with manure and dirt.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>By this time Mr. Scheiner, expressed anger against the association and it's representatives. After this report, this incident was taken into consideration.</p>
