   <p>The well-known Democratic organization Straz 34. Wardy (The Guard of the Thirty-fourth Ward) has also been caught in the maelstrom of war enthusiasm. It has elected its officers, and is ready to march to battle as soon as President Wilson decides it is necessary to punish Huerta, and help establish peace in Mexico. The following telegram was sent to Congressman McAndrews:</p>
   <p>"Please dispose of the services of the Straz 34. Wardy. We offer four hundred men for service in the war with Mexico.</p>
   <p>"Honorary members of this organization are: Mayor Harrison, Congressman [A.] Sabath, and Judge Scully.</p>
   <p>"Among the active members are: Congressman James McAndrews; Clerk of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Probate Court, John A. Cervenka; Assistant Commissioner of Public Works, Joseph O. Kostner; member of the Chicago Board of Education, Joseph A. Holpuch; member of the Chicago Public Library Board, Dr. Frank Pokorny; Judge Harrison M. Fisher; Alderman John Toman; Alderman Winfield J. Held; T. J. Clohessy; member of the Small Park Board, Samuel J. Rosenblatt; and the following former Aldermen: Vladimir E. Cerveny, Michael S. Gary, Rudolf Hurt, Jacob Sindelar, and James Roach.</p>
   <p>"Signed: Colonel Joseph O. Kostner, Lieutenant-</p>
   <p>Colonel James McAndrews, Major</p>
   <p>John A. Cervenka, Major Winfield J. Held,</p>
   <p>Major John Toman."</p>
   <p>It is evident from the contents of the telegram that the Thirty-fourth Ward is not behind in the war spirit, and it can be presumed that the four hundred volunteers will soon appear armed and ready for service in the war with Mexico.</p>

   <p>In the meantime it is not known whether the President will avail himself of the tendered offer, because up to the present the Colonel has not received a reply to his communication.</p>
   <p>It is also not known whether the regiment had started any training.</p>
