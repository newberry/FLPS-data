   <p>Among the great conventions of our fraternal and sisterhood unions, which have been held this year, we must need add another, the very prosperous Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic union) the officers of which have now started their preliminary and preparatory work for an annual convention which is to be held in our city during the latter half of December. According to the reports of some of the members of the governing board and those of the grand lodge of the Jednota, the convention was not to be held until next spring, but the majority of the members of the grand lodge, which held a special meeting to fix the date for the next convention, agreed to call it for the end of this year, claiming that it would be more advantageous to do so. It was impossible to hold the convention earlier in the year, since the constitution of the Jednota provides that the election of delegates must occur at least sixty days before the convention. Individual lodges have already appointed their delegates, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>everywhere one may meet with a sincere desire and endeavor to make this convention a profitable one for the entire membership of the Jednota, to strengthen its foundation and to insure its future development. A five-member committee appointed to revise the constitution and bylaws and to start all preliminary work of the convention, was increased to seven members, so that the work could be divided among more brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>One might expect that individual lodges and members would propose various revisions and corrections of the constitution, or even add new articles to the document. Several propositions of this kind have already reached the secretary, therefore it is to be supposed that there will be many proposed revisions and changes which will have to be deliberated on. All additional proposed changes, emendations,etc.,should be sent as soon as possible to the secretary of the grand lodge who will refer them to the proper committee. It is quite likely that this convention will seriously consider the possibilities of uniting the several fraternal unions into one body; in fact the Czecho-Slavonic union has made several attempts in the past to bring about such a union.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In a recent issue the organ of the Jednota points to such possibilities, and recommends that the idea of a union with the following large organizations should be seriously considered: The Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic benevolent societies) and the Zapadni Ceska Bratrska Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Association.)</p>
   <p>The latter views are, of course, only the views of the editors of the official organ of the Jednota, but there can be no doubt that the question will be seriously approached as well as thoroughly discussed during the December convention.</p>
   <p>The Czecho-Slavonic union consists of sixty-eight lodges, and according to the last monthly report it has 5,811 members. Its reserve fund is $112,242.89. These lodges are in Chicago and its immediate vicinity, with the exception of two lodges, which are in Baltimore, Maryland. The following cities also have one lodge each: Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Cleveland, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Gary, Indiana; Glen Allen, Virginia; and Curtis Bay, Maryland.</p>
