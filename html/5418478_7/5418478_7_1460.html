   <p>Those of our fellow-countrymen who intend to enlist for service in Uncle Sam's Army should come to the hall of the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen district gymnastic association) tomorrow before 8 A. M. Sergeant Vosatka of United States Army, our fellow-countryman, will be glad to give information upon inquiry.</p>
   <p>We learn that the first group of enlisted Czech volunteers will be transported to the training camp on Monday next. The destination will be announced at a later date. The new soldiers will be tendered tokens and gifts of love. All the non-combatant sympathizers at leisure ought to aid in procuring and distributing the donations. They should also join the well-wishers who will accompany the rookies to the railroad station. A band consisting of Czech musicians will head the farewell procession.</p>
