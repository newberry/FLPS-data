   <p>Never before were there so many visitors at St. Adalbert Cemetery as was on Decoration Day. They came to do honor to the departed soldiers who bled and gave their lives for the freedom of this country. They enlivened, in the true sense of the word, this city of the dead, because there were crowds of people everywhere.</p>
   <p>'The ceremonial rites were held before the crypt, where a Speaker's platform had been built, and around which were assembled the Catholic Cadets, and members of the Veteran's society, "Baron Filipovic." The ceremony was inaugurated by the Rev. Frantisek Bobal. Other speakers were: former Judge and Mayor, Mr. Edward F. Dunne, Mr. Jan Peklo, and Rev. Vaclav Stepan.</p>
