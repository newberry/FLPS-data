   <p>The Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (District Federation of Bohemian Catholics) holds its important meetings quarterly. The last such meeting was held last Sunday in the parish house of the Blahoslavena Anezka Ceska (Blessed Agnes of Bohemia) at South Central Park Avenue and West 27th Street. The meeting was opened by Mr. Karel Radous....at 3 P.M. There were 160 delegates from various Bohemian Catholic organizations of Chicago. As far as we know there were also several members of the Catholic priesthood present in this meeting. They were: The Reverend Monsignor Prokop Neuzil, who is the director of the seminary at Lisle, Illinois, the Reverend Innocent Kestl, the Reverend Krizka, the Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, the Reverend Placid Sasek, who is the director of the Bohemian Benedictine printing house, Frater Tony, and Frater Josef Stedronsky.</p>
   <p>After a prayer, the minutes of the previous meeting were read by Mr. Vaclav Jedlicka, the secretary of the Svaz, whereupon the various officials reported on their activities. Two letters were read from the Ustredna Narodniho Svazu Ceskych Katoliku (central office of the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) and concerned the proposed expedition of the Bohemian Catholics to Czechoslovakia, which is to leave on May 10,1922. Aid to the starving Russian children was touched upon in the other letter from the Ustredna. Also, because of the expedition to Czechoslovakia, the convention which the National Alliance was to hold, was postponed till October of this year. At that time most of the members of the expedition will have returned, and the results of it will be discussed. A motion was made and carried that committees on resolutions and constitution be appointed at once. Both committees are to begin their work immediately and are to give their reports at the proposed convention in the fall....</p>
   <p>It was announced in this meeting that the local Czechoslovaks will arrange a joint celebration with their Polish brethren on Decoration Day, this celebration is to take place in both of the Catholic cemeteries, that of Svaty Vojtech (Saint Adalbert) and that of the Vzkriseni Pane (Resurrection of our Lord). There was a lively debate dealing with the problem of estrangement of our young people, and how the Svaz should prevent it. Several very good suggestions were made; it was stressed that what young people need most is a thorough Catholic bringing up which would lead to a development of lay leaders who would not only become useful to society in a practical way, but would become instrumental in promoting our movement. Those who took part in the discussion pointed out that what we need most, is the establishment of so-called social centers where our younger generation could not only receive counsel but engage in decent entertainments. The executive committee took all the theories advanced under advisement in order to deliberate further on them, selecting only those which will be most practicable and acceptable. That committee is to report its findings to the general meeting, and on the basis of these findings definite action will be taken.</p>
   
   <p>It was further announced that in the fall of this year a large entertainment will be arranged for all the Bohemian Catholic communities of Chicago, the proceeds of this entertainment shall go to the fund for the saving of the young people. </p>
   <p>Finally, it was recommended that all the Bohemian Catholics in America purchase that number of the [Bohemian Catholic periodical], Cesky Svet (Bohemian World), in which the work of the Bohemian-American Catholics is fully described. It covers the period of the liberation [of the homeland] and is well illustrated.</p>
