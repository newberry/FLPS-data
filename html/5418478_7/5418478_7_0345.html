   <p>The Bohemian John Huss celebration of the Spojeni Cesti Protestanti (United Bohemian Protestants) was held in the new Harrison High School on Marshall Boulevard and 24th Street last night.</p>
   <p>It was opened by the chairman of the committee on the John Huss celebration, Reverend Dr. Vaclav Vanek, at eight o'clock in the evening. The John Huss orchestra played a very good potpourri of Bohemian popular airs developed in the Church on Sawyer Avenue and 24th Street. After a community song which was joined in by all those present, the Reverend Frank Svacha of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, read the psalm that John Huss was reciting when led to the stake. Thereafter one hundred and fifty Bohemian children, dressed in national costumes, sang the song "Bud Panu Cest" (Honor to the Lord), and then Reverend Vanek introduced the chairman of the celebration, a member of the Chicago Board of Education, Mr. J. A. Holpuch. In his introduction he pointed out Mr. Holpuch's splendid activities on the School Board on behalf of the <span class="page-break">2</span>Bohemians, and then handed to him the historic gavel sent from Bohemia for the Huss celebrations in Chicago and loaned to him for this evening by Reverend J. T. Stone. A chorus composed of choirs of Bohemian Protestant churches sang a choral, the words for which were composed by John Huss himself, and another choral, "Kdoz Jste Bozi Bojovnigi" (Ye Who Art God's Soldiers), both of which were conducted by Mr. Jerome Mysicka. Later on, the same chorus sang Pivoda's arrangement of the Bohemian national anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where is My Home). The group of children in national costumes sang a festive song composed for the Huss celebration on the basis of some of our folk songs. The song made a profound impression, and a great deal of credit is due Miss Bozena Salaba for the care with which she studied and rehearsed it with the children. The songs were accompanied on the piano by Mr. Bedrich Brazda.</p>
   <p>The speakers of the evening, each of whom spoke ten minutes, were Dr. J. F. Smetanka, who selected the topic, "John Huss and the Bohemian nationality,"</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>and spoke in Bohemian; Reverend F. V. Duha, who spoke in English on the topic, "John Huss as a Patriot"; Reverend J. P. Bartak, who chose the subject, "John Huss' Religion"; and Professor J. J. Zmrhal, speaking on "John Huss as the Nation's Teacher". The special features of the program were Professor V. Mach's violin solo, "Adagio Religioso" by Vieuxtemps, and the address of Reverend Josef Krenek of Silver Lake, Minnesota, on the topic of"John Huss' Sacrifice".....</p>
   <p>This was the last of the John Huss celebrations in our city. All of them added to the prestige of the great Bohemian colony in Chicago. This one was attended by approximately fifteen hundred people, who completely filled the lower hall of the Carter H. Harrison High School. Among those present were many Bohemian guests from outside of Chicago who had come to Chicago for the Fifth World Congress of the Christian Endeavor.</p>
