   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the managing committee of the Czech National Cemetery a request for further financial support made by the Czech National Alliance was debated on, with the result that $5,000 will be donated in a lump sum to the Alliance for the pursuit of the movement for the liberation of Czechoslovak lands. Mr. Pecha, chairman of the committee, voted on the side of those who wished to donate the whole amount at once instead of in two installments.</p>
   <p>The result of the voting was received with ardent applause by all those present, which shows that the operators of the Bohemian National Cemetery have always been faithful supporters of the patriotic aims of the Alliance. It will remain so, and let no request pass unheeded.....</p>
