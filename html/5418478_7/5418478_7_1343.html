   <p>All friends of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires will surely attend the meeting to be held tomorrow in the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, and for which extensive preparations are being made. Those who attend will find that this spring entertainment arranged by the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Chicago Post, Czechoslovak Legionnaires) is pleasant indeed. Even the name of this patriotic organization should be a sufficient guarantee that the entertainment will be first-class. Not only are the entertainments of the Legionnaires famous because of their good nature, but the charitable and patriotic activities of the Druzina and its rare sacrifices are equally well known by our general public. The Druzina will furnish its own band and every participant may expect a thoroughly good time. The program will begin at 8 P. M.; the admission will be fifty cents including war tax.</p>
