   <p>As in previous years, the Cesko-Americka Svobodna Obec (Bohemian-American Freethinking Community) commemorated the anniversary of the historically important tragedy of the martyr death of John Huss on a stake on the shore of Lake Constance.</p>
   <p>The commemoration consisted of a mourning ceremony in the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery at 26th Street and Albany Avenue last night.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's beautiful weather attracted such a large multitude of people to the celebration that the pavilion was filled to overflowing.</p>
   <p>The celebration consisted of a carefully selected and prepared program of instrumental and vocal selections and a number of speeches.</p>
