   <p>Bohemian Chicago will be one important national building richer--a building devoted exclusively to school purposes. The Patronat Cesko-Anglicke Svobodomyslne Skoly (Trustees of the Bohemian-English Free Thought School), after years of deliberation, have decided to realize an old idea of building a schoolhouse of their own where the pupils now enrolled in the Patronat's school could find everything that can be expected in a modern school building. The Patronat has been maintaining a school in its hall on 18th Street for many years, but for a long time its members have been aware of the fact that the present accommodations are not adequate.....</p>
   <p>It was therefore decided to build a new school....on the two empty lots right across the street from the present premises.....</p>
   <p>The Patronat is most fortunate in having been able to secure this site for the comparatively low price of $4,000.....</p>
