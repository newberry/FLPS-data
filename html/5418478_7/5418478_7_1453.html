   <p>The moment arrived when we had to say good-bye to our Sokols who did not hesitate, but went to offer themselves to Uncle Sam, to throw their body and soul into the fight which shall decide the fate of every nation in the world. Though the last hour was filled with emotion, no weak sentimentality showed on the features of our warriors. On the contrary, the recruits exhibited determination and satisfaction, for they all were going voluntarily. None of them had been driven into the yoke of coercion which is still remembered by those who were beaten into service in the old homeland.</p>
   <p>Great throngs of people had congregated in front of the home of the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs (gymnastic organization) long before 6 P. M., the hour set for the march which was to bring the enlisted men to the railroad <span class="page-break">2</span>station on Polk and Dearborn Streets. Mothers, sisters, sweethearts, and wives, with male relatives and thousands of friends, all of these wanted to bid farewell to the Sokol, soldiers of whom the physicians in charge of the examination had said: "Boys such as these, that's what we want for soldiers!"</p>
   <p>A short farewell gathering was arranged for the recruits in the rear of the hall where Mr. Dolezal, Mr. Zitny, and Mr. Mejda held brief addresses, which were appropriately answered by recruit Simaner, who vowed in the name of his comrades, that the Sokols did not intend to come back with their names tarnished. Fitting gifts were presented each soldier by the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs organization. National anthems were sung, the soldiers gathered into ranks, and the procession started, headed by Husa's band. The banner which was carried in front of the Sokol soldiers showed on one side the colors of the United States, on the other a likeness of Tyrs with a dedication in the Czech language. In the center of the marching column, <span class="page-break">3</span>a large sign proclaimed the event that Czech Sokol Volunteers were marching there. </p>
   <p>The procession moved through 25th Street, Kedzie Avenue, and 22nd Street, then to the Plzen (Pilsen) district where, at the home of the Pilsen Sokol, volunteers from other Sokol organizations joined those coming from the California district. This scene was one of great rejoicing and patriotic spirit. Blue Island Avenue, Halsted Street, Jackson Boulevard were passed while passers-by acclaimed the marchers. The recruiting station at State and Harrison Streets was another stop.</p>
   <p>During the march, a few instances of bad behaviour have to be recorded. Some hoodlums jeered, but they soon were driven into hiding, for our Sokols were not in the mood to stand for these exhibitions of Prussianism, and punishment followed these provocations if the perpetrators did not succeed in taking refuge in safer quarters.</p>

   <p>The platform at the depot of the Wabash railroad was crowded not only with friends and relatives of the departing soldiers, but with a throng of other people who were attracted by the impressive scenes. They had been treated with utmost courtesy by the police, in whose hands lay the upkeep of order, and were permitted on the platform.</p>
   <p>As the train was finally to start its journey to Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, Mo., the band played the Star Spangled Banner and our national anthems. "Na Zdar" was the last salute sent in thousands of voices to the defenders of the country. They numbered one hundred and fifty, occupying the last coaches reserved for them and adorned with signs which proclaimed what Czech Sokols can do.</p>
   <p>They were the flower of their Sokol organizations. But there are others left, and many have promised upon their Sokol word of honor that they are going "to see what their brethren in Jefferson Barracks are doing."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>They will all hurry to the medical examination offices and follow their departed comrades.</p>
