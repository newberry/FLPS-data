   <p>All the protests that our "drys" and the enemies of immigrants could muster, could not convince the U.S. Senate that Mr. Charles J. Vopicka should not be appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the Balkans. Perhaps no other nomination made by President Wilson has met with as stubborn an opposition as this one has had--this nomination by which he wished to express his recognition of the Bohemian nation.....</p>
   <p>....Mr. Vopicka's nomination was finally submitted to the vote of the Senate and....was unanimously approved.....</p>
   <p>....Mr. Vopicka will soon leave for Washington to receive his instructions and shortly afterwards will sail for Europe.....</p>
   <p>The present residence of the American ambassador to those countries is Bucharest, Rumania. We hope, however, that this may be changed and that the embassy may <span class="page-break">\2</span>be moved to either Sophia or Belgrade, either of which Mr. Vopicka would undoubtedly prefer to Bucharest.....</p>
