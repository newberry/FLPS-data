   <p>The vigorous appeal of the Czech branch of the Red Cross has produced a telling effect upon all classes of our people. This was proved by the magnificent manifestation in the pavilion of the Pilsen Park Brewery, Albany Avenue and 26th Street, last night. The popular park became a place for the gathering of a multitude of sincere Czechs and Slovaks, so that the honest efforts of the arrangements committee were crowned with a success which may be fairly well termed phenomenal. Our people have shown that it has fully grasped its responsibilities, and that it is ready for the sacrifices which are justly expected from every American in these grave times.</p>

   <p>Even the parade which preceded the huge meeting was a grandiose affair. In spite of the misty rain drizzling throughout the day, the crossing of 26th Street and Crawford Avenue, the starting point, was thronged so that it resembled a veritable camp of enthusiasts. The fervor of the crowd reached a high point with the arrival of the marine band from the Lake Bluff Naval Training Station, which was received with joyous clamor. When the parade was finally started, it consisted of all our societies, clubs, and other organizations augmented by thousands of individuals. While it moved through several streets of the Czech California district, it was joined on 24th Street by a large number of festively decorated automobiles. The Daily News Band, the Boy Scouts, led by Mr. Jan (John) A. Sokol, a squadron of the Mounted Police, and Spanish War Veterans, led by Frank Kral, added to the picturesqueness of the marching columns, which were guided by deputy bailiffs of the Municipal Court, procured by Chief Bailiff Anton Cermak.</p>
   <p>The parade arrived at the pavilion, and the participants slowly began to <span class="page-break">3</span>file in, while the marine band was finishing a chipper march. Mr. Rubringer's band, within the pavilion, then played the "Star Spangled Banner," in which the assembly joined also.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Anton Cermak, chairman of the arrangements committee, who has gained an excellent insight into the organization and beneficent activities of the Red Cross when he was a member of the committee appointed by Mayor Busse for the relief of the inhabitants of the small mining town, Cherry, smitten by a mine disaster, and also when a member of the Czech relief committee on the occasion of the Eastland disaster.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak gave a survey of the purposes and functions of the American Red Cross, at whose head stands the President of the United States, himself. "Let us think of the charitable work done by the Red Cross after several hundred miners in the little town of Cherry had been trapped by fire, and were slowly starving to death, while their women and children <span class="page-break">4</span>cried and moaned in despair over the ill-fated shaft. The Red Cross was unable to rescue the unfortunates, true enough, but it hastened to alleviate the sufferings of the survivors by donating $350,000 and distributing it among the unfortunates. In the Eastland disaster, the Red Cross was in a position to save some of the most critically injured by rushing medical aid to the place of the accident, which struck misery into hundreds of Czech families. Again the Red Cross distributed $350,000."</p>
   <p>The speaker continued in assuring the audience that the accomplishment of the Red Cross at this time will overshadow everything done heretofore. He admonished his fellow-countrymen not to merely look on with their hands in their laps, but to consider that the United States is at War with a relentless enemy, and that it is imperative that everyone of us do our duty. "This is our duty, indeed! We must accomplish enough in this portentous era in order that the name of the Czech-Americans be set in golden letters when the history of this war of liberation is written!" And further:</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"We cannot, at least all of us cannot bear arms and go where we long to be--in the trenches where our Czech-American volunteers are now. As we cannot fight in the trenches, let us fight right here, at home!</p>
   <p>"Let everyone of us, men and women, become members of the Red Cross!</p>
   <p>"We do not feel the terrible effects of the war as yet. This may be the reason why we failed to do all for the patriotic cause that we expected to accomplish. Just wait until June 5, when the streets will be swarming with soldiers, when our sons will be hastening to reach the battlefields, to fight for the honor, rights, liberty, and the old glory of the Czech nation--and to die.</p>
   <p>"Just let us wait until reports from the battlefields will come to us, enumerating the wounded and the dead--then we shall know that it is in-cumbent upon us also to do our duty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"Yes, let us become members of the Red Cross, whose physicians and nurses will be on the battlefields to come to the aid of our children who have been hurt by the arms of the enemy, to alleviate their pains, and in many cases to save their lives.</p>
   <p>"What is it that is really being asked of us? Nothing more than to pay one dollar per year to the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>"Do you know, you Czech fathers and mothers, whether it is not to be your own son who will be taken care of for that very dollar which you paid? .....</p>
   <p>"Under ordinary circumstances, one nurse is supposed to take care of two hundred soldiers; in war time, the service is much more exacting.....The time is nearing when there will be a dearth of nurses.....The service of the American Red Cross may, or may not, be subject to criticism, yet it is the best service in the world. I appeal again to you fathers, and mothers, to join the Red Cross, and thus to help your own <span class="page-break">7</span>children! Let Chicago attain the goal of one-half million members!"</p>
   <p>After Mr. Cermak's address, which evoked peals of applause, Mr. Charles H. Wacker, chairman of the Chicago branch of the Red Cross, spoke... He expressed his confident hope that the Czechs of Chicago would stand in the front, and be represented by a very large membership...</p>
   <p>Dr. J. F. Smetanka, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, in taking the floor, voiced his gratification at the change of attitude of the Chicago Czechs during the last three years during which the World War has been raging. "This period has taught us the virtue of sacrificing," he said, "the American Czechs have ceased to be Philistines; one proof of this is given by the large sums of money donated by us for our patriotic cause. Not only is this true, but the Czechs of Chicago are grasping their obligations, and if the State of Illinois took first rank as to the number of volunteers, it was largely due to the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, and other Slavonic nationalities, who did not hesitate to offer their services.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The Boy Scouts were the next on the program; they presented a drill demonstrating first aid to the wounded. The Czech volunteers were then presented and enthusiastically acclaimed by the audience. The band played the "Star Spangled Banner," and within a few seconds the hall was turned into a sea of fluttering flags.</p>
   <p>A flaming address was then delivered by Mr. Jan (John) Straka, well-known worker among our societies, after which followed another by the popular public speaker, Mrs. Clara Klaus. Dr. Jan (John) Rudis - Jicinsky, editor of the Sokol Americky (American Sokol), gave the audience a survey of his experiences on the Balkan peninsula where he was the leader of a Red Cross auxiliary branch, financed by the well-known philanthropist, Mr. Frothingham. He spoke highly of the beneficent activities of Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, United States minister to the Balkan states, who made contributions out of his own purse when the auxiliary Red Cross branch was most in need of support. Mr. Vopicka, himself, then took the platform and spoke words which, as usual, charged the assembly with intense patriotic sentiment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>The vocal singing part of the program was intrusted to the Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Central Singing Association); under the baton of Mr. Joseph Houdek, chorus director. It rendered Smetana's enchanting chorus, "Veno" (Dedication). The male octet, Rieger, sang in English the "Star Spangled Banner," and "My Country 'Tis of Thee." The two Czech national anthems "Hej Slovane" (Ho Slavs!) and "Kde Domov Muj?" (Where is My Homeland?) were sung by the entire assembly with patriotic fervor, Mr. Rubringer's orchestra assisting.</p>
   <p>The patriotic purpose of the meeting was served in the highest degree; the financial results also were most satisfactory. Fullest recognition is due to a small army of our ladies who proved very efficient as agitators among the audience for membership in the Red Cross; most in the gathering enlisted for service.</p>
   <p>The great manifestation will form a new chapter, more remarkable than all previous ones in the history of Czech Chicago.</p>
