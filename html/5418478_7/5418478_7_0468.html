   <p>One would wish that meetings like the Convention held in Chicago, Feb. 9th to 12th, might take place oftener, for they invariably result in more intensive and efficient work.</p>
   <p>Every district branch of the Alliance, with the exception of the Canadian branch, was represented by one or two delegates, districts with more than fifteen branches having two delegates. The National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics, which forms an autonomous division of the Alliance, was represented by its Chicago officers and by delegates from Cleveland and St. Louis. It is no exaggeration to say that since the day when the first Czech immigrant landed in the United States, no Bohemian assemblage has been held in this country with such a high average of ability and actual achievement.</p>
   <p>Organization changes were the subject of greatest interest to the delegates. In every other allied state there is one common organization of Czechs and Slovaks. That is not feasible in this country, where the Bohemian National Alliance and the Slovak League have become too firmly established in the hearts of their people to give place to a new body with a new name. But a union, closer <span class="page-break">\2</span>than the cooperation heretofore practiced, was deemed necessary by all the delegates of the Bohemian National Alliance, as well as by the accredited representatives of the Slovak League. A number of plans were proposed and the result was the creation of an American Branch of the Czechoslovak National Council, composed of eight representatives of the Alliance and the same number sent by the League. This new organ will have charge of all political, consular, informational, recruiting and relief activities, and offices will be established in Washington and New York. The eight Czech members of the Council were at once elected. They are: Charles Pergler, Dr. L. J. Fisher, Prof. B. Simek, Rev. A. B. Koukol, Mrs. Caroline Motak, Father O. Zlamal, John Straka and Hynek Dostal.</p>
