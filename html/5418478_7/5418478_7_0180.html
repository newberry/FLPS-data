   <p>The Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), under whose emerald lawn over thirty thousand of our countrymen dream dream dreams from which there is no awakening, was literally flooded yesterday with billows of surging throngs throughout the day. Thousands and thousands of our countrymen passed through the Cemetery's gates to decorate the graves of their departed friends; to offer to them, and to the valiant citizens who lost their lives in battle under the starry flag, a quiet and dignified tribute. The huge city of the dead was transformed, as by a magic wand, into a sea of blossoms, and you could hardly find a grave which did not show evidence of the pious regard of the living to those who with arms crossed over rigid bosoms, made their last pilgrimage through the gates to eternal rest.</p>
   <p>As in previous years, the solemn celebration, an event staged in the frame <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of fresh verdure and azure skies, was held at the foot of the veterans' monument. Yesterday's celebration was the most beautiful one we have ever been privileged to witness. It was half past ten o'clock in the morning when the gates of the Cemetery let in the cortege, which was formed more than two hours earlier at the Cesko-Anglicka Svobodomyslna Skola (Bohemian-English Free-Thought School) on 18th Street, and which later re-formed, after a long journey, at the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), right close to the Cemetery. It consisted of a military band under the baton of Mr. Konopasek, members of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, veterans of the Civil War, veterans of the Spanish-American War, and a body of Sharpshooters. These uniformed groups gathered around the monument where the usual rites in honor of these men who gave their lives in service to the Union were performed. The rites consisted of speeches, funeral ceremonies and a triple salvo fired by the Sharpshooters. The celebration proper took place on an improvised platform in the immediate vicinity of the monument.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The platform was occupied by members of the Cemetery board, inmates of the Orphanage, and invited guests. The celebration started after the ceremonies at the monument by a short, informal, but sincere address by President Jan Pecha. The band then played Safranek's "Zvuky Ceske" (Bohemian Airs) which are based on Bohemian folk songs; and Mr. Pecha introduced the English speaker of the day, Mr. John R. Newcomer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Newcomer, a former Assistant State's attorney and at present a judge of the municipal court, presented an excellent, patriotic speech in which he paid due tribute to the Bohemians for their success in industry and in professional endeavors, and for their deep understanding of American patriotism which is so well manifested on all proper occasions. He considered it a great honor to have the opportunity of speaking to them at such an important event as the celebration of Decoration Day. To make this an official holiday was a beautiful idea, he said.</p>
   <p>"There is something infinitely elevating in seeing that all leave their usual <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>work and daily cares in order to spend a day in quiet commemoration of those who gave their lives for their country, and, incidentally, in contemplation of the great problems with which we have to grapple today. But, apart from the patriotic demonstration, this day has far-reaching significance in another way. It generates and promotes the feelings of true friendship and mutual helpfulness. We talk so much about money in our everyday life that these times are justly called materialistic. Another topic of conversation which is just as frequent is politics. But in spite of all that, friendship reaches much deeper than any financial matters, and soars much higher than all political sentiment. There is nothing in this whole wide world that could be compared to the true, clean, and unselfish friendship that a day like this causes to surge so strongly in human hearts. And if today's celebration had no other meaning, it would be of greatest importance as an occasion for meeting friends and strengthening the ties which bind us together.</p>
   <p>"It is a wonderful thing to live under the American flag and enjoy its protection. It would seem that it took the full 1,776 years after the birth <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of Christ to prepare the ground for a nation as great as ours. Apparently it was necessary for Plato to write his philosophy, for Justinian to create his laws, for Luther to lead a movement of reformation, for the first Christian martyrs to stir the surface of the Tiber River; it was necessary for Rome, Greece, and other great nations to grow, flourish, and disappear, in order that from their experiences, and the beautiful examples which they have given humanity to follow, a new, great nation might be founded. For almost fifteen hundred years this enormous western continent had to remain unknown to civilized man, and for fully two hundred years the Old World had to send here its bravest and strongest men in order that this great continent might be colonized.</p>
   <p>"For many hundred years the genius of invention and scientific research slept a deep sleep, as did this great western continent, in order to yield its rich fruit under the powerful impact of the human spirit. And thus, when the history of the world had prepared the ground, on the fourth day of July, 1776, a new, great nation was born on earth. The mere birth in itself <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of a new nation, however, is not an event of very great importance. Many nations were born, lived, grew strong, became decadent, and perished. We find their epitaphs in that huge cemetery of the past. But the nation born on the Fourth of July, 1776, was different from all those that had ever been born before. On the Fourth of July a nation came into being which was dedicated to freedom, founded on the broadest ideas--ideas that were new in the history of the world; a nation whose government derived its powers exclusively from the people, and which ruled with the consent of those whom it ruled. That day marks the beginning of our marvelous growth in population, finance, and territories. From a narrow strip along the coast this country has grown until it reaches from sea to sea, and it may be almost said that the sun never sets on the American soil.</p>
   <p>"But the real power of a nation is neither in the land it occupies nor in the size of its population. If this were the case, there would be no nation more powerful than Russia or China. The real power of a nation is in the physical, spiritual, and moral state of its people. The test of a nation is what it <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>has done to make its people happier, better, and more nearly perfect. In other words, a nation aspiring to real strength and greatness must develop physically, spiritually, and morally. Therefore, today, while we gratefully commemorate those who fought and gave their lives for our country, we must not forget that it is the duty of the living to live for their country and give it all that is best in them. Dying for one's fatherland is not the only greatness. It is just as great to live for it. Let us bear in mind that we who are living face just as great problems as those who sacrificed their lives on the altar of the country, and that a satisfactory solution of our problems requires just as devoted a patriotism as was theirs. The bodies of those who fell have long since turned to ashes and dust, but the spirit that led them to glorious deeds is still with us.</p>
   <p>"Life under The Star-Spangled Banner, this symbol of human liberty, is a great privilege. But it carries with it certain duties which we, as true Americans, are obliged to take upon ourselves. The life of an individual is like the life of a nation. It never can stand still. It must either rise to <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>new heights or sink; either progress and grow or deteriorate and shrink. Here lies our responsibility. To live for a principle is just as difficult and sacred as to die for it; and if those living now will do their duty just as heroically and nobly as the heroes of 1776, 1861, and 1896, there is not the least doubt that the American nation will grow and get stronger and stronger, until it acquires a decisive influence upon all other nations of the world. Already the influence of the principle put into practice July 4, 1776, that no government has any other power than that which it derives from the consent of the people, is indelibly impressed upon humanity the world over; and its influence will keep on growing until the time comes when the young American government is considered the political savior of all humanity."</p>
   <p>The judge's speech, frequently interrupted by spirited applause, was followed by the recitation of the poem, very appropriate for the occasion, "Padlym Hrdinum" (To the Heroes That Fell), by Barbora Klecka, a little inmate of the Orphanage. Her recitation was excellent and gained for her the sympathies <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>of the entire audience. Dvorak's "Humoresque," now so popular as to be included on the program of almost every concert, was played by the band of Mr. Konopasek. Following this the Bohemian speaker of the day was presented to the audience. For this year's celebration the managers secured the services of Mr. Josef Mekota, a lawyer from Cedar Rapids, and a well-known speaker endowed not only with brilliant ideas but also with a sonorous, sympathetic voice. His speech, in brief, ran as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our great Republic is not rich in national holidays. But those that we have are inseparably tied with the halo of heroic deeds, and live by the memory of great sacrifices. One of the American holidays carrying the most sentimental connotations is Decoration Day. This day stirs in us an immense flow of sacred memories, beautiful sentiments, and deep gratitude. To honor the memory of the dead is an age-old custom. Since gray antiquity, people of various civilizations, creeds, and customs have been manifesting in many different ways their reverence for the memory of their dead. This day has a particular significance <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>in our country. In 1868, General Logan, the commander in chief of the Army of the Republic, issued a proclamation by which May 30 was dedicated to the memory of heroes who fell in the Civil War. He selected May 30 because, at the end of that war, the Army of the North was disbanded on that day. He words can describe the compassion which the heroes of that War have for the unification of our Republic. No language is rich enough for that purpose. There are no words which whould adequately express the horrible sacrifices of life and property of those who took part in the great tragedy of our nation. But the principle which was involved required such sacrifices. Destiny has decreed that in the evolution of human government the principle of democracy must be bought by the sacrifice of millions of lives. The seeds of discord which threatened to destroy the best government under the sun were sown during the birth of the colonies on American shores. The rift which, in 1861, grew into an abyss of destruction, had its beginning in the rise of Massachusetts and Virginia. The differences between the character, the principles, and the conditions of these two were deep, obvious and natural."</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>This part of the speech was followed by a clear description of conditions prevailing immediately before the start of the fratricidal war of the North against the South, and an explanation of reasons leading to the break. It was not, in the first place, for the liberation of Negroes, as is commonly believed. According to the speaker, the sword was to decide whether this country was to be ruled by the whole people, or by an arrogant, selfish oligarchy. It was a cruel test which was to prove beyond doubt that free democracy is possible in this world. To fight for such a high and sacred principle was as great a duty and a privilege as a man can possibly be heir to. Immortal, therefore, is the memory of heroes who fell or died in this significant struggle. May our infinite gratitude make happy those who are still among us. It is our greatest privilege to honor the memory of the departed and be grateful to the living heroes, liberators of our country.</p>
   <p>In every state of our active and complicated life there are heroes and heroines whose memory deserves recognition and veneration. Here, under the green lawn, <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>rests a good, thoughtful mother who tirelessly exercised her mental and physical powers to educate her children properly and to make her family happy. She is one who deserves loving remembrance not only once a year, but every day. And over there rests the body of a father who, throughout his life, made sacrifices with the utmost loyalty for the good of his dear ones. His memory ought to be kept as fresh as the flowers that adorn his grave. There are thousands of men and women whose deeds will never become a part of world history, but who have made by their common sense, their work, their generosity, definite contributions to the welfare of mankind. Great scientists, deep thinkers, prominent poets and famous statesmen have all contributed in their own way to the happiness and progress of humanity. All these have left us, as a beautiful heritage, their memories.</p>
   <p>"My Chicago countrymen," continued the speaker, "ought to be congratulated upon the way they celebrate this holiday. They are deserving of recognition and appreciation of the American public and the American press."</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>In his further remarks the speaker paid tribute to the growth and success of benevolent societies whose membership in the United States is close to eight million. The Bohemians may be justly proud of the fact that they were the first in this country to engage in benevolent organization activities--the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) are pioneers in the development of the present principles and activities of benevolent brotherhood. The Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky celebrate this year their sixtieth anniversary. During this time they succeeded in making their way through a maze of prejudice, enmity and spite; it is, therefore, only proper that we should remember their founders today.</p>
   <p>"There is a great deal we can learn from those who have died," continued the speaker. "Their virtues and their achievements form an excellent example for us to emulate. The sweet memories of their noble traits enrich and deepen our lives. There is nothing that can so fill our hearts with humility and strengthen our ideals as a quiet hour in the city of the dead. Here they <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>rest in eternal peace, free of all cares and sorrows, worries and troubles of our complicated, strenuous life. No insatiable ambitions, no chasing after the almighty dollar, no vain fancies disturb the dreams of those who have crossed the invisible, mysterious barrier between life and death. No race after the will-o'-the wisp of worldly power, no complaints of the unhappy, no sobs of the suffering mar their peace. In our memories they are not subject to any changes. We see them just as they left us, be it yesterday or fifty years ago; and thus we shall see them to the very end of our earthly pilgrimage.</p>
   <p>"Today's celebration would be incomplete for us Bohemian-Americans if we did not pay tribute to the memory of the greatest of Bohemian-Americans, the immortal Karel Jonas. His work and his unselfish activities in behalf of Bohemians in their new country cannot be fully appreciated. He was the Bohemian Horace Greeley. He was the one who urged Bohemians to go West and turn the prairies into a beautiful paradise. The first of our pioneers had hard beginnings, but their children must bless the foresight of Karel Jonas.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>On such occasions as this, be it in a beautiful, great cemetery, such as the one here, or in a modest little village burial ground, we should always pay our homage to the leadership of Karel Jonas.</p>
   <p>"Further it should be mentioned that in the month of May, there are the anniversaries of two of the greatest of Bohemian composers. Thirty years ago, Bedrich Smetana ended his useful and prolific life, and ten years ago he was followed by his successor, Antonin Dvorak. Smetana and Dvorak--what a team! The charm of their music will eternally entrance millions of people. They are the ones whom the world admires and to whose musical genius, the fruits of which they have given us, the world bows."</p>
   <p>The speaker gave due praise to the Cemetery and its exemplary management. "Our Narodni Hrbitov is one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the entire United States. The organization which runs it is well known throughout the country for its efficiency. It generously supports many noble and humane institutions. Its distinguished way of commemorating this American national <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>holiday makes it deserving of commendation by the American public."</p>
   <p>The speaker concluded his beautiful address with another tribute to our departed friends, whose memory will not wither like the mortal flowers--no matter how perfect they may be--with which we decorate their graves, but will shine forever in our hearts.....</p>
   <p>After Mr. Mekota's speech the band played several selections, and Victoria Kaspar, another little inmate of the Orphanage, recited in English the poem entitled "The Graves of the Household." All inmates sang together "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the Bohemian national anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home).....</p>
   <p>Those in attendance dispersed throughout the Cemetery, stopping at the graves of their dear ones, devoting a few more moments to quiet meditation.....The birds sang their song of peace. A mild breeze carried the fragrance of flowers and seemed to whisper through the trees a sweet, soothing "Requiescat".....</p>
   <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>
   <p>The members of Catholic veterans' organizations began assembling in previously designated spots before seven o'clock yesterday morning. Accompanied by veterans' bands playing gay marches, they boarded streetcars which took them to Norwood, Illinois. From the station they marched in a parade to the near-by Cemetery. By that time, all roads and side streets leading to the Cemetery were crowded with people. Small wonder--the weather was ideal for a Decoration Day celebration. The sun in its full brightness shone from early morning, and thanks to the storm and rain of two days previous the air was comparatively cool and little dust was left on the highways.</p>
   <p>The Decoration Day celebration was held both in the new and in the old cemeteries both of which belong to us [Bohemians] and the Poles. The parade disbanded and the several uniformed groups assembled around the platform which was conveniently erected upon the elevation near the Cemetery chapel. The <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>celebration proper started with the singing of the American national anthem. Thereafter, Father Valentin Kohlbeck mounted the platform and briefly explained the twofold reason for the celebration of Decoration Day.....He introduced the speaker of the day, Father K. Vesely, a professor of the College of St. Procopius at Lisle, Illinois, who enlarged on the origin of Decoration Day which dates back to the time of General Logan. He spoke about the "garden of the dead" and compared human life to nature: "Just as the seed must first disintegrate in the soil in order to sprout into a new, beautiful flower, so will man, after a time in the grave, be resurrected to new, splendid, eternal life".....In response to his eulogy of those who lost their lives in American wars, the cadets of the several uniformed organizations fired a salvo.....</p>
   <p>The English speaker of the day was Judge Kickham Scanlan of Superior Court</p>
   <p>After his speech, a musical selection and another salvo, came the main Bohemian address of the celebration. It was presented by Mr. J. Peklo, president <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>of army veterans, and ran as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear brothers and comrades! Our famous poet Vaclav Kollar, in his immortal 'Slavy Dcera (Daughter of Glory), speaks about the fatherland and proclaims with enthusiasm....'half of my heart to my country, half to the girl I love....' It was with just such sentiments as these that American solders went to war....to protect our country from its enemies....</p>
   <p>"Today we stand on this soil to commemorate those who lost their lives in service to the country. They repose in this ground after having done their sacred duty: 'Their bodies to interment, their souls to God's judgment....' Everybody who belongs to the military estate has a right to say: 'I am proud to have fought.' Spartan mothers used to send their sons to war. They presented them with a shield saying: 'Either with the shield, or on the shield.' This means that they should return as victors or lose their lives in service to the country. And these were pagan mothers...."</p>
   <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>
   <p>The speaker ended as follows: "It is God who directs the destinies of men and nations. He permits wars, distress and misery, but He helps His faithful. Constantine the Great saw in the sky a cross with the inscription: 'In this sign thou shalt conquer.' And he won a glorious victory. These friends of ours have also won a victory. They suffered, and now they rest under the sign of the cross, sleeping the sleep of the just. They fought a good fight, kept faith, and no doubt now they wear the crown of glory."</p>
   <p>This speech was followed by the band's playing "Kde Domov Muj," another salvo, and a community prayer led by Father Kohlbeck, after which the celebrants scattered in the Cemetery, and the veterans decorated the graves of their comrades with little American flags.</p>
   <p>All in all, this year's celebration at St. Adalbert Cemetery was successful, not only in regard to the weather, but also in regard to the program and all arrangements. It should be mentioned that a number of our ladies stood <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>before the gates of the Cemetery and as the people were leaving, collected ("tagged") contributions for the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society). What will be the result of their work is impossible to say now. But it will be hardly as good as last year, because they had competition with the Polish ladies yesterday, who "tagged" for their own orphanage.</p>
   <p>At Resurrection Cemetery</p>
   <p>Our countrymen assembled yesterday in immense numbers at Resurrection Cemetery in order to honor the soldiers of the Civil War who were commemorated throughout the country yesterday, and to decorate with flowers and flags the graves of their friends who rest in the Cemetery's consecrated soil.</p>
   <p>The celebration was very dignified in every respect, and our military organizations and other bodies showed the keenest interest in keeping strict order in the parade, thus making it a worthy part of the festivities.</p>
   <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>
   <p>The parade assembled at 8:00 A. M. in the church community of St. Cyrill and Methodius in our Town of Lake and was composed as follows: first marched the Second Company of Bohemian-Slavonic Veterans of Field Marshal Filipovic; then Slovak veterans; Veterans of Crown Prince Rudolph; and other organizations of the community which cared to join. The parade was led by Captain J. R. Vojtech, who was followed by a troop of policemen and the excellent band of Mr. F. Lhotak. The parade proceeded on 50th Street to Honore Street, from there to 47th Street where the participants in the parade took streetcars, standing there ready for that purpose, and rode to the Cemetery.</p>
   <p>By the time the paraders reached their destination huge crowds had assembled in the Cemetery. The parade reassembled at 11:00 A. M. in order to march, with band accompaniment, to the speakers' platform. Here the program proper started with an address by the commander of the Second Veterans' Company of Field Marshal Filipovic, Captain J. R. Vojtech, which ran somewhat as follows:</p>
   <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>
   <p>"First permit me to thank you on behalf of those who rest here in peace, and on behalf of the Veterans of Field Marshal Filipovic, for having come here in such large numbers. The attendance at this celebration has been growing from year to year, indicating our increasing desire to honor our dead.</p>
   <p>"The day of decorating graves is considered a holiday by all nations, even if each of them may meet it in its own particular way. We Bohemian veterans, as good Americans, have been celebrating this day of May 30 for thirty-two years. All nations of the world honor their war heroes by magnificent monuments and other tokens of esteem. It is to be regretted, however, that bravery is so seldom properly recognized during a man's life. In fact, there are people who scorn men brave and willing enough to risk their lives in war. As long as there is no danger of war, people are apt to abuse, mock, and deride a military man. But when war comes, they are full of enthusiasm for the armed force, and when the soldiers return, they are praised and loved as heroes. Our first president, George Washington, with his brave soldiers liberated <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>this country from exploiters and returned it to the people more than a hundred years ago. Do you think he could have done it without soldiers? At present we have a war in Mexico. Why? Because the poor people could no longer stand abuse and oppression by their own government, by American and British capitalists who own practically all of Mexico and keep the common people there in poverty, almost in slavery. Some crack-pots would like President Wilson and his Secretary of State to start a war with Mexico, but our President's sympathies are with those who deserve them. He will not be induced to war against oppressed, destitute people. On the contrary, he has warned Dictator Huerta, and will not stop until Huerta is deprived of his office and the Mexican people are assured of liberty and their human rights."</p>
   <p>Next Mr. Vojtech introduced Mr. Salak, one of the founders of our veterans' organizations, who remembered the fallen warriors in a brief but sincere speech. He expressed his pleasure at seeing that they are being appreciated throughout the country. The Second Company of Field Marshal Filipovic has <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>twelve comrades buried in these God's acres, and we pay them particular homage on this day.</p>
   <p>The speaker of the day was Father F. J. Jedlicka. His address was a masterpiece of oratory and made a deep impression on all those present. He enlarged upon the significance of this national holiday, upon the bravery of soldiers who had bled for the unity of our country on countless battlefields. Decoration Day celebrations are being held all over the country and we, as good Americans, good Bohemians, and good Catholics, honor the memory of the dead today in our own way. This celebration proves that we are loyal citizens of this new fatherland of ours, and that we are grateful to men who lost their lives for the unity of our country. The celebration also proves that we are good Catholics, because the constitution of this country is based upon Christian principles.</p>
   <p>Decoration Day is not only a national holiday; it is also a Church holiday; and the Bohemian Catholics are performing a deed of charity and true Christian love by commemorating those who bled to death for the country, and those <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>dear ones who dream their eternal dreams in this Cemetery. Therefore, this celebration has not only a worldly significance, but also a religious significance. To remember the dead is a meritorious act which should never be neglected.</p>
   <p>Father Jedlicka's speech was followed by a prayer in which he was joined by all those present.</p>
   <p>It was one of the finest celebrations ever held in the Resurrection Cemetery. Quiet and dignified, it will leave the happiest recollections in all those who took part in it.</p>
