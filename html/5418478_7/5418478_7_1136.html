   <p>A regular meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was held in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) last night.....</p>
   <p>Among the incoming letters was one from the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), inviting the board to the annual inspection of the institutions to be held Saturday, October 25. The inspection will include an exhibit of the inmates' handwork.....</p>

   <p>The bonds will be secured by a real-estate mortgage on the Hospital's property. They will be issued to facilitate an early start in building an addition to the present home of the Hospital. The board of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice mentioned in the letter that the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov frequently invests in bonds, and that there is no reason why it should not invest in Bohemian bonds with as good security as any other bonds may offer under favorable conditions. Only two representatives offered their opinions concerning this deal. One advocated the purchase of the bonds; the other was against it and moved that the secretary be instructed to reply in the negative to the letter. His motion was carried, and the secretary will inform the Nemocnice that the board has no cash on hand because of expenses connected with the building of the crematorium.....</p>
