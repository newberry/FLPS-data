   <p>Delegates from every branch of the Czech National Alliance in America met in the hall of Sokol Chicago, Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street, yesterday morning. This was the opening day of a conference at which the activities of the Alliance will be reviewed and plans devised for further action in the movement for the liberation of Czechoslovak lands. Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Alliance, was detained, and therefore Dr. Joseph P. Pecival, vice-president, opened the meeting of the morning session by ordering a roll call of delegates. Chicago was represented by Messrs. F. J. Kubec, F. C. Layer, Ad. Lonek, and Mrs. Anna Stolfa. Sokol, Free Thought, Protestant, Catholic, and Socialist organizations, as well as press bureaus, sent delegates to this convention. The Slovak League, the military bureau of the Czechoslovak committee, the Czech National Council of Russia, and others were equally represented.....</p>

   <p>Next on the program was the election of officers and committees for the conference.....Upon a motion by Professor Pisecky, the meeting elected Mr. Ivan Bielek honorary chairman representing the Slovaks, and the Reverend Frank Jedlicka honorary chairman for the Catholics. Mr. Serpan moved that the local press be invited to the afternoon session. The motion was passed and the morning meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig Fisher opened the afternoon meeting. This conference, he said, is going to accomplish its task by strengthening our efforts.</p>
   <p>After the recent declarations made by Lloyd George and President Wilson had been read, several attacks were directed against the Czech National Alliance, the two declarations being interpreted as proof of inefficient work of the Alliance. Dr. Fisher answered that Lloyd George had been reproached by the secretary-general of the Alliance because he had not firmly supported Czech demands. The prominent English statesman, Dr. Fisher, stated, had spoken in this manner: "The Allies stand upon their original program. This program is <span class="page-break">3</span>contained in the Allied answer to President Wilson's peace note. However, it would be ridiculous if the Allies promised liberty to the oppressed nations at a time when the enemy is on our soil. The Allies, nevertheless, adhere to those points in President Wilson's answer, i.e., those about the liberation of the Czechoslovaks."</p>
   <p>Under the influence of President Wilson's note, there developed a new reaction, and new assaults against the Czech National Alliance were made, Dr. Fisher continued. These attacks are designed to undermine some leaders authority, which is causing uneasiness in certain people. These activities are due to a spirit of sheer demagogism, which tends to destroy the results of untiring efforts. Dr. Fisher declared that the leading minds of the Alliance are doing their duty under the full realization of their responsibility, and that they will gladly invite well-meant suggestions for improvement. Dr. Fisher is willing to resign if the cause would thereby be benefited. However, he added, it is not so easy to find substitutes for such workers as Pergler, Benes, and Joseph Tvrzicky.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The speaker went on to say that for three years the leaders have been made the target of attacks, but have kept quiet. They did this not because they felt guilty, but because they knew that their position demanded work before polemics. The speaker expects this assembly to set itself up not only as a judge of his activities, but also as an advocate of his work if it has been well performed.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fisher enumerated the purposes for which this conference was called: 1. It is very necessary to work out a plan for our future political tasks carefully. It is equally imperative to work for closer contact with our brothers, the Slovaks, and with the Catholics. But it is of paramount importance to cultivate close relations with persons influential in politics, and also to distribute more propaganda through the press. 2. The Czech National Alliance should be reorganized, indeed. To create some other organization, however, would require extreme efforts and energy. 3. Some people clamor for a democratization of the Czech National Alliance. This is a beautiful word, but where there is no order, authority, and self-discipline, democracy remains a <span class="page-break">5</span>hollow phrase and denotes disorganization.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fisher closed by declaring that all the officers of the organization have been working in an unselfish spirit and are ready to submit their accounts to the public.</p>
   <p>The program was then discussed, and Mr. E. V. Voska, representing New York organizations, moved that the program for the conference be referred to a special committee, and also that representatives of the Slovak League and of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America be invited to take part in the debates at the conference. The motion was not carried, and a proposition by Dr. Breuer [the report does not state the nature of this proposition] was accepted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, took the floor to report on the activities of the central committee of the Alliance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The central committee and its headquarters grew gradually and performed tasks which were never thought of at first. The agenda may be divided into three groups: Agitational, political, and financial. In all these three fields the office of the committee fulfilled its duties and often did more than that.</p>
   <p>The quality of the work done is demonstrated by its results, i.e., a strong organization embracing the entire United States, based upon the joint progress made in the movement for the liberation of the Czechoslovaks. The work performed by the central committee was of necessity extremely varied. Consider that there are only two persons working in the office who draw wages. They are the secretary and the organizer, besides occasional help and the regular office boy. With this staff, the office takes care of eight thousand items of correspondence per year and sends out thousands of letters and tens of thousands of booklets, circulars, handbills, newspapers, etc.</p>
   <p>Such an immense amount of work cannot be disposed of in any office the size <span class="page-break">7</span>of ours without real sacrifice and extreme self-denial.</p>
   <p>With all this work it was necessary to think and to act for the entirety of the movement in America. If there be one just reproach raised against the workers up to now, it is the fact that they exerted themselves more than their strength allowed.</p>
   <p>Besides the regular work, our office also took care of political propaganda. The office of the central committee did not miss any opportunity to advance the cause of the Czech people before the forum of the American public. The entrance of America into the war facilitated the progress of our work, but on the other hand, enlarged its scope considerably. Neutrality limited our activities to a certain degree, but the war often compels us to use much discrimination and reserve. This occurs when American interests apparently cross with those of the Czechoslovaks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzicky spoke of the work performed by the central organization. He pointed to the report made by Attorney K. Pergler, director of the Slav Bureau, a Slav press organization. This office, the report shows, has performed gigantic feats since its creation. It had to supply information to a large number of American papers concerning Czech aspirations. It had to establish and maintain political contacts with outstanding men. Although it frequently had to face well-nigh insurmountable obstacles, still it could record excellent results. There is hardly one American publication that would not print flattering editorials or information about us. Many tons of information were sent out. The Bureau reached every spot of productive ground for the Czechoslovak cause.</p>
   <p>The results of such efforts are already apparent today; the real fruit will, however, grow in the future. According to Mr. Pergler, we may hope that the proclamations of neither Lloyd George nor President Wilson are to be considered as final, because the political situation is changing rapidly and the last word has not been spoken yet. One fact stands, i.e., that the Czechoslovak <span class="page-break">9</span>cause has very influential friends. France is the foremost of them, emphasizing this by its recognition of an independent Czechoslovak Army as a unit of the Allied Army. There is another success for us, and one hard to excel: Former President Roosevelt seldom delivers a speech without making mention of the Czech rights to independence.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pergler has a mass of documents in his possession which prove his statements to be correct. There are telegrams, communications, and newspaper clippings. He could not, for tactical reasons, reveal to the delegates all the details of his work. It is evident from his report, however, that the organization has been working with utmost perseverance and astounding persistency.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Pergler's report, Dr. Fisher spoke on the information sent to him by Dr. Edouard Benes, general secretary of the Czechoslovak National Council, now in Paris, France, which deals with the political and military situation.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Yesterday's session was adjourned officially at 6 P.M., but many delegates lingered until late at night.</p>
