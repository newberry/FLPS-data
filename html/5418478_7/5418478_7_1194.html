   <p>The recent meeting of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was opened by President Pecha.....The printed circular of the Patronat Skoly Vojta Naprstek (Trustees of the Vojta Naprstek School) addressed to the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov was read in the meeting and caused a great deal of discussion. The circular dealt with the misunderstanding between the Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslne (Bohemian Free Thought Trustees), Skoly Vojta Naprstek, and the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) in regard to the method of appointing and paying the teachers, and requested the board to voice its agreement with the point of view of the Patronat.....From the discussion it became <span class="page-break">2</span>apparent that a large majority of the trustees approved the standpoint of the Zdruzeni.....and the subsequently offered motion to table the circular and express confidence in the Zdruzeni was passed almost unanimously.....</p>
   <p>Of special interest among the expense items was the amount of $4,352.77 paid to the Kaspar State Bank for County Hospital bonds bought as an investment at ninety-six and a fraction. Also the pay roll for August amounted to the unusually high sum of $3,560.70.</p>
   <p>All of the representatives were surprised by Mr. F. Kopecky's proposal to build a John Huss monument in the newly opened section of the Cemetery. The four-hundredth (sic) anniversary of the martyr death of John Huss will be commemorated next year, and it would be a matter of considerable merit for the board to devote some four or five thousand dollars to the honoring of this famous Bohemian fighter for the freedom of conscience. During the <span class="page-break">3</span>ensuing debate it was pointed out that the board should be careful with its money now that the crematorium is to be built, for it will cost approximately $75,000. The new sewer will cost about $10,000; there will be heavy expenses with the improvements on Foster Avenue and 40th Avenue; and the cemetery is not making much money this year.....</p>
   <p>It was argued that there are so many Bohemian national organizations that are in need of support, such as the John Huss Memorial Building, Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital), and public enterprises, that it would not be advisable to start something new again. As a compromise it was suggested that a bust of John Huss or a memorial tablet could be placed in the new crematorium. But no formal motion was made one way or another, and the matter was left to be thought through by the representatives.</p>
   <p>The financial report showed $74,212.82 as the balance from July; income <span class="page-break">4</span>during August, $5,285.42; expenses, $28,853.79, which leaves ready cash of $23,644.48, of which $20,000 was deposited in a bank at three per cent interest and $3,644.48 left with the treasurer.</p>
