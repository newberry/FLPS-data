   <p>Bohemians will lead the Fourth of July parade. For that reason, we should see to it that we are not last in public opinion. It is of importance to us that the public should have a favorable opinion about us in everything, everywhere, and here once again we are offered an opportunity to accomplish this end. The arrangements committee should see to it that our section should not only equal those of other nationalities, but far surpass them. It is true that it will cost money, much money, but what of it? That can always be gotten. Our businessmen and our more well-to-do countrymen, will help us, and to be sure those who more frequently come into contact with other nationalities will gladly contribute suitable amounts, for they know that it is not good to economize where our dignified appearance is concerned.</p>
