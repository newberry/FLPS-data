   <p>Oak Park's new Sokol gymnasium was dedicated yesterday. Favorable weather brought many guests from Chicago to the scene of festivities. Several Sokol societies were very well represented. The gymnasts came to enjoy a few joyous enthusiastic moments.</p>
   <p>Around 2:00 P. M. a company of Sokols in uniform marched from the old building to the new headquarters. The new building was dedicated in a fitting prologue by brother F. Drabek. The keys to the building were given to little Miss A. Koller and she, in turn, with enthusiastic words, handed the keys to the president and called upon him to open the doors to this Sokol temple. The president gave thanks for the honor and trust which were thus shown him. He welcomed the guests and forecast a beautiful future. Doctor Rudis-Jicinsky urged the Sokols to continued activity so that ideals which are still unattained may be realized; only through the proper rearing of the young generation can this be accomplished.</p>
