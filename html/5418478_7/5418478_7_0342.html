   <p>The John Huss League of Freemasons, founded July 6, 1914, at Gary, Indiana, where it was incorporated under the laws of Indiana, held a meeting in the La Salle Hotel yesterday. This League is composed of Bohemian Master Masons of the whole United States, and was founded on the occasion of the Five Hundredth Anniversary of the tragic death of John Huss, the annual commemoration of whose martyrdom is one of its purposes. The La Salle Hotel has been selected as the headquarters of the League and the seat of its Board of Directors. Moreover as we have been informed by its secretary, Maximilian Kirchman, yesterday's meeting of the League was very successful and most fruitful in respect to outlining the League's activities and plans for the future.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held January 2, at 2:00 P.M. At this meeting is to be decided where the coming anniversary of John Huss' death is to be commemorated.</p>
   <p>The meeting received a large number of congratulatory messages which show that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the efforts of its Board are fully appreciated. It was concluded by a banquet, an informal affair marked by good fellowship. The toastmaster was the well-known Serbian journalist, Mr. John R. Palandech and among the speakers were Captain Norton of Gary, Indiana, and Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal.</p>
   <p>Miss Jirina Rudis presented two wonderful compositions by Dvorak and proved again that, in spite of her youth, she is an accomplished violin virtuoso. She was accompanied on the piano by Mr. Karel Florian.</p>
   <p>The most interesting event of the evening was a speech by Dr. [Jan] Rudis-Jicinsky, who described the various experiences, both tragic and gay, he had had during his year's sojorun in unfortunate Serbia as the head of the Bohemian-American Medical Expedition. His talk was followed with close attention by the audience.</p>
   <p>We are told that Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky is preparing for a big lecture in the hall <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of Sokol Pilsen. He is getting ready a large number of colored stereopticon slides for that occasion. It is expected that this lecture will arouse a great deal of interest in our public.</p>
   <p>It was long past ten o'clock when the participants of the banquet began to depart for their homes.</p>
