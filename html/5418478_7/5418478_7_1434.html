   <p>The law introducing compulsory service is going to be ratified tomorrow, or even today. This will do away with the privilege of enlistment for service in the Army and Navy; it will also eliminate the various advantages attached to voluntary service. One of these is the opportunity offered to our men to serve in Czech companies and to display their efficiency and fervor in a body of Czech extraction. If they miss the moment by waiting for compulsory recruiting, the Czech-Americans will not be allowed to join units with a Czech hue, but they will be placed wherever needed. The comfort which lies in doing duty together will not be granted to them in the future. Every able-bodied young Czech should hurry to the recruiting station in Pilsen Park and enlist in time.</p>
   <p>A group of Czech and Slovak volunteers, numbering fifty, will march tonight to the depot from where the train will leave for Jefferson Barracks, Mo.</p>

   <p>A large crowd of our Czech fellow-citizens are expected to give them a dignified and enthusiastic farewell.</p>
