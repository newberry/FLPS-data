   <p>Because the chairman of the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych v Americe (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America), Mr. Vojtech Cada, failed to appear, the conference, upon the request of Mrs. Anna Vodak, was called to order by Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, who addressed the delegates and briefly outlined the purpose of this conference. The reading of the names of the delegates followed. There were eighty-three delegates, representing as many Free Thought societies, attending the conference.</p>
   
   <p>It was further agreed that a chairman, a vice-chairman, a secretary, and a resolutions committee consisting of seven members be elected to serve as officers of the conference. Mr. Jan Pecha was elected chairman, Mrs. Anna Vodak, vice-chairman, and Mr. V. K. Soukup, secretary. The following delegates were elected as the members of the resolutions committee: Dr. J. E. S. Vojan, Mr. Joseph W. Egermayer, Mr. Jan J. Jelinek, Mr. Joseph M. Musil, Mrs. Ruzena Lorenz, Mrs. Anna Novak, and Mr. Frantisek Ort.</p>
   <p>The chairman then took his chair and in a brief speech requested that all the delegates take part in the proceedings and follow them closely, but that the proceedings should not be uselessly delayed and the conference prevented from adjourning today. In the meantime Mr. V. Cada, chairman of the executive committee, appeared at the meeting. Dr. J. E. S. Vojan then read the proposed order of the conference, which was approved as read. The reading of the congratulatory communications followed.....The secretary of the executive committee presented his detailed report. The report was approved. The reading of the report on the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych 1920 (National Tax of Bohemian Freethinkers, 1920) then followed. According to the report of the auditing committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, the proceeds of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych amounted to $2,564.55. The expenditure connected with the collection amounted to $781.26, a sum which is equivalent to thirty-one per cent of the entire collection. The remaining sixty-nine per cent of the collection will be divided between the local branch of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych of that settlement in which the tax was collected and the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych. For instance, in Chicago the sum of $1,695.90 was collected. Expenditures with the collection amounted to $525.75. The share of the Chicago branch amounts to $585.08. Total survey of the collection is as follows:</p>

   <p>Afternoon Session</p>
   <p>The conference was called to order by the chairman at 2:15 P.M. The minutes of the morning session were approved as read. The chairman then transmitted the request of the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky v Americe (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies of America) according to which the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych should seek representation in the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v America (Czechoslovak National Council of America). A lengthy debate followed in which Mr. Vojtech Cada, Mr. V. K. Soukup, Mr. Jan. J. Jelinek, and many other delegates took part. Finally, the request was referred to the executive committee.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. E. S. Vojan then read resolutions which were prepared by the resolutions committee.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. I was approved as read.</p>
   <p>Resolution No.II aroused a stormy debate in which Mr. Joseph M. Musil, Mr. V. K. Soukup, Mr. Emil Sindel, Mr. Vojtech Cada, and many other delegates participated. Finally, the resolution was passed with an amendment proposed by Mr. J. Mikolas, according to which the entire proceeds of a festival which will be arranged by the Chicago branch of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych on July 3, this year, will be donated to the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago), providing that the Sdruzeni will refuse the assistence offered by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
   
   <p>Resolution No. III was passed.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. IV was rejected.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. V was unanimously passed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frantisek Ort's proposal that contacts be made with other foreign-speaking free thought organizations was referred to the executive committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Hanzlik's motion that the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni be publicly challenged to turn certain funds over to the purpose for which these funds were collected was seconded by Mr. J. Mikulasek and carried through. The resolutions committee was instructed to prepare a suitable resolution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tomas Zahour expressed astonishment that the Bohemian daily newspapers had no reporters at this conference. It was explained that the minutes of the conference are to be sent to the newspapers and published.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. J. Vojan mentioned that the Bohemian Freethinkers of America are very indifferent, that they do not attend free lectures, and that because of this indifference the Nedelni Besedy (Sunday Get-together) had to be discontinued.</p>
   <p>The resolutions committee presented a resolution concerning Mr. J. Hanzlik's motion. The resolution was unanimously passed.</p>
   <p>The election of the members of the Illinois state committee then came up. It was agreed that four men, three ladies, and three substitutes [men and women] be elected. The following were elected as members of the committee: Mrs. Marie Zeman, Mr. Vaclav Vohralik, Mr. Joseph M. Musil, Mr. Jaroslav Hadraba, Mrs. Ruzena Lusk, Mr. Joseph Kroc, and Mrs. Ruzena Lorenz. The following were elected as substitutes: Mrs. Frantiska Makovsky, Mr. Emil Sindel, and Mr. Otto Rajtora.</p>
   <p>The chairman recommended that before the next national tax of Freethinkers is collected each settlement should be divided into districts and each family of that district should be visited by the collector.</p>
   <p>After a fitting speech by the chairman the conference was adjourned at 4:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>V. K. Soukup, secretary.</p>
   <p>Following are the resolutions passed by the conference:</p>
   <p>Resolution No. I: The Svaz Svobodomyslnych and the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe</p>
   <p>The conference of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych of the State of Illinois, held May 29, 1921, and attended by eighty-three delegates of as many Free Thought societies and by many individuals, hereby proclaims:</p>
   
   <p>Whereas, At the conference at the plenary meeting of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe, held in Pittsburgh, April 19, 1921, the Reverend Frantisek Bozenek stated that the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) has been reorganized and that all of the Catholic societies of men and women are represented in it; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, We consider it an absolute necessity that the Bohemian freethinkers of America also must have their own Svaz which would be a counterbalance to the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku and by which it would be proved that the majority of the Bohemians of America always were and have been adherents of the Free thought movement; therefore be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we ask all the Bohemian Free Thought men and women societies and all the Bohemian Freethinkers of America to join the Svaz as soon as possible in order to make a strong organization a reality.</p>
   
   <p>The principal purpose of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych has been the propagation of the Free Thought movement among the Bohemians of America. Inasmuch as the Bohemian Catholics have their own Svaz Ceskych Katoliku in which they are united, it is therefore necessary for the Bohemian Freethinkers to recognize the necessity of having their own Svaz. We are not original in advocating this action. We have been forced to do so by other groups. The other great Bohemian Free Thought organizations such as the Sokols, the principal purpose of which is physical culture and character development, and the benevolent societies, the main purpose of which is to take care of families who lost their supporters, will in no way hurt their reputation or their standing by joining it.</p>
   <p>We do not want to fight the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni. If that organization is able to find and engage itself in another sphere of activity, then it would be entitled to exist among us just as any other organization. But we can not permit this organization to be in the way of the growth of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, which is the only road to a strong organization for the Bohemian Freethinkers of America.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. II: In the Interest of the Bohemian Free Thought Schools</p>
   <p>Since the Bohemian Free Thought schools in America were and always have been maintained exclusively by the Bohemian Freethinkers, and inasmuch as we do not wish to be censured sometime in the future because religious people also helped to maintain our Bohemian Free Thought schools, and inasmuch as the officers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni stated that the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni cannot be a pure Free Thought organization because adherents of religious denominations also work in various branches of that organization, the conference recommends that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu refuse with thanks the promised proceeds of the so-called Narodni Posviceni (National Country Wake) which the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni is arranging for the benefit of Free Thought schools in the month of August. We want to remain independent and genuine Freethinkers as far as our schools are concerned, and we therefore express a firm hope that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol will act in a similar way, and that it will follow the example of the board of directors of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage when a similar offer was made by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni to that institution last year.</p>
   <p>Instead the conference recommends the following:</p>
   <p>Let the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol arrange its own Posviceni and in that case we ask all the Free Thought societies to support the said project to the best of their ability.</p>
   <p>If the gift of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni is refused, we promise to do the following:</p>
   
   <p>1. To donate the proceeds of the Freethinkers' Festival, which will be held July 3, to the Bohemian Free Thought schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>2. To donate one half of the proceeds of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych, which will be collected again this year all over the United States, to the Bohemian Free Thought schools of America.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. III: The Svaz Svobodomyslnych and the Bohemian Labor Movement in America</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the conference recognizes the fact that the great majority of the Bohemian people of America, and the Freethinkers especially, belong to the working class, and inasmuch as every improvement of economic and cultural conditions of the working class also means an improvement of conditions of the Bohemian people of America in general, the conference considers it its duty to support every effort and every action leading to the improvement of these conditions, and expresses a willingness to assume direct contacts with labor organizations which represent the Bohemian labor movement of America for the purpose of mutual support leading to the liberation of the Bohemian working class of America from economic and spiritual slavery.</p>
   <p>Resolution No. V: One-Cent Head Tax</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as more money is needed for the propagation of the Free Thought movement, the conference asks all the Free Thought societies to follow the example of those organizations and societies which are already paying one cent a month for each of their members, and we urge them to vote for the one-cent head tax as soon as possible. Fifteen per cent of this head tax is given to the state committee, and the remainder is given to the executive committee, which uses it for gaining new members and for organization purposes.</p>
   
   <p>Resolution No. VI: The Remaining Liberation Funds</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the largest part of the money which is today in the possession of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni was collected by the Bohemian Freethinkers of America, the conference of Freethinkers, at which eighty-three Free Thought societies are represented by their delegates, hereby challenges the officers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni to donate, at once, all the remaining funds toward the purpose for which this money was collected.</p>
