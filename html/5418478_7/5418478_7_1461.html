   <p>The office of the Bohemian National Alliance reports a good frequency by men who seek to enlist for service in the Czechoslovak regiment which is being formed here. Two thousand and two men are necessary to fill the quota. They ought to be gathered in as short a time as possible.</p>
   <p>It is of interest to know that men from the Socialistic Delnicka Telocuicna Jednota (Workmen's Gymnastic Unit) are joining. They number twenty-five up to now. Of other Sokol organizations, a great number has also enlisted up to the present.</p>
   <p>It will not be necessary to urge our fellow-countrymen to join, for they can see excellent examples of patriotism in the enlisted men of other countries, such as France and England, not to mention our plucky Czech and Slovak volunteers in their battalion in Canada. The Czechoslovak <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>legion is now being created. If every able-bodied Czech and Slovak will join, he will help to call the attention of the American press to our patriotic endeavor and sense of duty. All of our Czech fellow-citizens should inform young men of this Czechoslovak league, and so remind them of the opportunity to attest their patriotic conviction and ardor.</p>
