   <p>It was a melancholy, unfriendly day that greeted us yesterday morning while we made preparations to be on the way to our National Cemetery, there to perform the time-honored rite of decorating the place of rest of our dead. The morning, that had held out scant promise of fair weather, had mercy on us, however, and glided smoothly into a bright day which turned gloom into solemnly festive feelings. Society after society began to arrive at the C. S. P. S. (Liberal School), the point of rallying,and shortly after 9 a. m. the tunes sounded by Rubringer's band soared into the air, bidding the gathering to begin their march. The procession was led by Mr. F. Stejskal, marshal, and accompanied, besides the band, by the bugle and drum corps of the "Plzensky" Sokol (gymnastic society).</p>
   <p>After 10 a. m. the parade reassembled before the Orphan Asylum, near the cemetery, from where it wended its way directly to the monument of the Czech veterans. Among those on the speakers' platform were O. H. Carter, judge of the circuit court, who delivered the commemorating speech in the American language, and Attorney John J. Vlach from Milwaukee, who spoke in the Czech language.</p>

   <p>The president of the National Cemetery Association began the celebration by welcoming the multitude of participants and then introduced the marshal of the festival, Mr. Stejskal, upon whose signal the band played the touching composition "Bugle Call in Camp of the Grand Army."</p>
   <p>The pupils of the Bohemian-American Liberal School then sang "Brave Heart Sleep On"; the rendering of this tender melody was rewarded by sincere applause. Judge Carter then rose. He thanked for the opportunity given to him for a heart to heart talk with his fellow-countrymen of Czech extraction. After reviewing the momentous events of the last forty-six years, recalling to our minds the one thousand bloody battles fought in the Civil War; the preservation and the liberation of four million Negro slaves, he paused, then proceeded: "And the results of those bloody fights, my esteemed friends? Peace reigned again, former enemies became friends, they clasped hands, and from that moment we were one country, one nation under one Star Spangled Flag.</p>

   <p>I know there are from one hundred thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand of your nationality in Chicago. Many of you were born over the ocean in your dear fatherland. But surely one half of you were born here. This fact however does not make you different, for, even while you are Americans, it is Czech blood that flows in your veins; you love the old homeland, the native land of your fathers and mothers, and you must love and keep it in your heart. And, believe me my friends, it would fill me with fear if you proclaimed yourselves to be good citizens of this country without at the same time loving your old homeland. You, parents, all of you, should teach your children to love the old country, for she is as deserving as your new country, our great North American United States. In our public schools your children will learn to love the Star Spangled Banner and to honor this country that has hospitably received you and that you yourselves have sworn allegiance to."</p>
   <p>Then Judge Carter, after reviewing several occurrences of political and historical import, pointed out that we really should have no need for generals and armies; what we need are men and women, who by intelligent voting will decide the issues and the future of their new homeland.</p>

   <p>"Let us indeed, make honesty become our policy, and the ballot our throne. Lo and behold the flag! What does it mean? Liberty, a peaceful home and enlightenment!"</p>
   <p>The oration was received with whole hearted applause.</p>
   <p>The judge was leaving the cemetery with evident reluctance, when he was asked by the press how he liked the cemetery.</p>
   <p>"I have not seen a cemetery more beautiful in the vicinity of Chicago, I assure you. I admire these most beautiful trees; I like this sod, and above all I am enchanted by these gorgeous floral ornaments upon the graves that shelter your dead."</p>
   <p>Judge Carter is known as a man who does not talk lightly.</p>

   <p>In view of his appreciative words we do not know what more could be said about our National Cemetery. The American jurist's utterance also implies praise for the National Cemetery Association and for all of those who have devoted their honest endeavor to the building up of the institution.</p>
   <p>After Judge Carter had left, the band played "Soldier's Dream," and then Attorney J. J. Vlach of Milwaukee mounted the platform amidst reverent silence. This oration was long, and yet, when he ended it, there ran a feeling through those present that he should have continued. From the speech, which was rich in content and masterful in rendition, we point to the following remarkable passages.</p>
   <p>"Just as in the life of the individual there are moments of happiness and times of distress, there are historic occasions to which posterity points with pride, and others that cause it to turn away in deepest grief.</p>

   <p>"The history of our United States is a short one compared with the history of the nations of the Old World, yet it contains many moments that command the respect, aye, the admiration of the reviewer; it has moments that are truly monumental.</p>
   <p>"Whenever I ponder over the history of this country my thoughts wander almost unconsciously over the ocean to the cradle of my youth, to our beautiful Bohemian country and then, with a sigh, I always remember how our Bohemian nation, which once had inflamed all Europe with its cry for freedom and enlightenment, now lies on the Bila Hora (White Mountain), defeated, humiliated, shoved aside and forgotten by the whole world. At this memory my eyes are filled with tears. My heart throbs with grief, and my lips whisper: Why, O Fate, why hast thou chosen my nation for such bloody sacrifice?</p>
   <p>"Yonder, in Europe, our nation is dying and here in the American plains across the stormy Atlantic a new nation is being born.</p>

   <p>"The torch of liberty and enlightenment was wrested from the hands of the Czechs, but never could the mighty flame be stilled. Fanned over the sea to these shores it rises magnificently to the skies anew, proclaiming to the whole world that the will of the people is the supreme law.</p>
   <p>"Here the republic of the United States was created; it grew; it prospered; it flourished. The American people lived in liberty and happiness, no one predicted the imminent storm which threatened to destroy the Union.</p>
   <p>"The fateful year of 1860 arrived and with it the election of Abraham Lincoln, publicly known as a sworn enemy of slavery. The ensuing Civil War was a long and a bloody one. O Friends, let us divert our gaze from the horrible spectacle! The eyes of the humanitariam must fill with tears at the memory of the bloody fight. But the Union was saved, and the Star Spangled Banner waves mightily over the reunited brethren.</p>

   <p>"America commemorates the day of its heroes today who had given their lives in the fratricidal strife. It is our sacred duty to join, not only as American citizens, but as Czechs as well. For Czechs also have died in the battles for the preservation of the Union. Many a Czech, whose cradle had stood on the banks of the silvery river, Vitava, has fought for our Union and now lies here. Many an old father, many a mother, longingly expected the return of their son to the old country--in vain. He died on the field of honor, they were to see him no more. Every Czech can proudly proclaim himself as such today and it is to be regretted that some of our kind are seemingly afraid to betray their origin."</p>
   <p>Miss George Fiala, pupil of the Czech Liberal School, created emotional sensation by reciting "Remember the Main" and "Silent Guns," whereupon the band played a medley of Czech folk songs.</p>
   <p>This year's celebration was perhaps the best attended in years. And, last but not least, the transportation was excellent, the Street Car Company having timed the cars only four minutes apart.</p>
