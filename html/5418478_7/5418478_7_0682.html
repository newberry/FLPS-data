   <p>The Very Reverend Gorazd Pavlik, a bishop of the new church of Czechoslovakia, will speak tomorrow in the Hubbard Memorial [Bohemian Brethren] Church, 2520 South Lawndale Avenue. He was invited to address the congregation of the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, and chose for his subject the theme "About the religious movement of the Czechoslovak people". The bishop's address will be authoritative, for he was the first bishop to receive his appointment by the new Czechoslovak church. The lecture will begin promptly at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>Bishop Gorazd called on us at the Denni Hlasatel yesterday. Before coming to Chicago he attended the general convention of the American Episcopal church, held in Portland, Oregon.</p>
