   <p>After several months of negotiations and exchange of opinions between the central Bohemian and Slovak organizations in America, a common working program has been officially agreed upon. The Bohemian-Slovak agreement was reached in a conference held in Cleveland, October 22, 1915, by the adoption of a program, a part of which is being published herewith.</p>
   <p>The conference, in which a most active part was taken by representatives of both the Bohemians and Slovaks, adopted spontaneously the proposals offered by the headquarters' office of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) at Chicago, causing only minor changes to be made in them and adding a few amendments.</p>
   <p>There has never been any doubt that an agreement would be reached because the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Bohemians and Slovaks are working hand in hand in brotherly unity in all parts of the world. The Svaz Cesko-Slovenskych Spolku (Federation of Bohemian-Slovak Associations) is working on behalf of both of these Slavic branches in Russia. The official organs of the political refugees from Bohemia, the Cesko-Slovanska Samostatnost (Bohemian-Slavonic Independence) and La Nation Tcheque (The Czech [Bohemian] Nation) are taking the part of both the Bohemians and the Slovaks. The organ of the Bohemians in Russia is edited by a Slovak, Bohdan Pavlu, and the Bohemian political leader, Professor Masaryk, is a Slovak by origin, his work and renown representing both brotherly nations.</p>
   <p>Under such circumstances it is only natural that an agreement between the two largest overseas branches of Bohemians and Slovaks should be reached.</p>
   <p>Complying with the request of the Cleveland conference we publish herewith the official report of the conference insofar as it is of general interest.</p>
   <p>The conference was opened by the president of the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), <span class="page-break">\3</span>Mr. Mamatey, whereupon the following officers were elected: A. Mamatey, chairman; E. V. Voska, vice-chairman; Dr. Stefan Osusky, Slovak secretary; J. Martinek, Bohemian secretary.</p>
   <p>After introductory remarks by the president, the vice-president, and the secretary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian-National Alliance) the discussion of proposals submitted by the Bohemians started. Then the members of the conference divided into a Slovak and a Bohemian section, each taking up the proposals separately. After these separate group discussions--which were very brief--the proposals of the Bohemians were unanimously adopted and a few amendments added.</p>
   <p>The Program</p>
   <p>(1) Independence of Bohemian and Slovak lands.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Organization</p>
   <p>(a) The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni in America and the Slovenska Liga, each in its own sphere of activity, are engaged in an effort to collect the largest possible amount of money for a common cause. Each of these organizations, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and the Slovenska Liga, administers its own funds. The Slovenska Liga recognizes the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni as the official representative organization of Bohemians in America, while the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, reciprocally, recognizes the Slovenska Liga as the official Slovak body.</p>
   <p>(b) Both of these organizations will recognize as capable of entering into negotiations and making authoritative agreements only persons and bodies officially recognized both by the headquarters office of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and the Slovenska Liga.</p>
   <p>Neither the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni nor the Slovenska Liga will intervene with or act as a representative body with any foreign government alone, and all such <span class="page-break">\5</span>contacts will be undertaken by both in a common action. The same rule applies to negotiations and contacts with other organizations, or individuals, either Bohemian or Slovak.</p>
   <p>(c) A combined Bohemian-Slovak committee will be formed, its members to be appointed by both the Slovenska Liga and the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, which committee will enter into negociations with the Yugoslavs.</p>
   <p>(d) An agreement in regard to the combined committee and in regard to other matters of organization, will be reached by the headquarters of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and the central administrative body of the Slovenska Liga which are being authorized for this action by the conference.</p>
   <p>(e) In all public appearances and demonstrations, as well as in all common actions, the headquarters of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and the central administrative body of the Slovenska Liga will use the name of the Vykonny Vybor Cechu A Slovaku v Americe (Executive Committee of Bohemians and Slovaks in America).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>(f) Common demonstrations will take place in all communities where there are both Bohemian and Slovak organizations.</p>
   <p>(g) The press committee of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni has co-opted Dr. Stefan Osusky as the representative member of Slovaks. It will see to it that frequent releases concerning Bohemian and Slovak matters be sent to American newspapers.</p>
   <p>(h) This agreement in regard to common procedure will come into force and become binding as soon as its Bohemian and its Slovak originals are signed by the president and the secretary of both the Slovenska Liga and the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
   <p>The conference has authorized Dr. Osusky for the Slovaks, and Mr. J. Tvrzicky-Kramer for the Bohemians to issue an official report of the conference after their report has been approved by central bodies of both the Slovak and the Bohemian organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The conference was participated in by:</p>
   <p>Slovaks: Albert Mamatey, president of the Slovenska Liga, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; IV. Daxner, secretary of the Slovenska Liga; J.

   <p>It is now up to all Bohemians and all Slovaks to work together everywhere for <span class="page-break">\8</span>the achievement of the lofty and most beautiful aim set by the conference.</p>
   <p>Signed by Dr. Stefan Osusky, the Slovak secretary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, for the Slovaks;</p>
   <p>By J. Tvrzicky-Kramer, director, press bureau of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, for the Bohemians.</p>
