   <p>The first conference of the sixteenth annual rally of the C.S.P.S. (Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek--Czecho-Slav Aid Society), the oldest brother- hood in America, was opened [today] at 9 A. M. sharp in the Pilsen (Plzen) Sokol Auditorium by Brother John Tlusty of Iowa, president of the National Grand Lodge.....</p>
   <p>After the opening formalities routine business was disposed of first. There were two officers of the United States Army in the meeting, Captain Methodius Pazdral of Texas and Lieutenant Albert Hlavac of New York. Captain Methodius is known to Chicago Czechs as the former chairman of a conference of the Czech National Alliance. Thus two men were present who have authoritative knowledge of service in Uncle Sam's forces.</p>
   
   <p>After acknowledgment of the committee's report the conference rose to honor members who have given their lives in the struggle for liberty.</p>
   <p>Brother Tlusty, presiding, submitted the report on the activities of the headquarters office, covering the entire term of its functioning. He recommended that a telegram affirming the loyalty of Czech-Americans be sent to President Wilson, and also that our leader, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, be made an honorary member of the brotherhood. Other motions were that the office of State trustee be abolished; that those who became members before the year 1900 be required to pay higher dues; and that dues be sent directly to headquarters, so that bonds for the emergency reserve fund can be bought sooner. The motions will be referred to the various committees yet to be formed. For the purpose of saving time further reports and advices were not read but will be printed and distributed later.</p>
   <p>The election of the president resulted in Brother V. J. Wojtisek receiving 63 votes; Brother Pazdral received 19 votes. The newly elected head of the brotherhood was installed immediately. He pointed out the significance of the rally, which is augmented by the extraordinary conditions prevailing and the momentous times. He reminded the assembly of our duties toward the land of our birth and to our new homeland as well, the new land which recognizes our cause as just, and for which we are willing and ready to sacrifice our property and the lives of our sons. When in the course of his speech he gave expression to the hope that the Czechoslovak army soon might march through the streets of Prague as victor, the delegates burst into rounds of tremendous applause and shouts of approval.</p>
   <p>The election of the vice-presidents was then attended to. Brother Pazdral of Texas and Brother Frcek of Ohio were unanimously elected and took their seats while the crowd acclaimed them. The present secretary of the National Grand Lodge, Brother Lunak, was re-elected. Brothers Tuma of New York and Soukup of Chicago were nominated for the office of assistant treasurer. The former declined, and Brother Soukup was unanimously elected. After a committee of seven to arrange the program for the sessions had been elected, the meeting was adjourned till afternoon.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session began at 2 P. M. with the introduction of Dr. Joseph P. Pecival and Mr. J. F. Stepina, both representing the Czech National Alliance. The former congratulated the delegates to the big rally of this largest and most important of Czech societies. He dwelt at length upon the significance of the Czech National Alliance and [told of] the toil and the anxiety which it had to undergo as the price of being properly understood and finally recognized by the world. An appeal to the delegates for their further support of our national cause closed the address. Mr. Stepina followed, emphasizing the duties of the Czechs in America and recommending that the C. S. P. S. rally voice its hearty endorsement of the Czech National Alliance. He further asked that a telegram be sent to President Wilson in appreciation of his support of the Czechoslovak cause.</p>
   <p>Another telegram, the speaker suggested, should be sent to former President Theodore Roosevelt for his generous gift to the Czechoslovak army, to which he had donated part of the money received as the Nobel prize, thus testifying in a beautiful manner to his admiration for our soldiers' heroism. Mr. Novak newspaper editor, who is just about to leave for the Czechoslovak army, for which he had signed up, also spoke a few words. All the suggestions and recommendations made by the speakers will be referred to the respective committees.</p>
   <p>A survey of the agenda was submitted by Brother Herc. It had been worked out in an intermission. The various committees also had been named. To these Brother Ort wished to see added a committee "on the merging of all brotherhoods," in which one member for each State should be included.....One of the committees named was "for the merging of all Free Thought units"; in this are included members from numerous States.</p>
   <p>Before the session was adjourned to 9 A. M. of the following day in order to give the committees time for deliberation, Brother Joseph A. Smejkal placed a resolution before the delegates:</p>
   
   <p>"Whereas, it is recognized by every right-thinking Czech-American that the current events upon the European battleground are the struggle of world democracy against autocracy, and that still more sacrifices will have to be made by the people in their fight for civilizations, humanity, and democracy; and Whereas, it is especially important that the people of the United States be prepared for still heavier sacrifices, in order to keep our nation at its full strength for the fateful hour of the battle for liberty and humanity against autocracy, vandalism, despotism, and moral terrorism; therefore be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, that the delegates representing the Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek, known as C. S. P. S. and numbering 24,000 members, and now assembled in convention, pledge to the President their unwavering loyalty and support and promise to submit to any hardships whatsoever, and to make what sacrifices soever may be asked of them for the prosecution of this just war to a victorious finish; and be it further Resolved, that a copy of this resolution shall be written by the secretary of this convention and duly conveyed to the President of the United States."</p>
   <p>This resolution was passed by the delegates, who rose from their seats in token of assent.</p>
