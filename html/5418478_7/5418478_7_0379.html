   <p>Touching scenes are being seen these days in the field building at Svatupluk Cech Park at 20th and May Streets. Our Bohemian children assemble there around a richly decorated Christmas tree donated by Mr. Jos. Swoboda of Kewaunee, Wisconsin, who remembers the Bohemian children in Chicago in this way every year. Our picture shows one of such happy groups around the tree.</p>
