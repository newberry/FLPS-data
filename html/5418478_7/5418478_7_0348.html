   <p>The Coliseum will be decorated with flags of all countries in the world.</p>

   <p>President Wilson's Letter</p>
   <p>The Spojeny Vybor Ceskych Protestantu (United Committee of Bohemian Protestants) has invited President Wilson to the celebration at the Harrison High School. The President had been expected to attend the World Convention of Christian Endeavor in the Coliseum on that day. A reply to the invitation has reached Reverend J. P. Bartak. It reads:</p>
   <p>"The White House, Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>"The President has received your kind invitation and appreciates it very much. He regrets, however, that he will not be in a position to take advantage of it. Many public affairs of extreme importance prevent him from being in Chicago at this time. Will you be good enough to express to the Committee the President's thanks for your kindness.</p>
   <p>"Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>"Tumulty,</p>
   <p>"Secretary to the President."</p>
