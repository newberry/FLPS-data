   <p>The 27th recruiting district, which comprises our Twelfth Ward, sent 166 men, mostly Czech-Americans, to the training station at Camp Grant near Rockford, Illinois, yesterday.</p>
   <p>Twenty-sixth Street, the main street in the Czech "California" district, was crowded with relatives, friends, and friendly bystanders.....The Baumruck Banking Institute, 26th Street near Clifton Park Avenue, where the recruiting station is located, was the rallying point for the soldiers; from there they rode in two groups.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the municipal court, had made arrangements for automobiles and gifts for the soldiers. About three hundred autos were ready for the rookies and their relatives; the owners of the cars showed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their patriotic willingness by placing them at the disposal of the soldiers free of charge.</p>
   <p>The procession, on its way to the station, made a stop at the hall of Sokol Chicago, Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street. Anton J. Cermak, Judge Joseph Uhlir of the municipal court, and Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, spoke. From there the train of autos, which were decorated with Czech and American flags, moved through several streets of the Czech district before arriving at the station.....One thousand cigars and two large boxes of cigarettes were distributed among the future warriors.</p>
