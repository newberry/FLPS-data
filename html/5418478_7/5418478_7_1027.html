   <p>For the last fifty years, Czech Freethinkers of Chicago have regarded the vicinity of 18th and May Streets as a center from which their efforts in Free Thought education spread irresistibly over Chicago and, indeed, over all of America. Almost half a century ago, the building of the trustees of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society) was erected there. People were wont to call the building "Skola" (School), because it served not only for the occasional accommodation of various societies, but also our Free Thought school school found its home there and was frequented by the children of members of our organizations. The building has been used for many purposes. Theatrical performances were given there, Sokol societies held their drills, and clubs held meetings and arranged their entertainments under its roof. It became the rallying point for all Freethinking Czechs for many years.</p>

   <p>The usefulness of the building lasted only until last night. A fire broke out shortly after 10 P. M. and damaged the structure so seriously that repairs or rebuilding are out of the question.</p>
   <p>It is not know how this destructive conflagration originated. It is believed that crossed electric wires produced a spark which ignited inflammable material.</p>
   <p>A drill by the Sokol Slavsky was held in the main hall last evening, while representatives of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage were gathered in the front rooms, and Slovak Sokols drilled on the main floor. This latter practice had long been finished before the fire broke out.....Shortly after 10 P. M., Mr. Otto Zika, building manager, on his regular inspection round, smelled smoke and fumes in the hallway near the main hall. He and others found the stairway near the stage on the main hall in flames. The storage room where Sokol Slavsky kept its drilling equipment had also caught fire. Firemen were called. They could do no more than prevent the fire from spreading to the <span class="page-break">3</span>neighboring buildings. Not only the building itself, but also valuable property of various associations was destroyed in the fire, in spite of strenuous and repeated efforts to save it. It was valuable property indeed, for more than fifty organizations had precious souvenirs tucked up in cases along the walls; some of these had high commercial value. The Jednota Ceskych Dam (Czech Ladies' Unity) owned Ottuv Naucny Slovnik (Otto's Didactic Encyclopedia), one of not more than five copies in America at this time. It was destroyed, and with it went books and pictures of other associations as well. Among these was "Hus Upon the Pyre," valued at five hundred dollars and owned by the Rad Lipan (Order of Lipan).....</p>
   <p>The building was erected in 1869, originally of wood. When it burned down, it was rebuilt and stood until last night. Members of the board of trustees stated that it was insured for $20,000; the actual damage is estimated at $50,000. There will be a meeting this evening for representatives of all parties concerned at Heidenreich's place. Steps will be discussed for <span class="page-break">4</span>immediate action to build a new home for Czech Freethinkers, one that will be more modern, one that will answer the purpose, and one that will be as homelike and popular as the old one was.</p>
