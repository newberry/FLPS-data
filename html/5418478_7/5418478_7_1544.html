   <p>What we dislike most in our politicians in connection with the immigration question is their lack of sincerity. There is much talk now about so-called hyphenated Americans, a term which refers to Bohemian-Americans, Irish-Americans, etc.; it implies that everybody should be an American without any qualification--American only. True enough. But the trouble is that nobody seems to have the courage to stand up and explain clearly the whys and wherefores of the whole question. The point is that now, more than ever before, we are threatened by a war with Germany. It threatened in May of this year, but nobody seemed to be afraid. It threatens now again, and many serious-minded people are afraid that Germany may perhaps win this war, in which case she is likely to attack us. Now then, what about the hyphenated Americans? The truth is that Kaiser Wilhelm has in this country many spies and minions, some of whom serve him for pay--as has been proved--and others out of patriotic loyalty to his person. This means that the hyphenated Americans who are dangerous to this country are actually the Germans. This being so, have you ever heard anyone of our politicians say anything against them? Has Roosevelt said a word against them, the man who is reputed to fear nobody and nothing? Has President Wilson? Neither the one nor the other. Both of them spoke last week about the immigrant people, but spoke generally, carefully avoiding any mention of the Germans. Many times have we predicted that all immigrants would suffer because of the German traitors. Now we may be quite sure they really will!</p>
