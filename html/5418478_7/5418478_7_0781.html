   <p>The third annual pilgrimage of the Neznabozi ([Bohemian] Atheists) took place on last Sunday in the Pilsen Park pavilion. It was unusually successful, and the committee of the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) may certainly feel satisfied with the outcome of its indefatigable work. The pilgrimage of the Bohemian Atheists [Translator's note: They also call themselves freethinkers] has become a regular annual affair, being a manifestation of the freethinking Czechoslovak people of Chicago. This is particularly true of the members of the powerful Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies who attended the festival in numbers truly astonishing. The pavilion was crowded throughout the afternoon and evening, and the morale was excellent, thanks to the fine entertainment provided for the occasion by the committee. Everywhere good humor reigned, and a genuine Bohemian candor was noticeable especially during certain comical scenes, the performance of which occasioned much laughter among the audience.</p>

   <p>It was really an old-fashioned Bohemian fun party, such as one always likes to remember. It is understood that both young and old paid tribute to the goddess Terpsichore whilst others, who did not take part in the dance, listened to the strains of excellent music or attended the puppet show and other attractions. It goes without saying that the booths which specialized in the sale of "wet" goods did an inordinately good business, for the weather was very hot. All those who attended the festival agreed that it was the best one the Atheists had thus far given,and look forward to a similar affair next year.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the festival was also financially successful, and thus satisfied the members of the managing committee. A financial success would make it possible to devote the net proceeds to the propaganda work of the Grand Lodge [of the benevolent societies.] The said Lodge, which has recently begun to propagandize its work, desires to insure the development of this, <span class="page-break">3</span>our oldest and most powerful fraternal association. The results of its indefatigable work is to be noticed in the constantly growing membership. The proceeds of the Sunday affair will go to this [propaganda] fund and it is because of that fact that the good results of the festival were so pleasing.</p>
