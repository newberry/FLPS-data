   <p>The Town of Lake branch of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics held a meeting last week which was a pronounced success in every respect. A committee was elected to be in charge of the tent at the Bazaar, and the Czech women of the organization have disposed of a large number of booklets which serve as receipts in collections for the benefit of the Bazaar.</p>
   <p>Those who are taking up collections are advised not to rely upon the generosity of businessmen alone, since they are already overburdened. The booklets should also be distributed among friends, and the ladies should, if possible, contribute handwork of their own making. The men are urged to donate such things as cigars, footstools, humidors, umbrellas, etc. Gifts still more useful and costly, such as a ton of coal or a large box of soap, will be receipted in the booklets.</p>
