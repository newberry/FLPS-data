   <p>Today is the Fourth of July and the American people celebrate the anniversary of the Foundation and Proclamation of Independence. The experts in the history of the United States have determined which day was the most important in American history, and should be celebrated in the most fervent way. We Bohemians have nothing to do with the arrangement of the celebration, but we will stick to the sentiment of the whole American nation and will celebrate with them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In the same way as the churches call their followers, on church holidays to their temples with the idea of inducing them to take care of church matters, in the same way this free and democratic country calls its citizens, on this festive day, to celebrate and to reflect on the problems most important to its citizens. Moderate discipline, moderate excitement, will harm nobody.</p>
   <p>We Bohemians, being citizens of this free country, have very much neglected our education. All people, who came to this country soon after the Civil War, have constantly met with memories of the war and have heard every year, repeated tales about the two hostile parties, their fights, bloodshed and courageous deeds. They were repeatedly warned, that the <span class="page-break">3</span>same conditions can return again, because one political party, the Democratic, is watching for the moment when the other party, the Republican, will shut their vigilant eye, and then they will rise, unite with the Democrats of the South and establish slavery again, they will then separate themselves from the Union and start some kind of empire.</p>
   <p>The new Bohemian citizens were compelled to listen, all the time, to this kind of prating and to read in their newspapers the same thing. No wonder they believed in all of this as certain truth, the experienced politicians who published it had much practice in political sagacity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>This kind of bug-bearing originated in crazed brains and rammed into the thoughts of the Bohemians. Everyone who had intentions of becoming an American patriot was obliged to believe in it, and he who ridiculed it was called a traitor to the government and to the people, a slave-dealer who favored slavery.</p>
   <p>It is no wonder, that the new Bohemian immigrants were afraid to accept the great privilege of becoming American citizens. They refused to take first citizens papers, they despised citizenship.</p>
   <p>They were scared, that when the big war would start, which was constantly probable in their minds, they would be compelled to serve in the Army <span class="page-break">5</span>and would suffer worse hardships than under the military Austrian scourge. Single or married, with or without children, they would all go into the army-service. That is why they did not want to listen to citizenship talk and, rather, reported from time to time to the Austrian Consul to be protected from this supposed future war.</p>
   <p>The result was that many years after the Civil War, when the Bohemian immigration increased to such a degree, that in some settlements they could be decisive in the elections, there was only a small number of Bohemian citizens who were eligible as voters and they were not able to achieve anything.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Those times have gone. The foolish heads were forced to withdraw from public life, because a more clarified conception started to invade the frightened Bohemian communities.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians in the cities and villages started to recognize that they were detoured from the right way. They realized that they had been unduly scared and cheated, and that they had suffered great damage. They started to comprehend what was to their advantage. They applied for citizenship papers. They started to make use of their citizenship rights, in many instances very successfully. It was impossible to make good all at once. However, the activity of the Bohemians in public life, in all the states, where they have large communities, in the last few years has been very progressive and hopeful.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Liberty can not exist in a country, where the government is not in the hands of the people. It means that when single citizens have not liberty, they are not in a position to partake equally in governmental affairs.</p>
   <p>We must observe with pleasure the social life of our Bohemian people in this country, our new fatherland, and our power should be used principally for this country's benefit and for the progress of ourselves and our children. We must admire the eager work of our numerous Bohemian newspapers and contribute to their growth.</p>
   <p>We must see how honest, independent and incorruptible they are. We must keep a vigilant eye on these virtues since they are generally very neglected in the publications of other nationalities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>In larger communities it often happens that before important elections some benefactor of the Bohemian people appears who buys votes for certain office-chasers. Our Bohemian citizens know very well such miserable creatures and are no longer paying attention to them.</p>
   <p>Bohemians in public offices, such as county and state, is no longer a rarity, and proves the enlightenment of Bohemian voters and the ardor, which they are willing to throw in their political obligations.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians are using much time and diligence for pre-election and election activities and they are really happy when Bohemian candidates are elected, and never show their jealousy towards elected countrymen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>It is a common event for Bohemians to appoint as candidates their most capable and trustworthy countrymen, who are supported even by the voters of other nationalities. This support is not on the basis of common nationality, but on the basis of capability and good reputation.</p>
   <p>Political independence between our Bohemians has been developed lately to a very high point; there is now only an insignificant minority, that is able to hesitate in their belonging to the one or the other party, or in obeying blindly the orders of political bosses, who carry on without principle. Even though all these revelations are very consoling, we should be aware that there is much work left still to be accomplished.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Let us continue our work, let us be civilized in our civil duties, let us proceed collectively and protect our rights, and we will succeed in providing more and more freedom for ourselves and for our children, and a complete acknowledgement to the American government and its population.</p>
