   <p>The Fourth of July, Independence Day of the United States of North America, will have a triple significance for us Bohemians this year. First, as citizens of this country, which we adopted as our new country, and whose laws and government, as well as its memorable occasions, we are pleased to honor and preserve, we will celebrate the memory of the Declaration of Independence. Second, it is for us to prove to the other nationalities of this country that we lead all others in deeds, in the display of ability to prepare our various affairs, and general interest in the matter. Finally, on that day, a Tag Day will be held for the benefit of the Bohemian Charitable Association, and even if we bring it in the last place, we consider it, in so far as our domestic life is concerned, as the most important. The Fourth of July will have been celebrated by us <span class="page-break">2</span>in a dignified manner only when and if we turn over to the Bohemian Charitable Association several thousand dollars. We will do so, for we all know how great is the task which the Association has taken upon itself and how well it is being fulfilled.</p>
