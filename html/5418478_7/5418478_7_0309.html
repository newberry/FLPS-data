   <p>Beginning in early morning large crowds of Bohemian-Americans directed their paths to the Bohemian National Cemetery, where everybody was surprised at its cleanliness, and impressed with all the fresh flower and grass beds in all directions. The cemetery was improved lately by establishing a watering system.</p>
   <p>The newly erected monument for Bohemian Civil War Veterans was adorned with a large American flag. Mr. Shulz, responding to the wishes of Chicago's Bohemian veterans, decorated with flowers the graves of all Civil War soldiers of Bohemian origin. The visitors stayed in the cemetery almost to the end of the day, and approved the diligent efforts of the management to maintain the cleanliness and attractiveness of the cemetery.</p>
