   <p>A special meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was held last night in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). It was called for the purpose of continuing the discussion which could not be finished at the last regular meeting of the board about the building of the crematorium.</p>
   <p>The very well attended meeting was a lively one, at times even stormy, due to many clashes of opinion among the assembled representatives. The main point of discussion was the question of whether the crematorium should be built in the new section or, in accordance with the original proposal, next to the chapel. After a long debate, the representatives decided by a vote of forty to seventeen to built the crematorium next to the chapel.....</p>
