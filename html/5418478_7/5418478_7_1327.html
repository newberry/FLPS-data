   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Committee for the Bohemian Old People's Home, arrived at Mr. Pregler's place to take over the property. Mr. Pregler showed exceptional generosity to our humanitarian undertaking. He kept only his beloved personal collection, and turned over to the committee, everything else in the hostelry. The committee, which very carefully inventoried everything appraised the value of these articles, which Mr. Pregler left, at over $4,000. Mr. Pregler could have kept for himself very easily, articles valued at more than $1,000. Because he did not do so, he is deserving of full recognition by the Bohemian public. The Home received from him a collection of live animals, hundreds of rabbits and pigeons, thousands of trees, an ice-house full of ice, a large amount of hay and various machinery, rare flowers, dishes valued at several hundred dollars, bowling alleys in excellent conditions, etc.</p>
   
   <p>Everything which Mr. Pregler called his own thus far, became the property of the Home yesterday. The committee which took over the property was composed of: Mrs. Sulove and Mrs. Liskove and Mr. Pech, Kacina, Minarik and Topinka. A manager for the property will be appointed as soon as possible and it is expected that the Bohemian public will visit the Home in large numbers and that it will support it in every way possible.</p>
