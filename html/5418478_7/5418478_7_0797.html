   <p>The meeting was opened by the vice-president, Mrs. Soucek. All of the officers were present with the exception of the president, who, due to illness, could not attend. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. This was followed by the reading of correspondence. The management of the Frantisek Palacky Free Thought School announced the appointment of a new delegate, Mr. Ludvik Svarz. The Grand Lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union) announced the appointment of Mrs. Francis Schejbal as its new delegate. The new members were welcomed by the vice-president ....A letter from the Trojan Lodge No. 15 of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union), enclosed $13 for the benefit of the schools and in honor of the memory of Marie Jansik who died in Panama, Canal Zone....A letter from the Grand Lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam and another from the Grand Lodge of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) referred to the payment of salaries to three teachers during their summer vacations. These teachers have been with us for over thirty <span class="page-break">\2</span>years. Neither organization has any objections to these salaries being paid, and they state that the Federation should pay them when the money is available. After a lengthy debate it was decided that the Federation would not pay any of its teachers during the summer vacations, but that in view of the long tenure of service of the three old teachers--Miss Zeman, Mr. Straka, and Miss Koller--and their apparent needs, the Federation is willing to make a gift of $100 to each of them. This move will hold good for this year only.</p>
   <p>The auditing committee reported on the finances of the Federation for the last three-month period; its report was approved. A special fund, created for sundry expenditures and entertainment of our school children by the executive committee, is usually not mentioned in the reports of the Federation because the executive committee takes care of that fund independently. That committee will, however, render its financial report quarterly....Mrs. Stary reported on textbooks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>One thousand books were bound, and of these nine hundred were delivered to the Vojta Naprstek School and one hundred placed in the stock room....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Radesinsky reported on the public entertainment given by our school children in the Carter H. Harrison High School on May 28, 1922. The program was faultless, particularly the folk dances presented by our junior clubs. We are sorry to say that the attendance was small; such exhibitions as touch upon Bohemian schooling ought to be better attended. Mrs. Radesinsky also reported that a rental asked by the principal of the Harrison School was paid by our Alderman of the Twelfth Ward, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, out of his own pocket. It was decided to send him a letter of thanks. Mrs. Stary [the secretary] reported that Mr. Machek, due to his removal to Michigan, resigned as a member of the economics committee. Mr. Zajeda was appointed in his stead. The Dorostovy Klub Pavla Cechova (Paula Cech Junior Club) sent $25 as a gift. This money was the receipts from a theatrical play given by <span class="page-break">\4</span>it. The Club is to be thanked by a letter, Mr. Dufek reported for the entertainment committee. Letters will be sent to the delegates of the various organizations asking them to advertise the festival to be held by the Sdruzeni on September 17, 1922.</p>
   <p>A committee, consisting of the delegates to the Federation and members of the Sokol Rozvoj, will meet to adjust a grievance arising due to a conflict which exists when the Sokol holds its regular exercises on days set apart for school instruction. On such days [it was previously reported] the school attendance was very small. Some time ago the Sokol was asked to send its representative committeemen to the meeting of our Federation, but since that committee did not appear in our meeting--and we have been waiting for it for three months--and since the aforesaid grievance was not adjusted, it led to the creation of an independent school in the Utulna A Sirotcinec. The Sokol Rozvoj delegate surmised that next year there will be a sufficient number of pupils....The Federation will take care of the rest and the school will <span class="page-break">\5</span>continue to function.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dobias read the annual report, copies of which will be mailed to all the organizations. All groups will be invited to attend the festival to be given by the Federation. Mrs. Reach, a teacher in the F. B. Zdrubek School, reported that on July 1, 1922 the school will celebrate the end of its school year and requested the assembled delegates to attend it....After having listened to a report on receipts and disbursements, and there being no further business, the delegates moved to adjourn.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Frantiska Soucek, vice-president,</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Soukup, secretary.</p>
