   <p>The customary inspection of the grounds and arrangements of the Bohemian National Cemetery was undertaken at 10:30 A.M. yesterday. A large number of representatives participated in this twenty-fifth annual inspection. This inspection can really be called the twenty-fifth jubilee of the Bohemian National Cemetery, which has reached its present size and pleasingly flourishing condition under the management of its past and present representatives, and the very careful arrangements which Mr. L. Ine, the gardener tends to.</p>
   <p>The cemetery can take its place among the foremost, best cared for, more park-like cemeteries. That this is so, the representatives found out yesterday daring the inspection at which time some minor changes and the completion of a few repairs were recommended. On the far side of the cemetery a plot of hawthorn bushes or some similar shrubbery is to be set out, the main entrance gates are to be repaired, some lower priced lots are to be provided and a new section is to be opened behind <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Soldier's Monument.</p>
   <p>When the representatives reached the so called circle where rests the great freethinker, L. Klacel, Mr. Jos. Kostner stepped forward as jubilee speaker and gave a resume of the history of the cemetery from the date of its founding to the present time. This history is to appear fully as an album soon. He mentioned the first meeting, which took place on the 12th of February, 1877, at which there were present twenty representatives of various lodges, whose thoughts were directed toward the founding of a genuine Bohemian cemetery.</p>
   <p>At that time a committee of three was appointed composed as follows: Mr. St. Sramka, Mr. Mat. Karaska, and Mr. Fr. Bedlan, who were to find a suitable place for a cemetery and make a report on the 26th of February. They located an acceptable farm, but for several reasons it was not purchased.</p>
   <p>On the 12th of March eight representatives of various lodges met. They were joined by seven other representatives for the purpose of completing the work already begun.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Fr. Pracna was elected temporary chairman and Prokop Hudek as secretary, and on April 11, 1877 the Secretary of State issued a charter to the new organization. Further search was made for a suitable place, until finally Mr. Fr. Fencl discovered the present grounds, where the Bohemian cemetery lies today. This was an area of fifty acres and was bought for $10,000 on payments.</p>
   <p>In 1877 on the first of August, the first permanent chairman, Mr. Matej Karasek, was elected; to the managing committee were elected Messrs. Jos. Matousek, Jos. Novak, S. Sramek, F. Fencl; as secretary, Mr. Fr. Pracna; and as treasurer, Mr. Jos. Dostal.</p>
   <p>On the 6th of August there was buried in the new cemetery secretly by the resident representative, Mr. Nekola, the first corpse, the body of a child of the Brada family, so that the law suit of the cemetery association might end in its favor. This first grave was guarded day and night by a special watchman.</p>
   <p>The second corpse to be interred was that of Katerina Bican on September 10, the third, Anna Hubacek, on the first of November, 1877. Mr. Rocen became the owner <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the first lot sold for thirty-five dollars. In the year 1878 forty-seven lots were sold, last year 184 lots were sold.</p>
   <p>As can be understood, the association of representatives became indebted through the purchase of the grounds, but these debts were soon cleared up by arranging picnics, by borrowing from lodges and from individuals. The financial condition of the cemetery today is such that no one could expect it to be better.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jos. Lahvic was the first sexton, and his memory was honored yesterday by the representatives, likewise his son, Frank, the present sexton, was also remembered. The first gardener was and still is Mr. L. Ine, in whom the cemetery has, without any exaggeration whatsoever, a conscientious, industrious, experienced worker in his department.</p>
   <p>In the year 1885 ten acres were added to the grounds, and that year the Klacel monument was erected. In the year 1890 the Civil War Veterans' monument was erected. From the founding of the cemetery,improvements have been made year after year, such <span class="page-break">\5</span>as a tomb, a new residence for the manager, machine pumps for water supply for the cemetery, and other improvements.</p>
   <p>There are at rest in the cemetery 16,567 corpses, and the value of the cemetery has risen considerably, the details of which will be published in the memorial album. The speaker did not forget to thankfully remember the Bohemian newspapers, which helped in the beginning to make it an accomplished fact and still give considerable attention to it.</p>
   <p>There have been seven chairman through the past twenty-five years in the following order: Messrs. Mat. Karasek, Jos. Matousek, F. Tesar, Jos. Matousek, Jos. Hladovec, Jos. Matousek, V.Matas, Jos. Hora, Fr. Mencl, and Jan Pecha, who is the present chairman. Mr. Josef Matousek, for his unselfish, industrious generosity, was elected three times and remembered by his successors and all who have an interest in the cemetery.</p>
   <p>That was the gist of Mr. Kostner's speech, after which a further tour of the cemetery was undertaken.</p>
