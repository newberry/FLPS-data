   <p>The meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was opened by the president, Josef Tichava, in the presence of all the officers and a great number of representatives. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.....The following incoming correspondence was then read: A letter from the grand committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) which gave the names of their representatives to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol and recommended that more important problems be taken up in the general meeting and not in the committee meetings.....Another letter concerned the graduation exercises of our students on March 12.....The annual report of the newspaper Svobodna Skola (Free Thought School) was approved. The secretary of the Fourth Ward Free Thought School pointed out in a short talk how unpleasant was the task of closing their school which has existed for some twenty-eight years, but that it had to be done because of a paucity of students. He further reported that the funds of the Fourth Ward Free Thought school amounted to $577, which was equally divided between the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol and the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). At this juncture, the speaker desired to know about the disposition of the books and records of the now moribund Fourth Ward school, and whether these should be turned over to the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers). It was decided that only such records which contain the minutes of meetings should be turned over to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svodomyslnych Skol. The representative of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych reported on the question of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych (National Tax of Freethinkers), which will be levied as soon as possible, and at the same time he asked the representatives to attend the lectures arranged by the Svaz Svobodomyslnych every Sunday in the Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial).</p>
   <p>Mrs. Stary reported on the proceeds of the dramatic section; a play given on January 15 netted $176.55. Mrs. Radesinsky asked that a committee be appointed which would be in charge of schools and school catalogues. This was approved.</p>
   
   <p>The next order of business on the program was the election of [officers of] the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobomyslnych Skol. It was decided that the salaries of the officers remain the same, that is, the president shall receive one dollar a year; the treasurer, one dollar a year; and the secretary, twentyfive dollars for the same period. The following persons were elected: Mr. Josef Tichava, president; Mrs. Frantiska Soucek, vice-president; Mr. Karel Soukup, secretary; Mrs. Dobias, financial secretary; Dr. Antonin Mueller, treasurer.
