They have the necessary qualifications and capabilities belonging to Boy Scouts.</p>
   <p>In order that we might somewhat inform Bohemian parents with this new movement among our youth, we announce that the Boy Scouts of America, primarily, are trained in strict obedience by means of various military marching drills, flag, and other signal communication, telegraphy, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>other useful skills. Here is an opportunity for our Bohemian youth to be represented in a dignified manner before Americans. It is up to our Bohemian parents now to aid us in this direction, and place their sons under the American flag and they will surely contribute to the honor and fame of our Bohemian people in this new country of ours.</p>

Kodl, the manager of Svatopluk Cech Park, in his office, and Mr. Vaclav Washa, 1615 Jefferson Street.</p>
