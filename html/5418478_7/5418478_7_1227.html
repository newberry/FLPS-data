   <p>A meeting of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery Association) was opened by President Jan Pecha. The minutes of the last meeting were approved as read. The Association had purchased Chicago Municipal Bonds for $5,027.50. The pay roll for March amounted to $7,825.28; income was $8,287.25; the treasurer holds $6,241.20; the total cash balance is $14,528.45.....</p>
   <p>The Crematorium Committee is waiting for plans for the mausoleum promised by Architect Rusy. The American Mausoleum Company has offered to build a $125,000 mausoleum for 1500 bodies at its own expense and pay the Association $50 for each body in return for the privilege of using the Association's grounds. This would mean a profit of $75,000 when the mausoleum is filled. The Company could also build a crematorium and make a chapel available. The mausoleum would be built in white marble in the classical Greek style.....This proposal has been rejected because it reverts to an old system which has been abandoned by the more progressive cemeteries.....</p>
