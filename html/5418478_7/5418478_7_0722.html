   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics), an organization founded at the time of our [Czechoslovak] revolution, and today perhaps the most important and most influential institution of our Catholic countrymen in the United States, opened its third national convention yesterday. The convention was attended by sixty-seven delegates.....So many important tasks will face this convention, that it is doubtful whether it will be able to conclude its deliberations within the time specified.</p>
   <p>The program of the convention was preceded by a high pontifical Mass celebrated in the St. Vitus Roman Catholic Church at 10 A.M. yesterday. The celebrant was the Very Reverend Valentin Kohlbeck, O.S.B., abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Lisle, Illinois. Immediately after the church service all delegates assembled in the Ceskoslovenska Americka Sin, (Czechoslovak-American Hall), 1436 West 18th Street, where, after they had been officially welcomed by the president of the Svaz, Mr. Jan Straka, they took their places and began their deliberations. At the morning session a committee was appointed to examine the credentials of the delegates. The committee consisted of Mr. Frank Bicek, Mr. Cyrill Knotek, and Mrs. Karolina Tuchacek. After this necessary ceremony was completed the convention adjourned until 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session began with the report of the aforementioned committee.....Next on the program was the election of two recording secretaries to assist the regular secretary of the Svaz, the Reverend Bozenek. Messrs. Vladimir Peterka and A. V. Tesar were elected to this office. The president then appointed the following committees: The committee on the constitution and bylaws: Dr. Lorenz, Mr. Bicek, the Reverend Mr. Vytisk, the Reverend Mr. Klobouk, Mrs. Hynek, and Messrs. Koleda and Dvorak; the audit committee: Mrs. Kesner and Messrs. Smejkal and Gronlik; the resolutions committee: the Reverend Father Hroch and Neuzil, Miss Vondracek, the Reverend Father Zlamal, Messrs. Prochazka and Novotny, and Mrs. Novotny; the press and publications committee: The Reverend Fathers Bleha, Netardus, and Vasek, and Messrs. Radous and Knotch; the committee on complaints:</p>
   
   <p>the Reverend Father Janecek, Mr. Roderes, Mesdames Nedved and Masin, and the Reverend Father Polacek; the committee to inspect the records [of the Svaz]: Messrs. Mares, Kofron, and Marousek. When this necessary convention business was completed, the president read his very extensive report, in which the blessing....of the Holy Father was mentioned first of all. The president again welcomed all the delegates and guests to the convention, and made mention of the work which lies before them. He alluded to the Bohemian Catholic youth, who must be saved for the nation, and said that the slogan "All for our youth" is to become the slogan of this convention. He warmly recommended the support of the St. Cyrill and St. Methodius apostolate, and of the Bohemian college at Rome. He ended by thanking the delegates and all other workers for the work already performed, and expressed his hope that they would continue it at an undiminished tempo.</p>
   <p>This report was followed by another one submitted by the manager of the central office of the Svaz, Mr. A. V. Tesar. Since this report was too extensive, we shall have to mention only its salient points. According to Mr. Tesar, the Svaz has grown remarkably during the last few months, thanks to the efforts of its many tireless members. He mentioned the activity of the official organ of the Svaz, the Hlidka (Sentinel), which was founded in August, 1920; he touched upon the publicity work of the press bureau of the Svaz, the influence of which is noticeable everywhere. This bureau has made contacts with the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and is thus able to furnish news to many local newspapers; news concerning conditions in the old homeland. Mr. Sindelar (the first office manager of the central office), has written a history of this organization. The book will have more than three hundred pages and will soon be published. Mr. Tesar also mentioned the gifts and aid contributed by the central office in a struggle with the enemies of our mother tongue. These enemies endeavored to eliminate that tongue from our parochial schools--in Nebraska, for instance. This move led to the institution of the Svatovaclavska Dan (Saint Wenceslaus tax), which netted us more than $21,000. He announced the opening of an immigration bureau in New York, pointing out the fact that more Slovaks than Czechs pass through it, and that consequently the Sdruzeni Katolickych Slovaku (National Alliance of Slovak Catholics) ought to help in meeting some of the expenses of the bureau. A sizable sum was also sent to Rome for the benefit of the Bohemian college in that city. The organized tour to Czechoslovakia [which took place this year] was made at the request of a great many members of the Svaz, and by invitation from the old homeland. This tour was in conjunction with the one arranged by the Catholic Sokol, and netted us about seven hundred dollars. Part of that profit was turned over to the Catholic Sokol as previously agreed. After having finished his report, which indicated a colossal amount of work done by the central office, Mr. Tesar was complimented and thanked by the president and enthusiastically applauded by the convention.</p>
   <p>The president then requested the Reverend Father Bozenek, secretary of the central office, to submit his report also. The latter thereupon stated that his own report was contained in the one read by Mr. Tesar, and that he, in fact, had prepared it in toto. The Reverend Father Bozenek has been acting as secretary of the central office for about two and a half years; during that period, said he, there were 105 meetings of the central office. Contacts were made with Slovak Catholics. That contact resulted in a lessening of the violent attacks made by the Slovak press upon the Czechoslovak Republic.</p>
   <p>The treasurer of the Svaz, Mr. Josef Kopecky, then read his report. This revealed that from May 1, 1920, to December 31, 1920, the receipts [of the Svaz] were $32,044.31 and the disbursements for the same period $30,752.22. For the year 1921 the receipts were $30,742.96 and the disbursements $28,433.34. For the year 1922, that is, up to and including the month of August, the receipts, inclusive of a balance from the year 1921, were $27,027.30, and the disbursements for the same period were $22,034.43. The above treasury report was in printed form and was therefore distributed among the delegates. It also gave detailed account of all financial transactions, and the purposes for which the disbursed amounts were used. The correctness of the report was also attested to by Mr. Vaclav Kozojed, a certified public accountant. The books will, nevertheless, be subjected to the scrutiny of the proper committee, which will make its report to the convention later.</p>
   <p>There was an intermission lasting twenty minutes, followed by reports from the various district and parochial organizations, men's and women's unions, etc. All of these reports but two sounded favorable. A note of discouragement crept into the report made by the Reverend Father Janecek of Michigan. His report covered the Bohemian Catholic clergy of that state. The small number of Bohemian Catholics in Michigan, and the fact that they live in widely separated and scattered localities, makes any attempt at unified action impossible. Because they are sparsely settled and widely separated, the condition of the Bohemian Catholic parishes is anything but satisfactory. Another, equally unsatisfactory report was given by the Reverend Father Kreuser of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The latter clergyman complained about the lukewarm attitude of our countrymen there, and about a certain lack of organization which resulted.</p>
   <p>After a brief talk by the president, who tried to instill courage into the hearts of all complaining delegates....the second session of the third general convention was ended because of the lateness of the hour. The third session begins today at 9 A.M.....</p>
