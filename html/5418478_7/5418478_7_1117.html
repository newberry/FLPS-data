   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery)....was confined to the reports of its officers....and committees, the most important of which was the report of the building committee presented by its chairman, Mr. Mencl. Mr. Mencl said that the finishing touches on the crematorium were to have been made last week, but because of the belated delivery of electric-light fixtures and other such details, the work was slowed up.....</p>
   <p>....Mr. Kralovec reported on the very heavy expenses connected with the building of the crematorium.....He studied the bills and contracts and found that so far, the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov has spent fully $83,000 on the structure.....</p>
