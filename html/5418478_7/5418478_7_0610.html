   <p>The technical committee was appointed in accordance with the constitution of the Central Society and the following were named: chairman Mr. V. Jelinek; vice-chairman Mr. F. Kostka, secretary Mr. O. Harnach.</p>
   <p>In the preparatory work for this year's concert, the committee held only one joint meeting which, aside from Messrs Kalas and Sahuly, was attended by none of the other choirmasters. The arrangement of the program and its pan-slavic character was agreed upon in principle at this meeting. The technical committee endeavored to secure in addition to the Filaretov Society and Zora Society, the Slovak and Serbian singing societies; however, because of a lack of sufficient time and the unsuitability of the Slovak societies for such a concert, the idea of inviting these groups was given up. The technical committee finally agreed to ask the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society to appear independently and the A. Dvorak to supplement with orchestral numbers.</p>
   <p>Convention of the Central Bohemian Singing Society</p>
   <p>The convention, which was held Saturday in Mr. Radouse's place, was called to order at eight o'clock by the former president of the society Mr. O. Harnach and the following delegates were installed: for the Lyra Singing Society, Messrs. Dr. L. Wedeles, F. Cernik, and Rudolph Srb; for the Karel Marx Singing Society, Messrs. Karel Kalivoda, Joseph Napravnik, and Vaclav Smid; for Dalibor Singing Society, Messrs. F. Krupar, Jan Kamis, and William Pech; for Lumir Singing Society, Messrs. Joseph Hymer and R. Prochazka; for the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society, Messrs. F. Husa, A. Vanek, and P. Cejka; for Karel Bendl Singing Society, Messrs. Hugo Materna, J. Janecek, and Joseph Janecek; for the Fourth Ward Club, Messrs. F. Dolecek, Joseph Vavra, and Jan. Dolecek.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. L. Wedeles was then unanimously elected chairman of the convention and Mr. F. Krupar was elected secretary. Then followed the reading of the minutes of the annual meeting held on June 22, 1910, the reports of the treasurer, and the archivist. The report of the technical committee was also read and accepted, from which we learned the following:</p>
   <p>"During the past period the technical committee gained the following experiences which we hereby introduce to this day's convention.</p>
   <p>"There is a lack of discipline in the individual societies, so that the members are indifferent about their duties toward the society and thereby the more so in respect to the central body. For that reason it often happens that even with the most emphatic summons an insufficient number of singers respond; resulting in the insufficient training of the society and the uncertainty of a performance, especially when, in disregard of warnings, many singers who either seldom or never attend rehearsals take part in a concert and thereby make a successful performance more difficult. Another experience acquired is that it is not good to hold many joint rehearsals. This causes the interest of the members to dwindle. For that reason the technical committee recommends that rehearsals be held by individual societies as often as possible so that so many joint rehearsals will not have to be held.</p>
   <p>"The committee also recommends the continued mutual contacts with the choruses and societies of the Slavonic and other nationalities, so that we may benefit by their good examples and avoid their mistakes. The widest possible reciprocation would be beneficial to our progress.</p>
   <p>"To conclude this report the technical committee acknowledges that in many respects it probably did not accomplish all it should have that would serve to benefit the society. The apparent incompleteness of its activities is excused by the fact that the conditions under which it worked and the habitual tardiness of the members made it impossible to obtain better results. The technical committee, according to its own opinion, did everything possible for it to do."</p>
   <p>The meeting was then opened for proposals from the floor. A motion by Mr. Bobisude for the creation of a travelling fund was referred to the technical committee, For the improvement of the financial condition of the unity, Mr. Fitzek moved that contributing members be secured. The motion was defeated after a lengthy debate. The motion by Mr. Jelinek to give joint performances of operas was not definitely rejected, but Dr. J. Vojan explained that it was not possible for the society to start working on operas at once but that it should go forward slowly and steadily. A motion to amend the constitution was adopted and a committee was appointed for that purpose. In answer to the question as to why the Bohemian newspapers did not take more interest in the society, the reporters, Mr. Psenka of Svornost and Mr. Kral of Spravedlnost, replied that the society had not sent any reports to the newspapers. A promise to support the society as much as possible was made. Dr. Vojan volunteered for the publicity committee and will give reports concerning the Singing Society to the newspapers.</p>
   <p>The election of officers for the coming year was the next order of business. Mr. A. Vanek was elected president; Dr. L. Wedeles, vice-president; Mr. F. Krupar, Secretary; Mr. F. Husar, archivist.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the technical committee be named by the choirmasters of the separate societies, and that care should be taken as to the qualifications of the appointed members because the greatest task, and responsibility for the success and development of the Society, rests upon the technical committee. Other committees are to be appointed by the president.</p>
   
   <p>In view of the fact that the Society has been offered many advantages by the management of Svatoplok Cech Park, it was decided that as many as possible, of the members of the society should visit the park on the Fourth of July. With that the convention was brought to a close.</p>
