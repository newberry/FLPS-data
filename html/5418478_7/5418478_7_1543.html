   <p>Since the break in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Austria, there reigned great confusion in the granting of the citizenship papers to immigrants from Austria. One of the judges admitted applicants without discrimination, while another denied the citizenship on the ground that Austria was an enemy country. Congressman A. J. Sabath, who represents a district with a high percentage of Czech populace, intervened in this matter, and received a response from the commissioner of naturalization, who informed the Congressman that he had advised his assistants who conduct the investigations that Austria is not considered an enemy state. Therefore, no restrictions should be placed upon applicants from the dual monarchy. Congressman Sabath has won the gratitude of many by his resolute intervention.</p>
