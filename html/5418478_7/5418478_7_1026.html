   <p>Organizations which formerly held their meetings and entertainments in the rooms of the Czech and English language Free Thought school [the building of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society)] are invited to make use of the rooms of the Pilsen auditorium until our razed building is reconditioned. The rents will remain the same. We have entered into an agreement to that effect with Mr. Anton Vana, manager of the Pilsen auditorium, 1754 West 18th Street. We hope that our organizations will appreciate our efforts to accommodate them. The Sokol Slavsky will also move to the Pilsen Auditorium.</p>
