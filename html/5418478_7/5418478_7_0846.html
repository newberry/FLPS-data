   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery Association) which was characterized by a large attendance of delegates, and which took place in the upper hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets, several important matters were taken up and discussed. The meeting opened at 8 P. M...The secretary, Mr. V. Filip, reported on the payment of fees and contributions for the perpetual care of graves....The total amount of contributions to be used for this purpose was $2,475. The sum of $60 was received for the temporary care of the grave of Mrs. Terezie Fenzl..... Mr. Josef Smejkal, a member of the board of directors of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, read the usual biennial report concerning the conditions of the cemetery; that report is to be submitted of the county court....The next item taken up in this meeting was the matter of a large clock to be installed in the tower of the cemetery. The estimate submitted by the Seth Thomas Clock Company of Chicago, was $1,628.50. Another company, the Solun System, also <span class="page-break">2</span>submitted a catalogue, but since no estimates were made by the latter concern its offer was not considered. There was a lengthy debate as to the kind of clock needed, and it was finally decided that this whole matter should be turned over to the board of directors....</p>
   <p>The board of delegates then criticized the matter of income from the crematory, and it was ascertained that since its erection the average income from this source was $5,500 annually. It was further reported that certain materials from abandoned mausoleums, mainly granite pillars and blocks, are to be sold to the firm of Filling Brothers who are makers of monuments and grave stones, and who offered the sum of $75 for the lot. It was recommended that this offer be accepted by the board of directors because the granite blocks, etc., are of no value to the cemetery. After having settled this matter, the installation of the new vice-president, Mr. Stanislav Simecek, took place....The delegate, Mr. J. J. Jelinek suggested that the crematory be better advertised....Mr. Smejkal announced that the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova owned $50,000 worth of the so-called Victory bonds, and since their face value <span class="page-break">3</span>had risen before their maturity, he recommended that they be sold and other bonds purchased which could bring more profit to the Cemetery Association. In a debate which followed, Mr. Cipra explained the reasons for the increased face value of these bonds, and upon motion by Mr. Jaro Klaus it was decided that the board of directors should deal with this matter according to its best opinion and to sell the bonds at a profit.</p>
