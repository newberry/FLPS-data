   <p>A large number of beautiful buildings, both private and public, have been built in the Lawndale district, one of those sections in Chicago where the population is predominantly Bohemian. These buildings add a great deal to the fine appearance of the district, and the latest among them is the new Bohemian Presbyterian Church on South Lawndale Avenue near West 26th Street.</p>
   <p>This church seems to have grown up overnight without anybody's noticing it. The credit for the building goes to our noted national worker, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, whose undertakings always seem to be brought to a successful conclusion. Whatever he starts, he knows how to finish, even if it requires a great deal of concentrated effort on his part. He works quietly, without any ado, and his enterprises are always of a humanitarian nature. One of his most important achievements is the Bohemian Immigrants' Home in Baltimore, a project on which he worked long enough to secure for it the permanent support of the Austrian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>government. When this was done and he saw that his work was assured a permanent existence, he retired quietly from Baltimore and came to work in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Here he has laid the foundation for the Bohemian Settlement on South Racine Avenue; here he has been working hard in the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), of which he is the secretary; and more recently, he has been devoting most of his energy to the realization of his old dream, the building of a Bohemian Presbyterian church in the Lawndale district. In spite of the fact that most of the money for the church had to be secured from non-Bohemian-Americans, Reverend Vanek completed this great piece of work in so short a time that none of his friends would have thought it sufficient even to start a comprehensive campaign. Now that the church is finished, it serves as an ornament for the whole neighborhood.</p>
   <p>The dedication ceremonies will take place tomorrow, January 3. The name of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>this new house of worship is the "Hubbard Memorial Cesky Presbyterni Chram" (Hubbard Memorial Bohemian Presbyterian Church). It is located in the very center of the Bohemian colony on South Lawndale Avenue, that is, at 2522-28 South Lawndale Avenue, and the minister is its founder, Reverend V. Vanek.</p>
   <p>The dedication ceremonies will start Sunday at 10 A. M. with services conducted by Reverend Vincent Pisek of the Husuv Ceskobratrsky Chram (John Huss Church of Bohemian Brothers) in New York. This is the same Dr. Pisek to whom credit is due for the financing of the recent Bohemian medical expedition to Serbia. He secured the sum of $12,000 from one of his friends to whom he had told the story of a servant girl who brought him two dollars for the Serbians after having walked several miles in order to save the nickel for carfare.</p>
   <p>At 3:30 P. M. the dedication proper will take peace. It will be presided over by the Moderator of the Chicago Presbytery, Dr. Clarke, and the principal <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>speaker will be the noted philanthropist and friend of the Bohemian people, Dr. John Timothy Stone, minister of the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Reverend Edgar P. Hill and many other prominent personages of Chicago Presbyterian churches will also be present.</p>
   <p>At 8 o'clock in the evening, a sermon will be preached by the Moderator of the Bohemian Middle-West (sic) Presbyterian Church, Reverend Jos. Krenek of Silver Lake, Minnesota, and another sermon by Dr. A. Barta of Dubuque, Iowa. The evening of Monday, January 4, is reserved for the Bohemian Protestant preachers of Chicago; and Tuesday night there will be a lecture by Dr. Krenek on the timely topic, "By What Can the Slavs Enrich Humanity?" Wednesday night there will be a speech by Dr. F. J. Smetanka on "Bohemia;" Thursday the opening of the classes and a social evening for the pupils will take place; and on Friday will be held the first prayer meeting in the new church.</p>
   <p>The edifice is one of the most beautiful and most modern of Bohemian Protestant <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>churches in this country. Including the real estate and inside furnishings, it was built at a cost of $36,000. Reverend Vanek tells us that with the exception of $3,000, the entire amount is subscribed for, and that he expects to have little difficulty in securing the missing $3,000 among his personal friends.</p>
   <p>A sum of $10,000 was donated by the estate of the Hubbard family, after whom the church is named. The auditorium seats four hundred people; the schoolrooms accommodate three hundred and fifty. The structure was built by the contracting firm J. A. Holpuch and Company of Chicago.</p>
