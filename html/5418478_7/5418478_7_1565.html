   <p>We have been requested to remind our countrymen who have had their first citizenship papers for more than seven years to apply for the second papers as early as possible if they want to acquire them according to the present law, which provides that every applicant is entitled to an interpreter.</p>
   <p>We are advised that this old law will be in force until September 29. Owners of such papers will have to apply for new ones if they fail to apply for the second papers by that date.</p>
