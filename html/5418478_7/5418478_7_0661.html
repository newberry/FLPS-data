   <p>Shortly after nine o'clock yesterday morning, Mr. Frank B. Zdrubek, chairman of the convention committee, declared the convention of Bohemian-American Freethinkers opened. Dr. Frank Iska, chairman of the executive committee, took the floor and in a lengthy talk explained to those present the real purpose of the convention. He also requested of them energetic work and regular attendance. On the motion of Mr. Rosicky, Mr. Zdrubek appointed a rules committee for the convention, and at the same time a permanent committee. Mr. Zdrubek named Messrs. Cejka, Bunata, Hollman, Rosicky, Kirchner, Rehak, and Eggermayer, Dr. Iska, Mrs. Rokuska, Mrs. Ruzicka and Mrs. Rychlik. Dr. Iska was not appointed to the committee until after Mrs. Ruzicka had made a motion that Mr. Zdrubek be also included in the committee. A minor debate ensued, which was ended when Dr. Iska announced his willingness to serve as a member of the committee. Mr. Pech moved that the committee be enlarged to fourteen members, which motion was accepted. While the committee was in consultation, the reports of various committee secretaries were heard.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the convention committee, Mr. Rudolph Janda, asked forgiveness for not being able to submit a more detailed report. Because of the great amount of work in connection with the convention, he was unable to complete the report until yesterday morning, or just before the convention opened. From his reports we select the following items: A total of 419 circular letters were sent to various lodges; in addition Mr. Janda sent out several hundred letters to newspaper and to Czech Freethinkers in Prague, whose representative, Dr. Bartosek, is present at the convention. In naming the newspapers which wrote in favor of the convention and those which made evident their disagreement with the holding of it, Mr. Janda did not forget to cast insinuations at Denni Hlasatel; but we consider his remarks the result of a somewhat faulty memory and of an underestimation of our reports. Mr. Janda certainly would not tell a deliberate untruth, because he knows that it would not be dignified for a truly enlightened person to do so. He was thanked by the chairman for the work he had accomplished for the convention.</p>
   <p>A report was then given by the secretary of the executive committee, Mr. Tupy, who sent out a total of 1094 circulars, and wrote thirty-five pages of minutes while attending nine meetings. His report was received with thanks by the chairman of the convention.</p>
   <p>Congratulatory letters and telegrams from many individuals and lodges were read.</p>
   <p>At the request of the chairman, Dr. Bartosek spoke a few words. There is not the least doubt that Dr. Bartosek is a highly educated man; therefore, it is no wonder that his remarks were followed attentively. After Dr. Bartosek, whose words were received with stormy applause, Dr. Vojan of New York spoke.</p>
   
   <p>In the meantime the committee returned, and its chairman, delegate Cejka, announced the result of its deliberations. The committee resolved to recommend the election of one chairman, three vice-chairman, two secretaries, two recorders and one treasurer for the convention. Morning sessions are to begin at 9:00 A.M., afternoon sessions at 1:30 P.M. Pertinent motions are to be submitted in writing, formal motions may be made orally. The member making the motion is to be allowed ten minutes' time to substantiate his motion, and debate on the motion is to be limited to five minutes. The rules for the convention as worked out by the committee were accepted.</p>
   <p>To the committee which will have to establish contact with the Free Thought societies of other nationalities all over the world, were named the following: Walleck, Iska, Kral, Jicinsky, Zdrubek, Rosicky, Cejka, Dr. Vojan and Dr. Vistelny.</p>
   <p>The chairman announced that the committees would retire for conference and that the convention stood adjourned.</p>
   
   <p>The afternoon session was far from harmonious. Not only were unpleasant scenes enacted, but the entire success of the convention was threatened. Several of the delegates evidently thought that the convention had been called for the purpose of affording them an opportunity to settle old hatreds, and they acted accordingly. They seemed to forget how those people who had traveled great distances, urged on by a desire to work conscientiously, would look upon such quarrels.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. Pech, brought the meeting to order at 1:30 P.M. Several congratulatory letters were read. After the communications received had been read, the secretary read the minutes of the morning session. Dr. Iska then explained the absence of the treasurer, Mr. Charvat. The treasurer, however sent in his report, from which it appears that he received a total of $1748.51 and paid out $262.31, leaving a balance of $1486. 20. Upon a motion by Dr. Iska, it was resolved that the chairman appoint an auditing committee, the members of which he is to name today. Mr. Kirchner resigned as secretary because he was elected also to the resolutions committee and wished to remain on it. Mr. Hulik was elected to the vacancy by acclamation.</p>
   <p>Dr. Iska announced that some good workers had been overlooked when the committees were elected, and he moved that the chairman be given the privilege of enlarging the committees by appointing additional members, especially those who applied. A protest was raised against such procedure; Mr. Polacek, Mr. Rehak and Dr. Radesinsky protested, asking for more active work rather than more committees. Mrs. Klaus remarked that the convention had been called to do some work, and not to satisfy a few personal ambitions.</p>
   <p>After much debate, Dr. Iska was selected as the speaker for the evening session, and the afternoon session adjourned.</p>
   <p>In the evening a public meeting was held, at which Dr. Iska, Mr. L. Palda, Dr. Bartosek, and several other people spoke. This meeting was presided over by delegate Holman.</p>
   
   <p>The convention will be called to order again at 9:00 o'clock today.</p>
