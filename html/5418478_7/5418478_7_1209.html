   <p>A regular monthly meeting of the board of trustees of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was held last night in the hall of the Cesko-Americe Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-American Benevolent Societies) at May and 18th Streets.....</p>
   <p>The incoming mail brought letters from Mr. Rusy, Mr. Charvat, and Mr. Zitka, three architects who entered the competition of plans for the crematorium. Mr. Rusy, who had received the second prize, maintained that he had in no way gone counter to the specifications set forth by the competition and requested the trustees to reconsider his plan. Mr. Charvat, on his own and Mr. Zitka's behalf, simply charged that, in judging the submitted plans, the trustees disregarded their own specifications for the competition, which put the competitors at a disadvantage. They therefore claim compensation, for which they will sue in court if necessary. The letters were set aside for consideration at a future meeting.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Mencl, as chairman of the crematorium building committee, submitted the following written report:</p>
   <p>"In accordance with the decision made by the board of trustees on June 11, the committee held two meetings, at which the plans for building the crematorium were thoroughly discussed. As a result of these discussions, the committee recommends to the board that they build according to the plan submitted by Architect Randak. After a detailed study of this plan and its financial aspect, the committee came to the conclusion that $65,000 will be necessary to erect a building which would be consistent at least to some degree with the prestige of the institution and the standing of Bohemian Freethinkers in America."</p>
   <p>This recommendation in the form of a motion, which was duly seconded, was finally carried by 22 to 12 votes. Many trustees, however, were not present at the meeting, and several of those who attended left the room before the vote was taken. The voting itself was preceded by a debate which was not only extremely lively, but also very embarrassing. It is not worth reporting in its entirety, but the ideas expressed by Mr. Komorous should become known to our public. At the meeting in which the members agreed on the building of a crematorium and allotted $35,000 for this purpose, Mr. Komorous had already voiced the opinion that it is not desirable to connect the crematorium with the old chapel because the chapel will have to be rebuilt in part, and such remodeling is seldom satisfactory. He had also said that $35,000 will not go very far in a project of this kind. That at least his last contention was correct has been proved in this meeting. It should be frankly admitted that by voting $35,000 for the crematorium, the board gave the competitors in the contest a limit which should not have been exceeded.....</p>
   <p>Finally the members at the meeting agreed to award the prize money to the winning contestants.</p>
