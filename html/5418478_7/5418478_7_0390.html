   <p>Yesterday at the convention of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Unity), a great deal of work was accomplished in connection with amendments to the constitution, and although almost every article of the constitution was thoroughly discussed and debated, it is expected that the convention will adjourn at the specified time. In spite of the fact that several articles gave rise to lengthy discussions, these were carried on in a peaceful, considerate manner, and therefore the harmonious work had been at no time disrupted.</p>
   <p>Sister Bohumila Ludvik, chairman, called yesterday's session to order at 9 A.M. After the roll call, Sister Anna Stolfa, secretary, read the minutes of the preceding session, and after several comments, these minutes were approved as read.</p>
   <p>Then many congratulatory communications were read.</p>

   <p>The committee for the erection of a new Bohemian Free Thought school in Cicero sent a congratulatory letter together with the request for a monetary contribution to this project. This matter was referred to the resolutions committee.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon session many articles of the constitution were discussed, but very few minor changes were made.</p>
   <p>A splendid banquet was arranged last night by lodges 39, 41, 67, and 114 in honor of the delegates. All of the delegates were present. The banquet was held at the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' hall at 48th and Honore Streets. The banquet was a success in every respect.</p>
