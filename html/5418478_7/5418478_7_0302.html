   <p>The celebration held yesterday at the Bohemian National Cemetery by the Bohemian National Cemetery Association was, without doubt, a most impressive affair. The principal reason for this, aside from a carefully arranged program with excellent speakers, was the good weather. It lured everyone out, and certainly, not many of our fellow countrymen remained in the city. All were hastening to the cemetery, eager to honor there the memory of the heroic soldiers who fell in the Civil and Spanish-American wars, and to render solemn tribute to the memory of departed relatives and friends. Street car lines leading to the National Cemetery conveyed many, and at some points people were forced to wait several hours before it was possible to get aboard.</p>
   <p>The people gathered around the speakers' platform near the Soldiers' Monument <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the National Cemetery, which appears like a beautiful garden. They formed a mighty mass and followed the course of the program with close attention.</p>
   <p>After having marched in Pilsen, shortly after elecen o'clock in the morning the parade arrived at the cemetery, accompanied by the managing committee of the cemetery. It was composed of Bohemian veterans of the Civil and Spanish-American wars, led by the veterans' Marshal Radeky.</p>
   <p>On the grounds of the Old Peoples' Home, both speakers of the occasion, Mr. Leo Palda, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and W. S. Elliot, Jr., joined the parade. The ceremonies honoring the memories of the fallen soldiers were begun by Frank Stejskal and Fr. Schultz. After the decoration of the graves of their fallen comrades and the firing of an honorary salute by the members of the George Washington company of sharpshooters, commanded by Jak. Stainer, the special celebration was begun by Jan Pech, chairman of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association.</p>

   <p>He introduced the English speaker, W. S. Elliot, Jr., who, in a convincing and touching address, outlined the issues which led to the Civil and Spanish-American wars, and brought up recollections of the heroes who bled there in the cause of freedom and equality. He spoke of the greatness of our new country, which become so great because of the Civil War that it now stands at the head of all nations. Toward the close of his address, he appealed to his listeners to work for the happiness of all, never forgetting those who sacrificed their lives for that which we now enjoy. His discourse, masterly in diction and principles, was interrupted at times by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The second speaker, a Bohemian, was the well known veteran journalist, Leo Palda, of Cedar Rapids, who, speaking extempore from a warm heart, inspired all those that were present. The great crowd listened to his eloquent words with breathless interest. We will publish Mr. Palda's address in full in tomorrow's issue. Every distinct part of his address brought loud applause, which became a veritable storm at the conclusion.</p>

   <p>The veteran, J. R. Houghlitt, spoke feelingly in behalf of the Civil War veterans. The singing society Maj, of the Bohemian Labor Society's singing school, under the direction of it's teacher and conductor, Mr. Kalas, sang "Pomnenku", by K. Bendl, and "Tenting in the Shadows Gray", a song arranged by Mr. Kalas. The band closed the program by playing "My Country 'Tis of Thee".</p>
