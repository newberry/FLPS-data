   <p>Archbishop Feehan has transformed the Bohemian church of St. Prokop, at the corner of Eighteenth and Allport streets, into a monastery of the order of the Benedictine friars. Abbot Wimmer of St. Vincent, Pennsylvania, has named Father Nepomuk Jaeger as prior of the convent and two other friars as his assistants. The present parson, Vilem Coka, will take care of the precious lambs in the western part of the country. The parish of St. Prokop thus has the first convent of Benedictine friars in the United States, and we Bohemians may congratulate ourselves. Our Pilsen district will have one more ornament and a new joy.</p>
