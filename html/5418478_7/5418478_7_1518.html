   <p>The "Liga Footbalowa" (Football League) will begin its seasonal activity next Sunday. This organization has been poorly appreciated and even ridiculed from the outset, but through the assiduous work of the management, and the strenuous training during the winter time it has arrived at a point where it enjoys the respect of all other Czech societies so that it counts as members such clubs as : Slavia, Cechie, A. C. Rangers, Olympia, Union, Praha, the football section of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs, A. C. Atlas, and the youngest Czech association, Sparta. These represent 240 Czech football players.</p>
   <p>The Sunday plays will be devoted to the contest for the cup donated by the well-known merchant, Mr. Spalding. The next meeting of the Football league will be held in the establishment of Karel Novak, 26 Street and Avers Avenue.   </p>
