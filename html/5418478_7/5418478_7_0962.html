   <p>Because of the fact that numerous settlements have reported the impossibility of bringing the collection of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych (National Tax of Freethinkers) to an end this month, the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America) resolved at its last meeting, held November 23, to extend the time for the collection until December 31, 1920. All inquiries regarding this tax should be sent to the office of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych, 2232 South Kedzie Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.....</p>
   <p>One thousand more copies of the December issue of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason) will be printed to satisfy the growing demand for this issue, to be used for agitation purposes.</p>
   <p>The press bureau of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych is hereby asking all the Free Thought newspapers of Bohemian-America to publish this notice.</p>
