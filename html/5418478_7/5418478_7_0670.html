   <p>p. 5.. The sessions of the "Bohemian National Convention of the First Bohemian Catholic Association of America," held in Chicago, came to a close yesterday. The Bohemians of our city found this an appropriate occasion for a celebration. Every prominent Bohemian was present at the festival. An address was delivered by Mayor Harrison in the evening.</p>
   <p>The festivities commenced in the morning with services at the Bohemian St. Vitus Church. The parade held in the afternoon surpassed any other they have held previously. Seated in coaches were twelve delegates who came from various parts of the country. The parade moved along the West Side streets to its place of destination, the Bohemian hall Cesko America Slovanska, at 18th Street. Mr. Zindrich Zitusk, was marshal of the parade. Every Bohemian Society of the city was well represented....</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison was enthusiastically welcomed when he stepped upon the speaker's platform to deliver his address. He said: "With the exclusion of Prag, Chicago is the largest Bohemian city in the world. It often was said, that the American nation is identified with the Anglo-Saxon race. But Chicago disproved that nonsensical assertion. Represented in our city is every nation and every <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>race. They are the real builders of Chicago. The Bohemians can justly claim their share of this fine work. Chicago is a typically American city, well known for its hospitality, and as such it extends its welcome to the Bohemian citizens."...</p>
