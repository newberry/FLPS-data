   <p>The celebration last night in the "Tel. Jed Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) hall, in commemoration of the burning at the stake, of Master Jan Hus, was carried out in a dignified manner. A very fine portrait of our great defender of free thought and free speech, banked by flowers and the Colors of the Tel. Jed. Sokol (Gymnastic Union Sokol) was displayed upon the stage. Plainly to be sure, but nevertheless suitably decorated, it was somewhat significant of the noblemindedness of our women's organizations.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 8 o'clock, Mr. J. Novak arrived with his well-liked musicians ensemble and cheerfully and willingly rendered two praiseworthy compositions, before the speaker, Mr. Fr. B. Zdrubek, took his place. The ceremonial speech befitting the occasion was received with fervent gratitude. Toward the end of the speech three cheers were given for the memory of Jan Huss, three cheers to the success of Tel. Jed. Sokol were also given. After this the band again played and after receiving much praise, which was demonstrated by means of the general applause given, the audience left for their homes.</p>
   
   <p>We cannot refrain from saying, with warranted bitterness, that the cancer of disinterest is beginning to eat into the enthusiasm and life of our community, not only in political affairs, but on occasions, where it should appear as one unanimous body to show that it continues to foster warm sentiments for all things that tend toward the consecration of the spirit of free thought. There was a comparatively small audience present at yesterday's ceremonies in memoriam of Jan Huss.</p>
