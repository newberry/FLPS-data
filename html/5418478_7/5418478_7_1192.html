   <p>The Catholic community of St. Wenceslaus Church at De Koven and Desplaines Streets held a significant celebration yesterday. It commemorated the golden anniversary of the St. Wenceslaus Church and of the founding of the community itself. The prevailing beautiful autumn weather was an inducement to large crowds of our Catholic countrymen from other parts of Chicago to assemble around the historic church and help their local friends celebrate the festive event. Both the streets mentioned, as well as Bunker, Canal, and also, to some degree, Halsted Street, had put on a holiday garb for this occasion: From the roofs of our countrymen's houses waved American and Bohemian flags, and many also carried garlands and festoons of fresh greenery and flowers. The school, the church, and the parish, in addition to all such decorations, were also adorned with flags of papal colors. The inside of the church made a surprisingly beautiful impression with its profuse decoration of fir tree branches and thousands of lights. Its pews and all standing room were filled to capacity long before the ceremonies started, and the doors had to be closed in order to stop the multitudes.....</p>
   
   <p>The celebration consisted of a festive sermon preached by the Right Reverend Bishop Josef. M. Koudelka of Superior, Wisconsin. He spoke in Bohemian and his discussion centered around the golden jubilee of the church and the life of St. Wenceslaus, whose church celebration took place yesterday. After the sermon, Reverend Havlovic, with the assistance of Reverend Kohlbeck and Reverend Zenisek, celebrated a High Mass which was also attended by Archbishop J. E. Quigley and his chancellor. The Archbishop gave a short address in English in which he complimented Bohemian Catholic communities on their loyalty and progress. The music and choral singing were directed by our well-known conductor, Mr. Jan Geringer.</p>
