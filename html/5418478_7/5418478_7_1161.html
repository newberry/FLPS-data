   <p>The day before yesterday and again yesterday we published preliminary reports of the celebrations contemplated for the benefit of the church of St. Jan Nepomucky on the so-called "Mala (Small) South Side". This "Mala South Side" is one or our oldest Bohemian settlements in Chicago, and it claims a history of almost a half century.</p>
   <p>Our statement that a large number of the old settlers would come to this celebration was justified, because, although many are not living here now, they came to renew old acquaintances and interests in the old "Mala South Side", and to lend a helping hand at an opportune time. We were not disappointed in the least. On the contrary, our expectations were more than satisfied, because our threefold celebration was a success in every respect, and the arrangements committee may be well pleased with the results.</p>
   <p>First, we must explain why we speak of a threefold celebration. First of all, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>on the corner of West 30th Street and South Lowe Avenue, there now stands a beautiful temple, just recently completed, which has become the successor of the old parish church consecrated in the name of Jan Nepomucky, although this old church is still standing at the corner of West 25th Street and South Princeton Avenue.</p>
   <p>Even though there have been services in the new church since its completion on March 8 of this year, nevertheless the church was never officially consecrated and turned over to the public. It was decided to wait with this celebration until an auspicious occasion presented itself, and a better time than last Sunday could not have been chosen. Last Sunday was the day following the celebration of St. John, which falls on Saturday.</p>
   <p>Here in our American parishes we always celebrate a saint's day on the following Sunday; therefore, last Sunday was also celebrated as a pilgrimage, and at the same time the church and the rest of the parish buildings were consecrated. Finally, a confirmation ceremony was performed in the newly <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>consecrated church.</p>
   <p>We have made references before to our new temple and the history of our parish. Today we must add that the founder of our parish, Jan Nepomucky, was the Reverend William Coka, who was succeeded by the Right Reverend Frantisek Boubal, who is now a priest at the parish of St. Ludmila; and finally was followed by the Reverend A. J. Novacek, to whom responsibility for building the new church belongs.</p>
   <p>To the preceding reference we may add that the edifice is a combination of styles. The lower floor is reserved principally for church services. The school will take up the entire first floor, to the rear of which are a number of rooms set aside as living quarters for the schoolteacher sisters and the order of the Benedictine Sisters.</p>
   <p>This ingenious arrangement of this beautiful church was the work of the architect, Mr. Rezny, and the principal builder, Mr. Josef Strnad, Jr.</p>

   <p>Yesterday's triple celebration was begun shortly after one o'clock in the afternoon, when all of the societies which we named yesterday assembled in a small park situated at the corner of South Halsted and 30th Streets, and waited there for the rest of the group, including the Right Reverend Bishop Rhode and his retinue of clergy from South Chicago. As soon as Bishop Rhode and his company arrived, the line swung into action, marching along 33rd Street to Union Avenue, Union Avenue to 29th Street and Lowe Avenue; then the marchers all walked to the new church, stopped while everybody stood at attention; finally the Bishop and the rest of the clergy filed between the two columns of marchers into the rectory, where many of the other clergy had already retired.</p>
   <p>The leading marshals of the procession were Alderman Richert, Alderman Ryan, and F. Cerny, representing the Prvni Ustredni Jednota (First Central Union). A. Adam headed the cadets, Frantisek Vavrin lead the Katolicti Lesnici (Catholic Foresters), and Frantisek Jana was Mr. Varin's assistant.</p>

   <p>The line of march started with mounted police leading, followed by officers on foot. The cadets marched next. Then came the Sokols (Gymmasts) and Sokolky (Women Gymnasts) with their band of musicians; individual societies of the Prvni Ustredni Jednota, the military band from Town of Lake, Mr. Lhotak leading; Katolicti Lesnic, and a deputation of societies in automobiles and other conveyances. Next came the communicants, boys and girls, and last in line were little maids of honor dressed in white.</p>
   <p>This procession was the largest ever seen on our "Mala South Side", and it roused the well-deserved interest of all the onlookers who lined both sides of the street. The housetops were decorated with banners and flags in commemoration of this auspicious event.</p>
   <p>The ceremony proper of blessing the church was begun at about three o'clock. Bishop Rhode performed this ceremony with the assistance of the Bohemian clergy. The Bishop then spoke in English, after which an address in Bohemian was given.</p>

   <p>Next in order came the communion ceremony, which included about two hundred children with their godmothers and godfathers in attendance, and also communion for the adults. After this ceremony was ended the assembled societies marched away from the church, by two bands playing merrily, to Liberty Hall at 30th Street and Union Avenue, where in a short time a friendly and very animated entertainment was in full swing. This reminded us of the entertainments in the old homeland at the country fairs. The hall was so crowded that hardly any more could have secured entrance, and no doubt many stayed until quite late.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this entertainment were undoubtedly large, and they will be used for the support of the new church. </p>
   <p>The central arrangements committee was composed of the following countrymen: Messrs. Moulis, Knetl, Reysek, Vlazny, and Ditrich. Other members gave them a helping hand, so that the success of this threefold celebration practically belongs to the whole parish. All of the members were very happy because the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>weather conditions were ideal. All members of our parish and also our spiritual adviser may be proud of the work, which was crowned with such success. But above all, we may be proud of our parish, whose members will surely not become inactive now, but on the contrary, will serve their church with greater interest from now on.</p>
