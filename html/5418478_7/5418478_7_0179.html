   <p>Even if labor and business conditions are not as we should like to have them, we have many good reasons to celebrate the American Thanksgiving Day, the day set aside to give thought to the blessings we have received during the year. This year the celebration should be more sincere and more joyful than ever, because we shall give thanks for the fact that we live in this free, happy country, happy many times over now since it has been spared the folly and horrors of war. It may therefore be expected that our countrymen and their women folk will participate in largest numbers in the dinners, banquets theatrical performances, concerts, socials, and other forms of entertainment which our lodges, orders, societies, and unions have arranged for their members and friends.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Announcements of fourteen such entertainments are omitted in translation. The sponsors include Sokols, Catholic organizations, and Freethought groups.]</p>
