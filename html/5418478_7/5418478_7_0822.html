   <p>Yesterday morning at ten o'clock the state convention of the Svaz Svobodo-myslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) of the State of Illinois opened in Chicago. The convention was held in the Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial Building) and was presided over by Mr. J. M. Musil. After the roll call it was ascertained that over fifty Free Thought societies were represented by seventy delegates. The Milwaukee local federation delegated Brother Jecmen. After the adoption of the rules of order, Brother J. M. Musil was elected president of the convention; Sister Blazek became first vice-president; Brother Egermayer, second vice-president; Brother F. Strunc, secretary; and Brother V. Vohralik, assistant secretary. The following were elected as members of the committee on resolutions: Messrs. Suchy, Pls, Vjan, Jelinek, Benes, and Mesdames Lapek and Bohdan. To the committee on complaints, Mr. Cada and Mesdames Kappa and Lusk were elected. To the committee on constitutional matters, Messrs. Studnicka, Krupar, Hudecek, Siroky, Dolansky, Rajtora, and Kamis were elected. Letters addressed to the convention were read. The proposed resolutions and suggestions were referred to the respective committees. [Names of persons giving various district reports are omitted in translation.] The local Chicago Federation consists of more than seventy members who represent the local Free Thought societies.....The convention adjourned at noon to resume its deliberations at 2 P. M.</p>
   <p>The afternoon was taken up by the reading of minutes. In view of the extensive program, it was found impossible to grant the request of Professor Kralicek who desired to address the convention, choosing for his theme the subject of the world program of the Roman Catholic Church. Thereupon Brother J. J. Jelinek took the floor and reported on the Free Thought press and the necessity of publishing at least one weekly periodical for the Federation. Brother Jelinek claimed that at least an attempt should be made in that direction as was suggested during the 1920 convention. He emphasized the need for such a periodical for the Bohemian Freethinkers of America who are to prove that they are able to support it. The committee on resolutions recommended that publication begin after September 1, 1922. This recommendation was made into a motion by Brother Matejka and carried after a lengthy debate.</p>
   <p>Brother Krafar, representing the committee on constitutional matters, then read in detail the proposed constitution of the State Federation which was also voted on accordingly. The question of resolutions followed, and the most important item here was the clearing up of the relationship which existed between the Federation and the now defunct Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance). The resolution read as follows:</p>
   <p>"We protest, naturally, against the introduction of a new concept of 'Progressive Free Thought' among the Bohemians of America. We owe our Free Thought movement to the life work of Vojta Naprstek, Karel Jonas, Frantisek Zdrubek, Frantisek Klacel, Vaclav Snajdr, Bartos Bittner, and other zealous workers. Their kind of Free Thought has always been and still is progressive. This fact makes the new designation unnecessary. In view of the increasing boldness of the churches' division [factional controversy], and the splitting of the party among the ranks of the Freethinkers would only lead to ruin. We therefore ask the Sdruzeni to continue with its own activity, but when it comes to Free Thought matters it ought to recognize the necessity for a large national organization, such as the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers represents, and which in a way would counterbalance the Bohemian Catholic organizations. At the same time the Federation is always willing to co-operate with the former Sdruzeni and the Ceskoamericka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) in all other matters touching upon cultural or national problems."</p>
   <p>Another resolution was passed which insisted on all Free Thought Societies taking care that their members, who are also delegates to other organizations, be sincere Freethinkers. The next items on the program consisted of serious and long addresses by the foremost leaders of the Federation. The convention itself did not end until evening, and terminated with a speech by the president....The following important motions were carried and they embodied a thorough reorganization of the Svaz:</p>
   <p>The convention of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of Illinois, meeting in Chicago on April 30, 1922, decided on the following proposition which is submitted to the Vybor Svazu Svobodomyslnych v Americe (the executive committee of Bohemian Freethinkers of America) in order that the latter body may place it before the entire membership which is to vote on it. The proposition, which deals with the reorganization of our whole movement is to be voted on within the next thirty days. It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"1. The local Federation, no matter what its name (The Chicago Local Federation of Freethinkers for example), should always employ the term 'local' or the name of the city in which it operates.</p>
   <p>"2. Any individual paying an annual fee of one dollar may become a member of the local society. Each society pays one cent for each such member per month, or, at least, five dollars annually.</p>
   <p>"3. All fees are to be collected from members by the local societies and contribute to other and higher organization as follows: From the one-cent fee ratio the local society shall retain fifteen per cent; from each dollar collected, ten per cent shall be paid to the State Federation, and the remaining seventy-five per cent shall be paid to the National Federation. From each dollar contributed to the local society, that society shall keep seventy-five per cent, paying ten per cent to the State Federation, and fifteen per cent to the National Federation. Of the five-dollar fee, the local society shall retain twenty per cent, paying ten per cent to the State Federation treasury, and seventy per cent to the treasury of the National Federation.</p>
   <p>"4. In localities not having any local societies, the members shall pay their whole dues to the National Federation.</p>
   
   <p>"5. In places not having a State Federation, the local societies shall make payments directly to the National Federation.</p>
   <p>"6. All societies represented by their local Federations or by the National Federation shall receive the periodical Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), that is, one copy in return for the payment which such society or societies make to the National Federation either through their local Federations or directly.</p>
   <p>"7. Individuals who are direct members of the National Federation, as well as members who are represented by their local societies in the National Federation shall pay three dollars annually (that is, besides their membership dues or fees) as a subscription fee for the periodical Vek Rozumu. This payment shall be the duty of every member.</p>
   <p>"8. In case the above-proposed changes are adopted, they shall become operative during the second half of the year 1922.</p>
   
   <p>"A suggestion: The periodical Vek Rozumu, which is the official organ of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych v Americe, shall become a weekly publication, and its subscription fee is to be three dollars per annum. The National Federation shall appoint from among its members a committee consisting of five members who are to supervise the publication of the official organ."</p>
