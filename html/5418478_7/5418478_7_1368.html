   <p>There is, perhaps, not one band in the American navy or army in which there are no Czech musicians. Their performances are being more and more appreciated by the public. In the band of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station many musicians are Czechs. Among these, until a short time ago, was Raymond M. Zaher, a Chicago Czech pianist, of whose talent many a flattering report has been printed in Chicago dailies. He volunteered for service, and became a member of the Great Lakes band on May 7, but was transferred to Philadelphia where he will board a battleship, which is under orders soon to leave American shores.</p>
   <p>The 22-year-old pianist's parents live at 30th Street and Avers Avenue, where his father conducts a saloon.</p>
