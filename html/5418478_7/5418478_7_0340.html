   <p>The day of September 16 of this year marks the one thousandth anniversary of the martyr death of St. Iudmila, grandmother of the King and patron of Bohemian, St. Wenceslaus. The name of St. Ludmila is thus closely connected with the name of St. Wenceslaus and is dear to the hearts of all good Czech Catholics.....</p>
   <p>This anniversary will be commemorated by our brothers in the old country by processions to the places where St. Ludmila build and worked and died.....</p>
   <p>We, Czech Catholics in America, are unable to make pilgrimages to these places, but we can commemorate fittingly that day, and it is our sacred Catholic duty to do so. We call therefore to all Czech Catholic Americans: Celebrate the anniversary of St. Ludmila, particularly all our parishes and associations carrying her name, pay homage to the great merits of St. Ludmila. Pay homage <span class="page-break">2</span>by attending the Holy Mass celebrated to ask blessing upon our nation, to ask that the time of unity may return to our happy old country, that the people may return to the traditions to the times of St. Ludmila and St. Wenceslaus.....</p>
   <p>(Signed) The executive committee of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Federation of Bohemian Catholics) of America.</p>
