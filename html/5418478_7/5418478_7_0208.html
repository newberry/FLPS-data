   <p>A full-page drawing, showing a mother and two children in front of a counter in a butcher shop in the act of buying a turkey, heads this issue. The caption says: "A Happy and Merry Posviceni" [a fall festival in Bohemia, comparable in some respects, particularly in plentiful eating and drinking, to the American Thanksgiving Day].</p>
   <p>The issue contains almost two full pages of notices of various lodges, clubs, societies, etc., giving time and place of their celebrations of the Posviceni, mostly in restaurants; but the larger ones are to be held in various halls in Chicago's Bohemian districts. In some instances there is a reference to the menu--either turkey, or goose, or chickens and ducks with "all the trimmings" are promised to the participants, to say nothing of Posvicenske Kolace (open fruit, cottage-cheese, poppy-seed, or other kinds of open tarts most popular at any Posviceni).</p>
