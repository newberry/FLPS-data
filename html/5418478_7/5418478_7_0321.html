   <p>Chicago Bohemians consecrated a day in Bohemian history, a day of fraternization in memory of the great martyr, Jan Hus. This year exercises were arranged in three separate local places. In the "Tel. Jed. Sokol" hall (Gymnastic Union Sokol) there was given a dramatized version of "Jan Hus". The attendance was quite satisfactory. Yesterday there was arranged a special celebration which was participated in by many of our people, there-by making it known, that they respect their great leaders suach as Jan Hus was. The speakers for the occasion were Fr. Zdrubek, K. Stulik and J.R. Jicinsky.</p>
   <p>There was also held a celebration at the "Cesko Anglicke Svob. Skole" (Bohemian-English Liberal School) on 18th Street yesterday afternnon. The attendance here was quite considerable and the result morally splendid of course. In the evening there was a shortened version of the "Jan Hus" Drama and this was received by those present with pleasure.</p>
