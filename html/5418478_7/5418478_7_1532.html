   <p>Last night graduation exercises were held for 106 Bohemian candidates for citizenship. The event took place in the J. Sterling Morton High School assembly hall at 8 P. M., under the sponsorship of the active Poplatnik Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association. This organization was instrumental in providing the necessary training for the candidates, without which it would be impossible for them to obtain the desired citizenship certificate. It is noteworthy that the instructors in this course were Professor Otto Duda and Miss Josefa Duda who with unwonted zeal and industry endeavored to convey the necessary information to the candidates. In this they were eminently successful according to the naturalization officer who praised the Bohemian people in general and the Bohemian candidates in particular, saying that they all deserved high grades [in the examination given by the naturalization department].</p>
