   <p>The Czech-American public again viewed with pride a new contingent of our men who are preparing to do what is their duty. They are on the way to Jefferson Barracks, Mo. They are accompanied by thirty Slovak brethren, who also are hastening to serve under the Star-Spangled Banner. Enthusiasm for enlistment has considerably increased, and young men are crowding our recruiting stations.</p>
   <p>It is worthy of recording that our Czech volunteers have been found by the Medical examiners to take the first place as to fitness.</p>
   <p>Those of our volunteers who were among the first to enlist are in best condition and spirits as may be gathered from numerous letters that have reached us from the training camp in Jefferson Barracks.</p>

   <p>The tenor of all of these is one field cry: "Send more and more volunteers!" [Follows list of new recruits.]</p>
