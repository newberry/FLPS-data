   <p>Today the St. Cyril and Methodius parish of Town of Lake is celebrating a significant jubilee. Although not primarily its own jubilee, nevertheless it is one in which the parish is deeply concerned, because it is an important anniversary of it spiritual adviser, a priest and national worker well known in Bohemian circles, Reverend Tomas J. Bobal. He himself recollects the most significant moment of his life, thirty years ago today, when he was ordained a priest. Although himself too modest to direct attention to this significant occurrence; Reverend Bobal's friends and devotees, notably the assistant pastor of the parish, Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, have made arrangements already to celebrate the anniversary in a proper manner. The event will be observed in the church, where Reverend Bobal will celebrate a High Mass. Before the High Mass Reverend Innocent Kestl, pastor of the Blessed Agnes parish, will deliver a sermon. This celebration will doubtless be attended by almost the whole parish, which looks upon its spiritual adviser with the respect and love which he has won through his many good works.</p>
