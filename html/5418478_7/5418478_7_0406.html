   <p>The meeting of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America) was called to order at 11:20 A. M. by the vice-president, Reverend Innocent Kestl. Delegates present were: Reverend Innocent Kestl, Doctor Joseph P. Pecival, Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, Doctor Matthias Lorenz, Messrs. Joseph Paskovsky, Karel Bernreiter, Jan Straka, Tuma, Doctor Jaroslav F. Smetanka, temporary secretary and executive officer Vaclav Kosner. The guests present were: Lieutenant Spanihel, executive officer of the Czechoslovak National Council of Prague, Czechoslovakia; Miss Sarka Hrbek, Mr. Joza Zak Marusiak, delegate of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe, who just returned from Siberia, and Mr. Matlocha. Mr. Mamatej sent a telegram stating that he and most of the Slovakian delegates will not be able to attend this meeting because of an Eastern railroad strike.</p>
   
   <p>A reading of the minutes of the plenary meeting held in Cleveland, Ohio, January 8, 1920, and of the executive committee meeting held in Chicago, February 13, 1920, was omitted, because a copy of these minutes had been sent to each member. The minutes of the executive committee meetings held in Chicago on February 23, March 20, March 27, and April 2 were read and approved without change.</p>
   <p>The temporary secretary read a lengthy report about the activities of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe, especially about the situation which arose as a result of the loss of the shipment aboard the ship "Liberty Glow". The entire shipment was insured for $197,455 which has already been paid to the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. It was discovered, however, that the total valuation of the shipment represented the sum of $214,972.12. Mr. Kubelka, commercial attache of the Czechoslovak General Consulate in New York asserts that he insured the shipment according to instructions given to him by the officers of the collection depots of Chicago. Mr. Kubelka enclosed copies of communications showing that he acted strictly according to instructions. Mr. Frana Klepal, former manager of the collecting depots in Chicago says that he informed the secretary orally that the total valuation of each freight car was only an approximate figure and that in each case he sent Mr. Kubelka a detailed statement of each shipment by which Mr. Kubelka could easily appraise the valuation of each freight car.</p>
   <p>The secretary is of the opinion that regardless of whose fault it was, the damage is done. Now it is the duty of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe to see that the senders receive full insurance less the usual discount for office expenses. The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe then unanimously resolved to appropriate the sum of $15,000 to cover the deficit and ordered Mr. Vaclav Kosner, who was hired to take care of this matter, to make out the checks at once.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session started at 2 P. M. After the meeting was called to order a committee of four members who were elected to represent those whose shipments were lost was given a hearing. Their spokesman, Mr. Beranek, especially blamed the officers of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe for the erroneous information given to our public about the shipment and asked for a more speedy settlement of claims for the lost, damaged, or undelivered shipment. The committee was told that after the forwarding action was accomplished, the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe, in order to economize, did not keep a special office to answer all the inquiries, and that all this work had been done free of charge by the officers of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. Now the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe has an officer to take care of this matter. As far as the undelivered shipment is concerned, the representative of the Ceskoslovanska Narodni Rada v Praze (Czechoslovak National Council in Prague, Czechoslovakia), Mr. Bohumil Klir, reported three weeks ago that a statement relating to the undelivered shipment is being prepared, and that the loss is small. Mr. Klir will soon have a correct statement at our disposal.</p>
   <p>Because Mr. Frana Klepal, former manager of the collecting depots, was one of the four members of the committee, the question of the responsibility for insufficient insurance was brought up again. Mr. Frana Klepal read a written proclamation, the gist of which was presented in the report of the secretary. Furthermore, a report of the local Chicago committee authorized by the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe to supervise the financial management of our forwarding action was read. The report, signed by Messrs. Karel Kouba, Martin Huska, Jan Mrazek, and Mrs. Julia Hrych, blames the late manager of the collecting depots for many discrepancies. Mr. Frana Klepal presented his explanation and the whole matter was postponed until a statement of Mr. Rudolph Mulac, public accountant, who promised to appear at 4 P.M., is received. The committee accepted the explanation and departed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Bernreiter presented his report about the proceedings of the convention of Czechoslovak Legionnaires held recently in Cleveland, Ohio, which was attended by the Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, Messrs. Jan Pankuch, and Karel Bernreiter as the representatives of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. The convention was attended by about twenty-five Bohemian and Slovak delegates, and the proceedings were impressive and harmonious. The convention resolved that anyone who voluntarily joined the Czechoslovak, Canadian, or United States armies before September 15, 1917, the time when the Czechoslovak legion was created, may become a member. But only volunteers of the Czechoslovak legion or their families will be entitled to aid from a fund which may be provided by the Czechoslovak government or the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. The attitude of the convention toward our national organizations is loyal, and the dispute of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago and the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe is considered a local matter of no importance.</p>
   <p>The legionnaires expect to receive a fund of $10,000 promised by the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe which will be administered by the legionnaires' headquarters with the co-operation of representatives of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. The representatives of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) and the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) announced that their respective organizations appropriated their quota of the said fund. This amount will be paid out to the legionnaires as soon as their headquarters are established. Because of the fact that the Slovak League had not been fully represented at this meeting, it will be necessary for the Slovak League to approve its quota later. To co-operate with the legionnaires in the management of the above-mentioned fund the following men were elected as trustees: Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, Messrs. Karel Bernreiter and Jan Pankuch.</p>
   <p>In the meantime Mr. Rudolph Mulac who examined the bills of the former collecting depots appeared. He said that he did not attempt to audit the receipts, because that is a task requiring a week's time. So far as disbursements are concerned, he found items amounting to about $3,000 for which there were not sufficient bills. The correctness of these bills is impossible to determine without an explanation from Mr. Frana Klepal or Mr. Cerny, the treasurer of the collecting depots, who also signed the checks. It was resolved to ascertain whether all amounts received were correctly entered, and the abovenamed gentlemen will have to explain the dubious items.</p>
   <p>Then the committee of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires inquired about the $10,000 fund which is to be given to the legionnaires by the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. The committee was informed of the decision of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. The news was gratefully acknowledged. Legionnaire Bukovsky asked what the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe learned about the accounting of the fund created from the $150 bonuses which was set aside for every volunteer legionnaire from the United States. Mr. Tuma announced that he discussed the matter with Mr. Frantisek Kopecky, Czechoslovakian consul in New York, who said that he could furnish Mr. Tuma with an accounting of that part of the fund which was entrusted to him for the payment of relief to the families of married volunteers; but that the other part of the fund was used for monthly allowances to the volunteer legionnaires in France. Because Mr. Bukovsky was not satisfied with this explanation, Mr. Tuma was authorized to take further necessary action in this matter together with the committee of the legionnaires.</p>
   <p>Legionnaire Vosatko is of the opinion that it would be only proper that every Czechoslovak legionnaire from the United States who served in any of the Allied armies receive a special service certificate. The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe willingly approved this wish and decided that Mr. Vojtech Preissig, who designed the recruiting posters during the World War, be asked to design this service certificate.</p>
   <p>Miss Sarka Hrbek then read her report about the proposed bills in Congress which would make it easier for our Czechoslovak legionnaires, and legionnaires of foreign birth, to secure United States citizenship.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joza Zak Marusiak then reported on his nine months' mission to Siberia. He had traveled to Siberia with four other members of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe to work for the benefit of the Czechoslovak legionnaires. To cover his traveling expenses, the sum of $1,200 was allotted to him. The meeting then adjourned until Thursday morning at 9 A. M.</p>
   <p>The session on Thursday, April 16, came to order at 9:40 A. M. First the report and statement of Mrs. Motak was read. The statement shows that there is a balance of $2,226.53 on hand, but the transport of about fifty legionnaires from Europe is expected and the sum of thirty dollars must be paid to each of them. But because other smaller groups of legionnaires are yet expected, Mrs. Motak moved that the balance of about seven or eight hundred dollars be kept for this purpose. The motion was approved.</p>
   <p>The request of three individuals from the old country who ask for monetary and other relief was read. The matter was referred to the local Vcelky (Bees).</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe has neither a president nor a secretary. However, since the Slovak members were not able to attend, the elections had to be postponed. Because an opinion was expressed that the Slovak members do not attend the meetings regularly, it was resolved to send two delegates to the next convention of the Slovak League which will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the latter part of June this year. The delegates would accurately explain to the convention the relation between the Bohemian and Slovak members of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. Doctor Joseph P. Pecival and Mr. Jan Straka were the delegates elected.</p>
   <p>The temporary secretary, Doctor Jaroslav F. Smetanka, again offered his resignation, and this time he insisted that it be accepted. The resignation was accepted and the sum of $200 appropriated to him as a reward for his secretarial work of the past eleven months. In the meantime current matters will be attended to by Mr. Vaclav Kosner, and the executive committee is authorized to look for a new, talented secretary who, if necessary, does not have to be selected from the ranks of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe.</p>
   <p>The bills of Bernard Judae and Company for payment of customs duties on the Canadian shipment were approved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tuma asked for the payment of a bill amounting to $5,881.37 which was spent by the joint committee to welcome the Czechoslovak legionnaires upon their arrival in New York. In a lengthy speech he gave substantial reasons why it was done. Since the welcoming of legionnaires was a matter concerning the entire Czechoslovak-America, it was resolved to pay the bill and at the same time place a quota of $6,000 upon the organizations participating.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tuma then reported about the new women's activity in New York which conflicts with the resolutions of the past convention of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. He further recommended better contact with the Czechoslovak National Council of Prague and a greater interest in our own problems in the United States. On the basis of his reasons a committee was appointed to form a plan of activities and reconstruction. Mr Tuma promised to outline a plan and send it to the committee consisting of Reverend Innocent Kestl and a member of the Slovak League.</p>
   <p>Miss Sarka Hrbek explained the activities of her office and announced that the American Red Cross wants to organize all the national institutions, such as charitable, social, etc., with local centers in order to co-operate for the better development of American life. It was resolved to notify the American Red Cross that we are willing and ready to co-operate.</p>
   <p>The next plenary meeting of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe will be called by the executive committee.</p>
