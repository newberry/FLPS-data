   <p>Washington, D. C., July 21. Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, a candidate for a diplomatic office in the Balkans, was introduced to President Wilson by Senator [James H.] Lewis and Congressmen Adolph J. Sabath and McAndrews today. Mr. Vopicka's supporters maintain that his prospects for the nomination are excellent, but it seems that the President will not make any definite decision before the conditions in the Balkans are settled, peace restored, and the opinion of countries concerned secured.</p>
