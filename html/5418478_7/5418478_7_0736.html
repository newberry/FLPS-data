   <p>More than fifty members of the board of delegates of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) assembled yesterday morning in our beautiful necropolis in Irving Park. There, accompanied by the officers and members of the board of directors of the cemetery, they undertook the customary annual inspection of that institution which from humble beginnings has, during the course of time, grown into one of the most imposing enterprises of the Bohemian people of America. Today we may safely say that our Hrbitov assumes such proportions as to surpass the wildest dreams of its original founders. It consists of 130 acres extending on one side from Crawford Avenue to Central Park Avenue, and from Foster Avenue to Bryn Mawr Avenue on the other. In it lie buried over 40,000 of our countrymen; its annual operating expenses exceed the tremendous sum of $300,000, and the monthly payroll for its 80 employees averages $10,000. An enterprise of such large proportions requires very efficient management. That management is in the hands of the board of delegates, headed by a board of directors and the several officials, and it will not be out of place to say that the cemetery is managed by them not only conscientiously but, more important, honestly and economically.</p>
   <p>Once every year the representatives of the various organizations who have been delegated to manage the affairs of the cemetery, assemble to subject that enterprise to a joint scrutiny, to assure themselves personally about its progress, and to confer about what should be done to develop it further. It was for this purpose that more than fifty delegates took part in the inspection which, lasting more than three hours, left them entirely satisfied. The inspection, in which the Bohemian press representatives also took part, brought to light anew the well-known fact that the management of the cemetery is vested in competent hands.</p>
   <p>.....The inspection tour itself began at about 9:30 A.M., starting from the main entrance of the cemetery and proceeding northward to Klacel's obelisk where the first stop was made. Near this landmark rests the ashes of the Nestor of Bohemian-American journalists, Frantisek B. Zdrubek, and here also one may find a memorial tablet honoring the memory of an outstanding American friend of our nation, the jurist, Robert H. Vickers, an author of a history of the Czechs written in the English language. Here the inspection party rendered a silent homage to the three spiritual giants and then proceeded to the new section 18 which consists of about 41/2 acres. This section, although being the northern most part of the cemetery is, nevertheless, not very far from the main entrance. The grounds here have already been surveyed, roads cut, and water pipes laid, so that lots will soon be ready for sale. In view of the advantageous position, and also due to the fact that the cemetery has little unoccupied land, the lots in this section will, no doubt, sell rapidly.</p>
   
   <p>A little farther beyond this point lies section 14 which is situated easterly from section 18. Work has been started on section 14 and it will be ready in about a year. The necessary information was supplied by Mr. Jan Pecha, president of the board of delegates, who just returned after a four-month trip abroad, and by Mr. Stanislav Simecek, vice-president, who took over the president's gavel during his absence, performing the presidential duties conscientiously. Others who acted as ciceroni were Messrs. Josef Simejkal, Josef Siman, and Frantisek Boucek, all of them members of the executive committee. An especially valuable informant was Mr. Karel Bastyr, the gardener.</p>
   <p>In the eastern part of the cemetery, one of its oldest sections, a stop was made at the grave of L. Avenarius, a former member of the editorial staff of the Denni Hlasatel, who died under such tragic circumstances on February 10, 1897. Avenarius, as will be remembered by our older readers, killed himself while in a delirium by jumping from a window of the County Hospital where he was being treated for typhus. The Spolek Cesko-Americkych Zurnalistu (Society of Bohemian-American Journalists) furnished a stone for his grave, and since the grave is now in a rather neglected state, a collection was made among the members of the inspection party to raise sufficient funds to care for the grave from year to year. The board of delegates will assume the responsibility, and thus the grave of this young and talented journalist will receive perpetual care.</p>
   <p>In the eastern part of the cemetery there are several older sections, and the board is considering the possibility of having them restored. The children's section, which served as a burial ground since the World Columbian Exposition more than thirty years ago, is about to be abolished. Most of the graves in this section receive no other care than that furnished by the cemetery employees. The parents of the children that are buried here have either died or are not to be found, and since no fund exists which could be used for the care of these graves, they lie uncared for. Steps will be taken, therefore, to inform the relatives, provided that these may be found, to have the remains transferred to another section; the new locations and the labor which such transfer entails will, of course, be furnished gratis by the cemetery authorities. The grounds thus obtained shall be used for the burial of adults.</p>
   <p>Much attention was paid by the inspection party to the tree nursery which is located on the south side of the cemetery near the reservoir. This nursery is a very rich one despite the fact that many of the young trees which were cultivated here by the gardener, Mr. Karel Bastyr, were taken out to be transplanted in the new section 18. In this nursery one may find a veritable wealth of newly planted specimens which are being cultivated for next season.</p>
   <p>The next stop was made at the crematory, the imposing edifice of which may be seen from afar. Not until today do people realize that the erection of this building, against which so many protests were made, was a wise and thoroughly practical move. The building, together with its equipment, cost in the neighborhood of $100,000. This was indeed a huge sum, but in reality it was a great saving, since a modern cemetery without a crematory would be unthinkable today, and experts estimate that the building, equipment, and the chapel would at the present writing cost at least $250,000. An equally wise move was the purchase of an organ for the chapel, an item which was also considered to be "an extravangance". The organ, which cost $9,000 has long since paid for itself. And so, no matter where our steps led us in this cemetery, we found everywhere the signs of strict economy.</p>
   <p>A longer stop was made in the chapel of the crematory, during which its organist, Mr. Tuma, played several compositions, and where the names of the inspecting delegates were read. Most of the delegates were present. Mr. Simecek, the vice-president, seized this opportunity to welcome the returning president, Mr. Pecha who at this juncture resumed his office. Mr. Pecha thanked Mr. Simecek for substituting for him during his absence, fulfilling the duties of a presiding officer in such a conscientious way, and he also expressed his joy at seeing all of the delegates in good health and alive.....</p>
   <p>Previous to the inspection, the crematory building had been equipped with a large clock, and the empty space below the cupola was tastefully decorated by a copper ornament, all of which adds greatly to the harmonious appearance of the whole. Another addition, useful as well as ornamental, was the erection of a locker-room for the employees of the cemetery. It is located at the site of the former reservoir. The inspection party also visited the extensive hot houses that contain great wealth of plants and flowers.....Finally a stop was made at the garage which also belongs to a group of the more recently erected buildings by which the cemetery was enriched during the past year.</p>
   <p>As already stated, the inspection tour....lasted for more than three hours, and the members of the party were shown every new improvement made since the last inspection. Remarkable also is the fact that during recent times the number of monuments in our Bohemian National Cemetery has visibly increased, which speaks well for not only a great financial investment, but for a highly developed artistic taste. Such art works have been added to the cemetery from year to year, and it is natural that they have added to the beauty and orderliness of the burial grounds.</p>
   
   <p>After the inspection, all the participants repaired to the cozy restaurant of Mr. Bezvoda where a sumptuous dinner awaited them. Mrs. Bezvoda's fame as a culinary artist was well substantiated. When the purely physical requirements of the delegates were satisfied--and it need not be stressed that after a three-hour walk their appetites were excellent--the inevitable oratory talents of the men came to the fore.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Jan Pecha and Frantisek Zahrobsky, both of whom recently returned from a visit to the old homeland, pictured in a highly interesting manner their rich experiences gained during their long visit abroad. Both of them proved themselves to be excellent raconteurs and observers. Besides these two gentlemen, others seized this opportunity for delivering short addresses and toasts. These were Messrs. Smejkal, Simecek, Jan Klaus, Cipra, Tuma, and Jelinek. The representatives of the daily press spoke also, and the floor was finally occupied by Mr. Josef Jurka who seasoned his humorous speech by paraphrasing the term 'wonderful,' the frequent use of which by Mr. Pecha after his return from abroad characterized all of his descriptions. Thus Mr. Jurka too employed that word in summing up the events of this day: The mood of the delegates, the results of the inspection tour, the obliging ways of the representatives of the daily press, and 'last but not least' [Translator's note: The phrase 'last but not least' is printed in English] the culinary art of Mrs. Bezvoda and the fine restaurant service of her husband. All of these were truly wonderful. The clock struck three when the delegates finally decided to go home.</p>
