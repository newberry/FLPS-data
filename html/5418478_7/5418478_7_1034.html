   <p>The Reverend Father Jedlicka of Chicago was the speaker for a representative group which appeared before the papal delegate Bolzano in Washington, November 21. This group was sent by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Czech Catholics) to request the papal delegate to submit to Pope Benedict XV, a memorandum in which the head of the Catholic church is informed of the needs and grievances of Catholics in Czechoslovak lands. The memorandum also contains a petition to the Holy See for aid during the future peace negotiations, when the issue of Czech liberation will be most acute.</p>
