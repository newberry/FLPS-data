   <p>Yesterday's regular meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova [Board of delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery] was called to order by the vice-chairman, Mr. Mencl, after which the minutes of the previous meeting were read and accepted without change despite the objections of Mr. Treml, which were found to be without foundation.</p>
   <p>The bills payable, presented by the financial secretary, Mr. Husak, also included the monthly salaries of forty-two workmen for the month of February. All the bills presented were ordered paid.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pecha, in presenting the reports of committees, said that he, with the other members of the board of directors, visited Mr. Hladovec, who has been ill for some time. Mr. Hladovec turned over to them papers belonging to the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov [Bohemian National Cemetery], which Mr. Hladovec had accepted for safe keeping when he was elected chairman. Mr. Hladovec expressed <span class="page-break">2</span>the hope that with the arrival of spring his health would improve, and that he would again be able to attend the meetings.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pecha announced the death of Mrs. Hladovec, who died the day before yesterday. He proposed that a letter of condolence be sent to Mr. Hladovec, and Mr. Jurka, the cashier, added that flowers also should be sent. This was put in the form of a motion, and passed with an unanimous vote.</p>
   <p>During the reading of communications, the secretary called attention to the request of the Bohemian-American Cremation Society, for the issuance of cards permitting their members to visit the crematorium when ovens are in operation.</p>
   <p>The board of directors recommended that no such issuance of admittance cards be allowed, because the Cremation Society has a membership of about two hundred and the cremation services are considered private to the families concerned. Attendance at the services is not forbidden to anyone, according to a statement made by Superintendent Tuma; but he is of the opinion that the <span class="page-break">3</span>issuance of admittance cards would lessen the authority of officials of the cemetery, and would not help in the preservation of good order. He stated that there have been instances where certain persons had to be reprimanded for unbecoming behavior at cremation services. The secretary was instructed to notify the Bohemian-American Cremation Society relative to the decision of the Cesky Narodni Hribotov.</p>
   <p>The Cesko Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) sent a letter stating that it intends to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the burning at stake of Jerome of Praha, the 28th, 29th, and 30th of May, and that part of the celebration is to be devoted to the memory of fallen Bohemian heroes fighting in the ranks of the French, Russian, and Serbian armies. Another part will be in honor of our executed martyrs in the old country, and the Alliance requested that the committees of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and the representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov work together in preparing the program for this great celebration. The representatives of Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, who were present, explained the advantages of such unified action, and explained <span class="page-break">4</span>that the celebration would not lose by working in concert. It was moved and carried to comply with this request.</p>
   <p>The Patronat Cesko-Americkych Skol (Federation of Bohemian-American Schools) is arranging a Mardi Gras and has sent ten tickets. It was agreed to sent them ten dollars worth of flowers.</p>
   <p>The committee recommends the following transfers of lots: Katerina and Florian Prochaska, a part of lot to Josef and Sofie Cihak; Ladislav and Lizzie Kucera, to Ottokar Kucera; Teresie Necas-Kuplis and Josef Kuplis, to Jan and Anna Fichter. The directorate also recommends the return of ten dollars to Mrs. Rat for her husband's lot; and seven dollars to Katerina Rafajk for a childs' lot. The requests of Frantisek Zmrhal and Frantisek Slemenda were voted down.</p>
   <p>Representative Frantisek Ciha asked for the investigation of a mistake in recording the transfer of one half of his lot to his deceased parents. His request will be granted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Mr. Frantisek Masek, Senior, has investigated the advisability of giving support to the Slovak Free School, and has recommended its financial support. It was agreed to donate ten dollars.</p>
   <p>The directorate announced that the work on the columbariums is progressing rapidly, and that they will be completed next month.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pecha requested the organization to buy the assistant bookkeeper an adding machine, and the request was granted.</p>
   <p>It was announced that representative Mr. Matej Kolar, of Lodge Vratislav, Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) had died. It was voted that flowers be sent to his home, and a committee attend his funeral.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. Masek, then read the amounts of the bonds of the new officers. These were approved, and the induction of officers followed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Mr. Pecha was re-elected chairman, and was conducted to his seat by the vice-chairman, Mr. Mencl. Mr. B. J. Vacek was elected secretary. Mr. Tomas David is the only new member of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>When the chairman brought up the subject of new business, Mr. Richter called attention to the request for support by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), which was refused. He also called attention to the good work done by that organization and said that it should be supported, and that the previous order should be reversed. Mr. Petru supported Mr. Richter in his contention; but, as no motion prevailed, this matter will be left in abeyance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hrdina made a motion that the organization meetings be held on Sunday afternoons at the cemetery, but he did not get the representatives' support.</p>
   <p>For the beautifying of graves, Josef Soukup deposited $100, and Josef Fiala deposited $200.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Josef Jurka, announced receipts of the meeting as $4,601.29, and expenditures, $3,876.94. The balance, with the cash on hand, will amount to $8,126,58. The meeting was then ajourned.</p>
