Fifteen additional men enlisted last week, four of them members of the Czech Butchers' Educational Club. They are going to depart Monday. Their friends from the Club arranged an evening for them in Jerry Vilik's place, Laflin and 18th Streets last night. That informal gathering breathed sincerity and revelled in patriotism. A collection yielded $10.50 which will be placed at the disposal of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
