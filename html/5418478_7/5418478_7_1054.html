   <p>Members of the board of the representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery assembled for an inspection tour yesterday morning in order to observe the improvements of the institution and report to the respective groups of members of the cemetery association. In view of the many useful innovations which have been incorporated, the report is expected to be a very favorable one. All the representatives but two were present, Mr. J. Hladovec being seriously ill and Dr. A. Mueller also detained.</p>
   <p>Mr. Longin Tuma, manager of the cemetery, told the representatives that the sale of cemetery lots had been brisk. New hotbeds have been constructed or are being installed. They are modern in design and of ample capacity to take care of the needs of the cemetery. A new machine shop is to be installed.</p>
   
   <p>The representatives heard Mr. Jan Pecha, president of the cemetery association, who delivered a short address in the lower hall of the crematory. "This year," he said, "was the fortieth anniversary of the foundation of the Bohemian National Cemetery. This should be the proper occasion to celebrate. However, considering the critical time and the plight of the oppressed Czech people, any festivity will be omitted. Those who helped to found the cemetery would be astonished by the size to which, the institution has expanded," Mr. Pecha continued. "The number of representatives in the board is now seventy-six--about the same number as the founders of the cemetery who now rest in its graves. Two of the original representatives have been with the cemetery for forty years. They are Messrs. Topinka and Fr. Mencl, and they have held various offices during this time." In appreciation of their services, the board intends to present each of them with a gold chain. Both spoke a few words. Mr. Mencl pointed to the antagonism shown to the budding institution at its inception.</p>
   <p>"There was, however, a tiny group of Czech Freethinkers who stood firm and created and fostered this beautiful garden for our departed. Today, forty years after the founding of the cemetery, it is an honor to belong to the body of representatives who are entrusted with the management of this cemetery, our national treasure."</p>
   <p>After these words Mr. Mencl remembered those who had given their best efforts to the cemetery, who have completed their task and now lie beneath the same soil which they helped to preserve for future generations. He closed by expressing his best wishes for the future of the cemetery which he called "the pride of the freethinking Czechs, not only of Chicago, but also of the entire American country".</p>
   <p>After the meeting and refreshments, the party inspected some recently-acquired property, and then sat down to a dinner, which was made more enjoyable by Czech national songs which Mr. Pawloff played on the piano. Mr. Pecha then rose once more to give an account of the work done during the last year. The gross income of the association was $108,000 and this sum is expected to be exceeded in the coming year, so that "in some future time the cemetery may be handling millions of dollars".....After several more speeches by representatives, it was resolved to send a floral offering from the cemetery hotbeds to the monument of Havlicek. It was to be red and white, the Czech national colors, with a ribbon attached bearing the dedication, "Pamatce Naseho Nesmrtelneho Karla Havicka Borovskeho" (In memory of our immortal Karel Havlicek-Borovsky).....</p>
   <p>The wreath was laid on the monument in Douglas Park yesterday afternoon during the Havlicek memorial celebration.</p>
