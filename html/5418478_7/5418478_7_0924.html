   <p>The Bohemian Catholics of America are doing wonders by their generosity. It is a fact proven by our schools, churches, and orphanage asylums, institutions which are scattered all over the United States. Recently, action was started to care for Czechoslovak aged men and women and young maid servants who are in need of a good Catholic Bohemian home, especially in large cities. We, at last, have our own Catholic home for aged men and women in Chicago, and we are also preparing a decent home for girls. That both these institutions are badly needed, and that our people are convinced of this fact, is proven by collections which are undertaken at every opportunity for the benefit of the Utulna Svateho Benedikta, which institution will soon be dedicated to its purpose.</p>
   <p>Just now the repair work on the property of the Utulna Svateho Benedikta has been started. The building is being thoroughly remodeled and the interior decorated. This, of course, will cost plenty of money. At the present time <span class="page-break">\2</span>there are not sufficient funds to maintain this institution, but the Utulna Svateho Benedikta depends upon our Bohemian people for financial support.</p>
   <p>Recently, the following contributions were received in behalf of the Utulna Svateho Benedikta: $500 was received from the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America). Various other contributions amounted to $58.50; total, $558.50. May the Lord reward the gifts of all the generous contributors. Additional contributions may be sent directly to the Utulna Svateho Benedikta, 1718 West 18th Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
