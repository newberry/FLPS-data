   <p>p.1--Yesterday certainly will long remain impressed on the memories of many parishioners of the Allport street church. The members of the Sv. Vaclava (St. James) Cadet Society in particular will remember it for a long time, and their parents likewise will not forget the indignity which was inflicted on their sons and through their sons on them.</p>
   <p>Yesterday about 9:30 A.M. funeral services were conducted for Jan Siply, a former member of the St. James Cadet Society. In the house of mourning at 616 South Center avenue the members of the society gathered and escorted the body to St. Procopius's Church at Eighteenth and Allport streets. Since the cadets are members of a Catholic society and the sons of Catholic parents, and they themselves profess the Catholic faith, they felt that they had free admittance to a Catholic church. But they were sadly mistaken. At the door their entrance was blocked by Father Prokop Nevzil, who declared that they could not be admitted to the church. Although the cadets know that the church was built by their parents and is maintained by their money, they did not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>wish to create a disturbance and make matters worse; so they obeyed Neuzil's orders and remained outside.</p>
   <p>However, the parishioners assembled in the church did not bear quite so calmly the affront to this popular society of Catholic youths. When the cadets were forced to leave, the people within did not choose to remain either, and they left by the other door, expressing their resentment by grumbling as they went out. The women of St. Procopius's congregation were especially indignant. The chief sexton, Mr. Turek, wishing to show that he was a loyal servant, tried to intervene, but he was severely reprimanded by the angry women, who frankly criticized the conduct of the Allport street parson and his assistants. These old parishioners, who had helped to build St. Procopius's Church with their money, and who have always contributed generously, even when the Reverend Fathers were begging for a sidewalk in front of their printing plant, audibly expressed their emphatic disapproval of this unprecedented action against the cadets. The indignity accorded to these youths affects their parents also, who certainly do not deserve such treatment at the hands of those whom they feed and maintain with the fruits of their toil.</p>

   <p>It could not be otherwise with the Allport street Benedictines. Their hatred of the St. James Cadets had its origin in the fact that the young men did not contribute to the bearded Fathers of the Allport street monastery as the Fathers ordered them to do. About two years ago the cadets held a picnic on a Sunday, for they and their friends belong to the laboring class, and they cannot take a holiday whenever they please like the Reverend Fathers of Allport street. The picnic was forbidden by an order issued from the parsonage, but the cadets held it in spite of the prohibition and made it a grand success. After the picnic the rector of the parish informed them that they were excommunicated, and that their society was no longer recognized as Catholic and would not have access to the church. But if the cadets had been willing to give half the profits of their picnic to the Reverend Fathers, all would have been forgiven. However, the young men would not let themselves be robbed; they thought that they were better able to use this honestly earned money for the good of their society, and perhaps for that of all Catholic people, than were the Benedictines. Hence the "excommunication" pronounced against the Cadets still persists, and that is the reason why they were excluded from the church yesterday.</p>

   <p>The parents of these Catholic youths find this affront to their children hard to bear. All day yesterday nothing else was talked about among the parishioners; and the ears of the Benedictines surely must have burned. We heard one old parishioner say: "They continually abuse unbelievers from their pulpits and in their newspaper; they continually incite people against Hlasatel, saying that it does harm to Catholics; but the greatest destroyers of the Catholic faith among Bohemians are the Benedictines themselves. Their arrogance and disregard of others, their selfishness and greed,--these more than anything else repel the Catholic element among Bohemians. How can Catholic parents put their sons into Catholic societies? They must always fear that they will be shamed and humiliated, as were the St. James Cadets." These words are the plain truth and are fully warranted. The acts of these queer "servants" of the Lord best show that the Benedictines really serve only their own greed, their own selfishness, and their own arrogance. But there is a limit even to the patience of our people!</p>
