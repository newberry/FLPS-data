   <p>Among the officers selected to be instructors at Camp Rockford, Illinois, is one of our Chicago Czech fellow-countrymen, Jan [John] F. Zajicek, captain in the United States Army. It is said that he is the only Czech promoted to the rank in the recently established officers' camps. He has had four years service in Uncle Sam's Navy, and studied surveying in Chicago. He re-enlisted at the entrance of the United States into the War. He studied in the schools for army engineers at Fort Leaven-worth and Fort Sheridan, from which he was mustered as a lieutenant, and was finally promoted to the captaincy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zajicek was born in Chicago, where his parents live now. Although away from Czech atmosphere for most of the time, he has remained a sincere Czech nevertheless.</p>
