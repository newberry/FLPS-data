   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Federation of Czech Catholics) has been receiving many gratifying and encouraging expressions from the foremost national workers in the old country in which the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku and the work the Svaz has been doing are recognized for the great merit earned by their activities for the Czechoslovak nation. We consider these expressions for what they are in fact, that is, a full justification of our determination to continue in the work we have started, and a confirmation that the ways and means we have been using in our work have shown results that have been of unusual benefit to our nation in general and to our Catholics in particular. Today we consider it our most pleasant duty to share with the Czech public the contents of a letter just received from the newly elected Bishop of Hradec Kralove [important industrial center in Northeast Bohemia], the successor of the unforgettable Bishop Brynych, Dr. Karel Kaspar, a man who is highly esteemed throughout <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Czechoslovak Republic and recognized as a sincere patriot. He writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"Deeply stirred by your letter and your congratulation on the occasion of my election to the office of the Bishop of Hradec Kralove, I am sending you herein an expression of my full appreciation with the assurance that I shall never forget your kindness. May I be permitted to give my thanks to the Svaz Ceskych Katoliku of America for everything that organization has done for our beloved nation and for everything it is doing now. Unable to reciprocate in any other way, I am praying to God that He man compensate you very richly.</p>
   <p>"May God compensate you also for the action you have undertaken among our Catholics in America upon the initiative of His Holiness, Pope Benedict XV on behalf of our dear Czech College in Rome. May it have God's blessing and succeed, so that our beloved country may have a worthy representation in the metropolis of all Christendom. May it educate and send into the <span class="page-break">\3</span>world many priests with childlike devotion to the Holy Church and an enthusiastic and unselfish love of our dear Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>"Bespeaking your pious prayers for myself and my office, and sending you and all yours my blessings. I am in sincere devotion,</p>
   <p>"Dr. Karel Kaspar,</p>
   <p>"Bishop of Hradec Kralove.</p>
   <p>"August 11, 1921."</p>
   <p>We want properly to appreciate these rare and gratifying expressions. We want to appreciate them because they refer to all that has been done in order that our nation may become independent and be permitted to live a life of a cultured nation, a peer amongst the best of them; in order that it may never forget that a Christian nation has the best chance for a full and successful development. An independent nation, if built upon a <span class="page-break">\4</span>Christian foundation, is on her way to prosperity and happiness. Let us never forget our origin, and may we live here in America so that our deeds and actions may always do honor to the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>Let us show our strength by building a powerful organization. Let us inspire among ourselves the love of purposeful work. There are many things requiring our immediate attention. On with the work, on to our rows! For the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku.</p>
   <p>Ant. Vaclav Tesar, office manager.</p>
