   <p>The recruiting station in the hall of the Pilsen Park Sokol (gymnastic society) will be closed next week. After this week Czech and Slovak volunteers will no longer have the opportunity, offered the earlier recruits, of serving together in the same, preponderantly Czech and Slovak, companies. The last contingent, but one, of Czech and Slovak volunteers (this is the third) left for Jefferson Barracks, Mo., last Monday. The fourth, and last, contingent will leave next Monday evening, when the Pilsen Sokol recruiting station will be closed; the group will be under the charge of Sergeants Vosatka and Kuzel, U. S. Army. Many Czech Sokols from Cedar Rapids, Ia., and Detroit, Mich., together with others from Chicago, are expected to enlist for service before Monday.</p>
   <p>From ninety to ninety-five percent of the Czech and Slovak volunteers have passed the medical examination up to now.</p>
