   <p>Yesterday's celebration in commemoration of Jan Huss was a great success, even the fine weather helping the large attendance in the Patronat Hall. All houses in the neighborhood were adorned with Bohemian flags from early morning. The celebration was opened with the speech of Mr. Weicher, then the President of Free Community introduced the Secretary,Mr. J. Novak and greeted the audience. The celebration was opened with the chorus "Volnost" and many instrumental and vocal numbers followed on the program.</p>
   <p>M. Babka in his speech opened the eyes of the audience on a bitter truth, that the male members of the "Free Community" are very indifferent freethinker problems.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was a living picture,"Funeral Pyre of Jan Huss" which met with endless applause.</p>
