   <p>Every Czech-American of military age, who is capable of bearing arms and who is without urgent family obligations is duty bound to enlist in the American Army. He should not claim exemption, but should be glad to fight the murderer of his own people, the enemy of this country to which he is strongly attached, and the foe of all mankind.</p>
   <p>In this way only can we show that the unnaturalized Czechs of this country are not alien enemies and that they do not deserve to be treated as such.</p>
   <p>Those young Czechs who have failed to take out first papers should apply for them this instant in order to clear the way for entering the American Army. This is their sacred duty if they want to be considered good sons of the Czech nation and worthy of the many benefits which America has bestowed upon  them.</p>
   
   <p>The American Army will take good care of them. Insurance will be left for their loved ones if fate should demand the supreme sacrifice.</p>
