   <p>Our readers have already been informed that the Harrison-Beseda Club was founded, which is composed of male and female pupils of Harrison High School. The president is Miss Vraz. Although only about three weeks in existence, the club numbers 140 members, more than all others, so that it is expected to become the strongest association of the school.</p>
   <p>This club presented its first entertainment yesterday afternoon, and offered a colorful and beautiful program. Several teachers were present. Czech national songs, classic dances, and select pieces of the highest type for the piano, were the main features; after refreshments were served, the party finished with a general dance.</p>
   <p>The club is intended to be a Czech club, not in name only, but in fact. We hear that its members, accompanied by the Czech teachers, will pay a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>visit to the Czechoslovak bazaar and thus unburden themselves of their national obligation. The club is preparing - as a novelty - a national dance, the "Beseda." Last night's party served to make the students of the first class acquainted with the elder ones. We wish the best of success to the young club, hoping that all of its members will pay attention to all matters concerning the Czechs, particularly to the Czech tongue, the sweet language of our parents.</p>
