   <p>The chairman called the attention of the delegates to the annual inspection of the cemetery which is to be held this Sunday. At the same time he did not forget the reporters of the Bohemian daily newspapers and invited them to attend. They all promised to be there.</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Masek, then took the floor and called attention to the significant celebration of the unveiling of the memorial plaque of Frantised B. Zdrubek and requested that a speaker be selected for this occasion. The chairman replied that the orator of the Svobodna Obec, Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, is above all others qualified to be a speaker at this celebration. The delegate, Mr. Zrust, having only the best of intentions, brought up the matter of buying a piece of land from the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and asked if any letter regarding this matter was received. Replying to the question of the chairman, the secretary and the superintendent of the cemetery stated that they had not received anything. The delegate, Mr. Vaclav Cipra, moved that the debate regarding this matter be ended. The delegate, Mr. Spousta, then asked if it was true that the wages of the men who are employed by the cemetery had been reduced by ten cents an hour. Mr. Smejkal denied that it was so, but at the same time admitted that the men who were recently hired cannot expect the same rate of pay as the men who are experienced. Mr. Spousta was satisfied with this explanation.....</p>
