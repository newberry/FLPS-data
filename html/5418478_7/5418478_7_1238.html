   <p>P. 1 - Col. 4 -- The Reverend James Vanek, recently an active worker in Baltimore and well known among his countrymen in Chicago, moved from Baltimore to this city a few days ago and will reside here permanently.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vanek's activity while in Baltimore was greatly to his credit, and doubtless the readers of our paper have read highly complimentary reports of it.</p>
   <p>For the last sixteen years he has devoted most of his time to benevolent work. He established and managed a home for immigrants, and in general his work was such that it obtained wide publicity.</p>
   <p>For some four years, we believe, Mr. Vanek was secretary of the Bohemian School Association of America.</p>

   <p>He resides at 2324 South Central Park avenue. He has purchased this building for $8,200 and will establish in it a temporary refuge for girls. Mr. Vanek's residence has fourteen spacious rooms and will be remodelled for his purposes.</p>
