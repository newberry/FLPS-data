   <p>Sixty-nine members of the Czech Sokol Legion were examined as to their physical ability in the main recruiting office yesterday, and adjudged fit. Six others were rejected for weak eye sight or bad teeth, and two for other deficiencies. This result is in proportion better than that found among recruits of other nationalities, and it decidedly reflects favorably on the constitution of the Sokol organizations. (Follows list of the enlisted men.)</p>
   <p>A number of young men reported in the branch recruiting office in the Plzen (Pilsen) district so that the group which will be sent to Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, will be considerably increased. There are some more expected to enlist today, or possibly tomorrow, either in the Pilsen distric office, or in the hall of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs on Lawndale Avenue. All those who have been enlisted in time will join <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>those going to Missouri. The Czech volunteers will travel in a reserved railroad car.</p>
   <p>Last night the names of the ships were given out to which the Illinois naval reserve is assigned. Most of the recruits from Illinois who have enlisted in the United States Navy will be embarked on the men o'war "Vermont" and "Massachusetts;" some will be sent to the Naval station in Philadelphia.</p>
