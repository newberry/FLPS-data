   <p>Architect A. Charvat's lawsuit against the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) ended abruptly and unexpectedly yesterday. The plaintiff asked for the dismissal of the jury in order to prevent the dismissal of his case and thus the definite loss of his suit.....</p>
   <p>The case may be called again in the next court calendar, but this can not happen for another year and a half. From a purely legal point of view the outcome is a decided victory for the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov.....</p>
