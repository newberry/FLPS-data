   <p>We have arrived again at the annual celebration of Czechoslovak independence-- the 28th of October! Who of us could pass by that day without directing his memories into the past, recalling to mind the end of a three-hundred-year-old yoke, of which the termination four years ago was accompanied by a cry wafted from Sumava to the Tatry Mountains: We are free!</p>
   <p>It was a great day indeed, which will forever be remembered not only by our people at home but also by us--the Bohemian Catholics of America. For we labored hard to make Czechoslovakia free--to create a republic. During the few years of Czechoslovak independence we notice that the nation has not been idle, for the results already accomplished are in themselves proof of a knowledge of the meaning of freedom. And we have the best of hopes that the inner life of the people will develop calmly, and that there will be a continuance in the building up of the Czechoslovak state, in which everybody will feel at home, where there will be no development of party interests which would be deleterious to the freedom of the country as a whole; in short, we hope that all the people of Czechoslovakia will be like one happy family. Where there is sufficient love of country, there can be no talk of obstacles and difficulties. This day we are in spirit in our native homeland and rejoice with the nation! The Bohemian Catholics of America are aware of the greatness of this day and will preserve that awareness. They will do more; they will endeavor to transmit the love, which they cherish for their great and dear Czechoslovak nation and their dear mother tongue to their own children that have been born to them in this new world.</p>
   <p>This day is a milestone in our [national] life, a milestone at which we stop to render thanks to God for His manifold mercies and for His gift of freedom, praying to Him that He may bless that golden Czechoslovak land. And as before, so on this day, too, we call upon our saintly prince, St. Wenceslaus:</p>
   <p>"....Do not let us and our progeny perish!"</p>
