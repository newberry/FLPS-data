   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association) was called to order by the chairman, Mr. John Pecha, at 8 P. M. sharp. Mr. V. Filip then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved without correction. The reading of bills followed. In its letter the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America) asks the Sbor to buy several admission tickets for a celebration held July 3 and for which admission tickets were enclosed. Apparently the letter was delayed because the said celebration was held last Monday. The Grand Lodge of the Czecho-Slavonic Union announced a new delegate, Mr. Joseph Dudera, in the place of Mr. Anton Ondracek, who at the present time is visiting Czechoslovakia. In regard to the erection of additional building, it was decided to wait. The delegate, Mr. Smejkal, explained the matter concerning Mr. E. Beranek's bequest and delivered a check for the sum of two thousand dollars. This sum is the share of the Sbor from the bequest of the above-mentioned countryman. The burning question--to buy or not to buy--a question which was the cause of <span class="page-break">\2</span>hot debates in several previous meetings, was decided last night by a vote. It was decided not to buy. As it is known to our readers the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova was asked to buy a piece of land called Spice (The Point), owned by the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). By yesterday's vote and upon the recommendation of the board of directors of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova, which did not recommend the purchase, a matter which stirred up many angry arguments in the meetings of both associations, was closed.</p>
   <p>Receipts during the past month amounted to $35,324.22; cash on hand from last month, $27,733.82; total,$63,058.04. Expenditures were $38,290.18; cash on hand, $24,767.86.</p>
   <p>During the month of June twenty-one lots were sold for a total of $4,532; there were four cremations and one hundred and sixteen burials.</p>
