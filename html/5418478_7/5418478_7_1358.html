   <p>Dr. V. Anyz, a well-known Bohemian doctor in Chicago, who for several months was active as a member of a relief mission sent to Siberia by the American Red Cross, returned to Chicago last week.</p>
   <p>Dr. V. Anyz, who is well known to our Bohemian public, returned to the United States richer in numerous and interesting experiences. From his experiences he related: "Our mission to Siberia was not a collective expedition led by a fixed leader. Everybody traveled independently. This we could notice after our arrival in Vladivostok, where our work was assigned to each of us separately. Before our voyage to Vladivostok, the following doctors met in San Francisco, California: Doctors Cepelka, Jicinsky, and Anyz from Chicago, Dr. Sedlacek from Omaha, Nebr., Dr. Davis from Ottawa, Kans., and Mr. Davis, a pharmacist, from Idaho. There was <span class="page-break">2</span>also a group of fourteen graduate nurses, of whom not one was of Bohemian origin.".....</p>
