   <p>"The following cablegram was just received: 'Dr. J. F. Smetanka appointed consul for Chicago.'</p>

   <p>This report that at last we will have our own consul in Chicago is joyful news to our countrymen. That we were longing for this event is known to everybody from the reports in our newspapers. His appointment is that much more welcome to us, because a man of great ability, and a man who devoted himself so much to our national cause was appointed to this important office. Therefore it is with great pleasure that we take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Smetanka, and we are sure that this selection will prove to be of great benefit to our young republic and to our countrymen who reside here.</p>
   <p>The location of the new consulate and the time when our new consul will take up his duties will be officially announced later. Once more we extend our sincere congratulations!</p>
