   <p>Confidence in the previous activities of the Czech National Alliance was expressed in a resolution passed in yesterday's session of the C.S.P.S. (Cesko Slovansky Podporujici Spolek--Czecho-Slav Aid Society). The members of the brotherhood are called on to do everything in their power, no matter how heavy the sacrifice, for the liberation of the motherland. Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, our leader, was elected honorary member. Much work was also done on the bylaws,so that the delegates hope to finish [their task] in today's session if unexpected obstacles do not arise.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened at 9 A.M. by Mr. Vojtisek. After the reading of last session's minutes one of the outside communications occupied the special attention of the assembly. It was a request from Vek Rozumu (The Age of Reason), a New York publication which promulgates the Free Thought tenets. The magazine was recommended to the members, and Brother Here suggested that a sum of money be appropriated for its support. This was granted.</p>
   <p>The committee on organization reported in favor of establishing organizers for grand lodges and also for smaller bodies, in order to help increase the membership, [They recommended as follows:]</p>
   <p>"The organizers should be paid by the lodges themselves. In case of need, the National Grand Lodge might help out."</p>
   <p>"It was explained that organizers working for the entire brotherhood would not be a practical institution if engaged as regular workers. The proposition was left to the individual lodges.</p>
   
   <p>Brother Ptak , chairman of the committee on bylaws proposed a new article to the effect that a member who has given wrong information regarding his age or other circumstances should lose the right to his death benefit, and that the same penalty should be imposed on inebriates or drug addicts. Such a restrictive measure is particularly necessary in prohibition States, where alcoholism, addiction to morphine, and similar vices are becoming rampant.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session began at 2 P.M.....The finance committee submitted its report. The books of the National Grand Lodge were declared to be in the best of order. The members who took part in the rally are to be reimbursed in the total amount of $2,942.52. Mr. Tlusty, chairman of the Grand Lodge, will receive for his generous co-operation $250; Mrs. Beranek, stenographer, $30; Mr. Soukup, assistant to the secretary, $30; supervisors of the hall $30; guards $20; and a manager $10.</p>
   <p>The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani (Center of Higher Education) is to be asked for co-operation in the schools of our youth associations in preserving Czech national consciousness in the minds of our adolescent [compatriots].</p>
   <p>Brother Machacek read the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"We, the delegates of the Union of the Czecho-Slav Aid Societies in the United States, assembled in the sixteenth rally, opened August 25, 1918, in the City of Chicago, Illinois, in recognition of the invaluable service, tireless activity, and able leadership of Professor Thomas G. Masaryk in this most momentous struggle for the historic rights of the Czech nation, headed by the Czechoslovak National Council, proclaim our leader an honorary member of our beloved brotherhood, the Union of Czecho-Slav Aid Societies. A copy of this resolution shall be engrossed and sent to Professor T. G. Masaryk."</p>
   <p>The following flamboyant resolution from the pen of Brother A.H. Zicha of New York was passed by the delegates, who rose from their seats in token of approval:</p>
   
   <p>"We, the delegates of the United C.S.P.S. Aid Societies.....</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The armies of the democracies, in a struggle unparalleled in history are battling for the two most important ideals of mankind, the preservation of liberty and the right of small nations to return to an independent national life; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Czech nation, the rights and the spirit of which the Hapsburg dynasty tried to destroy by any criminal means whatsoever during a three-hundred-year-old struggle, was accorded by the Allied governments the right to perfect independence, so that today for the first time since the fateful battle on the Bila Hora (White Mountain) the Czech nation may envisage with fond hopes and firm belief an independent national existence; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The American branch of the Czechoslovak nation, conscious of the century-old oppression and suffering of their people and conscious of their national heritage and of the principles of freedom governing our new homeland, at the echo of the first shot in this greatest battle of democracy against autocracy rallied under the banner of the Czech National Alliance, concentrating upon it all its energies and moral and material aid for the fulfillment of the Czech nation's three-hundred-year-old hopes and longings; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We are fully aware of the fact that the Czech National Alliance has perfectly attained the purposes of its highly important task, in which all the endeavor and activities of Czech life in America are reflected, [namely], the movement for the liberation of the old homeland, that revolutionary action which has fought with acknowledged success its way into the forum of the world; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That this conference now express its high appreciation to the Czech National Alliance and to the Slovak League of their successful work, and that it also voice its esteem for our Czechoslovak Army, together with Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, its head, and extend its cordial wishes for victory in the battle for our common cause; and be it further</p>
   
   <p>"Resolved, That this conference appeal to our people and emphasize most sincerely that it is the duty of every true Czech man or woman to become a member of the Alliance, to give to it vigorous support, and to render any service whatever to promote our sacred war for Czech liberty and independence, with willingness to sacrifice all our resources, our blood, and our lives,for that should be their guiding spirit in the drive toward our goal.</p>
   <p>"All members of our brotherhood will make it a point of honor to adhere to this pledge. Our national patriotic duty calls on all able-bodied sons of our nation to take arms against our sworn enemy. Join the Czechoslovak Army and help in the struggle for the liberation of Czechoslovak lands!</p>
   <p>"Let us reward the courage and the heroism of those who are shedding their blood and giving their lives that the liberty of mankind may not perish from the earth, that we may win our battle for the sublime rights of mankind, and that the banner of liberty may wave over our Czech motherland."</p>
   
   <p>The conference resolved to send expressions of gratitude to former President Theodore Roosevelt for his gift to the Czechoslovak, Army in Siberia and to the Governments of Great Britain, France, and Italy for their recognition of the independence of our old homeland.</p>
   <p>The Organ Bratrstva (organ of the Brotherhood) will be printed by the Narodni Tiskarna (Bohemian National Printing Company) in Chicago for $318 per 10,000 and $1.90 for every additional hundred copies.</p>
   <p>More resolutions in favor of the Sokol organizations were recommended:</p>
   <p>1) In towns without any Sokol groups but with a Czech school pupils should be instructed in the rudiments of Sokol drill and brought up in the Sokol spirit;</p>
   <p>2) Brotherhoods owning their own halls should as far as possible place them at the disposal of Sokol organizations;</p>
   
   <p>3) Wherever a brotherhood maintains a school, classes should be timed so as to give pupils an opportunity to attend Sokol drills; and</p>
   <p>4) The editors of the Organ of the Brotherhood should be ordered to give some space to these matters from time to time.</p>
   <p>These recommendations were approved and will be referred to the next National Grand Lodge. An amended proposition on the merging of all the brotherhoods was read:</p>
   <p>"The sixteenth conference of the C.S.P.S. aid societies well recognizes the advantages and benefits accruing from the consolidation of all Free Thought brotherhoods in the United States and Canada. All lodges wishing to join the merger are urged not to hesitate but to get into contact either with the committee appointed in this conference or with the offices of the National Grand Lodge of the C.S.P.S., and to take these steps immediately. After an answer in the affirmative is received, the lodges should place the question before the members in the form of a referendum. After the vote has decided for the merger, each lodge should employ an accountant who will calculate the financial standing of the group, the average ages, and other details, so that the financial status, or even the existence, of the lodge shall not be endangered. A convention of elected representatives is to follow. Points of discussion will be: 1) the structure of the statues for the merger; 2) a uniform chart for payments; 3) sickness and accident tables; 4) the establishment of death benefit rates; 5) the fixing of an amount for the emergency reserve fund; and 6) the drafting of various other regulations vital for the prosperous existence of the new combination of brotherhoods.</p>
   <p>Documents and exhibits shall be sent the State commissioner for approval. The costs of the transactions pertaining to the unification shall be borne by the uniting brotherhoods and imposed in proportion to their numerical strength. The committee elected and entrusted with the agenda connected with the unification shall remain in office until the magnificent idea becomes a reality. The law demands a majority of two thirds of the votes of the delegates present at this rally before the merger is legalized. The same law applies to the votes of members within individual lodges."</p>
   <p>The delegates were ready to vote on these recommendations but postponed their decision in order that the proposition might be printed first. The voting is expected to take place today.</p>
   <p>Before the session was declared closed, the committee on resolutions presented the telegram which [the convention] had voted to send to former President Theodore Roosevelt:</p>
   <p>"We, the delegates of....have unanimously resolved to express to you our most sincere gratitude for the splendid donation to the Czechoslovak Army and for your appreciation of its heroism in the battle for civilization and democracy."</p>
   <p>The committee on bylaws recommended a large number of amendments, mostly of secondary importance, which were accepted. The progress made by this committee is ample proof of the tireless zeal with which it is handling its problems. Other committees are also hard at work, so that there is no doubt that all their reports will be put before the assembled delegates at today's session.</p>
