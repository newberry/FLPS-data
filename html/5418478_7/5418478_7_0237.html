   <p>The second sane celebration of the Fourth of July in Chicago belongs to history. Notwithstanding the intense heat, large numbers of people appeared on Michigan Avenue, and the streets through which the parade moved were so crowded that the most conservative estimates place the number of spectators at two hundred thousand. Seventeen nationalities were represented in the parade, which was estimated at three miles in length and moved along Michigan Avenue from Twenty-sixth Street, portraying the patriotism of people who have chosen this country as their new homeland. Five thousand persons, Sokols, Germans, and other turners, musicians, women, and children, marched in the parade. Naturally, the allegorical floats aroused the greatest interest, and even though today's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>English newspapers did not mention it, as for example the Record-Herald, which did not mention the Bohemian section of the parade at all, the spectators recognized the Bohemian float as one of the most beautiful.</p>
   <p>It was 10:30 A. M.when the parade began to move down Michigan Avenue from Twenty-sixth Street. It was received with stormy applause from the people crowded on the walks along the entire course. Leading the parade was Judge Michael Girten, as chief marshal, surrounded by a magnificent staff. Following behind the band was another no less resplendent group. It was the marshal of the Bohemian section, Mr. John Cervenka with his staff. The Bohemian float aroused general admiration. It was greeted noisily, as were also the mounted Sokols and the ambulant section of the parade. We regret very much that because of lack of space we cannot describe everything in such a manner as the parade deserves, but we must say that it was a fortunate idea to outfit the Bohemian float in the way it was outfitted.</p>

   <p>Then followed the other floats and groups in accordance with the program which was previously published, and we gladly admit that this year all of the floats were magnificently arranged, and more suitable to the idea than they were last year.</p>
   <p>Our ladies "tagging" for the Bohemian Charitable Association, energetically and tirelessly followed the parade, heroically braving sunstroke, decorated hundreds upon hundreds of the spectators the Tag Day emblem, a red heart. Since we saw the same sort of activity on the streets of Bohemian communities and in the parks, we expect that the Fourth of July this year was a generous day financially for the Bohemian Charitable Association, and we wish it that such should be the case, for the Association is deserving of support.</p>

   <p>In Douglas Park</p>
   <p>Never before, perhaps, has such a multitude of Czech people assembled in Douglas Park as the one gathered there yesterday for the celebration of the Fourth of July. It is to be pitied that on account of diverse small accidents, the program could not be presented in its entirety. The simple drills, for instance, had to be omitted for lack of time. The beginning of the festivities was scheduled for 4 P. M., but many had arrived at 2 P. M., already supposing that this was the time for the start. They crowded in and filled the pavilion to its capacity. The musicians, under Mr. Rubringer's direction, were on time at 4 P. M. sharp, and began with some exquisite pieces: A medley of National airs, selections from "Prodana Nevesta" (The Bartered Bride), and opera by B. Smetana; "Poet and Peasant" by Suppe, etc.</p>
   <p>Former alderman Mr. Derpa in his oration, proclaimed the day's festivities <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>to be the beginning of a new era of the Fourth of July celebrations in the very spirit of the founders of this republic. He made mention of the splendid showing of the Czechs in the great festival parade. "Their group," he said, "was the most colorful and, the most interesting section. It presented a gratifying example of the Czech populations' love for this new fatherland."</p>
   <p>Mr. Jar. Psenka, editor of the Denni Hlasatel, in his address, urged the Czech part of the audience to continue to celebrate Independence Day for the further growth of the glory of the American banner, which in its colors so closely resembles our own Czech flag. The speaker impressed upon the audience the importance of the duties they owed as citizens to the republic which has given them privileges and liberty.</p>
   <p>Both orators during their addresses were exposed to the penetrating rays <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the sun, which shone upon the platform mercilessly. Reason enough for having reduced their speeches to a necessary minimum.</p>
   <p>There were to have followed several national dances. But not a trace could be seen of the dancers, and not a word heard. This caused considerable embarrassment to Mr. Charles Vopicka, a member of the committee, who found himself alone. The musicians, as it is known, keep strictly to their union hours, they never play one minute longer. One hour of suspense passed before the dancers arrived. It was as late as 5:30 P. M. before the group was ready to begin with the ballet from "The Bartered Bride," but the crowd was amply rewarded for their patience. The graceful movements of the dancers combined with the colorful costumes were a treat for sore eyes. At six o'clock, the national dance, "Beseda," was to be danced, but the musicians refused to play on. Finally, Mr. Rubringer and his first cornet player were <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>persuaded to play the "Beseda," which was danced in two columns only. The Americans in the audience gave repeated expression of their delight over the melodious music, and the resiliency of the young bodies of the dancing girls and boys who so perfectly timed their motions to the music. Meantime, thirty members of the Sokol, assigned to the performance of the gymnastic exhibition had arrived. The musicians, however, declined any request for further playing, so there was no drill exhibition. This closed the festivities, at which Congressman Sabath was one of the most enthusiastic visitors.</p>
   <p>In Svatopluk Cech Park</p>
   <p>In park number three, or as we have become accustomed to say Svatopluk Cech Park, the afternoon festivities were carried on by a large number of participants, and it was our sokols with their drills who made the program <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>interesting. Men and women sokols from Sokol Slavske and pupils of the same Unity, together with members of the Fuegner-Tyrs Circuit, performed joint exercises. Needless to say that the Sokols received a great deal of applause for each of their beautiful and smoothly executed performances. Not the least interesting were the lantern pictures showing the spectators the various happenings in the history of this country.</p>
   <p>An ingenius festive speech, having reference to the significance of the Fourth of July to the American people and setting forth the significance of a quiet, dignified celebration of the Declaration of Independence, was delivered in Bohemian by Mr. William Kolacek, president of the West Parks Commissioners. He also read the constitution of the United States.</p>
   <p>A band under the direction of Mr. Jech participated in the celebration and played a number of famous compositions.</p>
