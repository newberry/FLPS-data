   <p>P.1--The subordinate lodges of the Bohemian American Foresters sent their delegates to the fifth convention of this benevolent association, so that they would consult and resolve upon everything which they recognize as advantageous to the membership. Forty-two delegates, men and women, sent by twenty-nine subordinate ladges, met yesterday in the Sokol Chicago hall on Kedzie Ave. The start of the convention was set for nine o'clock, but because all the delegates were not present at that time, it was decided to postpone the start until nine-thirty o'clock. The convention was brought to order, by the chief-forester of the Grand-lodge, Mr. Joseph F. Pelant, with the following words: "Esteemed brothers and sisters! With this day our duty, to work for the good of the Bohemian-American Foresters, has arrived. Our work will have importance not only for us, but also, for the <span class="page-break">2</span>whole Bohemian public and especially, for our descendants. Therefore, it is necessary that we act calmly, prudently, and with true brotherly and sisterly helpfulness. Before I proclaim the convention as officially opened, I shall permit myself to appaint a credentials committee. I also want to remind you, that there is present a representative of a newspaper a reporter from the Denni Hlasatel, was present at the convention) and because we will take up many important matters, it depends upon you, whether you care to have a representative of the press present. So far as I am concerned, I think it would be only right. We are not dealing with anything which should be kept a secret; therefore, let the public know about our proceedings."</p>
   <p>Delegate Joseph A. Smejkal, moved, that newspaper representatives be permitted to attend the convention. The motion was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>The chairman then appointed a credentials committee of the following named delegates: Joseph Bidlas, from Sumava lodge No. 9, Anton Blaha, from Klacel lodge No. 3, and John Pyskacka, from Pilsen lodge No. 12.</p>
   <p>The committee began it's work without delay and it was found that the dele <span class="page-break">3</span>gates of all lodges were present, with the following exceptions, John Sedlacek, of Bohemian Lion lodge No. 1, his place was taken by an alternate, Mr. Heinderich; James Schmidt, of Klacel lodge No. 3, alternate Frank Bobek; Stephan Bradace, of Bila Hora lodge No. 7, alternate Frank Cisar; and Anton Tysl, of Jiri Podebradsky lodge No. 10, alternate James Kus.</p>
   <p>After the credentials of the delegates had been accepted, the chief-forester Mr. Pelant, once more urged upon the delegates the honest performance of their duties, and expressing the hope that capable men and women had been selected to attend the convention, brought the convention to order.</p>
   <p>The chief-forester requested the secretary to read the minutes of the last convention which was held on Jan. 10, 1907. The secretary read the voluminous protocol which was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>The chairman requested the secretary to make his report. He reported the passing of the ardently active members John Havla, John Polanka, Frank Vytlacil and Matthew Kalina.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Called on by the chief-forester to rise, the assembly paid respect to the departed. The secretary then proceeded with the reading of his report and the delegates learned that although the organization progressed, it had not accomplished what was expected of it in the future. Especially the year 1907, after the financial crisis of that period, was unfavorable to the organization, but still the membership increased. The year of 1909, in turn, was much more promising at the very start, and the activities of the members also, in so far as the securing of new members, were more intensive.</p>
   <p>The 5th of December 1909, was the tenth anniversary since the Order of Bohemian Foresters came into existence. In his report the secretary complained, that our wives and daughters do not enroll in the numbers that they should. He said, that out of 1,950 members in good standing in the organization, only 90 are women. He said, it was regretable, that the wives of our members join foreign lodges and don't take warning, even when they are forced to resort to court proceedings in order to satisfy their claims for death-benefits. Sundry recommendations also were made by the secretary. In the first place, he asked for considerable and suitable readjustments of the dues schedule.</p>

   <p>The election of convention officers followed next in order. It was moved and passed, to nominate by acclamation and to elect by ballot. John Budilovsky was elected chairman and John J. Zahrobsky, became vice-chairman. The convention chairman thanked the delegates for their confidence and assured them, that he would not betray it. The vice-chairman expressed himself likewise and both took over their offices with a loud "Na Zdar."</p>
   <p>The morning session was brought to a close and the chairman adjourned the convention till 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
