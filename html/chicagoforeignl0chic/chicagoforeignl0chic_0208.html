      <p>December 1, 1926, will be memorable day in the life of our Slovenian
women. On that date the Slovenian Women's Society opens its branch in
Chicago. Not long ago our people just laughed at the idea of their
women being organized and show men's activity. It seems to be a very
hard job for our men to imagine their wives taking part in social and
cultural life, of our people. So, our women got out from their kitchens
and are new active in the colony's affairs.</p>
      <p>On that day at 8 P. M. the first meeting was held in the premises of our
school. On this occasion over 35 members signed applications.</p>
      <p>You should see the joy on their faces. The board of directors has been
elected and will consist of: President, Mrs. Fannie Jazbec; Secretary,
Mrs. Majda Brishar; Treasurer. Mrs. Jennie Stayer.</p>
      <p>Decision has been passed that on day of December 19, they will call mass
meeting on which should be invited all women from our colony in Chicago
and vicinity. Rules and regulations of this society as well as plans for
future work will be worked out at the next meeting.</p>
