      <p>Progressive Slovene Fraternal Benefit Societies in this country today,
among which the Slovene National Benefit Society is the largest, are the
work of pioneer Socialists, who had foresight, men who realized that
the workers are left to shift for themselves and are exploited on every
hand unless they are strongly organized. Therefore the Socialists were
pioneering the ground for the unions, for the cooperative movement,
for educational work and at the same time were fighting for old age
pensions and other types of social insurance.</p>
      <p>That was the work they were doing thirty years ago. At that time private 
insurance companies were the only type of insurance companies in
the field. Socialists realized at that time that private insurance
companies were in the field to reap as much profits for their owners
as possible. Today it is well known that they are a legalized racket.</p>

      <p>To the Jugoslav Socialist Federation and its official publication, Proletarec, 
we owe a debt of gratitude for the noble work it has been
carrying on among the old generation of Slovenes in America and the
American-born Slovenes for over three decades in the political, economic
and industrial fields.</p>
