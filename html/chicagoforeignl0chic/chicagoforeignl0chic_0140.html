      <p>The Slovenian Library in Chicago organized by the Socialist Club No. 1, has become 
more and more popular and can be considered as a public institution of high 
value. The management of this library does not spare efforts nor money in order
to fill its shelves with books, magazines, periodicals, etc., printed in the
Slovenian language. The greatest part of this reading material is ordered from
Lubljana, Jugoslavia.</p>
      <p>The library also has a large selection of books and periodicals printed in English
for those who know or want to learn English thoroughly. It is true that our
people help this institution, especially since we know that the fees are as low
as $.15 per month.</p>
      <p>The library is open every evening from 7:30 to 9 P.M., and is located at 1830 S.
Center Street on the premises of the Croatian Library.</p>
