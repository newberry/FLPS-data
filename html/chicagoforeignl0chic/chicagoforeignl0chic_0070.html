      <p>The American Socialist movement has great cause to send its heartiest 
fraternal greetings to Proletarec in its 30th year of publication.</p>
      <p>Through Proletarec the Socialist Party of the United States of America
greets the Jugoslave comrades who ahve shown such a great spirit of self-sacrifice, enthusiasm, devlotion and loyalty to the Socialist cause. In
a movement where sacrifices on the part of members are everywhere prevalent, it is still necessary to point out the special sacrifices made
by the pioneers who founded Proletarec and kept it alive until it could stand on its own feet.</p>
      <p>The struggles of Proletarec reflected the struggles of the American-born Socialists to keep their organization alive in spite of war, post-war
prosecutions, the insanity of Communist splits, and then the complacency of prosperity.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, the American movement is now coming of age and is throwing off the defeatism which its years of retreat brought.</p>
      <p>During 1934 more new recruits were taken into Socialist ranks than any
other year since 19<span class="gap">[gap]</span>, with the exception of national campaign year 1932.</p>
      <p>More pamphlets and leaflets were distributed, more radio speeches were given, more outstanding speakers ranted, and more organizers toured
than in any other comparable years since the war.</p>
      <p>The American movement which for a long while had to lean heavily upon the arms of the foreign comrades, now is able to strike out ahead on its own strength and responsibility. Only five short years ago the foreign language federation of the party included fifty-five percent
of its membership. Today the foreign language federations have increased
<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
their members, but because of a much greater increase in the English-speaking ranks 
the foreign language federations represent only 18% of the Socialist Party's total membership.</p>
      <p>The party has three times as large a proportion of industrial workers in its ranks as the country as a whole. Increasingly, the farmers of
America are becoming interested in Socialism and enrolling under the 
Socialist banner. The outstanding work done by the party in the defense 
of the union strikers of Ohio and in the organization and defense of the 
sharecroppers organized in the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union have been
outstanding instances of the party's farm work.</p>
      <p>The party is on the road to success. With the splendid cooperation that
the Jugoslav comrades have shown, with the heroic team work on the part
of the thousands of new recruits that have come into the movement in
the past few years, we will have in America Socialism in our time.</p>
