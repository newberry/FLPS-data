      <p>This year's issue of the May Herald is a jubilee number, dedicated to the 30th anniversary of our weekly, Proletarec.</p>
      <p>This occasion is rare, because very few Socialist paper were able to struggle along for such a length of time. Our paper succeeded. Now it goes into its fourth decade, young in its inspiration, full of pep and
with determination to continue its battle for the interest of the workers.</p>
      <p>Proletarec has witnessed a great number of publications succumb. Foreign language groups of the Socialist movement, with few exceptions, lost ground and some disappeared.</p>
      <p>The Slovenes, who are one of the smallest nationalities in thsi country and who in teh period after the war constituted 90% of the membership 
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
in the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, are relatively the strongest foreign language section in the American Socialist movement. Only the 
Finnish Federation could show a better picture than ours. After the 
World War the American Socialist Party was completely destroyed in many localities. Our branches then replaced the Socialist Party for 
a few years in quite a few places, especially in Western Pennsylvania, Michigan, Northern Minnesota, Western Ohio, and even in Cleveland and
Detroid, until the general movement was revived.</p>
      <p>It was not our ambition to play this leading part. This siutation affected our movement rather in a very harmful way, because the bulk
of the membership was discouraged. If Americans don't care, why should "we spent our money and time" inquired many of our comrades.</p>
      <p>Here and there an American branch was established. Our comrades thought that they would be an encouragement to them, but instead they asked for
support, mostly financial support.</p>
      <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
      <p>This situation gradually discouraged a great number of our members, who 
then became passive or even withdrew from the movement. Others continued with their work, believing in the historical mission of the Socialist 
movement so much that they would not resign from the task under any circumstances.</p>
      <p>Beside the Finns there is no other nationality in America in which the 
Socialist movement, proportionately, is as firmly established as in ours. That is the result of the 30-year work of our branches and their
paper, Proletarec. In conclusion, let it be stated that we always worked for the unity of the labor movement. Our task is to help build a Socialist 
movement, not quarreling factions. This is the purpose Proletarec and our federation are serving. We are in battle for a bigger and better Socialist
party, for building the Socialist press. This was the aim of Proletarec 30 years ago. It still is and it will be until our final victory.</p>
