      <p>It came as a big surprise to people who know how hard it is to unite us
Slavs, but it is the truth that in South Chicago we Slovenes and Croats
work shoulder to shoulder.</p>
      <p>As a result of such harmony, just a few weeks ago in South Chicago we
opened a new school, which has already about 250 children enrolled. If
only our people come to their senses and forget their political, religious 
and national differences, this cooperation can be found in other ways, as 
economics and education.</p>
      <p>This example can be followed by other colonies, for the benefit of their
members. Why our children must travel so far to their schools, as has been
the case with children in South Chicago, who made daily trips to Calumet
City, or must enroll in a Catholic school, where religion is the major
subject.</p>
