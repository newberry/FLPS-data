      <p>The Slovenian Section 28th International Eucharistic Congress in Chicago
held a meeting on July 22nd in the School Hall of St. Stjefan. More than
300 representatives from numberless Slovenian colonies in America were
present.</p>
      <p>The chairman of this Section, Rev. K. Zakrajshek, opened the meeting
with a selected speech, in which he openly accused our Slovenian
clergy of being selfish and of exploiting the church for their own
purposes. "These priestsâ€˜ attitude," he said, "will rain good relationship 
and respect toward church leaders and cease religious feelings
in their parishes."</p>
      <p>He advises all clergyman to pay more attention to the economic life
of their church members; work on their welfare, education, etc., and
bear in mind that the members of the church are already overcharged
with assessments. The church must be a place for peace of mind, not
for political or financial activities.</p>
