      <p>All over the world, except Russia, exists the most bitter economic and industrial depression in the history of mankind. Millions of workers have become
victims of want in lands of abundant foodstuffs and all other needs.</p>
      <p>In the United States alone, approximately 10,000,000 workers have no employment.
Our governing powers make as adequate measures for relief as the situation
grows worse. Primary elections of the Republican and Democratic parties again
oonfirm the belief that politicians were not concerned about the vital issue
of unemployment that is driving the people to desperation and starvation. Their
object was to get elected by exposing their opponents to graft, corruption, and 
showing what bitter enemies they were to the working class.</p>
      <p>It is the old traditional game of mud-slinging; but when a third party arises,
both Republican and Democratic parties unite under a camouflage of non-partisanship and fight desperately against any movement of the working class.</p>
      <p>Within the next few weeks presidential candidates for the Fall election will be
nominated. Every effort will be made to get the support of the people for the
crooked politicians. Huge sums of money will be squandered for campaign purposes.
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
Some candidates spend ten times more money to get elected then the salary brings.
What is the purpose of this mad scramble for office?</p>
      <p>Surely these would-be friends of labor are not going to serve the interests of the
people who contribute for the people who contribute nothing to their campaign
chests, but instead will support their financial backers for the large donations
and personal interests. This has proved to be a fact time and again; and when
the great mass of workers lose patience with one administration, they flock to
support the other. Due to their inability to see, they do not realize that both
the old parties are owned and oontroled by the capitalist class.</p>
      <p>It is futile to hope for anything better while they are at the helm.</p>
      <p>"Of all times, this is one time when every American Socialist should be on the
job, building socialist circulation, socialist organization", said a columnist
in the American Guardian not long ago.</p>
      <p>We can not stress too highly this important work for our movement. In the midst
of all misery and hardship that people must suffer under capitalism, they are
today more willing to listen to our message; and the need is greater than ever
<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
for such work in the coming elections.</p>
      <p>In some states the Socialist party is not a legal party, because laws have been
enacted which demand an outrageous percentage of votes to get on the ballot.
This is another burden we must overcome. Petitions signed by citizens who did
not vote at primary elections are the only read open for us. Each and every

comrade will be called upon by the party to join this army of solicitors.</p>
      <p>With the cooperation of all, we look forward to a new society to replace the

present broken down regime, which benefits the few while millions of workers

are left to look out for themselves. We will not only accomplish our goal, but

demonstrate an impressive demand upon the money lords that the people are well

aware of who are responsible for the existing conditions.</p>
      <p>Branches of J.S.F. will also find plenty to do in the next few months. Several

of our comrades in different states have been nominated on the Socialist ticket.</p>
      <p>Plans will have to be arranged for public meetings and speakers.

Circulars and leaflets will have to be distributed to call the attention of workers
to our cause. Every comrade - yes, the young folks too, must volunteer for

<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
this duty and help carry on the work. Victory for our cause will not be handed to us. We must organize, plan our campaign, and bring the issues to the

public.</p>
      <p>Socialist victories in Milwaukee, West Allis, Racine and other cities in Wisconsin 

were by no means easy to attain. Opponents, financed by business enterprises, 
the powerful press, representing the interests of capitalists. the radio.

and all other agencies, used by politicians to uphold the system to benefit

their masters, waged a bitter battle against the common people.</p>
      <p>This is a fine example of what can be done and must be done to bring about a

change in the society that will be of, for and by the working class.</p>
      <p>The present system of capitalism will destroy itself just as feudalism and chattel slavery passed out of existence, and a higher social order will take its

place. Only through effective political and industrial organization of all

people can we hasten its extinction. Comrades, let's face this task squarely,

do our duty so that we may have and enjoy Socialism in our time.</p>
      <p>Let's rally under its banners and join hands with the workers in the great cause

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
for the cooperative commonwealth. On this May-Day let us rejoice over what

has already been accomplished. and renew our enthusiasm for our work until the

goal is reached.</p>
