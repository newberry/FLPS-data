      <p>The last winter season in Chicago was very joyful. Concerts, carnivals,
bazaars, and all kinds of entertainment took place.</p>
      <p>The Catholic Dramatic Club of Chicago is especially showing great activity, 
and each time when some of our societies decide to hold a meeting
or amuse the public, the Catholic Dramatic Club gladly accepts the invitation.</p>
      <p>We are requested by the management of the above named club to inform
our societies that in case any of them desire to select their own play,
it will be played by club members under one condition: That the society
send a request and the name of the play in written form to the secretary 
of the Catholic Dramatic Club, Mr. Ludurg Skaja, 2118 W. 21 st Pl.</p>

      <p>They also advise giving the club at least two weeks time in order to
rehearse the play and be ready for a performance. We have also informed that the present staff of players is not (large) enough to cover some
of the plays and we, with all our hearts, recommend those of our young girls and boys, who feel able to play, to enroll in the club immediately.
It really will be a pity for all of us if such a big colony as Chicago's,
with thousands of our people, would not be able to supply the necessary
number of players and (thus) handicap the activities of this most important organization.d</p>
