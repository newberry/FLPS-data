      <p>The Slovenian colony in Chicago is growing surprising fast. For the last few months more than 100 new families have settled. The reason is the lack of opportunity for new and young generations in small towns. Chicago, with its vast industries, offers an excellent chance for ambitious young persons. Old Slovenian people, of course, feel badly in new surroundings and find it very hard to adjust themselves, being mine workers practically all their life.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian colony has good schools, recreation ahlls, etc. All this provides for good life.</p>
