   <p>Ludvig Brandt, a 26-year-old Norwegian, the former editor of Dag Bladet, was recently arrested on the charge of issuing checks without funds.</p>
   <p>When Dr. Howe heard of this, he brought three returned checks to the station, one for twenty-five and two for seventy-five dollars. He claimed he had not issued any of these checks, but that the signatures were so well done that he hardly could tell that they were false. He had proof that Brandt had cashed these checks. After some questioning, Brandt confessed that he had signed the checks and cashed them. He was held to the Grand Jury.</p>
