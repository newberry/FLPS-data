   <p>It is a great honor and a pleasure to give my views on this gala occasion [the Seventeenth of May]. While we were not all born beneath the same skies, or under the protection of the same flag, we are now members of the same great national household; we rejoice in a common citizenship and in the progress and prosperity of a common country.</p>
   <p>Many of you were born in far-off Norway and came here of your own choice, seeking a larger opportunity than that which your own country affords. Many of you were born here; but whether you came into this world in Norway or beneath the Stars and Stripes, you have a profound love for our common land and a desire to advance its welfare and its honor.</p>
   <p>I congratulate you upon what the Norwegians in America have accomplished, and I congratulate you also upon what they are doing in the upbuilding of our institutions. We have no better blood than that which flows in their veins. The rugged citizenship of the sons and daughters of the land of Ericson and Nansen and Amundsen has always been welcome to our shores. They have never failed to give a good account of themselves in every walk of activity where honorable deeds are to be done and where either the honors of peace or the glories of war are to be achieved.</p>
   <p>Our citizenship is drawn from all lands. We have all nationalities and all tongues among us, co-operating together in advancing our national interests. While they have a love for the country of their nativity, they have a larger admiration and affection for the country of their adoption. There is no country in the world which has a more cosmopolitan population, or where those who have come from distant lands are reaping more abundantly the rewards of honest industry. Many millions of the best men and women from distant lands are here to make their homes and add to the strength and glory of the Republic.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians are among the best type of citizens in the Republic. They are essentially a home-loving and country-loving people. They are, in fact, home builders of the best type, and, therefore, in the best sense they are nation builders. Those who have a passion for the home have an undying love for the Republic. There can be no love of country in the best sense where there is no love of home. The American home is, in the final analysis, the foundation of the Republic--home, where all of the tenderest memories center and whence all of the gentlest influences radiate.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians are inspired by the spirit of liberty--that spirit which actuated our fathers in the early days when the foundations of the Republic's institutions were laid; and they are firm believers in the virtue of our political fabric. They understand full well the purpose for which it was ordained, and they realize fully what it has cost in devotion and sacrifice. They realize also that it must be preserved from the polluting touch of selfishness, and that it must be held true to the principles for the perpetuation of which it was created. They are peace-loving and prefer the rewards which come from the cultivation of the manifold arts of peaceful industry; yet, they are ever ready to offer their services upon the sacrificial altar in every serious hour of the Republic. No one surpasses them in the sublimity of their devotion to their country's cause, either in the calm of peace or in the storm of war.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians appreciate fully the fact that in a republic liberty rests upon law. They stand for the enactment of good laws and for their faithful observance. They recognize no authority above the law, and understand full well that the permanency of American political institutions and the largest possible measure of wholesome individual and national progress depends upon the maintenance of the supremacy of the law. We must cultivate a widespread recognition of the fact that our laws must be enforced against all who violate them, no matter whether they are of high or low degree. The laws are made for all, and all must be compelled with impartiality to obey them. No one--neither individual nor corporate--can be allowed to defy the laws of the land without bringing them into contempt and shaking the popular confidence in the virtue and strength of the government. It goes without saying that the laws should be well considered and enacted with the highest wisdom; yet we have seen much evidence to convince us that such has not always been the course pursued. We have seen hysteria occasionally usurping the deliberate and better judgment of legislators. The laws should always be the expression of the well-seasoned judgment of the lawmakers of the land. They should be written into the statutes without fear and without favor.</p>
   <p>There is an old saying, with which we are all familiar, that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty". It is well to keep this simple truth before our minds at all times. Everyone who is interested in the future of his country should take an intelligent and active interest in the consideration and solution of all questions which affect our common interests. Safety lies in the largest observation of this truth, and danger rests in the disregard of it. Every man should do his own thinking; he should never consent that others should do it for him. He should give to every question of public moment the best thought that is within him, to the end that the solution may be a just one. It is one of the most gratifying features of our republican system that men may exercise their political judgment in the light of their own conscience with the utmost freedom, and this privilege should not be surrendered by indifference. The man who will sell his vote to another is not worthy of his American citizenship. The man who will not exercise the voting privilege when the opportunity affords is an enemy of the Republic, and is not worthy to enjoy its privileges.</p>
   <p>We hear much of fraud, corruption, and crime of all sorts, and some are filled with doubt and apprehension as to the future. There is a wide-prevailing spirit of unrest. To many the times seem to be sadly out of joint, but fortunately there is an aroused public conscience, and there is a widespread demand that the wrongdoers shall be brought to punishment. The popular demand is, to quote an utterance of General Grant, "Let no guilty man escape".</p>
   <p>Over against the wrongs of which so much mention is made in the public press and elsewhere, we observe the many and mighty forces organized to make people better. We see upon every hand most abundant evidence that there are more societies and people, in their individual or collective capacity, than ever before at work in the field of education and in the organization of charities, in an effort to uplift and make better the mass of countrymen. And I pause to observe that there are no people who take more intelligent thought of improving the conditions of their friends and neighbors than the Norwegians. Their charities and their benevolences are generally recognized. They have a regard for their kind. They are not consumed by narrow selfishness, but, on the contrary, their sympathies are as broad as are the needs of their fellows.</p>
   <p>With our rapidly increasing population, with the expansion of our industrial centers, and with the growth of our commerce, new questions arise which were unfamiliar to our fathers. Each new day brings problems peculiar to itself. We must meet them and solve them for ourselves. While they are dissimilar to many in the past, we bring to their solution those principles of justice and liberty by which our feet have been thus far guided in our national career. A question of continuing importance in the increasing complexity of our industrial and social development is the great question of men's proper relation to their fellowmen. In the mighty rush for wealth and power, for place and prestige, too many disregard their duties and obligations to others. We must have a care to safeguard the rights of all--the humblest as well as the greatest. That government is a failure and a mockery which does not reach out its strong arm and afford protection to all who owe it allegiance, with absolute impartiality.</p>
   <p>Government is ordained to preserve the rights of men and promote justice among them. When these supreme things are secured to all conditions of men, it fulfills its destiny, and it will win general respect; otherwise, it fails of it purpose and will earn and receive general contempt. We must have a care to avoid the evils which sapped the virtue of other peoples in the past. Wealth rightly accumulated and power properly gained and justly used are sources of national strength, but otherwise they are menaces and dangerous elements of weakness. Power is too often perverted either by weak or ambitious men; it should, of course, be held within wholesome restraint. It was well said of the mighty Lincoln that although he possessed almost absolute power, he never abused it except upon the side of mercy.</p>
   <p>Our country is advancing with enormous strides in every field of activity. It it going forward with a swiftness that is almost bewildering. All agencies in every avenue of effort are straining to the utmost to accomplish larger things.</p>
   
   <p>Our country has assumed a position of vast importance in the affairs of the world. Our political institutions are studied by other peoples as never before. Our manners and customs are attracting more and more attention in other lands. What we do has its influence far beyond the limits of our shores. The United States is throwing the weight of its influence more and more and more on the side of peace. We believe that as the world becomes more enlightened, there is less reason for an appeal to the sword in the adjustment of international differences. We have all read with inexpressible appreciation and thorough approval the recent address of former President Roosevelt at Christiania. It was a powerful utterance in favor of progress in the way of preserving international peace. We believe that the United States must exercise a tremendous influence in the future on the side of the world's tranquillity. Our relation to the nations of the world is such that no one can rightfully question the integrity of our purpose. We have no desire to extend our territorial limits or to encroach upon the right of other powers. We are not consumed by envy towards or jealousy of our sister nations. We wish them all the utmost possible measure of success in the working out of their respective destinies. We covet nothing more earnestly than their good will.</p>
   
   <p>I have no doubt that you will contribute your full share to the solution of the questions which agitate the public mind today, and which will arise in the future, bearing upon our common interests. Let us vie with each other in the effort and purpose to make our citizenship all that it should be, and out country all that it was designed by our fathers that it should become. We have mighty tasks before us. Let us bring to their performance the utmost zeal and the most exalted purpose.</p>
