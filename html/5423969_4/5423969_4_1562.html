   <p>The recent action of your board, granting the request and thus conspiciously honoring the memory of the early discoverer of America, was a step in the direction of establishing in the minds of all a memory of the country's early history that has gladdened the hearts of multitudes of people, and earned your board lasting gratitude.</p>
