   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Club gave a Christmas festival last Saturday. The festival opened as M. Pedersen's orchestra marched into the main hall, followed by 120 ladies and gentlemen. After marching around the hall, the guests were seated, and a real Norwegian Christmas dinner was served. The hall was, at the time, lighted only by a number of small Christmas trees placed on the banquet table. When the guests were comfortably seated, the flood lights were turned on, and the orchestra played the old familiar Christmas hymn, "Silent Night".</p>
   <p>The president, Mr. William Gerner bid the guests welcome. Mr. Olaf Bernts, the main speaker of the evening, spoke about Christmas and what it meant to the Norwegian people who were far from home.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. G. Lindwall spoke for the Norwegian Club. Senator Niels Juul [Dane] proposed a toast for "United Scandinavia," after which the Danish national <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hymn was sung by the guests. Other speakers of note were: Mr. J. G. Giaver, T. O. Rahen, Dr. Thomas Warloe, Mr. M. Kirkeby, T. Thorstensen, and Anders Hummeland.</p>
