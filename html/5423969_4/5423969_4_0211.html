   <p>The Northwestern Women's Federation's Members are active for Uncle Sam. They are very much interested in the Red Cross work and contribute their time every day of the week. Of late the Red Cross branch has also undertaken the work of registering Norwegian women willing to do work for the government; hundreds of women have offered their services.</p>
   <p>Next Thursday the Federation will hold a patriotic meeting at the Chicago Norwegian Club. One of the best known of the city's attorneys, Charles Darrow, will be the speaker of the evening.</p>
