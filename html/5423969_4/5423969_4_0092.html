   <p>The Norwegian Old People's Home celebrated its tenth anniversary last Tuesday in Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>The Reverend I. II. Meyer opened the proceedings with a prayer. Dr. Quales then spoke briefly, giving a resume of the activities of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society. H. A. Haugan insisted that the Home be controlled by some church or religious group. To this Dr. Anders Doe replied that as long as the Norwegian church in America indulged in factional fights, this proposal was out of the question. Dr. Doe pointed out that whenever the time came that the prelates of the Norwegian church thought only of the welfare of the church and not of petty personal differences, then this might be done.</p>
