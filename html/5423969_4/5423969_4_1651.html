   <p>The Norwegian National Association is a central organization embracing the Norwegian societies and clubs in Chicago, and every society belonging under the Association is represented by two delegates. There is nothing in the statutes prohibiting outsider from being present at the meetings, and every member belonging to some one or other of the Societies under the Association will therefore have the right to be present at the regular meetings of this Association, unless the latter have decided to consider certain matters in secret session.</p>
   <p>The Association meets on the first Monday in January, March, July, September, and November. The next meeting of the Association will be held tomorrow, February 29, at Sleipner Hall, Fairfield Avenue, near North Avenue.</p>
