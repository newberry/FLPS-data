   <p>The Society for the Norwegian Home for the Aged held its quarterly business meeting last Tuesday evening at Wicker Park English Lutheran Church. Dr. N. T. Quales functioned as chairman, and Mr. John Blegen as secretary.....</p>
   <p>The secretary read the report from the last annual meeting; the report was accepted. The president, Dr. N. T. Quales, presented the following report:</p>
   <p>"To the Society for the Norwegian Home for the Aged, meeting for quarterly conference:</p>
   <p>"Three months have elapsed since our annual meeting was held. At that meeting extensive reports were presented by the officials of the Society concerning the various branches of our work.</p>
   <p>"These reports have been printed and published in pamphlet form, and I assume <span class="page-break">\2</span>that most of the members of our Society have received copies.</p>
   <p>"At the annual meeting it was resolved that the board of directors publish the annual report in case this could be done without expense to the Society. Such publication of the report has been made, and our Society owes thanks to Mr. John x for accomplishing this.</p>
   <p>"What we have to report today concerns matters that have occurred since the annual meeting, and such a report will, for the most part, contain repetitions of everyday doings, something which rarely is of much interest. And yet, even in these everyday occurrences may be contained much to rejoice at, much to be grateful for. Among such gratifying matters may be mentioned the fact that the work of our Society is carried forward without friction; that interest in the Society is kept alive; that the membership is not only holding its own, but is increasing in several branches; that the membership fee is being regularly paid; that the Young Ladies Aid Society is steadily increasing its membership and promises to become a valuable adjunct to the Society; that the <span class="page-break">\3</span>state of health among the aged at the Home is good--no case of death has occurred since the annual meeting; that the debt of the Society has been decreased, etc.</p>
   <p>"All of this is gratifying and something to rejoice at. On the other hand, it must not be forgotten, however, that as day is added to day and year to year, the aged ones at the Home become weaker; their helplessness increases so that greater attention to their needs is required. As a result the responsibility becomes greater and the burden involved in carrying on the work becomes heavier. These are facts which ought to convince everybody that at the Home for the Aged we are indeed carrying on a work of love and mercy.</p>
   <p>"Since the annual meeting three additional residents have been accepted at the Home....The total number at the Home is now thirty, and at the time we have space for but a small additional number. Four new rooms have been added to the Home making it far more convenient and cozy than before. The <span class="page-break">\4</span>aged ones at the Home are, therefore, also very well satisfied with conditions.</p>
   <p>"Since the details concerning the various phases of our work will be presented in the reports by the secretary and the treasurer, I shall not discuss them. I shall merely mention that the annual expenses connected with the Home amount to about $2,500. To meet these expenses we have membership fees amounting to about $1,000; also income from a piece of property on Erie Street, amounting to about $200, a total regular income per year of $1,200. The remaining $1,300 must be provided in other ways. It is evident from this that vigorous efforts must be made to increase our membership, and I am convinced that this can be done if we try seriously.</p>
   <p>"The remainder required last year was raised through picnics, bazaars, etc., and these have invariably proven successful both socially and financially. We have also this year decided to hold our annual picnic on <span class="page-break">\5</span>the grounds of the Home....in August.....Similarly we have arranged for our annual bazaar at Schoenhofen's Hall, November 5-10, and we feel confident that the results will be as satisfactory this year as last.</p>
   <p>"With this,we recommend the Home to the support of all kind-hearted Norwegians in Chicago."</p>
