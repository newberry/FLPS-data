   <p>The Trinity Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged was in charge of the Society's bazaar on Wednesday evening. The attendance was larger than it had been on previous evenings.... The proceeds amounted to $202.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Helland, the superintendent of the Home, visited the bazaar with most of the aged residents of the Home. The aged visitors seemed to have "become quite young" for the occasion, and it was evident that they enjoyed the visit very much.</p>
