   <p>There was quite a disturbance at the last membership meeting of the Chicago Norwegian Club. Someone proposed to change the name from Chicago Norske Club to The Chicago Norwegian Club. The argument waxed hot and heavy for a time, until a motion was made that the name remain as it is. We cannot see what difference it would make either way. The Chicago Norwegian Club is an exact translation of the Norwegian name. Well, they must have something to fight about.</p>
