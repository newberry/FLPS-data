   <p>Mr. Morins Kirkeby, who recently returned from an extended vacation tour through Norway, has been appointed, by Wm. Gerner, president of the "Norske Klub" (Norwegian Club), chairman of the finance committee. The efforts of this committee are, at present, centered on raising funds for the proposed club building to be erected in the near future, presumably in the Logan Square district. This clubhouse will be a real center for our Norwegian colony.</p>
