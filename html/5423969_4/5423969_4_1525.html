   <p>We are told that it costs only fifty cents to get your first citizenship paper. You can take it out any time and you need no witness. Your final citizen's paper is entirely free, but you must have witnesses that will testify that you have been in the United States for five years, and there must be two years between your between your first and your final paper.</p>
   <p>People who came to the United States before they were eighteen only need the final paper, but they must have been in the country for five years and they must also bring witnesses.</p>
