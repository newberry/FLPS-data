   <p>To kidnap a child or a youth is, in the general opinion, one of the most serious crimes, but this attitude of the people has not found expression in our laws. In some of the states it is a far greater crime under the law to steal an ox or a horse than to kidnap a child. Illinois is one of the states in which the criminal law is most adequate in this regard, but even here the punishment is not heavy enough. He who abducts a child under twelve years of age may be given a sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor; but if the abducted child is over twelve years of age, the most severe punishment is imprisonment for five years at hard labor and a fine of one thousand dollars. It is evident that there is no just proportion between the crime and its punishment in this case.</p>

   <p>The legislature will convene next month, and it should pass definite and sufficiently severe laws for this type of crime. The recent success of kidnapers in Omaha will tempt others to try, and we may well expect to hear of numerous kidnapings in various parts of the country.</p>
   <p>In order to check such a dangerous crime epidemic at the very start, the legislatures in the various states ought to make kidnaping a crime to be punished with death.</p>
