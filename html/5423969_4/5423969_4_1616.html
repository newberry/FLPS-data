   <p>At its last meeting the Norwegian National Association passed a resolution censuring member bodies which hold private festivals on occasions when the Association is putting on a city-wide celebration, such as May 17 and Leif Erikson Day. The resolution was due to the action of The Chicago Norwegian Club, which not only held a private festival on May 17 but invited the League's speakers to attend. It is the object of the Norwegian National Association to promote harmony and co-operation between all Norwegian Americans of Chicago and vicinity. Arranging competitive banquets and programs is anything but conducive to harmony.</p>
   <p>The Association is now fully in harness for raising funds for the gift to Norway in 1914, and its committee is headed by L. C. Grundeland. The gift will be a fund to be used as the Norwegian authorities think best.</p>
