   <p>The committee selected to arrange a historic lecture in English for children on the Seventeenth of May has unanimously invited Reverend B. E. Bergesen to give the lecture. Reverend Bergesen recently gave a lecture on Norway before the Geographic Society in Washington, D. C., and was therefore considered particularly well qualified for the task. At a later meeting Reverend Bergesen promised to give the lecture, and he was instructed to communicate with suitable sources in Norway in order to obtain appropriate historical pictures with which to illustrate the lecture.</p>
   <p>The committee has rented Wicker Park Hall and instructed Dr. Nannestad to seek the assistance of the Norwegian Singing Society.</p>
