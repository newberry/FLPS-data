   <p>When the news of Roald Amundsen's discovery of the South Pole reached the Chicago Norwegian Colony, there was great rejoicing, especially in the Chicago Norwegian Club. The Club sent a telegram to Amundsen at Hobart [Tasmania], as follows:</p>
   <p>"Amundsen, Hobart:</p>
   <p>"Hurra [Hurrah]</p>
   <p>"Chicago Norske Klub".</p>
   <p>A few minutes later another telegram was sent; this time to King Haakon, reading as follows:</p>
   <p>"King Haakon, Christiania: Congratulations to Your Majesty and through <span class="page-break">\2</span>you to the Norwegian nation on the glorious achievement of our illustrious countryman, Captain Roald Amundsen. Every Norwegian -American rejoices.</p>
   <p>"Chicago Norske Klub."</p>
   <p>Yes, the Norwegians in Chicago were wild and jubilant. When Norwegians met they would raise their hats and exclaim, "Congratulations for Amundsen!"</p>
