   <p>The press has rendered this community a great service by its vigorous war on grand jury boodlers. If it has come to pass that the fountainhead of justice has been polluted and the voice of public prosecution silenced by corruption, the last barrier protecting society from the organized onslaught of criminals and public plunderers, masquerading as public servants has been removed.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the grave charges preferred by our contemporary press will be speedily and thoroughly investigated by a special grand jury. The grand jury system has proved its usefulness. It is all the more important that its absolute integrity should be preserved while it is still retained as a part of the wheels of justice.</p>
