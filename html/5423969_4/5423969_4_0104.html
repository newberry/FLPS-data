   <p>To the Members of The Norwegian Tabitha Society: I beg to inform the members of the Tabitha Society that the special meeting of the Society for the purpose of electing a nominating committee, announced in Skandinaven to take place on the coming Sunday, is not being called by the officials of the Society or its board of directors, who, according to the Society's constitution, is the sole agency having the right to call a special meeting. A nominations committee was elected at the last annual meeting and later vacancies filled in the manner prescribed by the Society's constitution. This nominations committee thus legally constituted is now busy executing its official duties in nominating candidates for officials to be elected at the coming annual meeting.</p>
   <p>G. A. Torrison</p>
   <p>President of the Board of Directors.</p>
