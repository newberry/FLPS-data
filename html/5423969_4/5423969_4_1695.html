   <p>At a fish dinner given by the Norwegian National League a few days ago, codfish was served, naturally, because cod is Norway's national fish. Most of the guests were served cod heads--which, by the way, were not on the menu. This caused a great deal of dissatisfaction. One of the guests arose to move that the League be called "The Cod Head Club," and Mr. Mathiesen promised that if the name were changed he would have a standing order for cod heads at Newfoundland.</p>
   <p>E. Iversen, who presided, said that when he received a postal card telling that he had been elected president, he believed that he was chosen because they considered him the biggest "cod head". A proposal was made to elect Ole Stensland fish inspector; P. J. Hoffstad, fish photographer; A. H. Nordahl, timekeeper; A. Mathiesen, fish head inspector; and Dr. Lindos, fish doctor.</p>
   <p>An important decision was made when King Oscar, Kaiser Wilhelm, and King Christian were made honorary members. There is sometimes much truth in a joke.</p>
   <p>It was finally decided to have a codfish dinner on the first Thursday of each month.</p>
