   <p>The business at the employment office of the Norwegian National Association has been steadily increasing since its start eleven months ago. The office is open every day from 8:00 o'clock in the morning till 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon. It is located at 897 West North Avenue near Fairfax Avenue.</p>
   <p>Since the opening of the office 1,429 applications for work have been made; of these more than one half have received a position; about one-hundred temporary employment. Many requests have come from the farmer districts for help on the farm, and about forty have been sent from the office.</p>
   <p>The applicants are not required to make any down payment at the time of applying, but of course an institution such as the employment office needs income to defray its expenses. At the time for annual report, complete and specific report will be made public. Every day there is evidence that the help rendered by the office both to employer and employee is being appreciated.</p>
