   <p>The Employment Office of the Norwegian National Association reports that during the three months from April 1, 345 people have applied for work, and work was found for 178 of them. Of these, only 62 people have paid any fee for the assistance extended them. The result is that the office is being run at a loss. This loss, however is becoming less each month, so one may hope that in the near future the office may become self-supporting. In the meanwhile, the Norwegian National Association is paying the deficit.</p>
