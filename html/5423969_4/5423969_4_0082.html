   <p>The Trinity Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held a pleasant meeting last Monday evening at the home of Mrs. H. Johnson...Membership fees amounting to $10.50 were paid. Mr. Meonard Undem was received as a new member. The candidates for the board of directors, nominated at the previous meeting, resigned in order that a new election could be held. The hope was expressed that Mr. A. Petersen would accept re-election to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The resignation of nominees was accepted and a new election was held with the result that Mr. A. Petersen was elected for three years; Mr. A. K. Malum was elected for one year; Mr. C. Nelson was elected treasurer for the Trinity Branch... The suggested new building for the Home was discussed; it is to be further studied at the Home Society's annual meeting next Friday in the Trinity Church. All the members of the Branch were urged to be present at this meeting to take part in the decision and thus shoulder a part of the responsibility for this undertaking so important to the Home....</p>
