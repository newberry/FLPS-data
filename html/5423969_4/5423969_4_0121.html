   <p>The Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged held its annual meeting last Monday evening at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Anda, 901 North Albany Avenue. Reverend L. Harrisville opened the meeting with a prayer. The reports from the Home were favorable, as usual. Mr. Olaf Anda imparted the information coming from the board of directors that the Society is now free from debt... Since, however, it has been found that old people applying for admission to the Home could not very well be accepted because of the lack of accomodations, Mr. Anda urged that strong efforts be made to raise money for the enlargement of the Home.</p>
   <p>It was voted unanimously to send a letter of thanks to Mr. Charles Franz, 941 Kimball Avenue, for his singing at the evening entertainment by the Branch during the bazaar at Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
