   <p>The time has come to restore real Americanism at home. During the war we had some of those wonderful two-hundred-percenters who were holier than the rest of us. We could name a committee composed of such two-hundred-percenters to arrange for a Fourth of July celebration, and they would not permit us to read the Declaration of Independence. That is not Americanism. Some of them took the position and said they wanted a law to forbid the use of any other language than English in the church, the school, and the newspaper. That is ridiculous and absurd. Can't a man fight equally well regardless of what language he uses. When the boys went over there, they didn't go to a tongue-lashing contest, and if they had, we suppose they could call each other names equally well in German and Norwegian as in English. We happen to know the Norwegian language; we know that we have some mighty strong swear words in Norwegian, and we suppose you have equally effective words in German and French.</p>

   <p>But there is a serious side to this question. Who was it that felled the forests, cleared the fields, and made this country blossom like a rose? Who was it that built the homes, the churches, and schoolhouses, if you please? It was father and mother, grandfather and grandmother, the pioneers who led the way and took the heavy brunt of the battle by the sweat of their brows. Now they are old, their hair is gray; some of them have gone beyond. Those who are still with us have few pleasures left. They like to go to church and hear the Gospel preached in the language they best understand; they like to read the news in the papers they have been in the habit of reading, and they like to see their little grandchildren toddle up to their knees in the evening to lisp a few words that please them best in the language they love so well.</p>
   <p>Does Americanism demand that we turn our hearts into stone and say to father and mother and to our grandparents: "We are smarter than you now; we want a law to forbid you to use the language you like to use!" That is not Americanism. It is Intolerance.</p>

   <p>England has given us many good things, and for all she has given us, we are grateful, indeed. But let us not be silly! England alone is not the mother of America. All the nations of Europe and Africa are the mothers of America. England, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Africa--each and all sent us the best in brain and in brawn and in spirit; in literature, in music, in song, and in poetry; in ideals and in home life; they sent all that our forefathers had struggled for in generations past, and brought it over here and placed it on the sacred altar of American citizenship in order that here there would arise a citizen who should combine the wisdom and the virtues of all the nations.</p>
   <p>We should live together in peace and friendship; we should solve our problems under the doctrine of brotherhood. This is the Americanism we preach, not the doctrine of hatred, but the gospel of love among us all. We need it in this period of reconstruction. It will make a better and nobler America. Every American should be able to speak English, but the more languages he knows, the better for him and the better for this coantry.</p>
