   <p>The Norwegian National Association, composed of delegates representing a majority of the Norwegian organizations of Chicago, is being severely criticized for its distribution of funds. Funds accumulated are distributed to various organizations at the end of each year, and this year's allotments included one hundred dollars to the Norwegian Ski Club to rebuild the trestle of the slide at Cary, Illinois, and fifty dollars to the Orphanage at Edison Park. It does seem that the criticism is justified when one considers that the larger donation is given for the convenience and enjoyment of a few while only half the amount is given an institution where homeless orphans are given a chance for their future. One would possibly have been less severe in censuring the Association if the ski hill had been in Chicago and the clubhouse accessible to more people instead of at Cary, Illinois, and accessible to only a few. The Orphanage, on the other hand, is the most worthy organization in the Chicago Norwegian Colony <span class="page-break">\2</span>and certainly deserves more generous support than a sports spot owned and utilized by a small group of adults who should and could finance their own private enjoyment.</p>
