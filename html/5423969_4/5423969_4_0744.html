   <p>The Bethlehem congregation (United Norwegian Lutheran Church) has sold its old church building at Center Avenue and Huron Street to the Catholic Bishop of Chicago. Plans for a new church, to be erected at Springfield Avenue and Iowa Street, are complete, and construction will begin in two weeks. The new pastor, Reverend H. J. Holman, will arrive in Chicago in October, from Slater, Iowa, where he has been the pastor for several years.</p>
   <p>The old church was built in 1871 and is one of Chicago's oldest Norwegian churches. It now meets the same fate as the old Trinity Church on Grand Avenue; both buildings are now the property of the Catholic church.</p>
   <p>This is a characteristic of our countrymen; they build and develop a community, then go away, pioneering in new fields.</p>
