   <p>A petition is being circulated protesting the building of the elevated. The petition asks those involved, especially the Civic Council, to "come down to earth and stay there."</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians, especially the Danes around Lake and Peoria, Lake and Kinzie, and Lake and Milwaukee, are the main objectors. [Translator's note:-- The Danes and Norwegians living in the district along Milwaukee Avenue from Lake Street to Chicago Avenue, believed that the "L" would lover real-estate values. The same thing occurred along Bake Street, out they did not get sufficient signatures. On the South Side, the people compromised and agreed on condition that the "L" should be built in the alley between Wabash and State; therefore it was called the "Alley 'L'. "Later the Scandinavians along Milwaukee Avenue regretted the petition, but it was too late--the new franchise had been voted on in the City Council, the line to run west, where the Metropolitan "L" now is located.</p>
   
   <p>The original franchise specified that the "L" run along Milwaukee Avenue to Chicago Avenue, later to be extended to what was then called Armitage Road.</p>
   <p>Every original franchise issued in Chicago was contested by the people. Some believed that the trains would fall into the street; others that the locomotives then used would set fire to the wooden buildings along the right of way. Many such reasons were given to justify the petitions.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians also, in many cases, fought "Baron" Yerkes' cable cars, primarily because of the numerous accidents and delays.]</p>
