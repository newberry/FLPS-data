   <p>The Womens Federation of the American Red Cross held its regular monthly meeting at the Ohlsen and Hall Building, 3224 Altgeld Street, last Monday. Our Red Cross work has been very successful; we make sweaters, stockings, and bandages. There is always a representative at the Altgeld address, and we give instructions in making bandages and other necessities for the use of our boys at the front. The bandage division will work in the Norwegian Club every Wednesday under the direction of Mrs. Astrid Mygdal and Mrs. Ella Juul.</p>
