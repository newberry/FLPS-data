   <p>The Zion Norwegian Lutheran Church at Potomac and Artesian Avenues, has been sold to the Jewish congregation, Synagogue Israel, for $20,000. This church, in its present form, is only 12 years old, though the Zion Lutheran congregation has had its church home at this location for 20 years. The site of the new church has not been decided upon, as there is some talk of consolidation with another church. Zion has over 400 members.</p>
