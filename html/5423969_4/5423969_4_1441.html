   <p>Recently, large pieces of real estate have changed hands in the Scandinavian colony which runs from Halsted Street to Robey Street, and from Indiana (Grand Avenue) Street to Armitage Road.</p>
   <p>Several corners have been sold by E. Dreier, the most prominent Dane in the colony, for sums as high as $150,000.</p>
   <p>Around Humboldt Park, lots are being sold by the hundreds to Scandinavians. Humboldt Park, no doubt, will soon become the main Scandinavian colony.</p>
