   <p>The Women's Division of the Memorial Committee met Tuesday, Jan. 7, at the home of Mrs. William Gerner, president of the Division, to discuss ways and means of raising their share of the funds. A committee, consisting of Mrs. Gullixen, Mrs. Ellexson, and Mrs. Jacob Hansen, was appointed to call on various church organizations. Mrs. Thy and Mrs. Malmstrom were delegated to call on the Women's aid societies in all the churches. Quite a number of coin books and memorial stamps have already been distributed, and it is expected that when their distribution throughout churches and women's organizations, is completed, the division will be well on its way to a successful finish of the campaign.</p>
   <p>The idea of using memorial stamps originated with the Illinois Women's Division, and it is being enthusiastically received by women's committees in every state where such divisions have been organized.</p>
