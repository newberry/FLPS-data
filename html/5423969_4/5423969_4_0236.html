   <p>Mrs. A. Hansen who has been at the poor-house at Dunning for more than a year has come to Chicago to visit friends. She complains that the food at Dunning is poor, and so she came to old friends on a visit to get a taste of some good food again.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hansen came from Christiania, Norway, and is 86 years old. Her husband died ten years ago. She has been in American thirty-six years and has no children or other relatives. In spite of her advanced age she is healthy and vigorous, but cannot do heavy labor.</p>
   <p>During her husband's protracted illness she provided for him and herself by sewing at a tailoring shop. Now her eyes are dimmed, and, in addition her hearing is poor.</p>
   <p>She requests that her compatriots in Chicago come to her aid in a small way so that on her return to the poor-house she might have a few pennies to spend as needed or as she might choose.</p>
