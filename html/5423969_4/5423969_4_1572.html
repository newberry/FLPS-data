   <p>The Red Cross Division of the Norwegian Women's Federation has done great work. The Division had to move from its office at 3224 Altgeld St., and has obtained temporary quarters in the neighboring house, 3226 Altgeld St.</p>
   <p>Here a very vigorous work is carried on, and everybody is invited to lend a hand. Mrs. Niels Juul, the wife of our congressman, and Mrs. Astrid Mygdal will direct this work. Both these ladies are trained in hospital service, and the staff of the Norwegian American Hospital will assist one day a week.</p>
