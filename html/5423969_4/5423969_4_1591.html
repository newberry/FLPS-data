   <p>The Norwegian National League held its regular annual meeting at Kedzie Hall last Monday evening. The President, L. C. Grundelund, presided. Reports were given by several committees.</p>
   <p>The employment office reported that it had received 3,133 applications during 1913, 2,240 from men and 893 from women, and that 342 men and 448 women were "placed" in Chicago, while 204 men and 41 women were "placed" outside the city. The financial report of the employment office showed an income of $1,230.09, expenses amounting to $1,864.12, and a deficit of $634.03.</p>
   <p>The manager of the employment office reported that the farmers were well satisfied with workers sent by the office. The sum of $371.83 had been received from various farmers for workers' railroad fares; the office had used $328.83 of this amount. The workers were supposed to pay the fares to the office but this was not always done. The books show that $402.33 had been used for fares, but that only $318.95 had been returned.</p>
   <p>The auditing committee reported that for 1913, the League had a total income of $3,317.85, expenses amounting to $1,487.60, and hence a balance, as of January 1, 1914, of $1,830.25.</p>
   <p>The question of a Norwegian national park was discussed. It was reported that the sentiment for such a park was growing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grundelund said that he would decline any office to which he might be nominated because private business prevented him from giving his time to the League. John Zimmerman was elected president. Thirty-six lodges, societies, and clubs were members of the National League in 1913.</p>
