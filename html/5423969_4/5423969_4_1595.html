   <p>A new society has been organized in Chicago: The Chicago Norwegian Students' Society. The Society is patterned after the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish societies that have always been so successful in Scandinavia. The group that assembled to discuss this idea included the most active members of the Scandinavian colony. They met in Kaffistova [an old Norwegian restaurant on North Avenue].</p>
   <p>Dr. Anders Doe, who was elected chairman for the evening, spoke for the University of Christiania. There were several other speakers on the program. The new executive board will consist of Dr. B. Meyer, president; Olaf Bernts, secretary; Ivar Wessel, vice-president; our old friend Ivar Doe was elected to an honorary membership by acclamation.
