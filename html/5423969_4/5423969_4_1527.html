   <p>The Scandinavian colony has begun to move westward. From its inception, it grew rapidly in the neighborhood of Indiana Street and Milwaukee Avenue; but because property values are at a standstill and business is poor, the colony now moves to the west. The section around Humboldt Park, from Ashland to California Avenues, and from Indiana Street to Armitage Road, seems to catch the fancy of Scandinavians. The section around North and Western Avenues is already a well-developed business district.</p>
