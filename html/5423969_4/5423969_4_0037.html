   <p>On Saturday afternoon, September 4, there was another festival at the Norwegian Home for the Aged, in Norwood Park. This time it was the old people who arranged the social. The board of directors and other invited friends came by the two o'clock train, and soon the whole gathering was led to the large dining hall, where tables heavily laden with delicious food were ready for the guests. In spite of the large number present, there was room for all.</p>
   <p>It is the custom for the aged people at the Home to hold a festival for the board of directors every fall, but this year the festival had special significance. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Olsen, 517 North Hoyne Avenue, have recently returned from their tour to Norway, and Mrs. Olsen, who is president of the Ladies' Aid Society, was greeted with especially great enthusiasm....</p>
