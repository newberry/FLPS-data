   <p>Some Norwegian ladies formed an aid society a while ago, naming it "Solglimt." These girls come together every fourth Thursday of the month in the homes of the members, in succession, working for the benefit of the poor. This society will hold a bazaar on Saturday December 1, at 2224 N. Kimball Avenue. Many useful and attractive articles, refreshments, all at reasonable rates. The society is inviting the public.</p>
