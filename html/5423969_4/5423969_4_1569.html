   <p>Congressman Niels Juul arrived in Chicago last night and with his wife, and daughter-in-law participated in the ladies card party in the Norwegian Club of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Asked his attitude towards maintenance of the Norwegian language he said, jestingly, that he was staunchly in favor of the maintenance of Norwegian provided only that the Norwegian in question be not the "maulet" (Norwegian dialects). In this sentiment the members present joined with strong applause, even the ultra Norwegians joining.</p>
