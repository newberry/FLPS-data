   <p>The Scandinavian Y.M.C.A. is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary. It was started June 13, 1876. Everything went slowly until Iver Olsen became a member and was elected president in 1893. He started the movement to get their own home, a hard job, but he and attorney Oscar M. Torrison succeeded. In 1893 they purchased the lots and on November 5, 1893, the building was dedicated. The building cost $11,500.00; debts $7,700.00; mortgage $4,500.00; private debts $3,200.00 From that time things started to look a little more bright. A few donations from business people helped a great deal.</p>
