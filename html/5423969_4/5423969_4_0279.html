   <p>p.2.....The copper mines at Lyngenfjorden, Norway have been the main topic of discussion throughout our Norwegian colony for several weeks. Scandia has taken the matter up, not out of personal animosity toward individuals involved, but because we feel that the swindle should be thoroughly exposed and it is the duty of a free and honest press to make such an exposure for the protection of our citizens. Those in position of trust, who allow themselves to be duped into aiding the perfection of such an open swindle will have to make the best of whatever adverse publicity we must needs give them. They made their own beds, may their rest thereon be as peaceful as it is deserving.</p>
   <p>Early last winter members of the Bethel Lutheran Church demanded that Mr. Adolf Larson, (a member of many years standing) a prominent worker in the mine swindle, submit a comprehensive report on the business of the so-called mining syndicate and that he clear himself of serious charges made against him. We will not go into details regarding these charges but they were serious enough to cause a number of Bethel members to demand the expulsion of Mr. Larson or they themselves would cancel <span class="page-break">\2</span>their memberships. A date was set for Mr. Larson to defend himself but he has several times delayed proceedings claiming lack of time due to urgent business. Rev. C. E. Tiller, pastor of Bethel Church, assured Mr. Larson that if he would clear his name in the matter both pastor and congregation would openly and wholeheartedly back him in every way. Many members of the church had bought shares in the mythical copper mines and they demanded an explanation. Mr. Larson's only reply was a tirade of scurrilous attacks on his accusers,and when this had no effect he resigned from the Bethel congregation. The whole future looks bad.</p>
   <p>Here is a man who for many years was a main pillar in his church, (financially and otherwise) acting as president of a swindling organization, selling shares, in non-existing copper mines, to people who had learned to trust him and who were still charitable enough to offer him every opportunity to clear his name. Their kind offers were rewarded with insulting countercharges and the erstwhile model showed his true color and callously resigned leaving men and women, who had trusted him implicitly, empty handed, their life savings taken by a group of low-down swindlers. Scandia is through with Larson; his own church accepted his resignation;board of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Deaconess Hospital kicked him out as a member and as president without a word of thanks for his years of service, all well deserved. But, the vice-president of the swindlers, Rev. Kildahl still retains his ecclesiastical robes and his high office in the United Lutheran Church, safe under the protecting wing of that organization. This is indeed a memorable saga of betrayed trust, wolves in sheeps clothes and ecclesiastical dirt and hypocrisy.</p>
