   <p>P.4.col.....John Johnson, a Norwegian sailon was arrested for the murder of an unidentified man. He was acquitted by a jury in criminal court on Thursday, Jan. 5th,after a six hour deliberation.</p>
   <p>Through Attorney John P. McGoorty,who was appointed by Judge Scanlon to defend the friendless and helpless man. Mr. Haugan, the Norwegian Consul, became interested in the young man's case and supplied the necessary finances to win his freedom. He has taken it upon himself to secure employment for him as well.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson would,in all probability,have been convicted and hanged,had it not been for Consul Haugan. A vote of thanks and appreciation is due the Consul from Norwegians,both here and in Norway.</p>
