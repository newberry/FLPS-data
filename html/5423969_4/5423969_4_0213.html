   <p>The Red Cross Division of the Norwegian Women's Federation is preparing for a big job, and it is hoped that all Norwegian women will assist our country these days. So many things are needed. Besides knitted goods there is need for bandages and other things required for hospital purposes. The division has several trained nurses among its members; there will teach the workers to prepare articles for bandaging as well as the other things required.</p>
   <p>Preparatory meetings for the discussion of"Ways and Means" have been held, and it way decided to hold, in the near future, a garden social for the benefit of the cause. Among matters claiming attention these days, none is as vitally needed as the aid for our soldiers, and it can hardly be imagined that our Norwegian women would stand back where their active participation is called for in a cause where the need is so great.</p>
