   <p>We the citizens of the United States, of Norwegian birth or blood, heartily indorse the action of the Norwegian storthing as set forth in its unanimously adopted resolution of June 7, 1905, as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, All members of the council of state have laid fdown these offices; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, His majesty the king has declared himself unable to form a new government for the country; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the constitutional regal power becomes imperative,</p>
   <p>"The storthing authorizes the members of the council of state, who retired today, to exercise until further notice, as the Norwegian government, the power appertaining to the king in accordance with Norway's constitution and existing laws, with <span class="page-break">\2</span>those changes which are necessitated by the fact that the union with Sweden under one king is dissolved in consequence of the king having ceased to act as king of Norway."</p>
   <p>We earnestly hope and respectfully petition that you will, at the earliest opportunity, signify your recognition of the new government of Norway, so created by the sovereign will of the Norwegian people, as expressed by the unanimous action of their representatives in storthing assembled.</p>
