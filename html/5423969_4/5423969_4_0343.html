   <p>In the last two years there have been more murders than ever before. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that everybody can buy a pistol and that everybody carries one.</p>
   <p>People have been murdered as a result of a quarrel over a collar button or for other such trivial reasons. Why can't the sale of pistols be stopped? Women carry pistols, youths and even children sometimes have guns in their possession.</p>
   <p>One would think Chicago was a frontier town in Kansas or Nebraska. Stop the sale of guns, and we will stop all this murder.</p>
