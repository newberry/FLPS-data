   <p>A festival was held at the Norwegian Home for the Aged yesterday. It had not been widely advertised in advance, and it proceeded quietly--a plain festival in every respect. And yet, this festival will stand in days to come as a memorable affair, not only in the history of the Home for the Aged, but it will set a mark in the activity of our countrymen in America for the future. It will serve as an estoppel to an activity perpetrated by well-meaning but unwise people here--that of begging leading men in Norway, especially the king and the queen, for contributions to beneficial undertakings and institutions started, and in the main kept up, by Norwegian men and women in this country.</p>
   <p>The "Father of the Home for Aged", the venerable Dr. N. T. Quales, is the man who at this very suitable occasion first protested publicly against this bad practice, and thereby, it is hoped, quelled it before it had developed too strongly. His were weighty words, and Norwegian men and women, of Norwegian birth or ancestry, wherever they may be in the world outside of Norway, will <span class="page-break">\2</span>in their hearts thank Dr. Quales for the protest he made. Dr. Quales spoke quietly; it was not his desire to "push to the front"; his very name vouches for this. It was a tactful endeavor to put a brake to a movement which had gained a start and in time might become a blot on the good name of the Norwegian-Americans, a protest in as inoffensive words as possible if the words were to take effect.</p>
   <p>As usual, when the Home for the Aged holds a festival, the weather was excellent, comparable to summer weather; the thermometer showed sixty-six degrees. As the clouds drifted away, the sun sent its rays down upon the beautiful landscape around the Home, and it was only the bare trees which brought the visitors to realize that the season was not that of midsummer. By special train, more than one hundred people came to Norwood Park for the festival.</p>
   <p>The main attraction was the ceremony of presentation by Consul F. Herman Gade of the gift of the pictures of King Haakon and Queen Maud. The pictures are set in magnificent golden frames, with the royal crown above and the signatures of the royal couple below. The pictures will probably be hung in the parlor of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the Home to remind future generations of Norwegians that the first royal couple in the land of our fathers are also thinking of the sons and daughters of the old kingdoms of "Harald, Sverre, and Haakon", as President Roosevelt called it......Veiled by a large Norwegian flag, the two splendid pictures, works of art, were placed below the great painting of Dr. Quales, the founder of the Home. There in the parlor the aged people were seated while the visitors were left to find places for themselves.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales functioned as master of ceremonies, and presented the Norwegian Consul in Chicago, Mr. F. Herman Gade, who was greeted by applause. The Consul spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"President Quales; Members of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged; Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"To me has come the honorable task of presenting to the Home for the Aged a gift from the King and Queen of Norway, the signed portraits of the royal couple, and at the same time to bring to all of you a greeting from King Haakon and Queen Maud.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"In presenting the Home with this gift, the Norwegian royal couple have given excellent proof of their kind interest in the Home....The noble, attractive faces of the couple are bright with friendliness and goodness; the pictures will ever remind you that the King and Queen of Norway are sympathetic toward the sons and daughters of Norway who have gone to other lands; that the love of the royal couple is not narrowed down to embrace only the Norwegians in Norway, but Norwegians everywhere, at sea or on land, in any part of the world.</p>
   <p>"The King has shown on many occasions that he values the love and sympathy of the emigrant Norwegians. When the delegates from Norwegian-Americans appeared before the King in audience at Throndhjem at the time of his coronation, he stated that the love and sympathy shown him by the emigrant Norwegians had been of great help and encouragement. These facts are worth remembering by us here in the far west.</p>
   <p>"The present gift is of a broader significance, however, than simply a greeting from the father of our old country; it is, in addition, a message of love from Old Mother Norway, a reminder that this love never dies even though the children <span class="page-break">\5</span>who left become old and, perhaps, never intend to return. The love of Norway for her children in America will never cease; it will persist as long as life lasts."</p>
   <p>The vigorous applause that acknowledged Consul Gade's speech rose to an ovation as the pictures were unveiled. Deeply moved, the president of the Home for the Aged, Dr. N. T. Quales, answered the speech on behalf of the Society, expressing appreciation for the beautiful gift....This speech, which will be remembered as long as Norwegian-American charity activity is undertaken, was as follows:</p>
   <p>"Consul Gade:</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged greatly appreciates the valuable and honorable gift which His Majesty, the King of Norway, and Her Majesty, the Queen of Norway, have donated to this, our Home for the Aged among Norwegian men and women in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"It is not necessary to assure the Honorable Mr. Gade, Consul for Norway, that <span class="page-break">\6</span>our Society deeply appreciates the honor bestowed upon us. We do, indeed, feel highly honored at being the recipients of this costly gift from the King and Queen of Norway. It is an attention shown us that will contribute greatly to strengthen the tie between the Norwegian royal house and the Norwegian emigrants, not only here in Chicago, but in all America.</p>
   <p>"It is a memorial gift that in the course of time will remain an object of pride for the aged ones, while at the same time spurring our Society on to more energetic activity, to more faithful work, to greater sacrifice for this benevolent institution that we have undertaken to maintain and direct.</p>
   <p>"The gracious greeting accompanying the gift appeals to us and makes us glad, and we now beg to burden you, Mr. Consul, to transmit to His Majesty, the King, and to Her Majesty, the Queen, our warmest and heartiest message of gratitude.</p>
   <p>"While we feel greatly honored in receiving this gift from the Norwegian royal couple, and are truly grateful to have been remembered, we cannot avoid asking ourselves the question: Is it right or proper for our compatriots here in <span class="page-break">\7</span>America to burden and trouble the Norwegian King in connection with collections for benevolent purposes in America? I have taken the liberty of mentioning this, Mr. Consul, since it is a thought which presents itself on this occasion, and the moment for mentioning it seems opportune. As far as I know the present occasion is unique, and for that reason there may be no need for entering into the principle of the matter; but it ought to be called to the attention of our countrymen....that activity in the line indicated ought to be discouraged.</p>
   <p>"Permit us then, Mr. Consul, to thank you for all the trouble undertaken by you in connection with this donation from the King. You were most kind in bringing us the gift in person, and we greatly appreciate your honoring us by the manner in which you made the presentation."</p>
   <p>The thunderous applause which greeted this speech by Dr. Quales clearly showed that the audience agreed in the sentiments expressed by him.</p>
