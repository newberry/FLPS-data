   <p>Concordia Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged has had another song excursion. This time the members of the Society were guests at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Crook, 735 Taylor Avenue, Oak Park. Mr. Crook, who is a member of the firm of Mortensen and Crook, has a large circle of friends within and outside the Branch, and many non-members were present, so that the large house was crowded with people.</p>
   <p>Mr. Crook does not enjoy living enclosed between two high walls, as so many people in town must do. He has followed Mr. Greely's advice and has gone west to take land sufficient for housing purposes.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened with singing, and prayer by Reverend Torgersen. Three new members were accepted into the Branch, and the usual matters of business were attended to. Mrs. Thomas Monson donated to the Branch a pack of finely adorned membership cards, and while these were filled in by Miss Winn, the secretary, Mrs. B. J. Johnson was kept busy distributing tickets and subscription books for the bazaar to be held at Schoenhofen's Hall during the week of the presidential election.</p>
   <p>After the matters of business had been taken care of, a splendid program was presented, opening with a song by Miss Ragnhild Johnson who was called on for an encore. Master Orlando Crook received much applause for his flute solos, accompanied at the piano by Miss Jennette Crook. Mr. Frank Hansen, also accompanied by Miss Crook, played two violin solos, displaying great facility as a violinist. Coffee, sandwiches and cakes were next on the program and greatly appreciated. It was very evident that the bracing air had given the people a vigorous appetite.</p>
