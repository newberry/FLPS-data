   <p>p.4...One of the highlights of a foreigner's existence, in Chicago, as elsewhere throughout the world, is meeting another from the mother country, with whom he or she can converse in the mother tongue and learn from each others experiences how to cope with unfamiliar phases of life in the new land.</p>
   <p>Chicago Norwegians have two cherished spots where such meetings are not only possible but every day occurrences. These are, "The Tavern" and "The Perfecto," Finstad &amp; Johnson owned cafe's. At these popular spots one can meet, at all hours, men and women from all parts of the Scandinavian countries, yesterday's arrivals or the old pioneers, and enjoy a real visit or reunion, at the same time partaking of the excellent food. Here one can order all the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish <span class="page-break">\2</span>delicacies, baked herring, roast rype (ptarmigan), baked rabbit, smoked venison,etc., together with imported old country beverages of all kinds..</p>
   <p>What can be more encouraging or pleasant to a stranger in a strange land than to drop in and enjoy an hour or so with the people, language, food, and music direct from the homeland. Only he who has loved the mother country can truly learn to love the new home of his choice, applying the inherited love of home and the urge to build in the new environment.</p>
