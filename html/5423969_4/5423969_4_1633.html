   <p>The Norwegian Club of Chicago has now become a reality. There has been a great deal of heated discussion regarding such an organization, its possibilities, benefits, and place in the community. At a meeting in the Bismark Hotel on Wednesday evening, the twenty-one-year-old Quartette Club and the seven-year-old Norwegian Club combined, forming the new Norwegian Club of Chicago. Sixty members of the two societies were present, and the consolidation was effected in a spirit of harmony and friendship. The spirit of the entire meeting was for unity and advancement. Olaf Beruts officiated at the reorganization session and the election of officers for the new club was immediately carried through. W. Gerner, Knud Lassen, and Oscar H. Haugan were elected president, secretary, and treasurer respectively.</p>
   <p>It was midnight before the election was completed. Hence there was little time for speeches, which were left for a later date. Various committees were appointed. Among these was the housing committee, which was given the task of securing quarters for the club. These quarters must be in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>vicinity of Humboldt Park and Logan Square as this is the territory most thickly populated by our Norsemen. Scandia feels that this consolidation will lead to closer unity among Chicago Norwegians in every respect.</p>
