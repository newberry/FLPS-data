   <p>Report of the Employment Office</p>
   <p>As usual, the farmers have patronized this office, and in every case they have been satisfied with the employees sent them. The office received $748.73 from the farmers for transportation, and $34.43 of this sum was used.</p>
   <p>The Decorah Post, Ottawa Times, The Danish Review, Scandia, Skandinaven, and The Washington Post [all Scandinavian papers] are sent free to the office, and we owe a vote of thanks to these newspapers for the co-operation given to the office through their columns.</p>
