   <p>At about nine o'clock the guests were <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and were welcomed by Mr. S. Husoby, chairman of the committee on refreshments. He also introduced the toastmaster for the evening. The foremost task of the toast-master is to enliven the proceedings, and to be successful in this, one must have a reasonably good command of the language. This requisite, however, was not possessed by the toastmaster of the evening, and inasmuch as some of the other speakers of the evening also did their best to murder the Norwegian language, one need not wonder that some of those who were present felt that Norwegianism did not receive its due at the evening's banquet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Birger Osland spoke on the objectives and the activities of the Norwegian National Association. He outlined the growth of the Association from its humble beginnings as a ten-man committee, of which Dr. Marl Sandberg was the president and the speaker the secretary. He lauded the administration of Attorney Hummeland and Ommund Harveland. Nothing, however, was said at any time about the administration of A. Abrahamson and that of Mr. Osland himself, and yet these two administrations must be considered the best in the history <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Clausen spoke in honor of America, while Mr. John Borge's speech in honor of Norway was the best delivered speech of the evening. C. Gilbert spoke about business life in Chicago, and Mr. John Jersin brought the speechmaking to a close with a speech in honor of Norwegian benevolent endeavors. At the close of his address he proposed a toast to the ladies.</p>
   <p>The solos offered by Miss Allrud were rewarded with enthusiastic applause. The regular program having reached its end, the toastmaster hurried to conclude the banquet. The attendance was quite large.</p>
