   <p>At the regular meeting last Monday, it was decided to discontinue, temporarily, the association's employment office, because the demand for labor is so great that it is unnecessary to continue this service.</p>
   <p>Of late its maintenance has involved considerable financial loss to the association, about $100 per month. Among the causes for this situation, the most significant one is, perhaps, the fact that a new Norwegian employment office has been opened across the street from the present bureau.</p>
   <p>The new employment office is said to have acquired, at least, one half of the clients of the association.</p>
   <p>The association voted a contribution of $200 to the Norwegian American Hospital.</p>
