   <p>The Norwegian National Association held its quarterly meeting Monday evening at Wicker Park Hall. Of the thirty delegates that were invited to represent the various societies, seventeen were present. Mrs. Sophie Christensen was the delegate from the Norwegian Women's Industrial Society.</p>
   <p>The Seventeenth of May committee presented its accounts from the latest festival at the Auditorium. To date $730 for tickets sold has been remitted, but several ticket accounts have yet to be settled. The expenses will total more than $750.</p>
   <p>The report was accepted and the board of directors was authorized to pay the amount due. When all bills have been paid, the committee will turn the books over to the auditing committee. Since the secretary of the Seventeenth of May <span class="page-break">2</span>committee is a member of the auditing committee, Mr. P. M. Balken was elected to function as auditor in the secretary's place, in so far as the Seventeenth of May festival accounts were concerned.</p>
   <p>The treasurer reported the cash on hand to amount to about $200. Some proposals for the improvement of the statutes were read to the quarterly conference. It was resolved to postpone the consideration of the proposals until the next annual conference in January.</p>
