   <p>A Norwegian Welfare Committee was elected by a Norwegian mass meeting held in "Our Saviour's Church" and reported to the American headquarters to aid the suffering of the city fire.</p>
   <p>People, occupying our churches, schoolhouses, and private homes, has been visited daily by our committee and were given food and clothing; until the time the city was divided into separate districts and people could go to the nearest relief office for help. Our committee however, continued its work and helped those who were not taken care of in the proper way.</p>
