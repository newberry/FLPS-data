   <p>On Monday, March 4th, Chicago reached the 75th mile-post in its history as an incorporated city. Seventy-five years ago, Chicago had a population of a little over 4000, and there are still a few living who recall that historic day.</p>
   <p>The growth of Chicago from a little city of 4000 people planted in a swampy malaria-infested spot, to the second largest city in America (21/2 million people), is nothing short of Phenomenal, and Chicago today is rated as one of the world's healthiest and most sanitary cities.</p>
   <p>We, of the Norwegian colony are proud to be a part of this world metropolis, and we wish to point out that our colony which numbers 75,000, is the largest Norwegian colony in America. We are the third largest Norwegian group in the world, and our people are second to none in the process of Americanization. We are proud of our little ancestral country and doubly proud of Chicago.</p>
