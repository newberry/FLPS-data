   <p>On Tuesday evening, June 4th, the Chicago Norske Klub (Chicago Norwegian Club) dedicated its new building and club rooms on Medzie Avenue near Fullerton. The Logan Square district is now a real center for Norwegians and Norwegian activities, and the location of the club rooms makes them easily accessible from all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>The initial session of the festivities was for members only, in order to give them an opportunity to inspect their new social home before its rooms are trampled with the tread of alien feet.</p>
   <p>The second session was a gala affair, a ball for members and their families, and at this occasion the ladies presented the club with a large silk American flag to match the Norwegian one it already had. At nine o'clock on Tuesday evening, the members marched into the banquet hall and, seated at tables set in the form of a horse-shoe, partook of a tasty banquet seasoned with music and speeches lauding the work of the building committee. This committee, later headed by Joachim Jiaever, stewed over to the table of the club officers and officially turned over the keys of the building to Mr. Gerner, club president. Mr. Gerner, in accepting the keys, tendered the heart-felt gratitude of the club to the committee for their efficient and faithful work, after which the keys were turned over to Dr. Anton Holmboe, chairman of the house committee, as a symbol of that group's authority and the responsibility for the care of the property.</p>
   <p>The new club rooms would do credit even to a group of rich people, while the members of Den Norske Klub are anything but millionaires or even rich, and one can readily understand the joy and enthusiasm displayed at the dedication.</p>
   <p>Our colony is proud of this club and its accomplishment. Here we have a comparatively small part of one of Chicago's minority groups of foreign descent that by earnest and faithful endeavor and by many a sacrifice have attained a goal far beyond what could have reasonably been expected. The club has its own building with a banquet hall, auditorium, piano, special wardrobe,ante rooms, ladies' room finished and furnished in white, the men's club room or lounge, library with suitable paintings, open fireplace, etc. The kitchen too is modern in every way. The beautiful draperies which are a work of art, were made by Mrs. Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> olmboe, and have to be seen to be properly appreciated. The club is also greatly indebted to Emil Bjorn and Christian Bogge, artist and architect respectively, for the beauty and coziness of the various rooms, not to forget the convenience throughout.</p>
   <p>The decorations and lighting effects of the club rooms are beyond criticism in any way. They are perfect.</p>
   <p>Quite late, even though the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> had in no way abated, the entertainment committee, masked and in full carnival regalia, marched in bearing the huge punch bowl and accessories recently presented by Mr. Balstad as a memorial to the new Norske Klub from the old Kvartet Klub. The punch bowl was immediately filled and emptied to the accompaniment of singing, speeches, and cheers. Festivities continued till the morning hours.</p>
   <p>On Saturday, June 15, the club will serve a 'Sexa' (six o'clock fish supper) for members and friends, and on Friday evening, June $1, it will give a children's ball to wind up the dedication festivities.</p>
