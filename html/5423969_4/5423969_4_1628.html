   <p>Last Monday evening the Bjornstjerne Bjornson Lodge celebrated its second anniversary.</p>
   <p>The program was very well arranged.</p>
   <p>Oskar Eriksen Frank sang a number of songs in his usual routine. Ullabrand's Orchestra rendered the musical selections. The noteworthy members of the orchestra are: Miss Thea Olsen (violin); Miss Jenny Thoreson (flute); and Mr. Sverre Rian (piano). Both of the ladies wore national costumes and played only Norwegian folk songs.</p>
   <p>The Lodge is affiliated with The Sons of Norway, an order organized with but one purpose, to keep the old Norwegian culture alive.</p>
