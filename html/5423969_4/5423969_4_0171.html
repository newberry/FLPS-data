   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Mission Home Society of Chicago held its regular semiannual meeting Tuesday September 11, 1917, in Bethel Lutheran Church, Humboldt Boulevard and Dickens Avenue. The chairman's report called attention to the fact that the society is now acknowledged by the Lutheran Church and this makes it easier to collect money for its work. The building plots on Kedzie Boulevard are fully paid for.</p>
   <p>The question arose about acquiring a larger plot of land for a building lot, and it was resolved to appoint a committee of three to investigate this matter and report on its work at the next meeting.</p>
