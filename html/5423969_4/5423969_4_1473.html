   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Club will hold a meeting this coming Thursday evening for discussion of proposals of new statutes for the club. The question of contention is mainly, is the Norwegian Club to remain Norwegian, i.e., a Norwegian Culture Center in Chicago, a place where Norwegians of the second generation will also be able to win contact with their ancestor's culture, or is the club to be transformed so as to become a so-called American Club in which the members know that they are Norwegians but evidently are afraid of admitting it?</p>
   <p>Anyone must realize that the cultural interests are kept alive first of all by keeping the language alive. Besides this, everything else is secondary.</p>
