   <p>The Norwegian Emergency Committee had its meeting the 10th of October. Mr. Ole Birkeland was elected chairman, Pastor Krognass, secretary, and Pastor Krahn, cashier. The first thing attempted by the group was to make an appeal to all Norwegian from coast to coast to help the fire sufferers.</p>
   <p>Almost immediately this resulted in the arrival of boxes of clothes from Madison, Wis., and later on sums of money. The committee collected $1,042, of which $300 came from people not belonging to any Norwegian churches and $200 from Augustana Synoden, the balance from the Norwegian Synods. The different churches received all together $7,800 from various churches which was distributed amongst the needy in their neighborhood.</p>
