   <p>Nora Lodge I.R.H.K., held a meeting last Tuesday evening and resolved to collect as much as possible to help our people in the town of Levanger Norway, which was nearly burned to the ground on the 12th of December, 1877. A committee was appointed to get the collection started. Remember Norway helped us in 1870, let us get busy.</p>
