   <p>If it wishes to accomplish Something of substantial benefit to the country, which will entitle it to the everlasting gratitude of its constituents, the present Congress should make some suitable provision for the improvement of our country roads--the only highways which are still left to the people. The first session was barren of results, and little is to be expected from the second and last. Both parties apparently are determined to pursue the safe policy doing nothing both preferring to play a waiting game.</p>
   <p>This interval of political inaction, which must needs prove more or less tedious and tiresome to most of the members, offers a splendid opportunity for a thorough and favorable consideration of the question of better roads. No politics are involved in this. It is a matter which may be decided exclusively upon its merits without the slightest regard to party lines.</p>

   <p>The people are aroused to the importance of good roads and demand that something be done along these lines without further delay. It is a matter requiring the co-operation of state and federal authorities, if the good roads movement is to be carried forward vigorously and successfully, and on broad national lines, as it should be. Consequently it is a question of which Congress should take hold with a strong, determined hand. Let the present Congress do so, and it will have done something which will be remembered with gratitude when its many and grave sins are forgotten. The session could not be devoted to a better cause nor [could the time be] more profitably invested.</p>
   <p>The energies and attention of the nation have been so engrossed in the task of gridironing the continent with railroad tracks, that the question of country roads has been entirely lost sight of. The means of communication between neighbors and between neighborhoods have been completely overshadowed by the great railroad enterprises enlisting millions upon millions of capital and offering an almost boundless field for speculation and gain. During the heated discussion of the problem of railroad rates, the condition of our <span class="page-break">3</span>country roads as an element in the cost of transportation has received only slight attention. This was natural; but the conditions now are changed. The development of the country has now reached a stage where the importance of the common roads is no longer obscured or denied. In many localities the matter of transportation has become simply a question of better roads. The time for action has come. The matter has been thoroughly discussed in the press, thanks to Albert A. Pope of Boston and other zealous champions of a civilized road policy. If Congress leads the way, the states will follow in its wage. Then let it lead.</p>
