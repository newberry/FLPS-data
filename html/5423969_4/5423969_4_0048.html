   <p>A new building is being erected on the grounds of the Norwegian Home for the Aged, in Norwood Park, Chicago. The cornerstone was laid a little over a week ago...</p>
   <p>Homes for aged people are up-to-date, necessary charitable institutions. Fortunately, most people have a home where they can find a safe, quiet harbor after the storms of life. Many are able to pass the evening of life in their own homes, together with their life companions, perhaps also surrounded by children or other near relatives; others find good homes with sons or daughters.</p>
   <p>But there are many who are not as well off as those we have referred to. Some poeple have gone through life alone; others have seen the mate of a lifetime leave. Some have had relatives and friends, but do not have them <span class="page-break">\2</span>anymore. All of these now are standing alone as the shadows of evening are falling about them. They have done their work in life, have probably done it well, but that is forgotten. Their surroundings do not understand them, and perhaps they do not understand their surroundings; they have not been altogether able to keep in step. Life with all its tumult passes them by, but they stand outside it all--strangers! They are alone.</p>
   <p>We are building homes for the aged to house the kind of people referred to here. To do so is our duty as Christians; it is also a social necessity to make the evening of life brighter and easier for these lonely brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>This is the task which the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged has undertaken in behalf of the Norwegian people here in Chicago. The Society is incorporated under the laws of the state of Illinois, and thus its legal existence is assured, practically speaking, for all time.</p>
   <p>What the Society has accomplished during the comparatively brief period of <span class="page-break">\3</span>its existence surpasses the most sanguine expectations. In 1896 the Home for the Aged was opened in Norwood Park, in a building acquired by the Society, and since then the work has been maintained and improved from year to year. The institution is now housing fifty-four guests, and since the Home was opened, one hundred old people have found a good, peaceful home there.</p>
   <p>The Society does not belong to any specific religious denomination. The work is carried on in a Christian spirit, and the services at the Home are conducted in accordance with the teachings of the Lutheran Church. The Home has a resident minister, appointed annually, who receives a regular salary.</p>
   <p>In order to be admitted into the Home the applicant, male or female, must have reached the age of sixty years, must have good recommendations, and must not suffer from contagious or unpleasant diseases. The question of religious affiliation plays no role, nor does the question of whether the applicant hails from a city or from a country district. Most of the present <span class="page-break">\4</span>inmates of the Home belong to one or another of our Lutheran denominations, and quite a number are from country districts.</p>
   <p>The buildings and grounds of the Society are situated inside the city limits of Chicago, and are valued at about $40,000. In addition, the Society possesses a reserve fund of $20,000. The running expenses of the Home during its entire existence has amounted to about $42,000. Thus, since the work for a home for the aged people was started, the total income has been about $102,000. For this amount the Society shows in return a debt-free property worth $40,000; a reserve fund of $20,000; and care given to one hundred people during a period of fourteen years. Splendid returns indeed for money expended! It would be necessary to seek far and wide for a worthy parallel to the work here accomplished.</p>
   <p>Applications for admission to the Home have been so numerous of late as to far exceed the ability of the Home to accommodate additional guests. Among the new applicants there are many worthy homeless and helpless old people <span class="page-break">\5</span>who have to be denied admission under present conditions, and as a consequence the Society has come to the conclusion that it is in duty bound to enlarge its activity.</p>
   <p>After mature consideration, and in spite of many doubts, the Society has decided to erect a larger and in every way up-to-date building beside the present structure in Norwood Park, in order to be able to meet more adequately the demands for a snug home for lonely old people in this part of the country.</p>
   <p>The new building is to cost $40,000. As stated above, the Society has a reserve fund of $20,000. Even though all of this amount be employed for the new construction, $20,000 will still be needed to pay for the building in full. The Society believes that our people will see to it that the required amount is raised.....Skandinaven is convinced that this confidence is well founded. What has been written in this article thoroughly demonstrates that the Society has followed the dictates of duty in starting the new building.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Home for the Aged has been rich in blessings for our people; but this very fact entails certain obligations--obligations to undertake new and broader efforts for the lonesome old people who cannot otherwise obtain the needed care during their declining years. An up-to-date home for aged people is a necessity in Chicago, if we are to take care of the old people in the city and the adjacent country districts in a manner to be expected of intelligent Christian people. The past vouches for both the will of the Society to do the right kind of work in this respect, and the ability of the leaders to direct the work and to see it through. The Society has deservedly won the confidence of our people to an extent few other societies among us can match.....For this reason, also, our people have opened heart and hand in support of the good work.</p>
   <p>Thus far, the work for the aged people has been made possible by the many small contributions received, and it is this type of contributions the Society chiefly depends upon for its support in the future. No gift is too small in support of a good undertaking. It is interesting to consider <span class="page-break">\7</span>that the great charitable undertakings and institutions are chiefly supported by people of small means. The "widow's mite" is far greater than one would imagine. The rich outpouring of warm hearts, of thousands of warm prayers and wishes forming the spring for the large stream of small gifts, is in itself a rich source of blessings.</p>
   <p>So we appeal to our countrymen in city, town, and country districts: Join in the good undertaking! If you have helped to support the Home for the Aged so far, you know that you have had nothing but joy from participating as you did. You also know that you will never regret lending a hand once more for the enlargement of the great undertaking. So join the ranks! You will be doing a good deed; you will be in good company; and you will gain rich blessings from gifts cheerfully given.</p>
