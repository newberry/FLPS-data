   <p>Stormy weather was threatening at the meeting of the Norwegian National League last Monday evening. Some time ago the league had passed a resolution censuring the practice of member groups of the league arranging private festivals which tend to detract attention from those arranged by the league proper. This resolution was especially aimed at the Norske Klub on account of its independently arranged May 17th, celebration this year.</p>
   <p>The delegates from the Norske Klub had been instructed to resign unless the resolution was reconsidered and voted out. After a lively discussion it was decided to strike out that portion of the resolution objecting to the club having invited League speakers to its private festival, so harmony was restored, Both parties in the controversy, were only partly right; but with the diplomatic, peace-loving Mr. Grundeland in command the league's "ship of state" was again brought on to the true course.</p>
