   <p>p.2. In passing Scandia desires to express our thanks to Reverend J. H. Meyer for the fortitude he displayed in making his own dream come true. We refer to the artistically beautiful Christ Church recently finished in Logan Square. The architectural tone of the edifice is something to be really proud of. Viewed from any angle the church appeals to one's sense of beauty and grandeur; its strictly Gothic facade is a real work of art and is evidence of the idealism of the man, who practically single-handed brought in the funds for the erection and furnishing of this beautiful house of worship. The inside arrangement of the Christ Church is very impressive, modeled in the style of Norway's finest churches and comparable with these in every way. Our people should feel right at home here the minute they step inside the building.</p>
