   <p>When I came to Chicago in the '80s, I lived in the heart of the Norwegian colony, on Morgan Street near Ohio Street. I lived with a Mrs. Wiggins, who was very active in Our Savior's Church. Many of the old-timers lived with Mrs. Wiggins, for example, Ole Stensland.</p>
   <p>In the '80s, the real Norwegian quarter was, Halsted Street on the east, Noble Street on the west, Kinzie Street on the south, and Chicago Avenue on the north. At that time, the Norwegians had their own school, at Erie and May Streets. The more wealthy lived north of Indiana Street, the poorer south of Indiana, those living on Bismarck Court, Hunt Street and Paradise Alley being the poorest.</p>
   <p>In Paradise Alley lived many curious characters. Mrs. Johnson, who tipped the scale at three hundred, was known to everybody as "Big Anna". Kastuten lived in Paradise Alley, making his living the best way he could, until some brewery opened a saloon for him, after which he became quite wealthy before his death, in the late '90s.</p>
