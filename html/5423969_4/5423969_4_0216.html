   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Aid and Relief Committee will continue its work. This winter, as every winter in the past, the poor and needy will have to be helped. The committee will especially prevent evictions during the winter months. Last winter they cared for a great number of evicted families, but this year the issue at stake is the prevention of evictions. This year we have the co-operation of the Hauge Synod, the United Church, and the Norwegian Synod. We make a plea for contributions from our more fortunate countrymen. Help us care for the Norwegian families that are in need.</p>
   <p>Send your contributions to the publisher of Skandinaven, Mr. Louis Anderson, who is the Committee's treasurer.</p>
