   <p>The Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged held its regular monthly meeting on Monday evening at the home of Mrs. Jennie Thye, 817 North Fairfield Avenue.....The president was absent, and since the vice-president was also the hostess of the evening, she asked to be excused from her presidential duties. Reverend L. Marrisville presided over the meeting in her place.</p>
   <p>The report from the previous meeting having been read and accepted, Mrs. Thye and Mrs. Anda reported that all is well at the Home. They told of their pleasure, upon their visit to the Home, in seeing all the men busied in various ways about the place, and the women occupied in preparing articles for the coming bazaar, and all of them well and pleased with their lot.</p>
   <p>As soon as the routine matters had been disposed of, the chairman took the occasion to get firsthand information about the state of the Home by calling on the president of the Society, Dr. N. T. Quales, to tell of the Home.</p>

   <p>Dr. Quales, together with his wife and daughter, was present at the special invitation of the hostess of the evening. They had also brought Mr. John Blegen with them.</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales had been at the Home during the afternoon, thus having fresh impressions of the place. He spoke of the activities of the aged inmates in the same spirit as Mrs. Thye had done. The man who had taken care of the heating plant, the cows, and also done various odd jobs about the property, had been both unpleasant and unreliable. He had been connected with the Home for two or three years and recently resigned. All the men at the Home then deputized a committee to request the president on his visit to the place to accept the resignation; at the same time they offered to divide the work hitherto done by the handyman in question among themselves. The board of directors complied with the request of the men,and now each of these aged inmates has his definite task which he finds pleasure in performing; the work is being done as if each man were working for his own benefit.</p>

   <p>The doctor maintains that work brings satisfaction, and satisfaction brings health. In any case, there have been practically no cases of illness at the Home this year; both the men and the women have been given the chance to be active. The women are especially eager in their work for the bazaar at which they expect to have a sizeable exhibit, which will enable them to earn a considerable sum of money for the Home.</p>
   <p>Mr. John M. Pedersen emphasized the fact that too little effort is made to increase the membership of the Society and to get the young people interested. After all, he said, if the Home is to be kept going after the founders and the present supporters fall by the wayside, it is necessary that the young people step in and be ready to take the place of those who have gone. He felt confident that many new members might be won if systematic efforts in that direction were made.</p>
   <p>The meeting resolved unanimously to consider Mr. Pedersen's suggestions in a <span class="page-break">\4</span>special discussion at the next meeting. At the request of the chairman, Miss Quales told of the Young Ladies' Aid. This society has a fund of $177 on deposit in the bank, and it is expected that this fund will be increased to $200 at the next meeting. The Young Ladies' Aid has twenty-six members, and holds meetings in the various homes on Saturday afternoons. Visitors and new members are welcome to attend the meetings....Coffee and cake was served at the close of the meeting.</p>
