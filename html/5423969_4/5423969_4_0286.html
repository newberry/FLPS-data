   <p>The five thousand dollar reward for the arrest of Paul O. Stensland, the Milwaukee Avenue banker fugitive, was paid today to James Keeley, managing editor of the Chicago Daily Tribune, who with Harry Olson made a flying trip to Tangiers, Morocco, where Stensland was in hiding.</p>
   <p>The money, however, did not remain long with Keeley, who immediately sent it to Mr. Fetger to put it into the depositors' fund.</p>
