   <p>The National Lutheran Commission had completed its collection. We reported some time ago that the goal was $750,000. The last report of the Commission shows that $1,210,000 has been collected, a good deal more than was expected. A special commission was set up with Professor M. J. Storlee as president, to go to France and organize the work there. The other members of the special commission are Dr. C. C. Brown and Dr. Lincoln. Reverend J. A. Stub had been put in charge of the national office. Mr. C. H. Boyer, president of the Illinois Commission, reports that only one church in this district failed to collect any money.
