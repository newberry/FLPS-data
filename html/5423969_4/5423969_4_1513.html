   <p>As time ebbs away, so ebbs away the life of man. As spring takes the place of winter by His bidding and by His prearrangement, so must youth take the place of the old by the same irresistible, dominating force. The boy of yesterday is the man of today. The spectacle in the arena, where life's great battle is fought, is ever changing, ever new. The struggle of yesterday is not the struggle of the morrow. The conquests of today will differ from the conquests of days to come. The obstacles encountered by the present generation will not confront the coming one. The character of the duties of man also change.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian pioneers can look with pride upon their achievements. Youth, when taking charge of these great riches, may congratulate itself for descending from people marked, wherever their abode, for their honesty, industry, and self-reliance. The pioneers have fulfilled their life's mission. They have not only shaped and formed the history of several states and cities, but they have helped to shape and form the history of the nation. Where their work ends youth's work must begin. What they failed to achieve, we should strive <span class="page-break">2</span>to attain. The future of the republic rests with the young, as did that of the present with those gone before us. The work ahead is important; the duties which we are summoned to discharge are weighty. The Scandinavians occupy no mean place in the council of the nation. It lies entirely with the young, if, in the near future, they shall wield a still greater power. Along this line the Scandinavian race should be made in the future; but we must fight for our just share in the management of social and political affairs as a Americans, not as Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>In consequence of the large immigration to this country of so many different types of people, holding so many different ideas as to the forms of government, our institutions are in danger, while personal liberty needs watching and American principles need champions. An idea of the power of this foreign element in our politics can be had by looking back upon the results of the election held recently in New York City. It was not Americanism that elected Van Wyck. Fortunately, the Scandinavians do not belong to the ignorant class <span class="page-break">3</span>of immigrants, but it is their duty to assist in repressing and subduing this army of ignorant and reckless voters.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, be true citizens, true American citizens. We owe it to ourselves, to the country under whose protective care we are enjoying so many immunities, and to the land from whence we came; for we cannot honor the memory of our Fatherland more, than by proving ourselves loyal subjects of the nation which has so generously received us. Much as we love the mother tongue, it must necessarily take a secondary place among us. There should not be divided opinions as to what language the young, the coming generation should learn. No, we must not falter; we must not waver. Indecision is as bad as idleness. Let us educate ourselves, not for the mere purpose of being able to cope with our contemporaries in the battle for existence and individual comfort, but for higher and nobler aims. Let our motto be honesty, integrity and loyalty, and history shall attribute to us these very virtues.</p>
