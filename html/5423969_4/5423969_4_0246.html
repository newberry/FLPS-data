   <p>In this edition of our paper we reproduce a facsimile of a letter from His Excellency A. Grip, Norwegian and Swedish Minister at Washington, D. C., in which the Minister expresses the gratitude of the Norwegian Department of the Interior to all those in the United States who contributed to the fund for the widows and children of the fishermen who became victims of the sea during the storm which swept the coasts of Norway last October.</p>
   <p>....The rich gifts from America have made deep impressions everywhere in Norway.</p>
   <p>The collection of funds,remarkable in several ways among the Norwegians in America, has been officially finished. It may be said without exaggeration that this charitable act forms one of the most attractive pages in the history of the Norwegians in America. The report of the catastrophe which brought <span class="page-break">\2</span>sorrow and suffering to so many homes in our old homeland brought sadness to the homes in this country also. The appeal for aid found immediate response everywhere. Contributions began to pour in from all sides, as little brooks into a river. The lists of contributors and expressions from cheerful givers have told the history of this undertaking better than this paper can tell it. Every social strata joined in the work. The churches forgot their internal strife; Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, and others found a common bond in the work for those whom the storm had bereaved....Even the children joined in, contributing from their little funds to help alleviate the need. The same spirit of sacrifice inspired all, not the least those whose means were limited.</p>
   <p>The results far exceed the expectations of those who started the undertaking. Skandinaven, as earlier announced, sent home more than 101,000 crowns, and the total contribution from America is in excess of 150,000 crowns. The joy created by the gift among the widows and children of those who lost their lives in the storm, may more easily be imagined than described. Life is hard for the fisherman along the shores of Norway even when things go well and the fisherman is successful in his everlasting struggle with the ocean for bread for himself and his family. And when the sea prevails in the struggle and hundreds of <span class="page-break">\3</span>fishermen are put to sleep in the deep ocean tomb, then the many homes become gripped by loneliness and want, and mother and children are staring hopelessly across the waves for the dear one who never returns....</p>
   <p>The consciousness of having alleviated sorrow and need is all the reward which the givers here in America expect.....But the fine spirit of sacrifice which has been evidenced by the gifts will remain as a bright banner of union in the midst of the darkness of disunion. A bond has been woven between factions and individuals, which will become stronger as time passes.</p>
   <p>The task of helping those in need has given proof that hairsplitting and arguing fall away like a spider's web for the need and the impulse for good deeds. Our people has been taught that a safe basis for union may be found in deeds of benevolence.</p>
