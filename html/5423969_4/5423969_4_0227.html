   <p>Of interest to Chicago Norwegians is the fact that the funds collected by a local committee have been thankfully received by the management of the Tuberculosis Sanitarium near Christiania. This money was used to furnish the most up-to-date room in the institution, and the plate on the door bears the name "Chicago." This gift from far away Chicagoans tended to increase the appreciation of Chicago throughout Norway.</p>
