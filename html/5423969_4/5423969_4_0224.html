   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Mission Home Society held its third annual meeting at St. Paul's Church last Tuesday evening. It was reported that the contributions were slow in coming in, and that it would probably be a full year before the Society can begin construction of its new building. Mr. S. K. Lund, the traveling financial agent, reported that he had received pledges for $4,330.</p>
