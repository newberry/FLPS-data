   <p>While H. O. Stone and Company is not, so far as we know, a Norwegian concern, the sales manager, L. M. Jacobsen, is a Norwegian. We notice in this company's advertisement in this issue of Scandia a reference to the fact that better living conditions are prevailing in the Montclare section. Our Norwegian people are notable as builders of homes, schools, and churches, things which are best promoted when people gather in congenial groups and plan and work together for the common good. It is characteristic of the Norwegian people to do so.</p>
