   <p>At the well attended social of the Women's Federation last Friday, it was announced that the Federation is going to build its own club house. The various branches of the federation have given signs of healthy life, but no more so than the Red Cross branch. This branch is very active indeed; its home is now at 3234 Altgeld St., where those who are interested may get information about the work accomplished, and also chance to add to the good work done.</p>
