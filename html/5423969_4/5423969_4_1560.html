   <p>The Mass Meeting was held by the Scandinavian Socialists at 742 West North Avenue, at which Peter Peterson was chairman and comrades Schilling, Parsons and a Danish party comrade who were speakers.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were accepted: In consideration that the terrible murderer called the English Government, is or will ask the extradition of two freedom loving persons, whose only crime is the accomplishment of the emancipation of the Irish people against oppression and despotism and considering that it would be committing treason against the Declaration of Independence to extradite Walsh and Sheridan for the British Government - it was resolved that we will oppose and fight this extradition with all means at our disposal. We call, therefore, on our good citizens to give us their support to save this country from such shame.</p>
