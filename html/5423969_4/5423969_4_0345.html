   <p>Sunday, at 2 o'clock in the morning, our countryman, Doctor Carlemann, residing at 166 N. Curtis St., was disturbed in his sleep by the barking of his dog. The doctor went to the front door and found a man trying to break in. He grabbed the man's arm and held him until the police arrived. The burglar, however, attempted twice to shoot the doctor, but missed.</p>
   <p>The burglar was taken to the station and identified as Mr. William Keller, a well-to-do man, owner of several tug-boats. Keller's gun was found. Keller was released on $500 bond for attempted murder. Let the citizens get together next time Mr. Keller attempts burglarizing and handle the case. The police do not seem to take any interest in murder cases. As usual, politics!</p>
