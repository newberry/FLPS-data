   <p>Club West works for the Norwegian Children's Home. Its main job is to collect funds for the Home, and this money is used to purchase clothing, shoes, etc., for the children. Every year the Club gives an elaborate concert, the proceeds of which are quite large, but if the quota is not reached, a lawn party or bazaar is arranged to cover the deficit. Club West is one of many organizations set up for the above-named purpose.</p>
