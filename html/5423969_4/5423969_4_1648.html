   <p>We find that a great many Norwegian organizations are governed by cliques, even the Sons of Norway. But the Sons, at least, have some little sense left; their clique tries not to do things in the way in which some of the other organizations do them. For instance, they have not had the audacity to endorse Consul Herman Gade for [the post of Norwegian] minister at Washington. All Gade's "fine-fine" friends in other organizations have done so; the "fine-fine" friends are the cliques.</p>
