   <p>"Jonas Lie" held its stag party Sept. 28, and in every way it was a success. The committee done its work brilliantly, and as a result, a full house greeted it. Dr. J. Berner, the toastmaster, filled his position to the enjoyment of all, and everybody on the program found favor with the public.</p>
   <p>Everybody was delighted, and the end of the party seemed to come too soon.</p>
