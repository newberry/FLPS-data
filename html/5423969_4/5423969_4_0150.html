   <p>The Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged held its regular monthly meeting last Monday evening at the home of Mrs. Jennie Thyr, 817 North Fairfield Avenue....The reports from the Home were favorable, with the exception that one of the inmates had left and Mrs. Marthe Nilson had died. The story of her burial appeared recently in the Skandinaven. The burial took place at the Society's cemetery section in Norwood Park. With one exception, the rest of the inmates at the Home are in fair health, rejoicing in the beautiful surroundings which now in springtime make the place doubly attractive.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Thyr reported a net income of $225 from the annual festival.</p>
   <p>The evening was too warm for the presentation of a program. The time was spent <span class="page-break">2</span>in conversation and made more interesting with the serving of coffee and cake by the hostess.</p>
