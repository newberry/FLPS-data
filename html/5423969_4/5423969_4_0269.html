   <p>Shortly after the fire, when we were obliged to shelter the sufferers in our church and school rooms, one of the American officials complimented the Norwegians. He said that the Norwegian was always very grateful for whatever he received in clothing or food and that he never criticized the different articles of clothing or food and never demanded anything from the government. Let us be proud of this remark and let us live up to it.</p>
   <p>I must give the superintendent for the second district all the praise I can for being so honest in his work of distribution of relief. It is too bad that Mr. M. F. Rockwell was moved to headquarters by request of the Germans; they were dissatisfied with his way of handling his office, stating that the Germans were discriminated against and were treated shabbily.</p>

   <p>One thing we demanded was a Norwegian speaking investigator as the Americans could not always be understood by and of the newcomers and for this we owe thanks again to Mr. Rockwell.</p>
   <p>I would like to repeat: pray, that we Scandinavians shall do all in our power to maintain our reputation and that we shall always show gratitude for that which we received.</p>
