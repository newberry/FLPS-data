   <p>As in former years the Norwegian Lutheran Church also this year has been in the field to succor the poor and the needy. Large quantities of clothing have been collected, and up to today $1712.30 have been donated to this worthy cause. It is encouraging to see how our people throughout the whole nation contributed in one form or another.</p>
