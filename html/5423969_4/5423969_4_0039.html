   <p>The Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged held its summer outing in Norwood Park yesterday. The outing was most successful. By train and carriage at least two thousand people came to enjoy the outing and show their interest in the Home. The new building is almost completed, but the excursionists stayed around the old building which was attractively decorated with bunting and Norwegian and American flags. The Ladies' Aid Board served refreshments on the lawn. Mr. Peterson's orchestra played almost continuously throughout the day.</p>
   <p>Old settlers had come in large numbers to greet aged acquaintances; they kept their headquarters separate from the main crowd. This, however, did not keep them from mingling with the throng, there to greet those of a younger generation. A number of residents of the Danish Home for the Aged were present to meet their Norwegian neighbors. Among the Danish visitors was the senior at that Home, Mr. J. C. Wildfang, eighty years old, but vigorous and lively as a far younger man.</p>
   <p>The festive program opened with the orchestra playing the Norwegian national hymn, after which the president of the Society, Dr. N. T. Quales, welcomed the public to this, the fourteenth annual gathering. Then Rev. N. J. Ellestad was introduced. He delivered a prayer and a brief speech. The weather, he said, seemed threatening yesterday with heavy rains, but the presence of the large audience today is proof that the Norwegian people are not afraid to take chances with the weather. Many, he said, had probably joined the picnic simply to meet friends and to shake hands with old acquaintances; but the majority had undoubtedly also had the wish to inspect the progress of the Home during the past year.</p>
   <p>It is a fine undertaking like every other deed of mercy. The speaker reminded the people of the words of the Scripture, "Be ye merciful even as your Father in Heaven is merciful". He further congratulated the board of directors on the great progress that the Society has made, and in this connection he called attention to another Norwegian institution of mercy, the Norwegian Orphanage. Finally he expressed the hope that the blessing of God may rest upon the two Societies which are working for the noble tasks of giving comfort to the aged people and of taking care of the children.</p>
   <p>Reverend Austin D. Crile was the next speaker. Of late years, he said, he had invariably been present when the Society for a Home for the Aged had its socials, and he had noticed that the interest in the cause which the Society is supporting is winning the interest of more and more people all the time. He expressed his joy that the Home is being conducted in a Christian spirit, by men of sound business practice; these factors are vital, he said, for the progress of such an important matter as the work for the aged. He spoke briefly of the two businessmen, H. A. Hangan and A. P. Johnson, both of whom now are dead. He also thanked the present leaders with their venerable president, Dr. N. T. Quales at their head.</p>
   
   <p>Reverend Ellestad brought a greeting from Reverend J. H. Meyer and wife, and from some other people who are on a tour to Norway and therefore unable to be present at the picnic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter M. Balken spoke of the Norwegian people in America. The Norwegian Home for the Aged is a monument to the Norwegians in this country. The speaker appealed to the younger people to support the older generation in its noble work, in such manner that as the older people fall away, the young will be ready to take up the task, following in the footsteps of their elders.</p>
   <p>The official program concluded with "America" played by the orchestra. Again the ladies brought out refreshments, and the people enjoyed themselves in various ways until the whistle from the train in the early evening announced that the time had come to depart.</p>
