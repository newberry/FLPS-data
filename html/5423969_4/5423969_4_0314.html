   <p>Alexander Peterson, 11 years old, was arrested recently on the charge of horse stealing. He was found guilty, and sent for several years to the Reform School, but his friends and relatives pleaded for him, and the judge believing that he would reform, let him go on probation. The boy soon began again to steal everything he could lay his hands on. Last week he disappeared from his home on Campbell and Lake, after stealing five dollars. He was arrested again, and this time he will go to the Reform School for good.</p>
