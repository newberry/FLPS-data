   <p>A white slave is being held at the Harrison Street station. This sounds unbelievable in the nineteenth century, in the modern city of Chicago, and in the free republic of the United States, where about twenty years ago a bloody Civil War was fought to free Negro slaves. But today, a white woman is bought, sold, and mortgaged so that when she escapes she is arrested and accused of robbery.</p>
   <p>The white slave in question belongs to Marta Mayer, a brothel owner on Fourth Avenue. The slave's name is Marie Dubhene, and hardly fourteen years old. She is small and good looking, with an expression of fear in her eyes and face.</p>
   <p>According to her story, she has had three owners, being sold from one to the other. About five months ago, while working in Montreal, her home town, she was approached by a woman named Fawn Kittie, who persuaded Marie and a girl friend to come to Chicago. The girls had no money, so Fawn bought <span class="page-break">2</span>tickets to Chicago for them. They were taken to 78 4th Avenue, where Kittie received money from a woman by the name of Miss Julia. The next day Julia brought some clothing for the girls, for which they signed, and they were told it was a mortgage. One of the other inmates warned the girls if they tried to escape they would be arrested.</p>
   <p>About two weeks later, they were sent to 15 South Union Street. There the girls stayed a short while. When Marta Mayer returned, she paid money to the owner and took Marie to 130 4th Avenue.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, Marie packed her clothes and escaped. An officer arrested her and brought her to the Police Station on the charge of robbery.</p>
   <p>We have several organizations here in Chicago which are supposed to take care of cases of this type. We sometimes wonder where these organizations are.</p>
