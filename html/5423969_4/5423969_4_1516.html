   <p>Editon, Skandinaven</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>As it is important that we discover the relative strength of those in favor of the English language securing a place in Skandinaven, and as we now have a chance, and no one knows that the future may bring, I, therefore, call upon those who can help the cause. It may be a long time before we yet another chance such as this.</p>
   <p>I am fully aware of the fact that in the old settlements the need for English is not so pronounced; but we cannot all live in the old settlements. We must move along more or less. Look at the New Englanders; see how they are dispersed over this country. The same fate will overtake our people by and by.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>There are those who make a fetish of the old country language, and it is more surprising that there are some leaning to both sides.</p>
   <p>People are apt to judge our strength by the amount of space we can hold in these columns. The question is one of making headway, "not only against tradition but against the men who are steeped in tradition".</p>
