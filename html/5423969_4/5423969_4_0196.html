   <p>Since the office has opened of 979 applicants, 498 have been employed. After seven months operation the Norwegian National Employment Bureau has been so successful that it's future success is assured. They have been backed by Chicago's business men and through this agency a large number of people have obtained employment. There are few employment agencies that can show better results.</p>
   <p>Most of the men employed are Norwegians and their salaries have averaged from $8.00 to $18.00 per week. The average salaries according to records have amounted to about $10.50 per week. Also some boys have received employment through the west side office at a salary of about $6.00 per week.</p>

   <p>To obtain employment for girls to do housework is found to be most difficult. There are many requests for such work with good pay, but the demand is greater than the number of applicants. The average pay offered for this kind of work is about $4.00 to $5.00, without their being required to do the washing.</p>
   <p>To obtain employment for skilled workman comes next, and on account of so many of the applicants having just arrived, and not as yet knowing how to speak or write the language, it is hard to place them. Even in these instances a good many have been given work and with good pay.</p>
   <p>Farmers in the north west have also taken advantage of this agency to hire men lately. One of the obstacles to secure employment for these men on farms, has been the cost of R.R. fare, because most of them did not have or could not afford to pay their traveling expenses out there. Should the farmers be willing to advance them this money it would make it much easier <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to furnish the men with jobs. Of the men employed on farms, very few of them have paid the fee charged by the employment agency and that has been a drawback.</p>
   <p>By requiring all applicants for work to sign new employment contracts, whereby they would agree to pay the placement charges, the management had expected to be able to collect this money; however it proves that it did not help much and that most of the men employed did not meet their obligation.</p>
   <p>At the next meeting the officers intend to work a new plan whereby they can take care of all such delinquencies in the future.</p>
