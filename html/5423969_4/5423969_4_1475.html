   <p>Mr. Christian Olsen, president of the third annual Scandinavian song festival to be held at Riverview Park has received a letter from Dr. N. Remmen in which the latter endorses the idea of Scandinavian co-operation, and heartly recommends the festival.</p>
   <p>"During the Scandinavian exposition at the Chicago Art Institute," Dr. Remmen writes, "the place was crowded from morning until night, proof of the appreciation of our art by the public."</p>
   <p>"Let us awaken the public to our music and also show them that we Scandinavians are able to work unitedly for a good cause. Was it ever more necessary to do this than at present?"</p>
