   <p>Mrs. Cathnea Lee-Thompson called the special meeting of the Women's Federation to order last night at the Humboldt Park Parish House, and various reports were given. Among the most interesting was the report given by Mrs. C. F. Arnet, chairman of the Red Cross committee. Her report was chiefly concerned with the manufacture of socks, underwear, etc., by the committee, and the amount of relief clothing sent to France by the Norwegian division. Mrs. M. Bergsjo has taken over the work of collecting money and clothing for the Belgian refugees. It was reported that the committee making bandages had done excellent work under the leadership of Mrs. Astrid Mygdal.</p>
   <p>The next special committee to report was the Viking Ship committee under the chairmanship of Mrs. J. Thye. She reported on the work to save this memory of bygone days. Mrs. Thompson then turned the chair over to Mrs. Trinne Kokkin, chairman of the Norwegian division of the Women's Federation. Mrs. Kokkin told the story of the Viking Ship, from the time it left Bergen <span class="page-break">\2</span>on the beautiful summer day a few years ago, until the day it arrived in Chicago, received by thousands of people who awaited its arrival.</p>
   <p>She then introduced Professor James Hansen, librarian at the University of Chicago, who gave a short talk on "The Influence of the Vikings on Southern Europe". He stressed the period between 760-780 A. D. when the vikings first went to Iceland and the Faroes, the Scotch islands, and Ireland. The Danish vikings were mostly seen on the east coast of England and in Northern France; he recalled that Danish vikings had "taken Paris" and invaded Rome. The Swedes had trekked toward the east and penetrated far into what then was called Gardarike, but which they, the Swedes, named Ruslana [Russia]. The Swedes also penetrated the Mediterranean to Myklagard [Constantinople], where the Norsemen became royal guards to the Greek emperors. Professor Hansen practically covered the whole interesting history of the vikings.</p>
   <p>The Federation thanked Professor Hansen for his interesting lecture, and asked him to return and speak at some of their future meetings.</p>
