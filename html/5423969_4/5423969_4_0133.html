   <p>The picnic of the Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged at Norwood Park brought together more than twelve hundred people in spite of the threatening skies. The first special train which left the Northwestern railroad station at 9 A.M. carried eight passenger coaches, filled with happy picnickers, to the picnic grounds.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements had decorated the main building, which was recently painted white, with Norwegian and American flags. When the second train arrived with ten crowded passenger coaches for the picnic, the guests were received on the platform by the board of directors while the Northern Light Band played national songs from the porch in front of the building. The many ladies within the Society served coffee, ice cream, sandwiches, and cakes at a very low price.</p>
   <p>The program opened with music....after which the Reverend H. B. Kildahl delivered a prayer. The president, Dr. N. T. Quales, welcomed the gathering and introduced Reverend Austin D. Crile, pastor of Wicker Park English Lutheran Church. The minister spoke of the cozy home which Norwegians in Chicago had built out here at Norwood Park, and lauded the splendid purpose of the Society for the Home for the Aged. In the further course of his speech he referred to deeds of mercy as the most beautiful kind of deeds and the finest fruit of Christianity. The heathens, he said, do not do much charitable work. He expressed the wish that the Home might soon have its own minister to take care of the spiritual life of the inmates.</p>
   <p>Mr. O. A. Thorpe was then presented to the audience. He spoke of the progress of the Home for the Aged during the four years of its existence. Now the Home is free from debt on its property. He expressed the wish that it might be possible soon to add a new building to hold one hundred additional old people. There are now thirty people at the Home.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mr. Harrisville spoke in honor of the board of directors of the Home and Reverend M. A. Pedersen called the Home a symbol of unity for the Norwegian people in Chicago. The Reverend L. L. Nervig of Nebraska closed the program with a prayer.</p>
   <p>Afterward the people were led to the western part of the park where racing contests were being held. Many participated in these events. Races were arranged for children, for young women, for young men, for fat men, and for older women, and everybody enjoyed the spectacle.</p>
   <p>At 6 P.M. the first "return" train started for the city, and two hours later the second train departed. Everybody expressed satisfaction with the tour of the Home for the Aged.</p>
