   <p>The Norwegian Women's Federation has formed a Red Cross Aids Committee under the auspices of the Council of National Defence. The committee expects to give worthwhile service to our country. All Norwegian women, whether members of the Federation or not, are invited to join in the work. So many things are needed. First of all bandage works will be done; and trained nurses will lead this work. Next is the question of knitted goods. The request has been made to the committee for 1,500 sweaters and thirteen pairs of stockings. The committee will supply the material to anyone who is willing to do the work. A course in first aid will be offered by the Federation as soon as enough members shall enroll.</p>
   <p>Money will of course be needed for materials, and the committee expects to arrange affairs for the purpose of many gatherings, during the fall and winter.</p>
   <p>To start with there will be a garden social with Norwegian folk dancing and other excellent features. It is hoped that everyone who is able will take part in this very important undertaking to aid suffering humanity.</p>
