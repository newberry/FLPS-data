   <p>p.4. Prof. Gisle Bothne, of the University of Minnesota, is at present visiting Christiania, Norway, where his chief activities seems to consist in receiving interviewers from Aftenposten (Evening Post). During one of these interviews he informed Aftenposten that in 1914 a thousand Norwegian American singers will visit Norway; additional evidence of Bothne's proclivity for braggadocio and biting off more than he can possible chew. As matters now stand the probability of such a trip looke doubtful, due to the apathy of Norway's powers that be, regarding the proposed world's fair or other attractions that would make a visit desirable and worth while.</p>
   <p>In another interview he was generous in his belittlement of Chicago's Norwegian colony. He states, "Norsemen are poorly organized in Chicago, scattered worse than twenty or thirty years ago. The Minneapolis colony is really much better in every respect."</p>

   <p>Prof. Bothne could find a more beneficial outlet for his linguistic overflow, and we would suggest that, at least, a man in his position should confine himself to the truth, and put himself in possession of facts instead of "talking through his hat."</p>
   <p>Our Norwegian colony, formerly centered in the 11th and 17th wards, have moved West-ward, mostly to the 27th and 28th wards where they have obtained cleaner and lighter homes than the old ruins that have now been taken over by Italians and Poles.</p>
   <p>As regards organizations, - Chicago has far more Norwegian churches pastors than any other city. We have a National league of seventy members, representing thirty-five organizations (all in Chicago), and an employment office run by the league; four of the best Norwegian male choruses in the country, the new "Norske Klub" (Norwegian Club), strong lodges of "Sons of Norway," "Daughters of Norway," "Knights of the white Cross," young peoples societies, "Bygdelag" (Sectional clubs), political clubs in both 27th and 28th wards, etc.- What does Bothne mean - "Chicago Norwegians poorly organized?"</p>

   <p>The pet grievance of Prof. Bothne is the absence of a big Norwegian theatre in Chicago. We lack the big theatre for one reason only - our Chicago colony will not throw money away on a mediocre theatre, nor on half baked actors. We will establish our theatre when we get the best and not before; we are critical to a point where nothing but the best in drama, music, art or literature will do. If Prof. Bothne is worried about our political status let us remember that our people constitute a very small group in a city of nearly two and a half millions, whereas Minneapolis has 50,000 Norwegians in a city of only 300,000 and the policies of the entire state are laid down by a better majority than 50% Scandinavian.</p>
   <p>When Bothne compares Chicago with Minneapolis he places Chicago in a false position, and we would ask him on what information he bases his assertions.</p>
   <p>He has criticized and belittled Chicago's Norwegians without knowing what he was talking about; in short he has presented the Norwegian press with everything but the truth. Tell the truth, Bothne, then you will fear no man.</p>
