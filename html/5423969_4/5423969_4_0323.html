   <p>There is no denying the fact that the country youths have far better surroundings, morally, than the youths of the city. Statistics show that in one of the Northwestern states, less than ten per cent of the boys and girls in the reformatories have come from the country, and only one per cent of those who are in the industrial schools are from the country. In the state referred to, one million people living in the country produce merely one per cent of the boys and girls in the reform schools while the one and one half million city population produce the remaining ninety-nine per cent. The reason for this condition must be sought in the circumstance that boys and girls in the country have their definite tasks to perform. The farm demands their time and saves them from idleness and all the evils associated with it. The youths of the farm learn to utilize their time, to do useful work, and many a country boy has in this manner built his character so as to make him suited for responsible <span class="page-break">\2</span>positions in the state and in the nation. The majority of our leading men in this country were born on the farm and grew to manhood there.</p>
   <p>Men and women who advance in the world do not waste their time dreaming of things they might have done if the opportunities had been theirs. Thousands of them have acquired much knowledge and a high degree of mental development by utilizing their leisure time for reading and for studies.</p>
   <p>The fact is that the world is full of opportunities, they are lacking neither in the city nor in the country. The world is the greatest university of all, and it opens its doors to everybody and withoug charge. But it is required for graduation that we utilize the opportunities offered.</p>
   <p>By thus taking advantage of the opportunities offered, many great men and women have widened their horizon and acquired knowledge and culture which opened the doors for them to future activity and to broader fields.</p>
