   <p>Congress Niels Juul [Dane] received the following letter from the Dovre Club:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"Politics may be adjourned, but the Dovre Club, like all good Americans intent on devising ways and means of promptly winning the war, does not have such wonderful confidence in our Democratic brethren as to allow the coming election to go to the Democratic party by default.</p>
   <p>"The Dovre Club is not convinced that the President's best supporters are the Democrats, but believe that the most loyal, intelligent, and sincere <span class="page-break">2</span>support comes from the Republican party. We have every confidence in the continuance of such loyalty, intelligence, and sincerity, and, therefore, the Dovre Club and their friends heartily recommend your candidacy and will do all that we can honorably do to assist your election to the office for which you were nominated at the recent primaries.</p>
   <p>"Henry Erland, President."</p>
