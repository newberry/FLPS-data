   <p>In the recent raids on disorderly houses, many girls have been found who were being sought by the police.</p>
   <p>In a raid on one of the notorious Sadie Richards brothels on Union Street, several girls were found, among them Clara Larson, Alma Peterson, Frida Hussen, and Minna Borg. All these girls had been enticed to the brothels by Sadie Richards herself. Sadie would hire the girls to work as maids in her private home on Washington Boulevard; at that place she would eventually introduce them to some "nice" men, who would entertain them. The girls would soon become thoroughly "broken in," and would then be transferred to one of Sadie's twenty brothels.</p>
   <p>It is high time the police began to raid these houses of prostitution. Most likely, many of our missing girls would then be found.</p>
