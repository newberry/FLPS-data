   <p>The ski club Nor (North) has demonstrated in a practical manner, the traditional Norse spirit of caring for the needy and the bereaved. Mrs. Carl Tollefsen, the widow of the "father of skiing" in America, left for her childhood home in Trondhjem, Norway, shortly after the death of her husband, but has been unhappy over this move. Several of her children are living in Chicago, and, since she longed to be with them, the ski club Nor has raised the necessary funds to enable the widow of their friend to return to this city.</p>
