   <p>The Norwegian National Association began its annual meeting in Sleipner Hall last night. Various reports were presented and accepted; some current business was disposed of, and officers were elected for the coming year.</p>
   <p>With every passing year the Norwegian National Association becomes more worthy of its name. Interest in the affairs of the Association is not restricted to the delegates, but has taken hold of the 3,500 members represented by the Association. Especially is this interest strong before each annual meeting. And this of course, is natural. One might say that during the years two parties have and been formed within the Association. It is difficult to determine the dividing issues, but nevertheless the parties are there.... The chief interest naturally centered about the election of president.... The opposition party had but slight chance, and its chances were all the more restricted because the votes were split between various candidates. The result was that Attorney John J. Sonsteby, a member of Chicago Board of Education, was elected by a large majority. The result of the election aside from the presidential office was as follows: first vice-president, Mr. O. C. Wold; second vice-president, Mrs. Marie Nielsen; third vice-president, Dr. S. Hannestad; recording secretary, Mr. H. Jentoft; corresponding secretary, Mr. J. Malmstrom; treasurer, Mr. Carl J. Backer. After the election of officers the meeting was continued till the coming Monday. The retiring president, Mr. Birger Osland, thanked the delegates for pleasant co-operation during the past year. He also read the report of the board of directors which this time was placed before the delegates in printed form. The report shows what the Association has done under the able and energetic leadership of Mr. Osland. The following is a summary of the report:</p>
   
   <p>During the past year nine meetings were held--six regular meetings and three special. The board of directors held eighteen meetings; the Seventeenth of May committee, fifteen.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the year the Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen, visited Chicago on his lecture tour through America, and one of the vice-presidents of the Association, Mr. Lasse Grundeland, gave a brief speech of introduction at Mr. Amundsen's....lecture in Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>On February 17 the Association's annual banquet for delegates and invited guests was held. The banquet, which was most successful, was arranged by a committee consisting of Messrs. S. Huseby; L. Halse; A. Amundsen. The speakers on this occasion were Consul F. M. Gade, Dr. Anders Doe, Judge Oscar M. Torrison, Mr. A. Abrahamsen, Mr. M. Clausen, and Editor A. B. Lange. The ladies' quartet, Echo, sang and a ladies' orchestra played during the festival.</p>
   <p>On inquiry from the Nordmands Forbundet (Norsemen's Association) in Christiania, Norway, as to whether the Norwegian National Association would join the Norsemen's Association, the secretary was instructed at the meeting on March 2 that the Norwegian National Association is restricted by its constitution from making decision in a matter of this kind since the individual societies within the Association have retained the right to decide for themselves.</p>
   <p>In April, the Norwegian Singing Association, together with the Norwegian National Association, gave a concert at Orchestra Hall for the benefit of the building fund of the Norwegian Orphanage, after a fire had destroyed the Orphanage buildings on Irving Park Boulevard. The committee on arrangements consisted of an equal number of members from the two Associations, the presidents of which.... functioned as active chairmen of the committee, with Mr. John Anderson, publisher of the Skandinaven, acting as honorary chairman. The accounts show that the concert gave a net income of $954.15, with some small amounts yet to be added.</p>
   <p>At the festival in Humboldt Park after the children's Seventeenth of May procession, Reverend G. A. Gullixon spoke in Norwegian and Miss Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, spoke in English....</p>
   <p>The speakers of the day at Brand's Park were Mr. William Jennings Bryan and Judge O. K. Torrison... After the speeches in the Park, the ladies served refreshments. The festival was attended by more than twelve thousand people and was a success in every respect.</p>
   
   <p>On July 22, the Norwegian National Association sent a protest to the Board of Education against the announced result of the census just taken by the Board in Chicago. This census gave the number of Norwegians in the city as 42,816, while the census taken by the Government in 1900 showed 59,898 Norwegians in Chicago. The Association pointed out that the number at this time, in all probability, is greater than in 1900. The justification of the protest was acknowledged by the Board and copies thereof were ordered sent to all the members of the Board.</p>
   <p>At the meeting in September, a committee was appointed to make arrangements for a lecture in English for children, to be given on the day of the Seventeenth of May celebration at Wicker Park Hall, as a wind-up to the children's procession in the forenoon. The Association believes that such a lecture will aid considerably in awakening and maintaining the children's interest in the land of their fathers, and that such a lecture is most desirable since the instructions in history in the public schools neither is nor can become as comprehensive as the Norwegian-Americans wish....</p>
   <p>At the same meeting a proposal to hold a festival in the fall was voted down. The reason was that the Association did not wish to deviate from its practice of arranging festivities only for the Seventeenth of May festival unless special occasions were to demand united action by the societies, or unless the condition of the treasury were to make such united action necessary. For similar reasons, and also in order to prevent unnecessary competition with the individual societies, the board of directors has found it unwise to support motions advocating the acquisition of real estate and the erection of a hall to be used by the Association.</p>
   <p>In November the board of directors made an unexpected visit to the Norwegian Orphanage on Irving Park Boulevard. At the following meeting of delegates, the board reported on the excellent state of order, cleanliness, and care prevailing at the Orphanage, and it was resolved that the delegates should visit the bazaar of the Orphanage as a group on some definite evening.</p>
   <p>The North-West Improvement Association became involved in political party strife, and it was therefore resolved to withdraw the National Association's representatives from the Improvement Association because the laws of the Norwegian National Association forbid participation under such circumstances.</p>
   <p>By request the National Association has sent representatives to the Women's Trade Union League of Illinois, Immigration Department, and the League for the Protection of Immigrants. The superintendent of the employment office was sent to the former organization, and Mr. John J. Sonsteby was sent to the latter as a temporary representative (until the act can be endorsed by the Association). Mr. Sonsteby was elected to the board of directors of the League for the Protection of Immigrants.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the year the board of directors adopted a seal and an emblem for the Association. This action was later ratified by the vote of the delegates of the Association.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, December 27, a committee consisting of Mrs. Marie Malmstrom, Mrs. Nicoline Oyen, and Mrs. G. Wallentin distributed Christmas presents to the children of the Norwegian Orphanage. The Association had voted fifty dollars for this purpose.</p>
   <p>As will be shown by the books, the Association has, during the year, rendered support to various benevolent organizations in Chicago. It has also pledged the amount of one hundred dollars toward the erection of a monument in Norway for the late Premier Johan Sverdrup.</p>
   <p>The report from the employment office shows that the work of the office has prospered during the past year. Because of changes in the form of monthly reports, the statistics of the attached report refer only to the period from April 1 to November 30, at which date the year of operation for the employment office ends.</p>
