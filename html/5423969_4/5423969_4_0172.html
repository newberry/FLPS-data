   <p>A committee was set up in the tent of the Norwegian Lutheran Church to arrange the building of a Norwegian Lutheran Mission hotel. The plan is to build a hotel where Christian Norwegians, whether transients or permanent residents, may live; to operate a cafe in the hotel; to have a reading room connected with the hotel; and to have a hall in the hotel where Lutherans can hold bazaars, concerts, and meetings.</p>
