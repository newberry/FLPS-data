   <p>A well-known Dane, Peter M. Lagoni, has engaged in the real-estate business for twenty-five years on the Northwest Side. In June, 1872, Mr. Lagoni built his shanty on the corner of North and Western Avenues. For miles around there was nothing but prairie. The first Sunday morning he opened he sold twenty-two lots. He was responsible for the fact that so many Danes settled on the Northwest Side. Later on he went into the wine and liquor business at 690 West North Avenue. He always has been very active in the affairs of the colony.</p>
