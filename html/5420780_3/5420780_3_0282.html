   <p>The Society was organized in 1868. It was a pioneer society in Chicago. It has promoted an understanding among its members that can be equalled by few organizations.</p>
   <p>Its charter members are widely dispersed in the different territories and states, but every one of these members carries on his work in the new surroundings with good results.</p>
   <p>Emil Dreyer and Nils Ohrenholt seem to be the only two organizers that are loyal to Dania and do not spend an excessive amount of time with other societies.</p>
