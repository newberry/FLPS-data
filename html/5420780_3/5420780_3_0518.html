   <p>William Bjerrhus, Danish soldier hero, was buried last Monday. The funeral services were held in Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>People began to arrive early, and by 11 A. M. the hall was packed, and hundreds of people were standing outside in the streets.</p>
   <p>The Harmonien Chorus sang a hymn. Reverend C. Engelstad, from the Lutheran Church on Humboldt Boulevard, preached a splendid sermon.</p>
   <p>After the chorus had sung another hymn, the casket was borne out of the hall to the hearse by a group of soldiers from Fort Sheridan, who acted as pallbearers.</p>
   <p>The burial was in Mount Olive cemetery. A salute of rifles was fired, and a heroic soldier-countryman found his last resting place.</p>
