   <p>The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church meeting at Trinitatis Church on Bicker-dike Street came to a close last night. The Danish churches in America have always imported their ministers from Denmark. A committee of ministers in Denmark selected the preacher and sent him to the United States. The committee, at present, consists of Pastors Heiberg, Rordam, Theol F. Nielsen, Wilhelm Beck, R. H. Sveistrup, and J. Holm.</p>
   <p>The committee in Denmark also received all reports of dissatisfaction among the different preachers; this is the reason for Pastor Heiberg's trip to the United States last year with all expenses paid by the Danish Government, to visit each of the Danish churches in this country. The result of this trip was the big meeting. Pastor Heiberg let them all understand that if the churches could not agree, the Danish Government would withdraw its financial aid. All the rules laid down by Pastor Heiberg were accepted and peace was restored.</p>
