   <p>Mr. Paul Bjornskjold, a real dramatic tenor, with a voice of purity and a tone of much beauty, surprised a large audience at a concert given by him at the Auditorium on April 10. Mr. Bjornskjold, in that true Viking appearance, presented a very interesting program. He has had a large operatic career in Europe, singing in most of the musical centers, largely in Wagnerian roles. However, his program at this time was one of Scandinavian folk songs, unknown to most Americans, but greatly enjoyed by most Scandinavians who had gathered to hear him. Several songs and arias in English and Italian showed his linguistic abilities.</p>
   <p>A later appearance of this artist in Wagner and Puccini numbers emphasizes the very good impression made at the concert that he is a tenor of rare ability and acquirement, and one who is a valuable acquisition to American musical circles. His appearance in a larger background, with a symphony orchestra, will be awaited with pleasing anticipation.</p>
