It is a remarkable fact that the total sum of the Danish emigrants from 1820 to 1840 equals in number the total sum of both the Norwegians and Swedes during the same time; yet the Danish immigration has never been very heavy, reaching its maximum of nearly 12,000 in 1882, when, on the other hand, 30,000 Norwegians and 65,000 Swedes arrived. Since then the immigrations of all the Scandinavian countries has declined. The Norwegians never exceeded a thousand a year until 1843, the Swedes not until 1852, and the Danes not until 1857."
