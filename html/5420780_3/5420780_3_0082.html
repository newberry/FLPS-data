   <p>The editor of Ny Tid (New Era) is offended because Skandinaven has printed an attack upon Charles Larsen.</p>
   <p>Charles Larsen was arrested and charged with sending obscene pictures and letters through the mail. Probably Mr. Petersen, Ny Tid's editor, remembers that he himself appeared as a witness in the case against Larsen. He now calls Larsen a product of the "System."</p>
   <p>Well a socialist editor always brings the "System" into any argument he may have. But what has the class struggle or the "System" for that matter, to do with Larsen?</p>
   <p>If the Ny Tid would forget its politics and its propaganda, and think more of salvation and the brotherhood of man, perhaps such individuals as Larsen would be less apt to fall into the hands of the police.</p>
