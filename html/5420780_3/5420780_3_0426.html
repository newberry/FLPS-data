   <p>While in Chicago I had, perhaps, the most interesting, and certainly the most stimulating experience of my entire trip, and that was my visit to the Church of the Brotherhood, which Rev. Oswald E. Helsing has started single-handed on the Northwest Side of Chicago, about three miles from the Third Church.</p>
   <p>Mr. Helsing and his associates took over an old saloon, redecorated it with the labor of their own people and have made it an attractive meeting place. Over the improvised pulpit is a significant picture of "Jesus, the Man," painted by an artist in the congregation. Between forty and fifty men and women were there to greet me, and when I say greet, I mean just that. There was a distinct cordiality and democracy about the group, which is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sometimes lacking in our churches.</p>
   <p>Mr. Helsing has gathered his flock from the neighborhood by house to house visiting and continuous hard work. They are enthusiastic about the possibilities of a liberal religious center in that section of Chicago. Most of them are Danes, Norwegians, and Germans who had broken away from conservative orthodox churches when they felt that there was no religious organization to meet their needs; and this the Church of the Brotherhood supplies. I have yet to see a better example of single-hearted and single-minded concentration to the spiritual and social needs of a group than Mr. and Mrs. Helsing are demonstrating here. The group has responded loyally and as generously as they can under the existing circumstances. Many of them are unemployed, or are working part time, and this makes all the more necessary, a center of inspiration and hope, which the church provides.</p>
