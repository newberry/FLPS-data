   <p>Christian Baun, while editor of the Dansk Tidende (Danish Times) increased its circulation from 300 to 7000. How could this be done? Baun wrote his own editorials; they were masterpieces of journalistic art. His readers are often spellbound by his simple method of describing things in his writings, whether they be scientific, social, or otherwise.</p>
   <p>Baun is always tolerant; he never criticized anyone harshly, but he brings out certain facts that never offend the individual. He never tries to "show off" his knowledge and make the other fellow feel "small".</p>
   <p>Baun writes in a free and flowing style, using simple language that everyone understands. He waxes poetic even in prose. A certain professor at the University of Chicago said: "He (Baun) uses the most unique language I have ever seen." Yes, both style and language are unique.</p>

   <p>We feel it was a mistake that he left the Times (Danish Times); the paper has not been the same, and probably never will be.</p>
