   <p>A new society has been formed. The Danish-American Embassy Association, whose aim is to erect a building in Copenhagen, Denmark, for the American Embassy.</p>

All such buildings are not to exceed in building cost more than 1 to 1 1/2% of the value of the United States export to the nation in question. Denmark imports from the United States amount to about $20,000,000; the building of the American Embassy in Copenhagen may thus have a value of $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
   <p>The president of the society is Karl Mathissen of New York. Jens C. Hansen of Chicago is both secretary and treasurer. On the executive committee we find the following members from Chicago; Dr. P. C. Clemensen, president; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Jens Gregersen, Niels Juul, Jens C.
