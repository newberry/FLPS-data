   <p>Den Danske Braminer Klub (The Danish Brahman Club) now has fifty members. It held a banquet for members and their ladies at Lytthans, December 30, and it will also have a reception and a ball in Scandia Hall on January 13, 1906.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: As far as I know this club consists of bachelors only, who upon getting married are forced to retire.]</p>
