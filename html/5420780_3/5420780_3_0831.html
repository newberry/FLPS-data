   <p>Mr. Assens, Danish Vice-Consul in Chicago, is very much interested in a Danish Export Society, which is trying to sell Danish products in America. The Society was founded in 1896. Every month it sends out The Danish Export Review, and every three months it publishes Hjemlandet in Danish. It costs fifty cents to join the Society.</p>
   <p>This idea will not have much of a future here in the United States. It is foolish for a Dane to pay fifty cents a year to help Danish merchants sell their products in the United States at a great profit.</p>
