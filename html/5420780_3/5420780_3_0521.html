   <p>Some time ago a movement was instituted to stop the publication of foreign-language newspapers. We criticized this move in a previous editorial, and now, the same person that started the over-patriotic idea of stopping our foreign press, remarked in a recent speech the following about the Danes: "When they get through they are full grown one hundred per cent Danes." And later he came with the following:</p>
   <p>"Now, think of a man who was brought from the filth of Denmark and placed on a farm for which he paid three dollar an acre. Ye gods and fishes, what America has done for him, he can never repay!" This was said in order to give the impression that there are no Danes who are one hundred per cent Americans.</p>
   <p>This statement has caused us to scan carefully the list of names of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>last contingent sent to Camp Dodge. There are fifty names on the list, and thirty of them are Scandinavians. [List of the thirty Danes in the contingent is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>If this percentage holds good for the other contingents, it would look as though the Scandinavians were proving to be pretty good Americans. In any event, should it lie in the mouth of a public official on the formal occasion to impeach the Americanism of boys who are going in any such percentage as that, when he himself, although of enlistment age and in splendid physical condition, has not yet offered to go? But he did not stop with that. After remarking that what the Danes had to develop the city and county did not count because it was incidental in comparison with what America had done for the Danes, he concluded the impeachment of them with the exclamation: "Now, think of a man who was brought from the filth of Denmark and placed on a farm, for which he paid three dollars an acre....."</p>
   <p>We hope we will not be charged with displaying any special hostility to this <span class="page-break">\3</span>gentleman when we suggest that such a statement, if it were literally true, does not befit a formal celebration of the birth of a nation set apart by its founders for the oppressed of all lands under the blessings of a free flag and free soil. But this particular statement is peculiarly untrue, for far from being a land of filth, Denmark is one of the cleanest and neatest lands in the world. And what is true of Denmark is true of the other Scandinavian countries. The Danes have been the model dairymen of the world. Our own state has sent delegations to study Danish dairying. Everybody knows that a model dairy means model neatness and cleanliness. The Danes are craftsmen, living in neat, clean little cottages in their cities. The most malignant enemy of the Danes would never speak of them as a people of filth.</p>
   <p>And then, should not we all recognize that in this war the Danes are by every tie bound to the Allied cause? Most of the Danes who have come to America from the overrun provinces of Schleswig-Holstein to escape Prussian tynanny. They are Americans, not so much because they have bought cheap <span class="page-break">\4</span>land in this new world, as because they have found freedom. Denmark would be openly in the war if the fate of Rumania, Serbia, and Belgium did not stare the Danes blankly in the face. It can not be allowed that the unity of the different nationalities be broken because of slander such as the above. We can not have racial or national prejudices at this time.</p>
