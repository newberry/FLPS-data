   <p>The new world champion, Bech-Olsen, the Dane, was expected in Chicago Sunday, April 1, at 9:30 P.M. Many Chicago Danes went to the Polk Street Station to greet him, but the train did not arrive until 1 A.M. Consequently many had gone home when he did arrive.</p>
   <p>Bech-Olsen had changed trains and came to another station. The Danes soon found him and started a celebration at Woer's restaurant. There were many speakers, E. Reehoff, A. W. Hansen, Viggo Danielsen, and Gram. But when the champion sang "Kender Du Danmark" he at once became the special friend of the singers from Harmonien. Bech-Olsen was tired and went to bed at the Palmer House Hotel.</p>
   <p>The banquet in his honor that was to take place April 4 was postponed until April 11.</p>
