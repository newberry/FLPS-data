   <p>In the January number of The Bookman we find an excellent article about the Dane Holger Drachmann. He is "poet, painter and radical," and "as a poet, has a high place among those wonderful Scandinavian writers who are gradually but surely coming to hold dominion over the modern literature of Europe". He is going to stay here several years and will visit most of the Danish-American colonies in the United States.</p>
