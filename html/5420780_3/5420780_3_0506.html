   <p>A Danish real estate man, Mr. A. Madsen, offered a property for sale on the corner of Rockwell Street and Wabansia Ave. This building was formerly a German church which was obliged to sell because of an indebtedness of $2,200 attached to the property. Mr. Madsen notified the pastor of Siloam Danish Lutheran Church, Rev. I. M. Hansen. The result was that Mr. P. H. Linden, a charter member of the Siloam church, bought the property on September 22, 1893 and offered it to Siloam for the use of a mission among the Danish people in that locality. At a business meeting held September 25, the mission was called Ebenezer Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church.</p>
