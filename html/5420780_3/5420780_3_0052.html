   <p>The Danish Aid and Relief Society asks the colony for contributions so that the society may be able to help many Danes in the city with money and food and clothing. The society meets every second and fourth Thursday of the month in Dania Hall, 251 West Chicago Avenue. The membership fee is three dollars a year. Besides the board there is an investigating committee of four, which visits any person or home that needs help.</p>
