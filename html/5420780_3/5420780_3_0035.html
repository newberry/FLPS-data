   <p>The Danish National Committee, by means of its relief fund, has done much to relieve the need and suffering of unfortunate and unemployed Danes during the exceptionally cold winter we are having. Each individual case is being thoroughly investigated in order to be sure the recipients deserve assistance.</p>
   <p>It is true that funds are running low and the good work should not be terminated. The Danish Workmen's Singing Society has decided to give a concert, the proceeds of which shall be added to the fund. The concert will be sponsored by the National Committee, and is to be held at Wicker Park Hall, Wednesday evening, March 20.</p>
