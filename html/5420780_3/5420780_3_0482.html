   <p>Last Sunday the handsome new church built by St. Stepan's Congregation, on the corner of 64th St. and Vincennes Ave., was dedicated, and so big was the crowd attending the ceremony that there was hardly standing room. Reverend Faber, of Clinton, Iowa, conducted the ceremony. We was assisted by the pastors Rordam, Gotke and Don of Chicago. Other speakers were Reverend Blichfeldt of Racine and Poulsen of Marinette. Reverend Gotke served the Holy Communion. Reverend Ostergaard And composed a cantata for the occasion, which was excellently performed by the choir from Trinity Church under the direction of Mr. Geo. Dupont Hansen. Miss Clara Jensen and Mr. Oscar Rubardt assisted as soloists. The church has cost $13,000, of which about two thirds has been paid, the balance is covered by a mortgage.</p>
