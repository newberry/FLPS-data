   <p>The Board of the Danish-American Association has decided to dissolve the society and start a new association with the same name but without stock and "not for pecuniary profit." The society has resolved not to work for export and import trade between Denmark and America, but to concentrate on Danish culture. The old society has been much critized because the stockholders had as many votes as they had shares, which resulted in the big stockholders dominating the policy of the entire society. The stockholders will be paid the value of their shares, which is between one third and one half of their original value. When the society started $10,000 worth of stock was sold. Stockholders who want to stay with the new company can become life-members merely by giving up their old stock.</p>
