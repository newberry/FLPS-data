   <p>Last night Dr. Max Henius gave an illustrated lecture in Danish before members of the society Sons of Denmark, during which the audience, with the doctor as a guide, visited interesting places both in America and in Denmark. Particularly did we enjoy the side trips to quaint out-of-the-way places, where old culture and traditions still live and also the beautiful Danish landscapes.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday Dr. Henius lectured in English in Germania about the Danish brewing industry, and the following day, in the German language in the North Side Turner Hall about the Chicago Public Library.</p>
   <p>The good doctor certainly keeps busy.</p>
