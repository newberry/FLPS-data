   <p>The United States census of 1900 shows that there are in this country 154,616 Danish immigrants and 115,292 Danish-Americans with both parents born in Denmark, or a total Danish population of 269,908.</p>
   <p>Of these Danes 8,000 belongs to the Danish Church and 9,268 to the United Danish Church, a total of 17,268, which is a little over six per cent of the Danish population in America.</p>
   <p>By way of comparison we are told that there are 688,037 Norwegians in United States according to the same census, and that 288,732 belong to some Norwegian Lutheran Church--that is, forty-two per cent. Reverend J. K. Jensen asks: What is the matter with the Danes? And why do they not join the church in this country?</p>
