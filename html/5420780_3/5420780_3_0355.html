   <p>A meeting was held to discuss the plans for celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Danish constitution and the wars of 1848-50. Twenty-four societies were present. Twelve societies were for the celebration, ten were against it, and two did not vote. The ten societies were willing to co-operate with the two central committees. It looks as if the affair will take place after all.</p>
