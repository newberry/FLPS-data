   <p>Last Sunday, Editor Christian Rasmussen passed away, at the ripe old age of seventy-five.</p>
   <p>He was born in Saeby, Denmark, in 1852. When he was twenty-three years old, he came to America, spent two years in Pennsylvania, and then settled in Chicago. He went into business here, and later organized the Christian Rasmussen Publishing Company. In 1881, he published Illustreret Ugeblad (Illustrated Weekly), which is in existence under the name Ugebladet (Weekly Blade).</p>
   <p>In 1887, he moved his plant to Minneapolis, where he organized several Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish papers, a bookstore, and an advertising bureau.</p>
   <p>In 1907, he published the first volume of Danes in America. His Farm Journal <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and several other papers were edited by Kristian Baun, who later became part owner....</p>
   <p>Christian Rasmussen was a Danish-American pioneer, of the old rugged type, who helped make Danish-American history.</p>
   <p>When he visited the office of the Danish Times, last summer, he remarked that "he would want nothing better than to die in harness," and this he did, because he was active until his last day.</p>
