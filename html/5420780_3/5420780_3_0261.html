   <p>This Society was the rendezvous of Danish immigrants in Chicago at a time when this country was undergoing a great disturbance. Nobody knew what might result from the Civil War. Great political and economic changes were taking place, property values and business capital were in danger, and the prospects for work for the coming winter were uncertain. All this must have aroused a feeling of sadness in Danish hearts on that cold November day when the men who organized Dania shook hands as comrades here in a foreign land. And perhaps this was the very reason why Dana or Dania took strong enough root to survive all the difficult periods through which it passed in the years which followed.</p>
   <p>Dania received its first and perhaps its most severe setback a few years after its formation. Dr. N. P. Petersen, George Hoffman, and Emil Dreyer <span class="page-break">2</span>had been among its leaders, and in its first years Dania already knew factional strife. Half the members wanted to preserve the original name, Dana, while others, with Dreyer in the lead, wanted to change the name to Dania. John Foster had removed to Naperville, and he was seldom present at the meetings; after a while others of the original members withdrew from the Society. Dania itself removed nearly every month to a new location, until finally the meetings were held in private houses. It was George Hoffman who saved the day in Dania's first crisis. He gathered in his house all the members whom it was possible to reach. Everybody had to contribute according to his means for the purpose of renting a meeting place again and continuing the Society. And it was a success. At the same meeting it was decided to incorporate the Society under the name "Dania".</p>
   <p>After this meeting in 1865 it appears that Dania again increased in size and in strength. A number of the city's prominent Danes joined it, but several of the grave Copenhagen sailors among its organizers were lost.</p>

   <p>Johan Foster himself could not recognize his own organization. He never approved of the change of name, not even when Dania in 1869 made him the first honorary member of the Society did he find real consolation. The old giant, Dania's father, spent his last years in Milwaukee, where he died on October 9, 1877. On his gravestone we might write to-day:</p>
   <p>Dania owes all to you,</p>
   <p>Johan Foster. Rest in peace.</p>
   <p>In the progressive year of 1865 it was proposed to organize a sick-benefit department, probably the first Danish sick-benefit group in America. It began to function in the year following, and it became of great importance to Dania. At the same time several committees were busy arranging for burial plots [for members of the Society] in Graceland Cemetery, but they <span class="page-break">4</span>were not successful in this undertaking. In the midst of all these activities Dania founded its library, and Niels Uhrenholdt was elected library steward. In the summer of 1865 the first outing "by land and water" took place, a trip by boat to Winnetka. In previous years Dania had held its picnics in "the sandbanks" [probably the Indiana or Illinois dunes] and in the forests along the Des Plaines River.</p>
   <p>In the year following, 1866, the famous "immigrant committee" was organized, which, as was usual with all Dania's committees, worked far beyond what might have been expected of its limited membership. The committee was to assist immigrants in various ways. It acted as an employment agency, and an advisory council and it conducted an evening school where the immigrant received instruction in English. The first teacher in this evening school was John Anderson, the publisher of Skandinaven. In the records of 1865 and 1866 it will be noted that Dania established its regular theater, which <span class="page-break">5</span>has functioned through the years with varying success. There the best-known Danish farces and comedies, with Eva Sallins, Johan Foster, and Niels Jensen among the actors, were staged. And after the Society's festive nights the women's auxiliary treated members and guests to Aebleskiver [a Danish cake] and coffee. There is nothing in the records to inform us, when the ladies' auxiliary was established, but the dusty old minutes inform us that Dania's ladies took part in the building of the Society with their usual helpful and co-operative spirit.</p>
   <p>When Dania had reached its first moment of success, the first celebration to commemorate the signing of the Danish constitution was held, which met with an enthusiastic response from Danes in Chicago and outside. But again the sun, for a time, went below the horizon of the four-year-old Society.</p>
   <p>A matter entirely alien to the Society's activities caused the decline of <span class="page-break">6</span>that period. The Danish [consul], Dr. N. P. Petersen, had come to the end of his earthly career, and it became a question of some importance among the Danes as to who should fill the vacancy left by Dr. Petersen. Emil Dreyer was a candidate and was eventually appointed Danish consul in Chicago. But Dreyer complained that the Society had not supported him, and he withdrew from its ranks together with many of his partisans. The membership sank below fifty, and even the strong sick-benefit department tottered. But among the faithful few the meetings were continued. The chorus was founded in 1870, and its voice was heard as late as 1894, when the singing society "Harmonien" had established itself on a solid basis. Many of the original members of Harmonien were old members of Dania, which may be the reason why the two societies were always united with the strongest ties of friendship and sympathy. Dania's "Gun Club" is first mentioned in 1871, and it terminated its existence in 1891, when its zealous champions left it to found the present Danish Sharpshooters, a club which has enjoyed exceptional success.</p>
