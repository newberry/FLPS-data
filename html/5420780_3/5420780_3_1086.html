   <p>The Danes have just unveiled a monument for Vigga A. Danielsen, who was the Supreme secretary of the Danish Brotherhood in America. The monument was made of granite; on the front was engraved: "Erected by the Danish Brotherhood," and underneath, "Memory of Viggo A. Danielsen."</p>
   <p>The procession started from Lagoni's Hall on the corner of Western and North Ave. Six lodges were represented by 800 members. Near the monument was erected a pulpit from which L. G.
