   <p>This church was formed by the union of two Danish church societies. At a meeting in Argo, Burt County, Nebraska, in September, 1884 some ministers formed Det Danske Evangelisk Lutherske Kirkesamfund (the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Society); they had left Den Norsk-Danske Evangalisk-Lutherske Konference (The Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Conference) at a meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, 1884.</p>
   <p>In 1893, there was another split within the Danish Church (Det Danske Evangelisk Lutherske Kirke in Amerika), which led to the formation of what later was called The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of North America or the North Church, as it sometimes was called. At first this church had nineteen ministers and two missionaries.</p>
