   <p>Ebenezer Church Choir was started in 1895 with 8 singers and Mr. J. Knudsen as their leader. After a few months Mr. Edward Nelson became the faithful director of the choir. The choir first met at the home of Mr. and Mr. Carl Pedersen, 733 Maplewood Avenue. One of the members of the present choir has been singing for 24 years. During the war eight of the boys from the choir served their country, in either the army or the navy and they came all back safely.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1928, Mr. Edward Nelson relinquished leadership of the choir to his son, Mr. Edward Jelson, Jr. The choir now has about 40 members, having doubled in size since 1920.</p>
   <p>The choir appeared in robes the first time at the Easter Morning Service in 1929.</p>
