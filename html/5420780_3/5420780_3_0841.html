   <p>Helga von Bluhme, who now lives in Brooklyn, protests against calling Mrs. Elizabeth Riis the first Danish actress to appear in America. She states that sixteen years ago (in 1881) she came from Denmark as a well-known actress. She was in Chicago eight days and read Drachmann's poem, "Sonderjyske Piger," before Dania, a small and intelligent society. She was introduced by Consul Dreier, whose daughter played the piano when she sang. She also read many of Hans Christian Andersen's stories. She became very popular in the colony.</p>
   <p>Later she left for Racine, Wisconsin, where she gave amateur plays with some young people of that town. They often performed before as many as 1,100 people.</p>
