   <p>Last Friday evening a banquet was arranged at the Red Star Inn in honor of, and to welcome, Admiral Richelieu, Consul Henius, and estate owner Lassen, directors of the Danish United Shipowners' Society, who are now visiting Chicago. About sixty Danes participated.</p>
   <p>The honored guests arrived about 8:30 P.M. and were introduced by Consul C. H. Hansen. At the table Admiral Richelieu occupied the place of honor, with Consul Hansen on his left and Dr. Max Menius on his right side. The consul made a brief introductory speech and appointed Dr. Max Henius as master of ceremonies. Dr. Henius spoke in behalf of the Admiral and the great business enterprise of which he is the head.</p>
   <p>The Admiral expressed his thanks on behalf of himself and his associates. He appreciated the hospitality with which fellow Danes received them. He made an excellent speech which naturally concerned the question of immigration, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and particularly Danish immigrants in America and their relations with the homeland. The Admiral's speech was particularly interesting, as it was founded on his own personal experiences, gained through years of activity under foreign flags. He mentioned how in earlier days people at home were mercilessly considering the emigrants as lost for the mother-country, and many looked at them as undesirable altogether. Fortunately this attitude has changed and given way to a deeper understanding of the important role played by emigrants in Denmark's relationship with foreign countries. A great share of Denmark's foreign trade has been built up by Danes who have settled in other countries; and it is a fact that huge sums of money are pouring into Denmark every year as the result of the labor of ambitious and hard working Danish emigrants. Therefore the public attitude in Denmark is not either indifferent or hostile towards the emigrants any longer. People are seriously concerned about the establishment of mutual understandings with foreign countries. The speaker wished the emigrants from Denmark all kinds of success and happiness, and continued: "But when emigrants grow old the memory of the old country comes again to the fore, and in many <span class="page-break">\3</span>instances they conclude that 'there is no place like home.' Lucky are those who are able to arrange for a return, to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and benefit by the experiences they gained abroad!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Carl Antonson spoke in behalf of Consul Henius and estate owner Lassen. Pastor Gjorup spoke for Denmark. Playwright Zangenberg sang "Hjemmets Sang" (Song of the Homeland), by Holger Drachmann, and spoke in behalf of the Danish-American Association and of Chevalier Hertz, especially. Mr. Hertz spoke for America and pointed to the fact that America is a country where emigrants go to and stay, yet without forgetting their origin and mother country. Editor Ivar Kirkegaard also made a speech. A song written by the indefatigable Carl Hansen was sung and Mr. Zangenberg gave another solo.</p>
   <p>After the banquet Senator Niels Juhl made one of his famous genuine humoristic speeches. Later a speech for the Danish language was made by Dr. Niels Johnson who pointed to the significance of having such celebrities as Mrs. Oda Nielsen and Mr. Zangenberg visit us.</p>

   <p>Among those participating was old Mr. A. A. Westengaard whose son, the young Professor Jens J. Westengaard, a graduate from Harvard University, has held an outstanding position as counsel to the King of Siam for many years.</p>
   <p>Of others participating we mention Mr. Lundberg, the Swedish manager of A. E. Johnson and Co's F.D.S. office in Chicago. There were also American newspapermen who, considering the affair was a purely Danish one, furnished a reasonably good report on the event. Only the Chronicle made the mistake of making Consul Hansen the author of the song that was sung as an alternative for the many speeches, something Consul Hansen could not have done at all.</p>
   <p>After a visit to A. E. Johnson's office the honored guests left for Baltimore and from there they continued to Washington, D. C., where they had an appointment with the President. Last Tuesday they returned to New York and in the evening attended a banquet arranged by Danes at a price of ten dollars per <span class="page-break">\5</span>plate.</p>
   <p>Admiral Richelieu is small of size, but he is one of Denmark's real great men. His life history sounds like a fairy tale. He was born in Schleswig Holstein where his father was a minister. After military service as lieutenant of the Navy Richelieu entered the Siamese Marine Corps and was successively promoted to captain, commander, admiral and trusted advisor to King Chulalongkorn during his reorganization of the Siamese Marine Corps. In 1899 he was appointed Minister of the Navy and remained in that office until 1902 at which time he returned to Denmark, partly on account of his wife's health and partly because he longed for the old country. During the twenty-eight years he stayed in Siam he assisted a number of Danes in obtaining excellent positions, and contributed heavily to promote Danish trade relations over there and in other places in the East. In 1905 he was appointed president of the Danish United Shipowner's Society, in which position his outstanding talents as an organizer and administrator soon were felt from the very center to the outermost branches of this world-wide organization. Admiral Richelieu has led the company into <span class="page-break">\6</span>and through one of its most glamorous periods and at the same time managed to make himself almost as popular as his predecessor, "Russian" Braadt, was unpopular because he was feared and hated by the personnel and workers. Only recently, before his trip to America, the Admiral donated an entire year's salary and bonus, about 65,000 Kroner, as a basis for a fund, the proceeds of which are to be used to aid employees of the Company.</p>
