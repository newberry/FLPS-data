   <p>Madame Elizabeth Riis' evening was a great success. Everyone of importance was present. She brought greetings from Denmark, Danish art and language. Denmark might have sent a great artist, but our country never could have sent a more fascinating, intelligent and beautiful lady. She won everybody by her personality.</p>
