   <p>Born in Hundborg near Thisted, Denmark, a son of Peter Bengtson and wife, poor, honest, hardworking country people, Andrew Benson began to work for a living at the time he became of school age. His work, attending sheep and cattle in the broad fields of Thyland, kept him busy in the summer time. Winter time was school time for poor country boys in Denmark those days. This condition did not, however, deter the youngsters in spiritual or physical development.</p>
   <p>In America we find thousands of them in responsible positions, some as first class farmers and dairy men, others as merchants, contractors, doctors, and teachers in the cities. Mr. Andrew Benson is one of the many poor Danish immigrants who have made good in this adopted country. When 17 years old, he left Denmark, 1892, and came to Plano, Ill., where he found employment in the Harvester Co. factory. Later on he tried his hand at farming and creamery work.</p>

   <p>Four years after his arrival he started the teaming and hauling business which he still, on a much enlarged scale operates, at 1723 W. Monroe St.</p>
   <p>Andrew Benson is today one of the most successful grading, excavating and cinder contractors on Chicago's west side.</p>
   <p>He is highly esteemed and a leading citizen. He has held several offices in the Chicago Contractors Association of which he was President for two years, refusing nomination for re-election a few months ago but accepting the office of Vice-president which he now occupies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benson is a Shriner and belongs to several clubs and societies, such as the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, the Hamilton and Medinah Country Club. He also belongs to a number of Danish-American societies and is a staunch supporter of any important and worthy cause sponsored for the good of the Danish colony.</p>
   <p>He is Vice-president of the Danish Old People's Home, member of Dania Society, and of the America-Denmark World's Fair Committee. Mr. Benson has a brother Jens, and a sister, Mrs. M. P. Boysen in Chicago.</p>

   <p>In 1924, Andrew Benson and his wife, Trine, nee Spolum, daughter of Danish parents, took a trip to Denmark to visit relatives and the graves of Mr. Benson's parents, a trip of much joy and interest to both.</p>
   <p>"When we were aboard the steamer in New York, ready to leave, I regretted our leave-taking with American shores very much, and would have cancelled the trip if I could have done sc," Mr. Benson said afterwards.</p>
   <p>"But now I am indeed glad that Mrs. Benson and I had the opportunity to visit our many relatives and friends and to see beautiful old Denmark.</p>
   <p>I had seen very little of the country before I left, and my wife was born over here, so it was really a new and strange land to both of us. But strangers we were not very long. Our relatives were very accomodating and dear to us and we made a host of friends in this very friendly and democratic country of our fathers. God bless them!"</p>
   <p>The Bensons have two daughters, both married, Carol--the oldest to James F. Millard, choirmaster in the Trinity Espicopal Church, and Evelyn to George <span class="page-break">\4</span>Cameron, Estimator. The Millards have three children.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Benson reside at 5351 Crystal Street.</p>
