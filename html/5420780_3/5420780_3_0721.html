   <p>Under the heading "Our Country in Danger," we have inserted an appeal elsewhere in this issue. We are, however, of the opinion that the appeal is without merit if not outright objectionable.</p>
   <p>We do not question the integrity of the signers, who, we are told, are all ministers of the two Lutheran factions of the Danish Church. They are as much in earnest as the rest who listen to so-called patriots whose real object is a reactionary attempt to destroy the democratic system of government.</p>
   <p>The appeal calls for contributions from Danes in America to finance the defense of Denmark in case of a general European war which is believed <span class="page-break">\2</span>unavoidable</p>
   <p>We believe it appropriate to let Danes in Denmark take care of the defense of their country. In a couple of months there will be another general election in Denmark. If the public at that time is in favor of an increase in appropriations for fortifications, etc., the question will, of course, be properly settled. But if the public is not in favor of the plans, if it does not elect a majority of representatives sponsoring the plans, which is almost certain, is it then the object of the private fortification collectors to break the rules of the parliamentary system of government by leaving the decision to the minority?</p>
   <p>So it seems to us. We believe that the whole system of defensive propaganda is unsound and dangerous and apt to jeopardise Denmark inwardly as well as outwardly.</p>
   <p>The Danes in America, their love for the mother country, be it ever so <span class="page-break">\3</span>great, cannot be truly in sympathy with such a plan, and far less so as good Americans. The Danish Ambassador, Constantin Brun, has advised Revyen that if the Danish government would accept a gift for that purpose from the Danish people at home, he assumed that it would also accept a similar gift from Danes abroad, but he did not believe the Danish government could or would accept a gift donated and dedicated to the defense of Denmark by citizens of another country.</p>
   <p>If this statement made by the Danish Ambassador had been known a little earlier, the good pastors would probably have hesitated a little. Fortunately a number of the most prominent names on that list are missing.</p>
