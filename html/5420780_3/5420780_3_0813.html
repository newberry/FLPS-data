   <p>The Danish Arctic explorer, Captain Mikkelsen, was dined and wined in the Red Star Inn by the prominent Danes of Chicago. Dr. Max Henius acted as toastmaster and performed his duties very cleverly. The main speaker was Henry L. Hertz who spoke on the United States, the country with so many possibilities. Carl Antonsen spoke for Denmark very beautifully.</p>
   <p>Captain Mikkelsen is a young man, being only twenty-seven years old. He thanked everyone for the wonderful welcome he was given in Chicago by his countrymen. He said that he visited President Roosevelt, and that the President promised him all the assistance he could give him, and so did several rich men of New York.</p>
   <p>The Captain will start from San Francisco in May. He has permission to fly the American yacht ensign.</p>
