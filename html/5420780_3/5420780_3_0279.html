   <p>In 1862 invitations were sent out to the few Danes who lived in Chicago. The invitations were signed by John Foster and John Petersen. The first invitations were for the most part, disregarded. But the two Danes tried again--this time about twelve Danes responded, almost the entire Danish population of Chicago. A meeting was called, at 49 South la Salle Street, and a new society was born. The name given to this small club, was "Dana", and Foster was elected president. About three months later the membership was about twenty, and in the following years the society barely kept together. In 1867, there remained only six members; the remainder had, so to speak, "gone west".</p>
   <p>A new executive was elected and on the evening of the election, everybody tried to cheer each other up, when, lo and behold, the door to the hall opened, and in marched fifteen Danes who demanded to become members.</p>
   <p>The next meeting place was [on the] corner of Ninzie and Clark Streets, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>in a few months the society had over one hundred members. The name was then changed to "Dania".</p>
   <p>After the great fire, Dania moved to Milwaukee Avenue, and in 1878 to Kinzie and Desplaines Street, but [it] was a poor place for a Danish club, and in 1887 they moved to 345 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>And now, today, they move into their own building on Chicago Avenue, near Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>Another of the organizers, an active and important member, "Niels I Taarnet" (Nels in the tower), or to give him his right name, Niels Uhrenholt, was the one that worked hardest in the thirty years of the society's stormy existence.</p>
   <p>When Niels died a few years ago he was missed by all, and today one often hears the remark, "No, this is net like it was in Uhrenholt's days".</p>
