   <p>Recently (1935) the Ebenezer Danish Lutheran Church decided upon a change in the order of the Sunday services. The language question was necessitating a shift from the custom of having services alternately in Danish and English. A continually growing group did not understand the Danish language. Therefore, the congregation changed to the double service with English services at ten o'clock and Danish at eleven. The result has been an increased average attendance from fifty to seventy.</p>
