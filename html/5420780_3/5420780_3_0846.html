   <p>Vice-Consul C. M. Koedt of Chicago has been given a three months' vacation. He is going to Denmark and England. It is pretty certain that he will not return. He was never very well liked among the Chicago Danes because of the manner in which he conducted himself in connection with the Hans Christian Andersen statue affair.</p>
   <p>Revyen, June 5, 1897.</p>
   <p>Vice-Consul Koedt left a debt of $1,000. Many Danes had a hard time recovering money owed them from the Consulate. Long before he left, his creditors had garnisheed his wages. The Consul, Mr. A. Petersen, had to go to Washington to clear up the whole affair.</p>
