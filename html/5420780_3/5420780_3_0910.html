   <p>Christ Nielsen, the well known pioneer of Logan Square passed away on Good Friday, March 30th, 6:00 A.M.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nielsen has been an undertaker on Fullerton Avenue and Spaulding Street for 22 years. Only five years ago he erected a beautiful apartment building and undertaking establishment on the corner of Spaulding and Fullerton Avenue which made his funeral home one of, if not the largest and most modern in the country.</p>
   <p>Many flowers, beautifully arranged, were part of the evidence of friendship displayed by many people. Thousands of friends kept calling and extending sympathy. Some could and did say it with flowers, many by telegrams and mail; but most of his friends were of a type he had at some time or other befriended in time of great need. Many were the favors Christ Nielsen had extended to some very poor families, and that without boasting. As far as Fullerton Avenue is concerned, every business man will admit that he has always been ready to help either <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>financially or in spirit for the good of the community. The writer has often seen Nielsen reach in his vest pocket to hand alms to a poor beggar, which he kept for this special purpose.</p>
   <p>Mr. Christ Nielsen was born in Westerweig, Denmark, 71 years ago, on August 20, 1863, and immigrated to this country at the age of 15 years. At 29 he was united in marriage to Marie Bredal on October 22, 1892. They were blessed with four children and six grand children. The grand-children were: Robert and Homer G. Nielsen, Marilynn Jean Andersen, Cora Jane Nielsen, Delores Marie and Roberta Sue Olson, who were responsible for many happy hours in the lives of their grandparents.</p>
   <p>Many thousands of friends and relatives paid their last respects to Christ Nielsen as the body lay in state. Well over a thousand friends were present at the funeral rites in the Home. Amplifiers were used to send the voices of those officiating into the many rooms which were crowded to capacity. Mr. George Dupont Hansen, for 40 years church organist played the organ. The Danish Lutheran Trinity Masonic Quartette <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>rendered such hymns as "Lead Kindly Light," "The Old Rugged Cross" and several others in most beautiful harmony. Rev. A. W. Andersen of the Danish Lutheran Trinity Church consoled all present with verses from the Testament and touched on the life of the deceased. He was followed by Rev. Lewis Moe of the First Lutheran Church, who told of the departed's favorite chapter, John 14. He also conveyed a message from the Fullerton Avenue Business Men to the family and the assemblage. Rev. Moe was followed by the Masons, who officiated. The many flowers sent by business and professional men (many of the undertaking profession), as well as relatives and friends, were carried out to eight cars necessary to transfer them to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Christ Nielsen leaves behind a very devoted wife, four children, grand children, relatives and many friends, who all agree that not only they, or Logan Square, but also the world is better for his having lived. Long live his pleasant memory.</p>
