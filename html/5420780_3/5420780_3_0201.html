   <p>At the Sons of Denmark's meeting, on June 28, the society's honorary member, Dr. Max Henius, presented it with an ivory president's club. For the occasion a cosy social gathering was arranged at Boyschou's after the meeting, where Dr. Henius stated that the only lodge emblem he is going to wear at the dedication ceremony at the Rebild Hill in Denmark, is the star of Sons of Denmark. There were several spirited speeches and song numbers, after which the society wished Dr. Henius a happy voyage, and asked him to bring a greeting to the Rebild festivities on August 4.</p>
   <p>This was the kind of evening that helps maintain and strengthen the enthusiasm for a society and its work.</p>
