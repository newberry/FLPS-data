   <p>Some time ago some Danes in New York started a fund to be used for a statue of the late King Christian IX of Denmark. This fund never succeeded. The final total is $1,950. The intention of the committee was to have a bust of the late king made and give it to the Danish government, but the state refused to accept the bust as they already have statues enough. Only about one per cent of the Danish-Americans in the United States sent in the money for this purpose.</p>
