   <p>The Danish-Americans celebrated the Fourth of July with a big parade composed of more than fifty organizations. The parade was very colorful; hundreds of American and Danish flags were carried by men and women in national costume. One division of the parade consisted of Danish-American boys who have joined the American Army. Music was furnished by two thirtypiece bands, one of them a military band. The main speakers were John Christensen, Henry L. Hertz, Reverend A. Dorf, and Christian Baun.</p>
