   <p>The Messrs. Henius and Hertz were not the only ones, after all, to be knighted. A Dane in New York, by the name of J.D. Hagerup, who is in the wholesale business and was recommended together with Hertz and Henius, has received the same honor.</p>
   <p>The three gentlemen were mentioned in Denmark as "three of our most outstanding countrymen in America." We regret to admit that Mr. Hagerup is a stranger, at least to us Danes, in Chicago; but, since he was so greatly "honored," we hope to become acquainted with him.</p>
