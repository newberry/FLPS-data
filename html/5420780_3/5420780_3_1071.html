   <p>Mrs. Lycinka Hansen, who has been engaged by the Scandinavian Socialists in Chicago to give a series of lectures, is old in the service of Socialism; she is a bookbinder by trade. In 1890 she started to travel and speak for the working class. She is a very good speaker and organizer. For three years she was president of the Women's Bookbinders' Union, and when this organization later joined with the men, she became a member of the board. For four years she was the president of the seamstresses' union. She has for many years written for the Social-Democrat in Copenhagen. Her husband died some years ago, and they both have done some hard pioneer work for Socialism in Denmark and Scandinavia.</p>
