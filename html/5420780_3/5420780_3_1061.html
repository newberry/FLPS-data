   <p>A banquet in honor of Dr. P. C. Clemensen was given last Wednesday in Grand Crossing Masonic Temple by the Grand Crossing Business Men's Association. Among the speakers was Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of schools in Chicago, who complimented the doctor on his able work as a member of the Chicago Board of Education.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were State Senator Clark, Senator Niels Juul, Alderman Vanderpoel, and a number of school principals.</p>
   <p>It was a very pleasant and festive affair, and we are of course, particularly pleased to note that an American organization thus wanted to honor a Dane.</p>
