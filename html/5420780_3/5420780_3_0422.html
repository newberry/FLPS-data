   <p>The Trinitatis Flower Committee has been in existence for several years. The committee decorates the church and the altar every Sunday, and then takes the flowers to the sick and the shut-ins with a message of love and good cheer. In the weekly church program you will find the name of the person who on that particular Sunday donated the flowers on the altar.</p>
