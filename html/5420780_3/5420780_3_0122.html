   <p>The Danish "Broadway" runs along North Avenue, from Western Avenue to California Avenue, and every evening looks like a festival. North Avenue is one of the widest and best illuminated streets in Chicago. Last Friday evening, the new lighting system was officially inaugurated with a large automobile parade, of which Soren Cerydon was king. He had twenty beautifully decorated cars; Rusnak Brothers had six; there were probably two hundred cars in the procession.</p>
