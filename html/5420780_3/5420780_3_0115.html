   <p>The famous "Round Table" in Wilken's Cafe on Clark Street in the Loop, will become even more famous. This particular table has been the one used exclusively by the "Builders of the Danish Colony" when they met to discuss their important problems. They would meet in the Wilken's Cafe, and sit for hours over their beer and aqua nitae</p>
   <p>The names of all the "Old Vikings" will be carved into the table top, and then the table will be sent to Denmark where it will be placed in a prominent place, probably in a museum.</p>
