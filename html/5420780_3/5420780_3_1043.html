   <p>The Movie Pictorial of August 29 contains an article and a large picture of Gerda Holmes, daughter of the Chicagoan Max Henius. The article, "An Actress of Viking Land," gives an excellent description of this talented young woman, who in less than two years became the leading lady for the Essanay Film Company here in Chicago. Her husband, Rapley Holmes, is engaged by S. N. A. Her best picture was, without a doubt, "A Song in the Dark," where she had the leading role, the blind girl, which was considered as one of the best portrayals of the season. Miss Holmes is considered a match for Clara Kimball Young, Lottie, and Mary Pickford.</p>
