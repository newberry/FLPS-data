   <p>The Danish actor, Mr. P. Fjelstrup, will soon arrive in Chicago. There will be a banquet in his honor at the Bismarck Hotel June 25. On June 27 he will visit the Danish Old People's Home, and on Sunday, June 28, he will make a public appearance at an entertainment arranged by Mr. Emanuel Johansen at Wicker Park Hall. Mr. Fjelstrup is a cousin of Dr. Fenger of Chicago, and his father, Captain Fjelstrup, lived in Chicago for many years, and is still remembered by the very first Danish pioneers in Chicago. Small wonder that his son now wants to greet old friends of his father!</p>
