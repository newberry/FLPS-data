   <p>On September 1, Dr. Max Henius, on behalf of two hundred Danish-Americans, purchased for 20,000 Kroner a piece of heather in Rebild Hills. The park is to be given to the Danish state and must never be cultivated; it takes in one thousand acres of land. On the deed will be written the names of all persons who sent money for this purpose to Consul C. H. Hansen, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Rebild Park is located half an hour's ride by railroad south of Aalborg and fifteen minutes' walk from Skorping station.</p>
