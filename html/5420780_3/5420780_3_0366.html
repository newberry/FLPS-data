   <p>Twenty-six years ago Denmark was given its Constitution and the people their liberty. Slavery was removed as a condition of labor; arrangements were made to secure everyone a bit of the social cake. Everyone was permitted an education; hence the celebration on June 5. Every county, every city or village is permitted to conduct its own political business, since it is permitted to hold elections for its own officials. We hope and pray that our old fatherland will always celebrate the Fifth of June.</p>
   <p>[In the celebration held here] Dr. Petersen, Editor Salmonsen, and Mr. Johnson spoke, and the Dania Singing Society sang. The festival was a success.</p>
