   <p>The well-known Danish author, Professor Karl Larsen, is at present working on a book about Danes in the United States, and he should like to get as many letters as possible written by Danish relatives to their sons and daughters in America, and letters sent from America to relatives at home. All letters will be returned and matters of a private nature will be carefully respected. With the letters people are requested to send such biographical information as they are able to supply for the full understanding of the letters that are to be used.</p>
