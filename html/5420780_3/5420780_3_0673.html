   <p>The first recipient of a stipend from the Constantin Fund was Ferdinand Anderson, 1626 North Washtenaw Avenue. Anderson has not made a visit to Denmark for the last thirty-eight years, so this trip will be a great pleasure for him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson was born in Copenhagen. He became a master mason, and emigrated to America. He came to Chicago in 1890 and soon became a member of all the Danish Societies in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He will leave about the middle of May for Rebilo, Denmark, in time for the fourth of July festival.</p>
