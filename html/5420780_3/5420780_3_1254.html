   <p>Danish-American Union in Esbjerg, Denmark, has sent a telegram to President Mckinley: "Our best wishes on the 4th of July. Sympathy for your weapons. We wish you a splendid victory." The President sent the union an answer back signed," Day, Secretary, White House." This was translated as day-secretary in Danish; the translator evidently thought that the American president had both a day and a night secretary. This caused a lot of amusement in the Danish-American press.</p>
