   <p>Senator Niels Juul will act as toastmaster, and the speech for America will be given by his Socialist opponent at the 4th District's congressional election, Attorney Otto Christensen. High school principal Th. Knudsen will speak on Denmark and its constitution. Congressman Victor Berger will discourse on the progress of the 20th century, and Miss Margaret A. Healy on the woman in America and abroad.</p>
   <p>Such a brilliant selection of speakers has hardly been presented at any previous national festival, and many words will be spoken at Riverview Park next Sunday, which certainly will be worthwhile listening to.</p>
