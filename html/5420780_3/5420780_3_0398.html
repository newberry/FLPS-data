   <p>The Scandinavian convention was held last Monday in the Workmen's Hall at Halsted and Ridgely Streets,for all the members of the eight societies. The Hall was decorated very artistically with American, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian flags. The president of the convention, Jacob Nielsen, wished every one welcome and explained the convention's purpose, which is to work for co-operation between the Scandinavian societies.</p>
   <p>After the banquet was over, Henry L. Hertz spoke on the major problem on the agenda of the convention; there are fifty thousand Scandinavians in Chicago, one eighth of the city's population. Certainly it is big enough to take care of its own needy countrymen.</p>
   
   <p>Captain Lange spoke on the necessity of erecting a large building for all the different Scandinavian societies so that they could meet under the one roof. This plan has been tried and has failed, but let us try again.</p>
