   <p>Kammerherre C. Bech of Engelsholm, Denmark, came to Chicago as the guest of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, and at the same time he visited his son, the Danish consul, George Bech. On November 3, some Danes gave a banquet in his honor at the Red Star Inn. C. Bech and E. M. Dalgas have both done much to cultivate the heather at home. He also gave a little lecture on this important means of preserving the national resources.</p>
