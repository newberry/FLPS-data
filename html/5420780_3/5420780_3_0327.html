   <p>p.2......The German Mr. Fimmerman recently proposed that the N.W. Business Association install an electric cross, spanning a distance of eight blocks from Humboldt Park Eastward on North Avenue, past Revyen, in order to honor the Danes on the 5th of June. Several Norwegians suggested that the cross be constructed just before the 17th of May, and lighted every night until after June 5. Thus both Norwegians and Danes would be honored.</p>
   <p>A committee, with an able countryman Corydon as chairman is in charge of the arrangements. The cross is going to cost $1,500.00, and it is hoped that both the street car company and the Edison Company will contribute towards covering the expenses.</p>
