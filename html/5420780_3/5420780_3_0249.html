   <p>Dania had a special meeting August 26. The city administration had requested that the society stop selling liquor or get a saloon license, which cost $500 a year. This is out of the question. It was decided, however, to buy a bar permit at $2.50, for every evening the bar is open. But liquor is not sold only at the bar; the janitor of Dania also sells liquor in the different club rooms. A committee was formed, consisting of Charles Ryberg, M. Houlberg, and Charles Wilde, to see what can be done when the renting of the bar expires on April 1, 1904. Most of the members are in favor of the idea that Dania take over the bar and get a license for the entire building.</p>
