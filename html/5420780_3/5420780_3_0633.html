   <p>The Reverend L. Heiberg writes a very severe criticism of the Thingvalle Line, the Danish line between New York and Copenhagen. He went on the line with his family. They were not told before leaving that they had to bring their own bed clothing. The mattress they had to sleep on was small and very thin and stank terribly. The soup served in third class was full of maggots. The food, fish, and meat were such that it was impossible to eat. The result was that the minister had to buy bread from the baker and good food from the chef in the kitchen. But the prices were such that the whole family was half starved when they arrived at Copenhagen. The minister did not have money enough to buy sufficient food for his wife and children. No wonder that he asks the Line to tell the truth to prospective travelers, or to give better service to its many customers.</p>
