   <p>The Danish king, Christian IX, has celebrated his eightieth birthday. On his birthday all the Danes of Greater New York were gathered at a big celebration in his honor. The Danish colony in Chicago, which has the greatest number of Danes in the United States, did not give any celebration whatsoever on that occasion.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The colony was at that time very socialistic and against all kings and royalty. Most of them were for a republic and looked upon the old king as a German.]</p>
