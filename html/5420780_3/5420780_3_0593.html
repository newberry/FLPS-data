   <p>The immigration law was passed for the purpose of preventing competition from immigrants because of the lower European standards of living. It was expected, in theory, that it would maintain both the wage scale and the opportunity for continuous employment of the American laborer.</p>
   <p>That it has not fulfilled the mission and purpose of its proponents is obvious from present economic conditions. It might be advisable, for the sake of furthering employment and prosperity, to look into that question anew to decide whether or not the immigration restrictions are in part responsible for our present economic grief.</p>
   <p>Immigration was reduced to 97,139 last year, as compared with the one million ten-year pre-war average. Since 1881, twenty million people immigrated to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the United States. This steady influx to our population, made up of the hard-working German, Irish, Polish, Scandinavian and other peoples, absorbed much of our slack by creating a perpetual demand for the surplus products of the farms, mines, buildings, and other industries,</p>
   <p>The cessation of immigration, which is the cause of the slower growth of population in this country, has tended to slacken consumption, which in turn helped create unemployment.</p>
   <p>America is completely a nation of immigrants. It has always been a haven to those oppressed. The question raised, is whether or not the United States might be well repaid for a disinterested investigation of the effects of the immigration law on its prosperity.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the law should be liberalized. As it now stands, the father, the mother, the husband, the wife, and children over the age of eighteen of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>a citizen are denied entrance to this country, except through the quota. The above mentioned persons certainly should be admitted as non-quota immigrants. The resulting harshness under the present law is very obvious.</p>
