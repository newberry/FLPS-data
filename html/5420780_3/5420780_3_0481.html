   <p>In 1908 the Ebenezer congregation tore down the old wooden church and built a new building on the two lots owned by the church. The new church was built of pressed face-brick, in modified Gothic style, facing Rockwell Street. The tower lends somewhat of a medieval castle effect to the whole structure. The windows are glass mosaics in which appear many Christian symbols. The new church was dedicated February 14, 1909. Much of the work on the building was done very reasonably or altogether free of charge by members of the church.</p>
