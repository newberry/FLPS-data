   <p>The Danish-American Association grew out of the festivities for the centennial celebration jubilee of Hans Christian Andersen's birthday. This celebration showed that the Danes in America work together, and the net result was nine thousand dollars for the Children's Home in Chicago. Most of the shares have been bought. The aim of the society is not to make a lot of money for the shareholders, but everyone will get a little interest on his share each year. The real aim of the society will be to further the cultural connection between Denmark and the United States. Mr. Charles J. Ryberg has been one of the most active members of this society in Chicago.</p>
