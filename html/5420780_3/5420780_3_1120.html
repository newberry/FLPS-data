   <p>The old Danish socialist, P. Geleff, has started to edit a new paper, Illustreret Bibliotek (Illustrated Library).</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: P. Geleff was one of the first socialist agitators in Denmark. He had to leave the country when he, with several others, tried to hold a public meeting in spite of the police. This led to a clash between the police and the crowd. The leaders got the choice between jail or exile.]</p>
