   <p>The actress Elizabeth Riis, from the Dagmar Theater in Copenhagen, came on a visit to Chicago. The papers had been against her coming, but she was very well received and much liked by the colony. She had with her a prologue written by the great Danish poet, Holger Drachmann. She was a splendid storyteller, and she told many stories. She was first invited by the Young People's society on the West Side. Dania arranged a meeting for her, and she paid a visit to Harmonien. The Danish Central Committee met and decided to invite her to a great meeting sometime in August when she returns from her trip to the Pacific coast.</p>
