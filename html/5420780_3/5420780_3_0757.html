   <p>Several Danish-Americans have gotten together with the intention of buying a piece of heather in Denmark to be preserved as a Danish-American National Park, which is to be given to the Danish State. On the deed will be found the names of all persons who gave money for this purpose. The intention is not to cultivate the heather, but to preserve it as an unspoiled piece of Danish nature. Consul C. H. Hansen, Chicago, is the treasurer who stands ready to receive money for this cause.</p>
