   <p>To-morrow the Danes in Chicago will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Danish consititution. We Norwegians, who remember our historic day, the Seventeenth of May, 1864, can understand the enthusiasm of the Danish colony.</p>
   <p>The headquarters of the festival committee will be at Scandia Hall, where eighteen Danish organizations will meet. They will march down Michigan Avenue and meet the South Side organizations in the downtown district, where they will take an Illinois Central train to Elliott's Park. The principal speakers will be Carl Antonsen, the Reverend Adam Dan, and Henry L. Hertz.</p>
   <p>It is likely that a great many Norwegians will participate in the festival. We Norwegians are in many ways connected with the Danes, who for four <span class="page-break">\2</span>hundred years shared our sorrows and our joys.</p>
   <p>Danish businessmen will participate in the parade with floats representing Denmark and America. A knight on horseback will lead the procession, which will have about forty horses and buggies. Emmanuel Johnson, the well-known theatrical director, is in charge of the procession. There will also be an orchestra of twenty-five pieces.</p>
