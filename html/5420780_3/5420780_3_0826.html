   <p>The Drachmann social at Central Music Hall drew a good-sized audience, and the guest of honor was awarded thunderous acclaim as he appeared on the platform, which was beautifully decorated with Danish and American flags and with rows of palms.</p>
   <p>The social opened with an organ solo by Miss Ingeborg Sorensen.....The Danish Singing Society Harmony sang "Do You Know Denmark?" and "We Gay Fellows" under the direction of Professor Victor Lanzkys, and reaped well-deserved applause. After two piano solos by Thorvald Atterstrom, who proved to be an excellent master of his instrument, the guest of honor appeared on the platform and was introduced by the chairman of the committee on arrangements, Mr. Peter J. Noer. The applause began as soon as the author-poet appeared, and continued for a considerable period of time.</p>

   <p>Finally, quiet was restored and Mr. Drachmann was given the chance of presenting a prologue written by him for the occasion.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the prologue, the poet had to reappear to receive a laurel wreath. After the storm of applause had subsided, Miss Bokken Lasson ....sang Danish folk songs....later offering three "Drachmann songs".</p>
   <p>She received much applause and two bouquets of American Beauties.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society Bjorgvin, directed by Professor John L. Swenson, sang Reisiger's "Olav Trygvason" in a most splendid manner. After prolonged applause, the singing was resumed with Grieg's "Norona Kvad"....and again with "Paul on the Hilltop".</p>
   <p>The social was very successful, though a larger attendance had been expected. Many Norwegians were present in tribute to the great Danish <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>author-poet. The net income of the reception was estimated at four hundred dollars.</p>
