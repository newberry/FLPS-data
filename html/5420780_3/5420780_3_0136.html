   <p>Baker F. W. Hansen, 447 West Chicago Avenue, has started to advertise his Dansk rugbrod (Danish pumpernickel). Most Danes born in Danmark find the American white bread too soft and they generally long for the far harder and more healthy Danish bread made of rye. This bread is mostly used for the well-known Danish sandwiches of the open kind.</p>
