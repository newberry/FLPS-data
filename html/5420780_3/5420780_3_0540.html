   <p>The folk dancers and athletes of the St. Stefan Youth Society gave a demonstration of old Danish dances and modern Danish gymnastics last Thursday in Hamilton Park, at the request of the Park Commission. The performance was attended by a large American audience, including a number of Chicago public school teachers.</p>
   <p>The demonstration was very successful, and earned much applause and favorable comment.</p>
   <p>Much of the credit, as far as the dances are concerned, should go to their able instructor, Miss Dagny Pedersen.</p>
