   <p>Our well-known author and lecturer, Mr. Olaf Linck has recently been in Chicago on his way West.</p>
   <p>Mr. Linck has been here before and is usually embarked upon some extensive trip. He is a keen observer and an enjoying and reliable writer. He has written two books of his impressions of America: "Danes under the Stars and Stripes" and "The Chance over there."</p>
   <p>This time the trip goes to Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, when he, with the permission from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, will reside and study the remnants of the famous Sioux Indian Tribe. Later on he will visit the Indians of the South.</p>
   <p>Of his studies he will write a book.</p>
