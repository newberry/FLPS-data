   <p>The practical result of the Youth Convention was the formation of a five-man committee consisting of: the Reverend K. Gjorup, Vice-Consul Cldenburg, Henry L. Hertz, C. Madsen (from the Young People's Society on the West Side), and C. Hvass, of Dansk Folkesamfundskreds on the South Side.</p>
   <p>The Committee is to help organize in every settlement a group of men and women who will help newcomers from Denmark meet the new conditions in America as quickly as possible, and to protect the Danish girls against the white slave-dealers.</p>
