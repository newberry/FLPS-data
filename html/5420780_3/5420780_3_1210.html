   <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Riis, Danish actress from Copenhagen, who has been visiting the Danish colonies in America, left for Denmark, Sept. 11th, from New York harbor. During her stay of three months she appeared in thirty-three towns. She left with a profit of about $2,000. The papers says that she "was a fairly good actress" but her personality was very winning and she was very well-liked by all who came in contact with her. The paper complains that prominent Danes in the colony monopolized her; which made it impossible for her to get the right impression of the colony as a whole.</p>
