   <p>The beloved old Dane, Fritz Frantzen, has been knighted by the King of Denmark. There are several reasons why "Old Fritz" was made a Knight of Dannebrog. First, because of the heroic battles he fought in 1864 [in the war between Denmark and Prussia], and also for his activities here in Chicago. It is the highest honor that can be bestowed on any man to be knighted by the Danish King. We can be sure that he upon whom the honor is bestowed has done many things worthy of mention.</p>
