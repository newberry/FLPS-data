   <p>The editor quotes an article by the great Danish poet, Jeppe Askjaer, in which the poet says that he does not want Danish heather cultivated; he finds a beauty here that ought to be preserved. May the editor of Revyen correct the poet; it is not the intention of the Danish-Americans to buy a piece of heather to have it cultivated but just to preserve it as it is, and to make it a park or gathering place for themselves during their visits home. This idea has been put forth by both Revyen and the Pioneer for some time, so the article by the poet is based on a misunderstanding. The Danes in the United States agree with him wholeheartedly.</p>
