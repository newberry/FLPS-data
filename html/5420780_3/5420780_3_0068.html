   <p>Peter Knudsen, 5820 South Morgan Street, was found shot through the head last Thursday morning, beside a small pond in Washington Park.</p>
   <p>The body was found by the police officer who fired the fatal shot. He said he had seen Knudsen walking in the park in such a way that he seemed suspicious, and when he shouted at him he started to run. The officer then fired a shot at him, and Knudsen returned fire and then disappeared.</p>
   <p>The officer claims he did not know Knudsen was hit.</p>
   <p>The police are puzzled about the whole affair, because Knudsen was known as a respectable man who would never be expected to anything unlawful.</p>
   <p>His brother Nels Knudsen can give no solution to the problem. He says: "Peter has always been a respectable man. I can't understand it."</p>
