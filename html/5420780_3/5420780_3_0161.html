   <p>On Nov. 10, 1886, the Danish Singing Society Harmonien was organized by immigrant Danish singers.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the society was to keep alive an interest for Danish music and song.</p>
   <p>The history of the society is long and interesting, and because space is at a premium, we will only mention a few highlights in its history.</p>
   <p>In 1915, a chorus of about twenty singers went to the World's Fair in San Francisco. At that time they gave a number of concerts throughout the west.</p>

   <p>In 1917, the memorial concert for the composer Niels W. Gade was held here in Chicago, and a mixed chorus of one hundred and fifty voices participated in it.</p>
   <p>The Society's Concert tour to Denmark, in 1924, was the highlight of highlights in their history. The chorus consisted of about thirty voices, and more than thirty concerts were held throughout Denmark. This concert tour brought about one hundred thousand crowns in box-office returns, a sum which was given to charity in the different towns in Denmark where they had concerts.</p>
