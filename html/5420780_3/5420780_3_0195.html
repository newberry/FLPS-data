   <p>Walhalla's Autumn ball last Saturday drew a large and youthful crowd, which with enthusiasm cultivated the dance, and could hardly sit still while the short comedy "Twenty-three Minutes in Tjaereby Inn" was presented on the stage. The actors did a good job, but were handicapped by the poor acoustics in the Hall.</p>
   <p>The affair broke up at 3 A.M. and netted the society a nice little sum.</p>
