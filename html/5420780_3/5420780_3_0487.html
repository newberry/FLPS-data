   <p>The Ebenezer Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church has arranged a great Danish song festival in the German Lutheran Church on Paulina St., between North and Milwaukee Ave., on Sunday October 14th. This church has a seating capacity of 2,000. Choirs from Racine, Kenosha, and Chicago will sing. The profit from the concert will go to a sanatorium in Brush, Col., an institution supported by the Danish Lutheran church and well worth giving a helping hand.</p>
