   <p>P. Marinus Paulsen has been so long before the public as a Composer, Violinist, and Conductor, that it seems almost superfluous at this time to mention the qualities that have made his success so pronounced. Yet the readers of Danish Times and the colony in Chicago have not had the opportunity to come in immediate contact with this Danish-American artist. Mr. Paulsen has recently returned to us fresh from the professional triumphs accorded him in the large cities of the country. He has conducted the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra for the past three years, besides directing the largest and best known choral societies of Indiana. Among them are: the Marion Civic orchestra, and the Fort Wayne Symphony orchestra, and his art has met with instant recognition everywhere.</p>
   <p>Numbered among his violin students are the best younger artists of the Central States. One of his pupils and proteges, Miss Andry Call, was the winner of the first prize in the National American Music Festival at Buffalo in October.</p>

   <p>Miss Call competed with representative violinists from all parts in America, so the event was a distinct reflection of credit on her teacher.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paulsen is well-known as a composer, and his works for orchestra have been played by the Chicago Symphony orchestra and many other large orchestras. The Choral work from his pen has received performance everywhere, notable among these was the performance in New York of his Cantata, "Love Trumphant," at St. Paul's Cathedral, at which time the musical critics were unanimous in their praise.</p>
   <p>In 1921, the Indiana Music Teachers elected him president of the State association, and he was recently elected a member of the National Association of past State presidents.</p>
   <p>At present, Mr. Paulsen is a member of the faculty of the Sherwood Music School, with headquarters in the Fine Arts Building, here in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The Danish Colony will, no doubt, again include this prominent musician in their musical activities.</p>
