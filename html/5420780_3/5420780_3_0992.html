   <p>About thirty-five years ago, Henry L. Hertz, who then had a summer home at Pistakee Bay, near McHenry, Illinois, organized the Pistakee Yacht Club and was for many years Commodore of this organization. He is still an active member.</p>
   <p>At the last annual meeting he was elected an honorary life member of the club and it was decided to celebrate July Fourth of this year as Henry L. Hertz Day and the Commodore and his wife were invited to be the guests of the Pistakee Yacht Club.</p>
   <p>Commodore Hertz says that these four days spent at Pistakee were some of the happiest vacation days he has ever spent; the weather being just fine and the country and the lake being perfectly beautiful.</p>
   <p>A reception was tendered the Commodore and his wife on the Fourth of July, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>at the residence of Mrs. Schills and between two and four in the afternoon there was a perfect stream of visitors, who called on their old friend, the first Commodore of the club.</p>
