   <p>By the end of the fiscal year of the United States government, which is June 30, about half a million people will have arrived at the shores of America. This high figure has not been reached since 1892. Last year the figure for people arriving at New York from Europe was only 342,000.</p>
   <p>Most of the people come from Southern Europe and will not be of much help to the working class, as most of them will be under the direction of the Catholic priests. America will get a lot of cheap labor, and the cause of labor will be set back for a generation or two.</p>
