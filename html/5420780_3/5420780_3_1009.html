   <p>A small group of friends was present last Sunday at the boat, "Atlantic," to say good - bye to Mr. C. H. W. Hasselriis, who will leave for New York to take a position in one of the largest export firms there. It was mainly the members of Dansk Arbeider Sang Forening, (Danish Workers' Singing Society) and the District committee who were present, and who wanted to show their gratitude to Mr. Hasselriis for the work done by him, as cashier and president for the societies. This was brought out in the speeches by the following: Henry Hertz, Doctor Max Henius, and Carl Antonsen, at the affair held for the guest of honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Magnus Holm spoke in few, well chosen words of the assistance given him <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>on a recent trip returning from Denmark upon the unfortunate death of Jens Fuglsang.</p>
   <p>On behalf of the guest, Mr. Frank A. Phillipson presented Mr. Hasselriis with a silver shield. It was a festival that proved during the eleven years of his activity in Chicago, Mr. Hasselriis had made many good friends.</p>
