   <p>The Danish Baptists started their first congregation in America in Wisconsin in 1856; now they have fifty-five churches with 3,800 members. The Danes do not care much about their language; almost all Sunday schools are conducted in English, and many Danish families join the American Baptist Church in their town. Reverend N. L. Christensen thinks that in about twenty-five years it will be hard to find a Danish-speaking Baptist in the United States.</p>
