   <p>The twelfth annual masquerade of the Dania Club, took place yesterday evening in the North Side Turner Hall. The attendance was large. Many Germans and Americans were present, besides the Danes and the Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The masquerade opened with a Chinese parade. The appearance of Prince Carnival put an end to this foreign foolishness by bringing everyone back to reality.</p>
   <p>The main presentation was the farce, "Puritanical Moral Philosophy," or a "Chapter from the Prayer Epidemic". On the stage a Chicago street is represented, with a saloon. The saloonkeeper (portrayed by J. Josephson) is conversing with his guests. McCarthy (A. Volguarz) approaches and asks the people to stop drinking while he begs the saloonkeeper to give up his barbarian trade. But as all his eloquence is in vain; an entire army of praying ladies comes to the rescue of McCarthy. But the saloonkeeper seems to understand his business. Supported by his gallant guests he offers the ladies a sample drink. So great was his <span class="page-break">\2</span>power of persuasion, so enticing were the filled glasses that none of the ladies could resist. Many other glasses followed the sample drink. McCarthy drinks to the health of the saloonkeeper and general gaiety reigns amongst the fanatics.</p>
