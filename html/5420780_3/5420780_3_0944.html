   <p>The Marines of the King's Navy of Denmark were on parade. Thirty thousand flashing uniforms marched before the Committee of Selection. Perfect military precision, the inspiring martial music of the King's Band, a perfect setting for the selection of only thirty men who represented the best military perfection out of this army of well-trained men. And--here among you is one of the thirty who was selected.</p>
   <p>With this feather in his hat, Soren Sorensen, the genial and capable proprietor of the Union Grove Creamery Company, left for the shores of opportunity. It was just thirty years ago that he first sighted the gleaming Statue of Liberty as he neared the land which was to mean so much to him and his family, yet to come.</p>
   <p>Sorensen had served an apprenticeship under the splendid training schools of Denmark in the creamery business. He was well equipped <span class="page-break">2</span>to enter this field of effort, as Denmark is one of the most prominent of all the nations of the earth in the dairy and creamery business.. But Sorensen was not in a hurry to start. He was waiting for the opportunity that he knew would come. He spent a brief period getting acquainted with the language and customs of the American people, and then embarked in his first business venture, with the enthusiastic help of his young and attractive wife, Ane Kirstine.</p>
   <p>The start was a small one, and the discouragements were many. The large powerful dairy concerns of Chicago thought that he would not go far. His single milk route which he operated himself, seemed so small and ineffective compared to the many, many routes that the large dairies were running. But Sorensen persisted. He worked hard--his wife worked hard, and soon their little business began to grow. They were crowded for room at the little place at 1249 North Western Avenue, and larger quarters were necessary to house the growing business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Just four years after the first start, Sorensen moved his dairy business to the modern plant he had built for it at its present address at 1521-1525 North Ridgway Avenue, Chicago, Ill. This was in 1912. His plant, as good as any in the city, although not so large, was then named the Union Grove Creamery, and the dairy products produced for their high quality under the able supervision of Mr. Sorensen, soon became known to the rapidly growing population of the Great west Side of Chicago. He has ever kept pace with progress. As soon as new and better machinery for processing his milk and other dairy products, was developed, Sorensen immediately investigated it. He has always followed this policy and today, his plant is modern, scrupulously clean, and up to the minute in efficiency.</p>
   <p>Milk, sweet, cool, and refreshing, and all the products that come from milk, the sweet rich cream, the golden butter, the flaky creamed cottage cheese, buttermilk--either cultured or homechurned, are distributed by the trucks and wagons of the Union Grove Creamery Co. The man who was <span class="page-break">4</span>selected, one out of a thousand, from the King's Navy, has brought the same efficiency to his dairy.</p>
   <p>Sorensen has not confined himself altogether to his business. He realizes the necessity of a man doing good things where they can be done. So,he has helped in the Lion's Club, he early became a member of the Danish Old People's Home Society. Dania, the popular social club of the Danes of Chicago has had his name on its roster for years, he is a member of the Medinah Temple, and all that it means in preparation and character, and because of his ability and effective personality, he has been chosen as an active member of the Danish National Committee, and of the Danish group of the World's Fair Committee.</p>
   <p>But these are all clubs and societies of a personal nature. They had nothing to do with his business. So Sorensen thought that was a phase of his life that should not be neglected. He belongs to the Milk Council of Greater Chicago, and to the Chicago Milk Dealers Association.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Dairymen's Country Club, with a beautiful recreation estate in the north woods of Wisconsin elected him to active membership, and the Century Dairy Club, of the Century of Progress of Chicago carries his name on its roster of membership.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sorensen's son, Thorwald, has been associated with his father in the business for several years. He is married, and four years ago, his charming wife made it possible to call the subject of our story--grandfather. The granddaughter, Jane Marie Sorensen, appears on the back page of this magazine. Her pretty appearance and rosy complexion, her mother, Gertrude Sorensen says, are the direct result of drinking milk each and every day. Thorwald is a young man in his late twenties who promises to show the startling qualities and attractive personality of his father. Thorwald's sister, Margaret is a Junior at our State University at Urbana, Illinois.</p>

   <p>Soren Sorensen, himself, is Treasurer of the Jubilee and World's Fair Book, and we take pleasure in congratulating him in this public manner on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Union Grove Creamery Company, and may his success be just as great in the coming years, as it has been in the past.</p>
