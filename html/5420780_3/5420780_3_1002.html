   <p>Many anecdotes are told about Henry L. Hertz. One of the best is the one about "Hertz's wooden leg". This leg has become an "institution" in Chicago. There is never a banquet where Hertz's wooden leg has not been served. And it certainly isn't a dry fare.</p>
   <p>Hertz loves to demonstrate what he says every one-hundred-per-cent American should be able to do; namely, to stab his leg with a knife without blinking. There is always great applause when the "Borneo Doctor," Dr. Niels Johnson, proposes a toast for "Hertz's wooden leg"; this is the signal for telling several stories about this famous leg.</p>
   <p>It has been told that Hertz demonstrated the "knife trick" at the court of Christian IX, and that Queen Louise promptly fainted. Yes, Henry would do something like that.</p>
   
   <p>For many years, while he had his office in the City Hall (where the weather forecaster's office is), he would compete with Professor Cox in forecasting the weather. Hertz said that he could always feel, days in advance, any change in the weather. And when Cox resigned Hertz applied for his job.</p>
   <p>The local writers often referred to Hertz as the "Chief with the broad blue nose". He had many such titles. Those he liked best were "The Old Eagle" or "The Bridge Builder"; it was said that Hertz had built a bridge of culture between Denmark and the United States.</p>
   <p>It was Hertz who conceived the idea of an American National Park in Denmark. It was he who bought the broad acres of heather at Rebild, Denmark, and donated it for this purpose. He is on the board of the American-Scandinavian Foundation. He is a member of every worthwhile Danish society or lodge. He is always in the lead.</p>
   <p>Hertz is eighty years old, but still very active. Yes, he may live to be a hundred. He has never been ill,except for a couple of times when he was run down by streetcars.</p>
   <p>Yes, may the "Old Eagle" live long!</p>
