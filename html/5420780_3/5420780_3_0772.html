   <p>p. 1. Col. 6. Henry L. Hertz of Chicago, is the recipient of a cablegram from Dr. Max Henius, representing Chicago Danish-American organizations. He advises that the Danish-American Day, July 4th' was a phenomenal success. The celebration of our Independence Day at the Aarhus Exhibition was brought about by resolutions adopted at a mass meeting of Danish-American lodges and singing societies at the annual Danish Constitution Day picnic at Riverview Park where 12,000 Danes were gathered.</p>
   <p>Dr. Max Henius, the official speaker of the day, made this statement, "This is, undoubtedly, the first time in history that a group of people, nationalized in a foreign country, had ever gathered to celebrate the national holiday of the land of their adoption in the land of their birth." Other speakers were:</p>
   
   <p>Count Carl Moltke, Danish Embassador to the U.S.A. who spoke about "The American from the Danish View-point," and Dr. Egan, American Embassador, to Denmark who spoke forcibly and appreciatively on "The American Citizens of Danish Descent." Ivor Kirkegaard, (Racine, Wis., Editor) announced that there are in America today 300 congregations, 200 churches, 6 hospitals, and over 400 societies (that have disbursed insurance and sick benefits in excess of 5,000,000 crowns) of Danish-Americans. This is a record that should make the mother country as proud as it does her children and grandchildren who are now citizens of the U.S.A.</p>
   <p>So well was Danish-American Day received by all Danish Authorities that in the evening a sumptuous banquet was served by the Aarhus City Council to 2,000 guests, a majority of whom were Danish-American visitors to the fair.</p>
