   <p>At the banquet in the Red Star Inn, Mr. C. Bech of Denmark spoke about the proposal made by a Danish-American, in a paper published in Denmark, for the cultivation of the heather. He wanted the Danish-Americans to buy a heather plantation in Denmark, where the Danish-Americans home on a visit could meet for great festivals. Such a heather plantation had now been picked by Mr. E. M. Dalgas, namely Hjelm. It is now up to the Danes in America to raise the money necessary to buy it.</p>
