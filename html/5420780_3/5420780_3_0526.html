   <p>p.4.......Major S. L. Rasmussen, who on June 5th celebrates his 74th birthday, can at this time also celebrate the 50th anniversary of his participation in the Civil War. He fought in many battles in which the number of fatalities reached more than 20,000. The major informs us that in those days a battle in which only 6,000, 7,000 men were killed and wounded, did not count.</p>
