   <p>J. Christian Bay of Des Moines, Iowa, has written his first book, which was printed in Denmark. Its title is Hvad Gud har sammenfojet. Sore Amtstidende writes about it: "It does not contain one bit of talent, only a lot of talk and false sentiments".</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Mr. J. Christian Bay is now the head librarian of Crerar Library here in Chicago. And today he himself smiles at this youthful effort of his. Mr. Bay has since written many a book well worth reading.]</p>
