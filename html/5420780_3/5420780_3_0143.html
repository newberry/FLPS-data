   <p>Mr. Chas. J. Rydberg left last Saturday for New York and Washington, to represent the "Lower Danish-American Postal Rates Committee." Petitions bearing over 15,000 signatures from about five hundred American cities have been beautifully bound in morocco by the Danish bookbinder Brendstrup. This impressive volume will be turned over to Count Moltke, Danish Embassador to the U.S.A., to be forwarded by him to the Danish government. Mr. Rydberg plans to have one or two prominent New York Danes accompany him to Washington where, during an audience with President Taft and Postmaster General Hitchcock, he is confident of getting a favorable opinion and the support of the movement from our own government.</p>
