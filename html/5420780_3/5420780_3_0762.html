   <p>p.2.col.4.....Mr. Saxtorph-Mikkelsen, who so endeared himself to our Chicago Danes at the Old Peoples Home Festival, gave his first personal recital last Saturday at D.B.S. No. 17 hall. He was greeted by a large and friendly audience that listened, spellbound, to his masterly interpretations of a wide selection of Aakjoers folk songs and poems. The song-lecture was a masterful presentation of a beautiful, mellow, well-trained baritone voice, of unusually wide range, combined with an artistic and dramatic ability that was refreshing. Even the simplest folk-song took on the guise of a classical composition. Songs to his own lute accompaniment were especially pleasing, moving his listeners at will to either tears or laughter. Aakjoer is popular in Denmark today because of Mikkelsen and the open hearts and ears in America bid fair to make Aakjoer Danish-America's favorite as well.</p>
