   <p>Andrew Carnegie has donated $1,000 for an organ for the Trinitatis Danish Lutheran Church. The congregation already has $1,600, and will thus be able to pay for the organ, which will cost $2,500. The Miller Brothers, Hagerstown, Maryland, will start to put in the organ right after Easter, and the work should be finished about the middle of April. Of the 150 organs installed by the Miller Brothers, Mr. Carnegie has given or paid one fourth to one half of the entire cost. No wonder that Reverend Rordam and the whole congregation are very happy!</p>
