   <p>p.5........Miss Henni Forchammer, delegate to the International Women's Congress in Washington, is at present in Chicago, as the guest of Jane Adams at Hull House.</p>
   <p>For several years Miss Forchammer has been one of Denmark's delegates to the League of Nations, and should therefore be in a position to give reliable and authentic information as to what can be done, and what has been accomplished to promote World Peace.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson's great thought of such an association received a cold shoulder in this country, therefore the U. S. are on the outside. This, no doubt, has weakened the activities of the League of Nations to some extent, but much more has been accomplished, than the people here realize.</p>

   <p>As much political dust has been stirred up over this question, it will do much good to learn something from an authentic source.</p>
   <p>Miss Forchammer will give a lecture on this theme this evening, the 29th., at St. Ansgar Church at 8:00 o'clock, and all are welcome. - Admission 35 cents.</p>
   <p>We hope, many will avail themselves of this opportunity to come and hear our so well known countrywoman.</p>
