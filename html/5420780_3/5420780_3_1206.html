   <p>The Danish actor, Mr. Dahlbom, dropped dead on Clark Street, Dec. 11th. He was a very good actor; but he was not very much liked because when he had money he became very proud and stuck up, and when he had no money he was sour and nasty. The theater company with which he played here in town had just gone out of business. He was about 60 years of age. Only six followed him to his last resting place on Mount Olive. Carl Antonsen said a few words at the cemetery. The funeral was paid by "Den danske Skytteforening" and some private friends on the West Side. See Revyen, Dec. 25th, 1897, page 4.</p>
