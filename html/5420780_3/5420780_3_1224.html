   <p>Vice-Consul C.M. Koedt of Chicago, has been given a three months vacation. He is going to Denmark and England. It is pretty certain that he will not return. He was never very well liked among the Chicago Danes because of the manner in which he conducted himself in connection with the Hans Christian Andersen statue affair.</p>
   <p>In Revyen, June 5, 1897, we hear that he left a debt of $1,000 and that many Danes had a hard time to get money they had coming from the Consulate. Long before he left, his creditors and garnisheed his wages. The Consul, Mr. A. Petersen, had to go to Washington to clear up the whole affair.</p>
   <p>(According to Revyen, July 10th, 1897, Mr. Koedt is a brother of the wellknown Danish business man in Copenhagen, Pesche-Koedt.)</p>
