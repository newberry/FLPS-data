   <p>The Danish King and Queen, having ended the official period of mourning, are the guests of the German Kaiser who greeted the royal pair in a most cordial manner.</p>
   <p>They were received by the Commander in Chief of the Army and the Commanding Admiral of the Navy with a retinue, and were escorted to the railway station where the Kaiser and his family were waiting. Kaiser Wilhelm ordered every military establishment within the Reich to fly the Danish colors on the occasion and all officers of the army and navy to wear gala uniforms during the entire period of their visit.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the brewers of war scares in Denmark will have to look for some new fuel with which to keep the pot boiling.</p>
