   <p>He and Leffingwell took part in Baldwin's expedition to the North Pole in 1901 and 1902. In May they will go on another polar expedition, from which they will return in 1908. The cost of this expedition will be seventeen or eighteen thousand dollars. Most of the money was raised in England by the Royal Geographical Society and the Duchess of Bedford. The Geographical Society in New York has contributed $3,000, and Harper Brothers have already paid $2,500 for the book which will be written about the expedition.</p>
