   <p>The actress, Elizabeth Riis, from the Dagmar Theatre in Copenhagen, came on a visit to Chicago. The papers has been against her coming: but she was very well received and much liked by the colony. She had with her a prologue written by the great Danish poet: Holger Drachmann. She was a splendid storyteller and she told many stories. She was first invited by the young people's society on the West Side. "Dania" arranged a meeting for her, and she paid a visit to "Harmonien." The Danish Central Committee met and decided to invite her to a great meeting sometime in August when she returned from her trip to the Pacific coast. See Revyen, June 19, 1897 page 4.</p>
