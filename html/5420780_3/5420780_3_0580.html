   <p>Fowler, Col., was started 15 to 20 years ago as a Danish colony by the famous Danish Socialist Paul Geleff, who once lived in Chicago. Many Danes bought land here at $40 to $75 per acre, the same property is now worth at least $150 per acre. Here live about thirty Danish farmers with their families. Here also is a Danish Brotherhood lodge No. 261.</p>
