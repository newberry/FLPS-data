   <p>page 2 col. 4-5. Chas. J. Ryberg, Chicago, has organized a new society: Foreningen for billig Porto (The society for cheap postage). The Danes are dissatisfied because it costs 33% less to send a letter from here to Germany than to Denmark. 3,000 letters have been sent to 326 cities in 28 states, wherever there is a Danish society. The intention is to get as many people as possible to sign a petition and thus to force the Danish government to sign an agreement with the United States in this regard.</p>
