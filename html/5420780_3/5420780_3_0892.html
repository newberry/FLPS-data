   <p>We, the Danes, in the United States in general and in Chicago in particular, have lost our Grand Master. Dr. Max Henius was a master because he possessed qualities which set him apart from other men, and he was the Grand Master because he had the courage to trust his inspirations, to believe in his talents and use them for the benefit of his fellow-countrymen.</p>
   <p>When people immigrate to a foreign country and immediately are confronted with the task of adapting themselves to unfamiliar conditions and acquiring a new language, they feel the need of fellowship and mutual understanding, because people are like trees, they cannot be transplanted from one soil to another without some disturbance of the inner life taking place.</p>
   <p>It is equally true that irrespective of how willing men are to be transformed into Americans, they can only by a slow process change their habits and view points, and while that growth takes place, their hearts are divided between <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>love for the country of their birth, and interest in, and loyalty to, their adopted country.</p>
   <p>During that difficult and precarious period of development, a bewildered groping people seek out men who can be their leaders and guides; men who are like sheltering rocks in the storm or shade-giving trees in a thirsty land.</p>
   <p>Dr. Max Henius was just such a natural leader, endowed with foresight, imagination, and intellectual strength.</p>
   <p>He subscribed to the idea occasionally that no man should lose his indentity as a foreigner before the rich heritage of his blood has been transfused into the veins of American life.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>He maintained that American patriotism stands, among other things, for tolerance, hospitality and understanding toward foreign-born people.</p>
   <p>He also believed that a man need not cease to love the good things of his fatherland because he is being Americanized.</p>
   <p>To that end and with that idea in mind, he became a staunch supporter of Danish societies which stood for the maintenance of Danish culture in its various manifestations.</p>
   <p>When the discussion is of men who till their last day have retained an undying love for Denmark, the name of Dr. Henius must be singled out. He spared neither time nor effort to foster and secure the things which were dear to his Danish ancestors and which he felt should survive in the hearts and in the minds of men regardless of the distance and years which separated them from the homeland.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>He labored for this principle with such fervor that his enthusiasm was a challenge to other men who perhaps had lost interest, and it moved them to follow his example.</p>
   <p>At times he became a solitary dreamer, climbing to heights where we could not follow him, but he always revealed what he saw from his high tower. It can truthfully be said that his visions were not inane reveries or idle dreams. Many of them became realities which brought honor and enjoyment to the Danish colony, glory to himself, and stamped him as a truly outstanding progressive personality.</p>
   <p>It was mainly through his initiative that the Danish-American Society succeeded in bringing to this country such celebrated Danes as former Prime-Minister Borbjerg, and the late world-renowned literary critic, Professor George Brandes, as well as the student choir of the University of Copenhagen. He likewise gave not only moral support, but also material aid to various excursions made by several Danish societies to Denmark.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>These achievements gave the impetus to a movement resulting in an exchange of scholars between America and Denmark, and strengthened their friendly relationship.</p>
   <p>It is satisfying to add that not only was Dr. Max Henius great as the instigator of such momentous events as those just mentioned, or when addressing a large audience presenting and explaining one of his magnificent ideas, but he was equally true and great when engaged in a friendly chat with a fellow Dane reviving dear memories of bygone days in the little charming country of the North.</p>
   <p>It is perhaps significant that Dr. Henius died at a time when immigration has practically stopped and the sons and daughters of the immigrants are coming to the front.</p>
   <p>They are native Americans to be sure, yet in their souls are left family traits, which although deeply rooted in the old world, now through them have become part of American traditions.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Every nationality has its own noble and beautiful characteristics, and whatever the Danes may have contributed to life in this country in the way of material success, intellectual progress, and spiritual advancement can, at least to a great extent, be credited to the influence of that man, to whom we at this moment are paying our highest tribute.</p>
   <p>It should therefore be gratifying to us in America to know that that part of his life-work which dealt with Danes and Danish activities, his exhortations not to forget Denmark, its history, art, stories and songs, in the last instance crystalizes in American life.</p>
   <p>So while we mourn the loss of our leader, a man beloved by his friends and respected by his critics, our grief is tempered with the joyful realization that he was not removed from our midst before he had performed his duties, accomplished his task, and left his lofty ideals glowing in the heart of every Dane.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>His life was an inspiration, and if we could learn to live our lives as he lived his, we should be better men.</p>
   <p>His memory is a benediction and the echo of his voice will long linger among us.</p>
   <p>When the final chapter of the saga of the Danish immigrant has been written, the name of Dr. Henius will stand inscribed as the Grand Master.</p>
