   <p>Dansk Folkesamfund i Amerika (Danish People's Society in America) was started on April 18, 1887. The founder was the Reverend F. L. Grundtvig, Danish pastor in Clinton, Iowa (1883-1900), who was first president. The aim of the society is: 1. To promote Danish national life where the conditions are right. 2. To start and support Danish schools and people's high schools. 3. To hold public meetings and lectures. 4. To maintain a Danish library. 5. To have homes for the young people in all the big towns where there is a large Danish colony.</p>
   <p>A division of this society in Denmark had 4,000 members in 1889. In 1889 the second edition of the Reverend F. L. Grundtvig's Dansk Sangbog for det Danske Folk i Amerika (Danish Songbook for the Danish People in America), was published (4,000 copies). A third edition came in 1910 (2,000 copies). It contained 781 songs. A collection of melodies was published in 1911.</p>

   <p>The Society started a colony, Danevang, near El Campo, Texas. Another Danish colony was started in 1905 in Pine County, Minnesota, near Partridge Station (the name was changed to Askov). A library of 4,000 volumes was given to Grand View College; this library circulates between the different societies. It has twice been proposed to dissolve the Society, but the motion was laid on the table.</p>
