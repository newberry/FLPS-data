   <p>The first president of the first Danish National Committee, (which then had the pompous title: "The Joint Committee Of The Danish Societies For The Arrangement Of The National Festival In Chicago 1909), was Claus Jensen, born in Flade, Mors, Denmark, November 29, 1867. Having served his king and country, Claus Jensen emigrated to U.S.A. and was naturalized as a citizen 1905. Representing the Danish Brotherhood in America, Lodge No. 35 as a delegate to the First Danish National Committee, he, in the year 1920, returned to this representation of Danish Societies in Chicago and vicinity as a delegate from Danish Brotherhood, Lodge No. 298.</p>
   <p>It is recorded in the annals of the Danish National Committee, that no more faithful worker for the ideals and ideals, promulgated by said committee, has been found, than Claus Jensen.</p>
   <p>His enthusiasm and convincing logic had the effect and inspiration required <span class="page-break">2</span>to win over the most hesitating and, quite often, intolerant delegates, who could not or would not see the light, but who under his leadership became eager to work, with vigor and vim, for whatever cause Claus Jensen, or "Little Claus", as he popularly was named, thought worthy of support.</p>
   <p>His popularity and renown as an indefatigable and honest worker, during eight years as Supreme Trustee carried him, in the year 1927, into office as Supreme Vice-President of the Danish Brotherhood in America, an office he held to his death. When this organization celebrated its 50th anniversary (1931), he was eulogized, in the Jubilee-Book published for this event, as one of the foremost leaders and most tireless workers for the Danish Brotherhood in America.</p>
   <p>When the Danish Brotherhood in America in 1925 arranged a Joint-Tour to Denmark for its members, Claus Jensen fared forth on a visit to his "old country". He was knighted by the king for merit, and it was truly said among his friends and associates, that never had a more honorable knight, "without fear and without reproach", been created.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>His never failing love for the art and culture of his native land was given its best expression, when he, in the year 1928, in the month of April, on the 20th anniversary of the Danish Committees, brought the staging in Chicago, Illinois of the famous Danish historical play "Elverhoj" to a triumphal culmination, under the auspices of the 20th Danish National Committee. The remembrance of this literary and histrionic event still lives among his countrymen and women.</p>
   <p>On the 16th day of June, 1928, Claus Jensen was stricken suddenly and was brought to the Norwegian-American Hospital for an operation. The operation for gall stone being a success, he was brought back to his home,4429 Leland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Here he died after a sudden collapse on the 11th day of July 1928.</p>
   <p>The Danish Brotherhood in America, by popular subscription, caused a monument to be set upon his grave in Memorial Cemetery, Evanston, Illinois, <span class="page-break">4</span>which was unveiled on the 26th day of May, 1929. In the same year his many friends and family associates in Chicago raised his bauta at his birth-place in Denmark.</p>
   <p>In the year 1885 Claus Jensen married Mrs. Sophie Rasussen, for whose children: Marie (Mrs. Chr. Worm), Anna (Mrs. Peter Jensen), Hattie (Mrs. Niels Jensen), Petrea (Mrs. A. Freeding), Julie (Mrs. J. Egholm), and Johanne (Mrs. C. Carlson) he became a kind and loving father, whose memory is revered and loved by all and sundry.</p>
   <p>The characteristics of Claus Jensen were his honesty of purpose, his ability to make even the most recalcitrant worker see the cause in preferment to the individual, his unselfishness and his unswerving, all-absorbing, friendliness toward his fellow-men. He, whom Claus Jensen called a friend, could not suffer from the feeling of loneliness or desertion--for "Little Claus" had the divine gift to inspire the true feeling of brotherhood--and he never deserted his friends.</p>

   <p>In this year of our Lord, Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-three, five years after his death, the name of Claus Jensen, and the remembrance of his all-friendly attitude towards everyone he esteemed and liked, is still kept alive, and the memory of his friendship holds a charm, that carries many a man safely over these days of depression and cynicism, when former ideals and ideas seem to be sunk in the darkness of materialism and selfishness.</p>
   <p>And the remembrance of Claus Jensen and his faith in idealistic endeavor shall not die, as long as Danish ideals are honored in this, his and our, adopted land.</p>
