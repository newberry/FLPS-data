   <p>There was much suffering among the Danes during the winter of 1897. On February 3 a soup kitchen was opened at 287 west Erie Street. From 9 to 11 A.M. coffee and bread were served and from 2 to 5 P.M. soup with meat and bread. Everything was free of charge. Dr. Lee was chairman of the committee, Mrs. Ray-Andersen, vice-chairman, and Emanuel Johansen, treasurer.</p>
