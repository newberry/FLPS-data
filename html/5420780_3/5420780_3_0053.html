   <p>The singing society "Harmonien" which is planning a great concert for the orphanage home has invited all Danish societies in Chicago to send delegates, that "Harmonien" might rent the Central Music Hall at a cost of $250 for one evening. Twenty-five societies did send delegates. Niels Juul proposed that it would be a good idea to form some kind of a central committee for all Danish societies in greater Chicago. This was done, and this central committee did much to erect the statue of Hans Christian Andersen in Lincoln Park.</p>
