   <p>"To the Citizens Assembled, Independence Day Celebration, Rebild Park, Denmark: I have just learned of the remarkable gathering which is to be held at Rebild Park on July 4, and it is my pleasure and privilege to send you the cordial greetings of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>As a major metropolitan center of America, Chicago is very happy that the day commemorating the birth of our nation should be celebrated in such a ceremonious manner in Denmark. Since America became a free country, many Danes have come to our country, and have become citizens of the highest character, a large number of them having achieved outstanding leadership in commercial and civic posts--leadership of which our people, regardless of nationality, are justly proud.</p>
   <p>On this occasion, I also want to extend to the people of Denmark a cordial <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>invitation to visit our great Century of Progress Exposition. This marvelous World's Fair, contemplated originally to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of Chicago's birth, has long since developed into a gorgeous expression and picturization of the social, industrial, commercial, medical, and artistic progress of the entire world.</p>
   <p>Hence, it is your Exposition as much as it is ours, and I sincerely hope that Chicago will have the privilege and opportunity of extending the hand of welcome to many of your citizens this year.</p>
   <p>With every assurance of the high esteem which citizens of Chicago bear for the good people of Denmark, I have the honor to remain</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Edward J. Kelly, Mayor."</p>
