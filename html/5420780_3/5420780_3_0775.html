   <p>p.2.col.3.......Through the courtesy of the Danish Consul, Chicago, we have obtained a copy of the new "Danish Coppyright Law" which goes into effect July 1, 1909. The new law gives lasting protection to authors of books, magazines, news columnists, drawings, maps etc. Copyright is now granted for fourteen years with a renewal privilege of a like term at a total expense of $1.00. The old law provided protection for only one year.</p>
   <p>A copyright is obtained by application to the Librarian of Congress, Washington, D.C., a copy of the book, article, map, etc., on which the copyright is requested must accompany the application.</p>
   <p>Danish-American authors will undoubtedly avail themselves of this protection; thereby definitely stopping the "copy-cat" activities of such offenders as Charles Rasmussen and a couple of other "holy" firms who have excelled in the art of plagiarism.</p>
