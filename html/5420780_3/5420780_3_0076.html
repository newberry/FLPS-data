   <p>John Mattson, owner of a clothing store on the corner of North and Damen Avenue, has been forced to close. As treasurer of several Danish societies he has embezzled large sums of money: From the Sharpshooters, $150; from the Denmark Lodge, $500; and the Odd Fellow Lodge, Norden, $1,000. The two first societies are covered by bondsmen.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In Revyen, April 3, 1897, the Sharpshooters inform the colony that Mr. Mattson does not owe the society any money, that both books and money have been returned.]</p>
