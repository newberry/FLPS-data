   <p>Pastor A.T.Dorf has just returned from a trip to the Danish Church and School at Des Moines, Iowa , where he was Censor at the theological examination.</p>
   <p>With the annual meeting close at hand we pay Pastor Dorf a visit in his beautiful and hospitable home, and are invited into his magnificient library, where thousands of books are arranged as only an expert would want it done.</p>
   <p>Upon asking the Pastor if he had a pleasant trip, we received the answer. "To visit the Danish Church and School is not a very pleasant undertaking. It should be the uniting factor in our church work, but sorry to say, it has for many years been the cause of division and a storm center. In reality we are no further today in our school-work, than we were twenty-five years ago, and without a policy or plans."</p>

   <p>"Was an examination held this year?" we ask, as we have heard that some of the young people refused to take the examination.</p>
   <p>"Yes, four students took the very simple examination, which was held, as much for the sake of society as for the students. The question of who shall pass, must not be decided by the principal alone. When we object to the abolishing of this examination, it is primarely to protect the theological students liberty."</p>
   <p>"Where will the annual meeting be held?"</p>
   <p>"In Omaha, Nebraska. The last annual meetings have not been peaceful. A few of the delegates have been aroused over something and have at once made it a cabinet-question."</p>
   <p>Homelands are brewing also for this years meeting. The principal of the school, Pastor Hoijberg, and Pastor V.S.Jensen, the theological professor of the school has been asked to resign. The annual meeting will be then decided upon their <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>successors. Everything possible will be made to have Pastor Hoibjerg reappointed. While he is in possession of considerable executive ability, he has difficulty in co-operating with others, which has caused split in the ranks."</p>
   <p>"Did you give a lecture, while you were away?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, I gave a lecture on the history and development of the Free Church of America. I knew that within the Protestant Church a movement was about to try to unite the different denominations into one church on the lines of a Peoples Church of a Community Church. An other idea is to introduce religious teaching with the Public Schools. It is a pity to know, that in Chicago 4/5 of the children grow up entirely devoid of any moral or religious ideas or teachings, consequently 85% of our criminals are young people."</p>
   <p>I spoke particularly on the Gary-System of Schools. Lastly I spoke on the ever increasing demand for Ministers and a university education. What our church needs today is leaders of more than average ability. I touched upon the question for <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the reason, that Pastor Hoibjerg and his group were opposed to this idea in preference to the free education of ministers at our theological schools."</p>
   <p>"What do you expect to be the outcome of the annual meeting?"</p>
   <p>"That question is rather difficult to answer. So much depends on circumstances. The church managament has not formulated any plans. When we view the conditions at the school, one is inclined to consider the battle lost, with no time to win another."</p>
   <p>Paster Dorf, who is of the rather optimistic kind, sinks into worried silence and melancholically shakes his head when we ask him, if he is going to the annual meeting.</p>
