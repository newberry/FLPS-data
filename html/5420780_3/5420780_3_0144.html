   <p>p.2.......The society for obtaining lower postal rates to Denmark has begun its work in a quiet, unobstrusive manner but results already show a great interest in the movement. Requests for petitions began coming in almost as soon as the idea was first announced and already the signed petitions are piling up at a very gratifying rate. Our expectations are more than fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Petitions whose signatures do not fill the entire page are usually accompanied by a statement that there were no more Danes in the community and that all there had signed.</p>
   <p>Those whose lists are still unfinished are urged to complete their canvass as soon as possible so the deciding blow may be struck while the interest is at its peak. Certainly no Dane can refuse to sign a petition of such importance.</p>
