   <p>The various Danish organizations in Chicago inaugurated the Christmas party season already last Saturday, when the Danish Workers Singing Society gave its party in Martin Petersen's Hall. On Christmas Day the Danish Brothers-in-Arms gave a successful ball, and the singing society Magneten gathered around the Christmas tree in Jacobsen's Hall, where Santa Claus arrived in person, much to the enjoyment of young and old "Magnets." He did not stay long, however; he had to leave for Walhalla Hall, where Walhalla's children were waiting for him.</p>
