   <p>Yes, Chicago has had a real Danish baron. This is the story:</p>
   <p>About forty years ago when the title of the Danish Baron Bartholin Eichel naturally belonged to the oldest son Caspar, and the younger had become majordomo of the royal palace in Ribe, Denmark, and Knight of Dannebrog, he married Lady Castensjold. After two sons had been born, he eloped to America (Chicago) with his wife's chambermaid. Of course he took with him the family jewels and whatever ready cash he could lay his hands upon.</p>
   <p>Shortly after his arrival in Chicago,he enlisted in the army, and fought in the Civil War. At the end of the war he returned to Chicago to find his wife, the erstwhile chambermaid, operating a brothel with fifty or sixty female inmates at an address on Calumet Avenue. Of course this was just the thing for the Baron--this becoming the proprietor of a brothel.</p>

   <p>He was later admitted to the police force, and still later promoted to sergeant. He took advantage of his promotion and robbed the treasury of the Chicago Police Department. Naturally Mayor Washburn had to remove the Baron from the city pay roll, but the Mayor got him a job at the stockyards as night watchman--what"a come down" for a royal majordomo and Knight of Dannebrog--where he for many years herded swine (sic). Years later he was admitted to the veterans home in Milwaukee, where he shot himself, three years ago.</p>
   <p>Last week the police found the body of a woman in the basement of a house on Calumet Avenue. The body was that of Mrs. Bartholin, the royal lady's ex-cham-bermaid, and the only son of the baron's marriage was the murderer. In today's paper we see that the son committed suicide in Riceville, Iowa, last night. So ends the career of the "Danish Chicago Baron."</p>
