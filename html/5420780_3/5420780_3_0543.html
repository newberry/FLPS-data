   <p>St. Stefan's Youth Society enjoyed a large attendance at its Church Concert last Sunday, for the benefit of the Ashland High School.</p>
   <p>(Translator's note: This is a Danish "People's High School," not to be confused with the ordinary American high school.)</p>
   <p>The printed and artistically decorated program contained a tribute to the beloved school, which was established in the Michigan wilderness in 1882. After having been discontinued for a few years, it is now being reorganized. The outstanding performer on the program was Miss Clara Jensen, who accompanied on the piano by none less than Mr. Geo. Dupont-Hansen himself, sang Hartmann's "Cradle Song" and "I Know a Cozy Little Home."</p>

   <p>With supreme skill Mr. Dupont-Hansen rendered a few piano solos, among which were two of Beethoven's "Sonatas," and "Dawn" by Grieg.</p>
   <p>After the concert, a fine dinner was served.</p>
