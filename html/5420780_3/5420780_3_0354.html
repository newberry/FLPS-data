   <p>On June 5, 1899, it will be fifty years since Denmark got its constitution. Dania has invited all Danish societies to help celebrate this anniversary in a way fitting the occasion. The original central committee for all Danish societies in Chicago has split in two, one for the West Side and another for the South Side, and now we find that many societies will not participate if either of the two central committees has anything to do with the celebration. The split was cuased by the misunderstanding and mismanagement connected with the now famous Hans Christian Andersen statue.</p>
   <p>This article is written by Rud. P. Svendsen, president of the central committee on the West Side. He wants to know why some societies will not co-operate. The West Side central committee represents sixteen societies, so this Committee should be able to talk with authority as to the wishes of the West Side. He feels that here is an affair that merits united action from all Danes.</p>
