   <p>Sorte Hansen of Chicago was in New York last week and was interviewed there by Nordlyset. Mr. Hansen spoke about the socialistic colony which he, together with Louis Pio, started in Kansas in the eighties. It failed and Hansen, therefore, insists that socialism is impractical and never can be carried out in practice. He also insists that the socialist leaders in Denmark know this and that they do not want to realize the socialistic program even if they had a chance. The editor does not like this and tears into Mr. Hansen for saying all this. The editor is sure that socialism will become a political power when we have educated the masses to take care of their own interests.</p>
