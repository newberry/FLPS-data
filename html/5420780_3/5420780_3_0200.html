   <p>The singing society Magneten had ideal weather for its picnic in Friedel's park last Sunday.</p>
   <p>Beauty contests for both males and females, athletic contests and dancing to Mrs. Mathiesen's orchestra, kept everybody busy and happy. It was very warm, and thanks to the many thirsts which had to be quenched, the outing was, also financially, a great success.</p>
