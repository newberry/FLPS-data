   <p>The united lodges of the Danish Brotherhood in Chicago had a very successful Danish National Day June 4 in Elliot Park. More than three thousand people were present. Claus Jensen, chairman of the committee, welcomed the guests. P. Blond spoke on Denmark and the Danish constitution, and W. Kikkebuch, the supreme vice-president, on the Danish Brotherhood of America. There was also singing by Magneten and Hejmdal. It rained for a little while, but people did not mind.</p>
