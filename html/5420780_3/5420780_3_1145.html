   <p>Andrew J. Larson, who is well known among the Danish-American citizens of Chicago, was born in Mon, Denmark, November 4, 1852. He is the youngest of the three children of Lars Jensen and Gertrude Petersen, who were also natives of Denmark. The former was a farmer by occupation and died when the son was but eighteen months old. His widow is still living in her native land, at the advanced age of seventy-eight years.</p>
   <p>Andrew J. Larson remained with his mother until he reached the age of fifteen years, attending the common school. Thus his mother did all in her power to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>give him a training which would assist him in the battle of life. He worked for a time as a farm hand, but soon decided to emigrate to America. He therefore separated himself from all relatives and friends and crossed the Atlantic to seek friends and fortune among strangers. He first traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana, where his first employment was in sawing four cords of wood, which he did in payment for a week's board. He nect worked in a spoke factory in Indianapolis, remaining about six months. For the next two years he was in the employ of of a railroad, first in grading and later as a section hand.</p>
   <p>In 1872 Mr. Larson came to Chicago, which was then rising from the aches of the great fire. Without waiting to choose his work he took the first opening offered and engaged with the force which was excavating for the artificial ponds in Douglas Park. With the few dollars he was able to save from his earnings he soon started as a junk dealer, and found the enterprise quite lucrative. Later he commenced on a small scale the business in which he is still engaged, confectionery and school <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>supplies, and has found the work more to his liking. He has followed the habits of industry and frugality which were necessary in his early life and has been able to save a fair portion of his income. Besides enlarging and building up his business as the growth of his trade required, he has invested considerable in real estate. He has erected a fine two-story brick building, the lower portion of which is his own home, the upper floor being rented, In considering the success which has crowned his efforts, Mr. Larson can point with pride to the fact that all his wordly wealth is the product of the labor of his own hands and mind.</p>
