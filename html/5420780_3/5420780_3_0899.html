   <p>The whole being of Max Henius was saturated with social and ethical impulses, which his clear brain formed into desirable goals, and laid plans in all details for realization in life. He then began a campaign of communication by telephone, correspondence, travel, etc., stretching over weeks, months, or even years, until he had fulfilled his dream in life. Then after a few weeks of seeming relaxation and peace, he would suddenly flare up again with a new ideal, and the whole works started again! He reminded me of the prophet, Jeremiah, who, threatened and prosecuted, once said: "Often I have been tired of it, and often I have said: I will no longer speak in the name of the Lord, but it has become as a burning fire in my bones. I cannot keep quiet!" There was such an inner ethical fire burning in the soul of Max Henius, and his scientific and business genius was permeated by it. I said at the banquet celebrating his seventy-fifth anniversary: "Max Henius is a practical idealist. In modern religious language: Max Henius was a great saint."</p>
