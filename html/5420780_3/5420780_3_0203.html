   <p>The singing society Harmonien gave a well attended fish dinner last Thursday night in Metropolitan Hall. The occasion was the conferring of the society's golden lyre upon three of its founders: Marius Olsen, Mads Hansen and Hans Hansen.</p>
   <p>The dinner was superbly prepared and served by Ousen. Chas. P. Dittelfson was toastmaster and read the jolly Singer-Bulletin. The society's president, Viggo Jensen, Dr. Max Henius, "King" Jens Jensen, and many others spoke, and solo and choir numbers were sung in the most animated spirit.</p>
