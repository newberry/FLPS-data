   <p>This year the Danish colony is going to be blessed by two reviews (Revyer*). The first one will take place September 22 in Scandia Hall; it is written by P.V. Rutzou. The second Revy is written by Volkmar Johansen and will be played at Wicker Park Hall, September 29.</p>
   <p>The annual Revy is an old Danish custom and a special form of Danish humor or sarcasm. The Revy is made up of three or four acts with a lot of songs in which fun is made of the main events of the year that passed, and of certain persons that have laid themselves open to ridicule; in other words, the whole year passes in review under laughter and song.</p>
