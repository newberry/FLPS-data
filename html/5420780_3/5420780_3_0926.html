   <p>A very interesting personality is Mr. P. P. Reisenhus, President and Treasurer of the American Glove Co., and also President of the American Tanning Co., Chicago. He has made fortunes and, like many others in these last few years of depression, lost fortunes, but he has not lost his smile nor his alertness of mind and body, he is 74 years old but looks to be 20 years younger.</p>
   <p>Mr. Reisenhus travels a lot, east and west, when his many business connections call him, and he loves and reads poetry, that may to some extent account for his hopeful mind and youthful appearance. He was born at Undrup, near Horsens, where he went to a commercial school and afterwards worked as a clerk in a store. His wanderlust brought him to England and later on to America, in 1880 he came to Chicago, and found employment with the Munson Belting Co, His next and more important job was bookkeeping for Mattson and Aeppli Tanning Co., there he worked for several years, till he in 1890, with his now deceased brother Henry, established the American Glove Company. Mr. Reisenhus is, like all true Danish-born pioneers proud of his adopted country America. He has not, however, forgotten little old Denmark with its quaint old towns, green woods and blue waters.</p>
   <p>P. P. Reisenhus is not of the forgetting kind; he remembers his friends, the poor as well as the rich, and is remembered and loved by them for his unpretentious and genuine character. Riches never gave him a swelled head nor a cold heart. The common people, rather than fashionable society, is the class with which he likes to associate.</p>
   <p>His playground is Washington Island, in Lake Michigan, where he has a summer-home and probably his dearest friends--judging by his words of praise for these summer-neighbors of his.</p>
   <p>He has paid several visits to his childhood home, the last time in 1930. He likes to muse about the friendly spirit of people and nature in the land of his birth.</p>
   
   <p>On his last trip to Denmark he had the old sunken graves of his father and mother reset and tombstones with words of endearment placed upon them. "My mother was the dearest and wisest teacher I ever had", says Mr. Reisenhus, "she died before I got back to visit. But I still have her dear letters of love and good advice. I love to read them over and over again, because there is new strength and hope for me in the words mother wrote."</p>
   <p>Some Danes, when they succeed and win high esteem as American citizens, will forget to associate with their own race. Not so with Mr. Reisenhus, he loves to mingle with his people, and is always willing to support any worthy cause, financially and morally, which the Danes in Chicago may undertake. He is a member of the great Hamilton and Medinah Athletic Clubs, and a Shriner of many years standing. He also is a member and past President, and Treasurer for 20 years of the Danish Odd Fellows, Lodge Norden No. 699, and also a member of the Dania Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. P.P. Reisenhus has by his great business ability, his honest and friendly character, given honor and respect to the Danish name in America.</p>
