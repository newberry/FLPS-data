   <p>Volkmar Johnsen passed away last week at the age of 79. He was one of the oldest settlers in the Danish colony.</p>
   <p>Our oldest colonists will remember him from 1870, when West North Avenue was one big prairie and the colony was around Milwaukee and Grand Avenues. He was the man that started the first Danish paper in Chicago, the old monthly Ha Ha, that later was bought by Christian Botker in 1895, who later changed the name to Revyen.</p>
   <p>He was co-editor for many years, in the early seventies, of the Danish paper Spogefuglen.</p>
