   <p>Baker F. Wm. Hansen, 447 W. Chicago Ave., has started to advertise his Dansk Hugbrod (Danish pumpernickel). Most Danes born in Denmark find the American white bread too soft and they generally long for the much harder and more healthful Danish bread made of rye. This bread is mostly used for the well known Danish sandwiches of the open kind.</p>
