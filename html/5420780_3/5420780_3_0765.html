   <p>Chamberlain C. Beck of Engelsholm, Denmark, here on an extended visit at the home of his son, Consul George Beck, was the guest of honor at a surprise banquet served at the Red Star Inn on Wednesday evening, November 3rd. The banquet was arranged by a "secret committee" to give prominent Danish-Americans an opportunity to meet this polished and prominent visitor and to make him feel fully at home with his countrymen in a strange land. Mr. Beck brought to light his intimate knowledge of the Danish-American relationship and the great friendship Denmark bears toward the U.S.A. and surprised the assembly by addressing in fluent, faultless English.</p>
   <p>Though the banquet was over at 1:00 o'clock, it was 2:00 o'clock before the final farewells had been spoken. Mr. Beck and his daughter, who accompanied him, sail on "Oscar II" from New York on November 11th.</p>
