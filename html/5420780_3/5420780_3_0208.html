   <p>p.4.col.3... The Scandinavian Workers' Chorus masquerade at Bjorgvins Hall on Saturday, Feb. 25 was a super-success. The hall was actually overcrowded by the gathering of happy jostling humanity. In addition to dancing to music by Carl Petersen's popular orchestra a comedy sketch was put on presenting "The Barber of Seville" in pantomine, the diversion being highly appreciated. After unmasking, a more than generous supply of tasty sandwiches and coffee was served in the basement dining room thus renewing the vigor of the dancers who again took up this enjoyment. The entire evening was more like a carnival than a dance, in both appearance and spirit, and will long be remembered by all who were there.</p>
