   <p>The Dania Club of this city is the largest Scandinavian club in America. It was founded in 1862 and incorporated in 1865. Its purpose is the promotion of the mental and material well-being of its members. The Club now has four hundred members, all Danes, although Swedes and Norwegians are admitted as passive member without the right to vote. The Dania has a sick benefit fund to which each member contributes six dollars annually. If he is sick he receives twelve dollars a week. This sick benefit fund, due to wise administration, is in the best financial condition. In case of the death of a member, the Club pays the funeral expenses and the widow receives two hundred dollars. The assets of the Club consist of $3,000 in cash, the Club building, and a priceless library. In the social world the Club is famous for its masquerades. It has its own choir with thirty singers, and a debating club where political and other questions are debated twice a week. Here the temperance question was discussed, and decided according to a liberal point of view. Here preparations were made for the Danish mass meeting in the Aurora Turner Hall, where the Danish citizens joined unanimously in our movement.</p>
