   <p>The Americans will make money and are not afraid to work for it. Thus he makes progress. The European workingman, saves himself. He believes that more workingman on a piece of work and less work performed by each man, will improve working conditions for all! He assumes there is only a limited amount of work to be found in society. Through experience the Americans have found that hard work only creates more work.</p>
   <p>The Americans do not hesitate in trying out new methods and machinery, which increase both employment, production and turnover.</p>
   <p>As an illustration: The modern American locomotives will pull twice the load of the old ones. They do not consume any more fuel than the old ones. Hence more work has <span class="page-break">\2</span>been credited for the locomotive factories, as a modern locomotive requires considerable more work in its building than does the old type. The boilers in the new locomotives will outline the old type four times, and the fireplace three times.</p>
   <p>The American workman is also better paid. Twenty years ago the average annual income of the "Steel Trust's" employees was $776.00 - against $2,000.00 - at the present time. Into consideration must also be taken the fact, that the cost of living has "only" been doubled, while wages were trebled; while the price of steel only rose 59%; which proves, that the new methods made it possible to balance accounts.</p>
   <p>An open mind concerning everything in America's strength:</p>
   <p>On an average five new patents are registered every day. They are not all of course, of equal value or importance. This means progress and keeps the mercantile leaders on the "qui-vive" for improvements.</p>
   <p>Inventions spell progress and will not be balked, however, much certain elements might oppose it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It is of the greatest importance to an industrial nation like America, that, during the last four years it has been possible to lower the rates on electricity to the consumers. In 1919 a ton of coal would develop 625 Kilowat-hours, now the same ton will furnish 840 Kilowat-hours.</p>
   <p>In a yeast-factory an invention was made. enabling a baker to get twelve more loafs of bread and of a certain quantity of flour. This means in money: Thirty-five to fifty million Dollars saved annually.</p>
   <p>It is possible that all these inventions are not of American origin. The American is not as inventive, as it would appear, but he is quick to recognize the value of an idea. The European boss believes it to be his duty, to be wiser and more able than any of his employees. The American boss knows that his "force" is to put people to work. There is an abundance of ideas, but the trick is to develop them and put them to work.</p>
   <p>The railroads at present employ 220,000people, while five years ago under federal control they employed 280,000.</p>

   <p>Outside frequently one meets Danes, who have been in American and have returned, and who will say: "No thanks, America is no place for one." They are unable to stand"the gaff." Those who make a go of it here are usually brilliant people, just the kind we need at home.</p>
