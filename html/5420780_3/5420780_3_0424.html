   <p>Ebenezer Junior Choir was formed in 1933. It now consists of 25 boys and girls. They sing at every morning service; as they grow older they pass into the senior choir. At the beginning of the fall of 1935, when the church introduced the double service system it became necessary to form an exclusively Danish choir for the Danish morning services.</p>
