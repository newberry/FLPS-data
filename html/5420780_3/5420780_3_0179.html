   <p>Dania is the oldest Danish society in Chicago. It was founded November 23, 1862. Its aim was purely social, but later sick benefit and funeral expenses were added. For many years the society met in a building at the corner of La Salle Avenue and Kinzie Street, but the structure burned during the Great Fire. Everything burned except the protocol and a picture of the Danish King, Frederik VII. The society moved to Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>In 1891 a building was bought on Chicago Avenue, but the Danes who first lived around Wicker Park moved out to the neighborhood of Humboldt Park. The society therefore sold the old building and built a new one on North Kedzie Avenue, near North Avenue. This building was finished in 1912 at a cost of more than $30,000. Dania now has 250 members; the club is open all day to members. Many well-known Danes have been presidents of the society; Henry Ockenholt, Charles L. Wilde, Carl Nielsen, Adolf Christensen, Emil C. Jorgensen, Charles Ryberg, J. C. Larsen (vice-president of the Security Bank) and lately Peder Kristensen. The treasurer is Ludvig M. Hoffenblad.</p>
