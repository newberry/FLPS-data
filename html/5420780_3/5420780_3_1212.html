   <p>In the Danish papers in Copenhagen, Mr. Pesche-Koedt, the brother of Vice-Consul C.M. Koedt, has written an attack on Consul Andrew Peterson and advocate Brastrup both of Chicago. He is blaming both these gentlemen for his brother's trouble. The Danish department of Foreign Affairs has declared that Mr. Koedt was discharged because when he left Chicago, he took with him $150 belonging to the Danish consulate. The Consul said he had to let him go because of "his arbitrary and unauthorized conduct in official affairs." The brothers are threatening to sue Revyen.</p>
