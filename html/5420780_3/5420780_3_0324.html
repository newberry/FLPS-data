   <p>p.1...........Once more we are celebrating the great annual festival. Once more we gather to remember the ocean-encircled islands of our homeland, the proud bogwood forests, its men and women, the glory of its past, its present culture and art. Let us make this Danish festival the greatest ever to be celebrated outside of Denmark. Let us show the world, that we love this country where we have built our homes, that we honor the flag, under the protection of which we live, but that we cannot forget the land where we first saw the warming, life going light of the sun, where we first heard our mothers beloved and lovely voice. No, we can never forget old Denmark, where we experienced the joys and sorrows of our childhood. Therefore, tomorrow we shall put aside our daily tasks. Tomorrow we are Danish in heart and mind. Let us all wear the Danish colors. Let old "Danne Brog" (the Danish flag) wave side by side with Old Glory from every Danish home, for this is the day of Denmark, the land of our birth.</p>
