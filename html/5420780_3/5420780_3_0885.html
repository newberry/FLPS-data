   <p>The activities that Doctor Henius pursued as a citizen, that is, in the service of the community and his fellow citizens, were undoubtedly very near to his heart. It is safe to say that they came next to his interests in his professional duties, and it may well be, that on occasion, his unrewarded public services were allowed to supersede his private commitments and that sometimes the latter suffered in consequence.</p>
   <p>It was in his capacity as representative citizen, now more than twenty-five years ago, when he was acting as the official host to a group of Danish singing societies on tour in this country, that I first met him. In the course of the Danish society's visit to Chicago they came to the Public Library with Doctor Henius as their guide, and it fell to my lot to receive them and show them something of the institution. I believe I am quite safe in saying that Doctor Henius's keen interest in the Library and its work dates from that visit.</p>

   <p>In 1911, he was appointed by the Mayor as a member of the Board of Directors--not we may be sure at his own request or through any effort on his part--for one thing that he would never do, was to ask anything for himself, but simply because he was the representative of a national group.</p>
   <p>It did not take him long, not only to become an active member of the Board in full sympathy with the policies and spirit of service of an American Public Library, but also to achieve recognition as a leader in the Board, and incidentally, and enthusiastic protagonist and booster of the American Public Library.</p>
   <p>On his annual trip to Denmark in 1913, two years after his appointment, he took with him a set of slides illustrating the work of the Library, and delivered a lecture before the city officials of Copenhagen.</p>

   <p>In the spring of 1914, when his first term of office expired, his fellow members took an official action unique in the history of the Library before or since, expressing by vote their hope that he would be reappointed, and undertook individually to urge his reappointment by personal representation to the Mayor.</p>
   <p>Happily their hopes and wishes were fulfilled and Doctor Henius was duly returned for a second term from July, 1914, to July, 1917, and served two years as its president.</p>
   <p>It was then that the full force of his energy and enthusiasm became manifest. He dreamed of a Library service for Chicago so complete as to be within reach of every citizen, and to realize his dream, he announced a plan--still valid and in progress, and still incomplete--of dividing the city into five regional districts with a regional branch in each.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But then came the entry of this country into the War, and everything else was submerged in the national emergency. That year Doctor Henius returned from abroad full of the provisions the belligerent countries were making for the welfare of their armies in the trenches. They were among other things, providing a book service for the soldiers, and that appealed to him as a wise and important enterprise.</p>
   <p>As soon as he reached Chicago, he proceeded to organize a similar service here with the Chicago Public Library as its center and headquarters. Appeals for gifts of books were issued to the public, and soon the books' began to pour in. In Chicago alone we collected four hundred thousand volumes. I shall never forget the first truckloads sent out to Fort Sheridan and Great Lakes one Saturday afternoon with Doctor Henius and some of the rest of us following in a motor car. Thus there began the campaign for "Books for Soldiers," which spread all over the country, and sponsored by the American Library Association.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>resulting in the despatch of books by the millions to American soldiers and sailors in training camps, in the trenches, and on the high seas.</p>
   <p>In 1917 it came to pass that by a turn of the political wheel, Doctor Kenius and all his colleagues on the Board were suddenly superseded by new appointees, and for the next eight years, our contacts with him were informal and unofficial, but we continued without interruption on the basis of his friendship for us and the Library, and his keen and permanent interest in its work. In 1925 he again joined the Board, and remained a member for five years. Gradually, under the stress of those difficult years and his increasing desire to spend more time abroad, we noted a decline in his fervor, and a growing preoccupation with other affairs that required his personal attention. In 1930 he resigned from the Library Board, one year before the expiration of his term, and against the protests of his fellow members. After that we saw little of him, and could only cherish the memories of the happy and fruitful years that had passed.</p>

   <p>This was the only continuous public service that he was called upon to render to his fellow citizens in this city. One may legitimately speculate as to why a man of so much force, enthusiasm, and ability was not called upon more often, and to more important public service. In Denmark, his activities received national recognition. Here in Chicago they were confined to the limited interests of a single community, and a single institution. It was not alone that he never asked nor put himself forward. Neither did he do that in Denmark, and yet he became a national figure. Nor is it merely because the kingdom of Denmark numbers about the same in population as the city of Chicago. It is a difference in attitude toward public service, and the evaluation of life.</p>
   <p>I remember once, when he sat for an unreasonable time in the ante-room of the Mayor of Chicago, waiting in vain to be received. He said, simply and a little bewildered, "I can see the King of Denmark in less time than that." And so he could. The King of Denmark knew him as a citizen of his country, and valued the contributions he made to his country's welfare.</p>

   <p>When the Public Library took official notice of his death, it did not employ words of mourning or condolence.</p>
   <p>Those who had been associated with him, remember him with admiration for his enthusiasm, energy, and achievements, and cherish the memory of a joyous and lighthearted companion and friend, a leader of his fellowmen.</p>
   <p>And so the Board of Directors spread upon its records a Memorial Minute in testimony of its gratitude for the career of a great and useful citizen, and a loyal and devoted friend of the Chicago Public Library.</p>
   <p>It is as such that we honor his memory, as a great and useful citizen and a loyal and devoted friend.</p>
