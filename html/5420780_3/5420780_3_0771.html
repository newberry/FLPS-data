   <p>The Danish government has donated to the development of Danish culture among Danes abroad the sum of 15,000 Kroner, to be used in 1909 and 1910. The aim is first of all to help Danish schools and buy Danish literature; the funds are not for denominational purposes. Danish societies that desire a share of this fund must apply to the Danish consul before October 1, 1909.</p>
