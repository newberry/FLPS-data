   <p>p.2.col.3........A letter mailed from the U.S. to Hederslev requires 2c postage while the same letter, if mailed to Kolding requires 5c Why should there be this difference? Haderslev gets the benefit of the postal agreement with Germany; no such fact benefits the Dane.</p>
   <p>Why has rate reduction not been arranged between Denmark and the U.S.A.? Is it because of Danish blindness as to the mutual benefit to such an agreement? Are we blind to the economy and to the greater benefits to be derived from the increased number of letters that will be dispatched under the lower rate of postage.</p>
   <p>Increased correspondence means increased knowledge of conditions in both countries; <span class="page-break">2</span>preservation of old and creation of ties between Danes here and in Denmark. In short, this improvement in postal service will bring mutual benefits that would be impossible to obtain in any other way.</p>
   <p>It should not be difficult to bring about a change. In view of the promptness and lack of opposition shown when the German and British agreements were made we feel that the good will of "Uncle Sam" toward Denmark will bring on a prompt acceptance of out proposal.</p>
   <p>Our greatest difficults has been to overcome the apathy of the Danish Press. Our Danish-American Press has long seen the advisibility of the change and has given the cause enough publicity to stir action, the Danes on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
   <p>Through our columns we appeal to all Danish-Americans to really unite in support of the proposed postal reduction. Prove to authorities and population of <span class="page-break">3</span>Denmark that we Danish-Americans are as much interested in the matter of postal rates to and from the old homeland as are our Germans and British meighbors in our adopted country.</p>
   <p>The society for the promotion of this idea invites every Dane in the U.S.A., to become a member. The membership fee is $1.00; there will not be any further dues nor assesments as we feel that the volume of these small contributions will adequately provide for publicity, stationery, postage,etc. All work by the Promotors of the plan will be done gratis. Membership may also be obtained by sending in a petition signed by twenty-five or more of our people. A complete report of the results of the movement will be mailed to all members within three months after the work of the society is completed. Remittances and communications may be sent to any member of the Working Committee of the Society.</p>
