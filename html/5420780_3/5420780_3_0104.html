   <p>The waiting rooms of LaSalle Street Station in Chicago was crowded with Danes and Swedes going to Denmark for Christmas. The Swedish Liners "Gripsholm" was on hand giving Charles Fandrick, Chicago Office representative, information.</p>
   <p>At 11 o'clock the Trainmaster sang out "All Aboard for the "Swedish-American Special" and people hurried to the track. There was plenty of room for the 200 passengers in the eight coaches. Everything was very comfortable on the Nickel-Plate Lehigh Valley Railroad. The Dining Room was well filled at every meal. The R.R. employees were very courteous and very helpful. When we arrived at Hoboken we thanked them all very much.</p>
   <p>Big Route cars took us at dawn to the Liner's Dock at 57th Street, New York City. In the Dining Salon of the Ship, tables were set elaborately with Lunch and Flowers. While we were eating our lunch, the Ship's music Corps played Danish music.</p>
