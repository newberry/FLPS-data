   <p>Last Sunday a meeting was called of all Scandinavian veterans, who participated in the War of 1848-49 against Germany. The order came from the Danish Government at Copenhagen, which wanted to decorate every man, Dane, Swede, or Norwegian, who fought against Germany. A war medal will be given to every one.</p>
   <p>A vote on the question of refusing the medal was lost. A second vote was taken and acceptance was voted.</p>
