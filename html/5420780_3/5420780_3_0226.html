   <p>The board of the Danish-American Association has decided to dissolve the society and start a new one under the same name but without stock and "not for pecuniary profit". The society has decided not to work for export and import trade between Denmark and America, but to concentrate on Danish culture.</p>
   <p>The old society was much criticized because the stockholders had as many votes as they had shares, with the result that the big stockholders dominated the policy of the whole society.</p>
   <p>The stockholders will be paid the value of their shares, which are now worth only one third or one half of their original value. When the society started ten thousand dollars' worth of stock was sold. Stockholders who wish to retain membership in the society may become life members merely by giving up their old stock.</p>
