   <p>The Danish National Committee has arranged an American tour for the Danish Student Singers. This singing group is making its first stop in Chicago. When the Danes of Chicago do things, then we may be sure that they will be done in a big way.</p>
   <p>The Student Singers arrived this morning. Thousands of Scandinavians met them at the station and every one wore a red and white ribbon on hat or in coat lapel.</p>
   <p>The reception held at the station was very well planned. When the singers left the train, two Danish orchestras played the Danish national hymn. Then, after many cheers, the local Danish singing societies welcomed them with "Auld Lang Syne".</p>
   
   <p>The tickets for the concert to be held in Orchestra Hall tonight have all been sold.</p>
