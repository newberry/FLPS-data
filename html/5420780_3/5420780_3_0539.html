   <p>The Danish Youth Society observed its silver anniversary last Saturday with a festive celebration in Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were State Senator Niels Juul, who dedicated his speech to the great, free America, and State Representative C. M. Madsen, who spoke for the ladies, congratulating them on having finally won some of the human rights of which they have been deprived since the beginning of the world, particularly the right to vote. Pastor Adam Dan, in his speech, paid homage to youth, and finally Mrs. Helga Hansen toasted the "elderly gentlemen of C. M. Madsen's age and up."</p>
   <p>As a birthday present, the society received a beautiful silk banner from its feminine members.</p>
   <p>Dancing, the last post on the program, continued for several hours.</p>
