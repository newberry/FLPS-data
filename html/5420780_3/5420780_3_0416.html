   <p>The Ebenezer Danish Church has for many years conducted a daily vacation Bible school. The enrollment last year (1936) was 87. The school is held, every day for the four weeks, immediately following the close of the public schools. The children from the ages of five to fourteen years, are assembled in the church parlors from nine to twelve o'clock every morning for instruction in Bible stories, singing, hand work, making of picture books, soap-carving and drawing.</p>
