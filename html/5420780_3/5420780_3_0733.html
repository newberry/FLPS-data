   <p>According to a dispatch from Copenhagen, Mr. Carl Antonsen was created a Knight of Dannebrog (the Danish flag), when he and Dr. Henius paid their respects to the King before returning to Chicago.</p>
   <p>As you know, Dr. Henius is already the proud possessor of both the Knight's and the Commander's Cross.</p>
   <p>Thus, in spite of the fact that "no decorations wanted" is written all over him, Mr. Antonsen did not escape his fate.</p>
