   <p>p.2.... North Pole Cook, as he is now derisively spoken of, as reported in New York (from Denmark) seems to be laboring under the impression that anything he could say could be of interest to our Danish-Americans. He announces a willingness to give free lectures about his tour to the North Pole but -considering the hoax he perpetrated in Denmark and his brazen affrontery in accepting Danish degrees, honor, and decorations,only to be found out and thoroughly discredited, we can assure him of the kind of a welcome such a colossal humbug deserves. Leaders in Chicago's Danish Lodge, social and religious circles are warning our people against allowing this international charlatan to address their groups.</p>
