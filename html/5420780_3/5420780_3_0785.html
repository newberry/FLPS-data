   <p>Daily papers in Denmark are publishing articles under such headlines as "Crazy Americans," etc., describing how Americans have been running wild with enthusiasm and engaged in actual fist fights in order to catch a glimpse of a Swedish prince who happened to land on the Eastern Shore. A few days later the same papers copied articles published by royal-minded Danish papers, in the East, suggesting that the Danes ought to be as good and ready for a royal visit as are the other Scandinavian nationalities.</p>
   <p>Well, well! Do they want a royal visit for the sake of having the Americans, and those of our countrymen who are yet so ignorant, to act like fools? We presume the majority of Danes in America will be above that foolishness of the old world and will act accordingly, but why incite the more ignorant to go wild with enthusiasm over the sight of a representative of an institution which we believe is neither necessary for nor beneficial to civilization?</p>
