   <p>Carl Busch, who is generally considered one of the great composers of his age, sits behind a small table in his studio at the Homer Institute.</p>
   <p>In a soft voice, almost inaudible at times, he says, "I have been trying to think of anything that might be a turning point in my life." He smiles naively. The very movement of his hands as he fingers a pencil on the table is quite and deferential.</p>
   <p>Lying about the studio wherever there is room for them, are antique band instruments, the beginning of a collection to which he adds from time to time. On the walls are pictures--memories. He delights in all of them. With the simplicity of true greatness, he finds as much pleasure in the one which recalls the time he conducted a group of high school bands as in those which recall his contacts with the great orchestras of the world.</p>

   <p>"We don't make much money out of music," he says, "but we have other compensations."</p>
   <p>For the turning point in his career, we must go back to the Denmark of nearly fifty years ago, and Copenhagen, its capital. Here were more than one hundred thousand persons, the handsomest palaces the country could afford, theaters, and music rendered by the best artists in Denmark, as well as by the great visitors from Germany, Norway, and Sweden.</p>
   <p>In one of the large rooms of the Copenhagen Conservatory of Music, a young man with a blond goatee and a sensitive smile played and played his violin. It was a selection from Mozart. To him his gray-stone city throbbed with music, and he loved it.</p>
   <p>With his back to the window, stood Valdemar Tofte watching the young student. Tofte was a little man with long hair combed back off his forehead after the fashion of the German musicians.</p>

   <p>"Mr. Busch," he said slowly, when the young violinist had paused, "you have feeling in your music, soul; but it seemed to me that you played not quite so well as last week. This tecnnique you must master if you will be a violinist."</p>
   <p>The smile went out of young Busch's face. He looked around the bare room, with nothing in it but three straight-backed chairs, a grand piano and cases for music. He looked at the little man before the great window, who gazed at him intently. And then his eyes shifted to the violin in his hand, to the fingers that clutched it, and up from them a little way to the wrist where it joined the hand. There should have been nothing there but smooth skin and the veins showing slightly blue. But there was something else, a small hard lump. It was very definitely there and it was painful, the result of practising on the violin eight hours a day.</p>
   <p>"Yes, I have not been careful enough of my technique," Carl Busch said; and he left to go to the room where he studied the beginnings of composition <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>under Niels W. Gade, the greatest composer in Denmark.</p>
   <p>He had thought at times that he would like to give some serious thought to composition. One day he might be able to produce a great symphony out of his head. That would be fine. The only trouble was that you couldn't count on anything like that. Whereas he knew that he could play the violin; not unusually well, perhaps, because he had got a late start. But he had learned a lot in the last two years.</p>
   <p>It wouldn't do for him to take any chances with his music. He might have to go back into law business as his father, George Ludvig Busca, had originally planned. He did not want to go back to Bjerre, the little village on the east coast of Jutland, where he was born. He did not want to go back to Aarhus, where he had worked in a bank adding up rows and rows of figures day after day. Ugh! How could a man live like that!</p>
   <p>These were the thoughts that passed through Carl Busch's mind as he walked along the corriders of the old palace that was the Copenhagen Conservatory <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of Music. From distant parts of the building came sounds of music, the strains of a violin, a far off piano, a singing voice. And his footsteps struck echoes in the great barren halls. Copenhagen, the seat of music in Denmark! He loved it. He felt a twitch of pain in his wrist and looked down. It was with a deadening sense of helplessness that he remembered his handicap. He had played less well today than he had played a week ago.</p>
   <p>That night at his rooming house he dreamed that his hands were cut off at the wrists and that he could not play at all. When he woke up he could hear an orchestra playing in his own head. Short passages took definite form with each instrument playing its allotted part.</p>
   <p>Two weeks later Carl Busch again walked through the corridors of the great building, going from the room where Valdemar Tofte taught him to play the violin to the room where Niels W. Gade taught him harmony and counterpoint and other fundamentals of the technique of composition. Gade was a handsome old man, with silver white hair and a vague reserve in his eyes.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"Professor Gade," said Busch, "I have a lump on my wrist that makes me play the violin worse every day."</p>
   <p>"Is that so? It is bad," said Niels Gade.</p>
   <p>"I will not be able to play any more for six months or a year. Do you think I could every learn to compose music?" asked Busch.</p>
   <p>"It is possible," said the greatest composer in Denmark.</p>
   <p>And through misfortune, Carl Busch turned to the work that has occupied him for nearly fifty years and the worry passed out of his mind. A violinist was lost, but a composer was gained.</p>
   <p>A year later this turning point in his career was clinched. He had won a scholarship to the conservatory of music at Brussels, where he was dismissed because he worked on his compositions instead of coming to rehearsals.</p>

   <p>With a violin under his arm, he took to the open road leading out across the land of the Flemish in the general direction of Paris.</p>
   <p>That evening when the sun was setting he came to a small village. He "didn't give a hang" for the serious worries of the world. He stopped in front of a small shop playing his violin. The freedom of the road and the peace and beauty of the countryside were in the inspired music. A crowd gathered; small pieces of money fell around him. Later a tall man who seemed important in the village, asked him to his house to spend the night.</p>
   <p>This was the first of many similar evenings. Joyously without any money of his own, he made his way to Paris. There, through his Alsatian landlady, he met Benjamin Godard, the most celebrated composer of France. Besides giving him a place in his orchestra, Godard looked over some of his compositions and advised him from time to time. Carl Busch also played under Charles Gounod in the first performance of his famous oratorio "Mors et Vita" <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>(Life and Death). Carl Busch was definitely a composer for the rest of his life.</p>
   <p>Paris was Copenhagen glorified. It was a musicians' paradise. It was only because a fire destroyed a summer resort in Southern France after he had agreed to play there, that he found himself temporarily unable to make a living from his music.</p>
   <p>Then he heard stories of gold hanging on the trees in Kansas City. What he found, when he got off the train at the old union station, was a gay day and a clay bank.</p>
   <p>His "A chant from the Great Plains," a symphonic episode, which won a national contest ten years ago for the best original composition, illustrates the fact that he has caught the spirit of America. That he has been twice knighted, once by the King of Norway and once by the King of Denmark, is evidence of how well he has reproduced the soul of the region of his birth.</p>

   <p>"I don't put music out of my mind when I am through with my work for the day. It still clings to me," he says.</p>
