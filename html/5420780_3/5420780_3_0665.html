   <p>Druggist Emil Dreier, the first Danish Apoteker* in Chicago, became the successor of Dr. Pearson both as Danish consul in Chicago and president of Dania. He was a powerful personality and became the leader at the Danish table at Wilkins' cellar. Here you would meet such famous Danes as the two architects Hammerich and Lautrup; the former opened a school for drawing in Dania for young Danes that just had arrived in the city. You would also meet Dr. Chr. Fenger, Prof. Frederiksen, the sculptor J. Gelert, the literature critic Clemens Petersen, and civil engineer William Harlew.</p>
   <p>You would also meet the first Danish Socialist leaders, recently deported from Denmark; Pio, Geleff and "Sorte" (Black) Hansen. Later on, the circle was joined by two young men: the politician Henry L. Hartz and Dr. Max Henius.</p>
   <p>*By apoteker in Danish we signify a man who only fills prescriptions ordered by a doctor. (J. E.)</p>
