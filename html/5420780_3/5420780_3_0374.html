   <p>In spite of rain and sleet, Danish Brotherhood Society Number 18 enjoyed a full house for its Christmas party in Wicker Park Hall. The children sang beautifully, especially, "There Is a Land," under the direction of P. L. Bland. The silver spoons donated by Ahlswede, through Julius Andersen, contributed to the enjoyment, but unfortunately there were not quite enough of them to go around, since the children numbered over four hundred. Hans Nelson furnished the dance music, by means of which the elders also enjoyed themselves splendidly.</p>
