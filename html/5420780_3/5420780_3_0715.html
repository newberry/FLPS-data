   <p>The Danish-American National Park, Rebild, Denmark was given to the Danish State by a group of Danish-Americans headed by Dr. Max Henius, at a festival, August 5, 1912, attended by the King of Denmark and his cabinet.</p>
   <p>The American Minister, Dr. Egan, spoke and so did the King. Rebild is located a few miles south of Aalbrog, Denmark. It is a piece of heather and hills bought by Danish-Americans. The Park is taken care of by the Danish State. The Park has to remain as it is, a piece of Danish nature unspoiled. It is always open to the public. And on the fourth of July, America's Day of Independence, and other days of importance to American citizens, all Danish-born Americans shall have the right to the free use of the Park for their gatherings.</p>
   <p>The deed to the Park was given to the King of Denmark by Dr. Max Henius of Chicago. The Danish poet, Jeppe Aakjaer, had written a cantata which was sung <span class="page-break">\2</span>by the student choir of the University of Copenhagen. There were also songs written by the Reverend Adam Dan and Ivar Kirkegaard. Max Henius, the leading spirit, also edited the book Den Danskfodte Amerikaner (The Danish-born American) in which the first attempt was made to write the history of Danish-Americans.</p>
