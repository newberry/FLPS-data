   <p>It was not Prince Diggo who became the happy owner of "Solust," Gluckstadt's mansion near Copenhagen. Maybe the prince never had such thoughts but there were rumors.</p>
   <p>The property was bought by a Dane of Chicago, and with American money. The buyer was not a prince but one of the common people, who after thirty-three years of hard and persistent work and aided by plain luck has made so great a fortune that he now is able to purchase the beautiful mansion for use as a summer resort.</p>
   <p>His name is George Rasmussen, founder and president of National Tea Company, Chicago. He bought Slust July 15, 1924 for 500,000 Danish Crowns "C.O.D." The seller was Landmandsbanken, Copenhagen.</p>

   <p>We find Mr. Rasmussen at Hotel d'Angleterre. He is husky of build and has an amiable personality. His eyes sparkle keenly under their dark brows but reveal glimpses of joy when the conversation concerns his native country as compared with the land of rugged individualism, where he made his fortune. "- How did you get the idea to buy Solust?" "- Well; it has been my desire for many years to stay in Denmark during my vacations. I used to come home every once in awhile; but now it is ten years since I was here last, and it is as though Denmark appeals to me this time more than ever so I decided to buy a place of my own. I heard Slust was for sale, and I have spent a great deal of time inspecting it and - admiring it. The deal was closed this morning, in fact it was closed last Saturday; but I had to wait for my money from Chicago, hence the delay." "- Are you going to stay here permanently?" "- No, I still have my business in Chicago to take care of, and I cannot be away from it for more than two months during the summer." "- You mean to say that you are going to maintain this elaborate mansion and use it only two months every summer? "- It is worse than that. I am going to stay here one month only. My wife prefers to spend her vacations in Paris, so we made a deal splitting the time equally between Paris and Denmark." "- Isn't this a sort of big house to use?" "- Maybe, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and I will have to spend quite a lot of money too before I have it in first class shape; but we like to have a comfortable home, and this place suits us."</p>
   <p>"- Did you buy the property without any household furnishings at all?" " - Yes, that is: I have made the beginning to an art collection. Cheap by the way; only 200,000 Danish crowns. However, I have in mind to attempt a restoration of Slust as it appeared in the former owner's days. Through his friends I hope to locate a great deal of the original furnishings and artistic treasures. I am sorry I did not know earlier that Slust was for sale. Had I acquired title to the property before the public auction, both the mortgage holder and I would have made a better deal."</p>
   <p>"- You mean you would have saved some money?" "- Yes, I would have paid two million crowns for it as it appeared at that time. The bank didn't get that much out of it by selling the art collection and furnishings separately, and it will cost me more than that to restore them.</p>

   <p>"- Who is going to take care of the property during the eleven months of the year while you are not here."</p>
   <p>"- I have a brother here. He and a lawyer will take care of it. The domestic help, already employed, I expect to keep.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rasmussen pulls out a drawer producing the deed to the property, a plainly written document stating that Mr. George Rasmussen is now the owner of Solust. The contract is signed by Emil Hertz and Oluf Nielsen.</p>
   <p>Another document happens to fall from the drawer. By a closer examination it proves to be a bill of sale on a Rembrandt painting bought by Mr. Rasmussen in Belgium and for the sum of 800,000 Franc.</p>
   <p>"- Is that one of the Master's best paintings?"</p>
   <p>"- Yes, I guess so, although it is not one of the most famous; but it is <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>worth having. It is called Chevalier Jaris de Caulery.</p>
   <p>"- Are you going to keep that at Solust?" "- No, that one I am going to take with me to Chicago. I have an estate there similar to the one I bought over here. My two sons have their home there."</p>
   <p>"- Did your sons ever visit Denmark?" "Yes, while they were small. Now they would not consider taking up residence in this country. They are genuine Americans. When they have graduated from the University I guess they will go in as partners in my business."</p>
