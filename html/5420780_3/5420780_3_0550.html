   <p>Next Thursday, St. Stefan's Youth Society will present Danish folk dances in the Abraham Lincoln Center under the direction of Miss Dagny Pedersen from Denmark.</p>
   <p>The dance team has been rehearsing for three months, and we dare say that the public has something to look forward to. The old timers who left Denmark years ago, will see something that they have not seen since they left the old country. Imagine reliving your youth on an American stage from thirty to fifty years after you left home! The Danish folk dancers have won much acclaim in the United States, and it has been proposed to introduce this type of dancing in the American schools.</p>
   <p>Every Dane should support this undertaking, which is not for profit. The admission is only twenty-five cents.</p>
