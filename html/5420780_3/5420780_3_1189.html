   <p>Street &amp; Smith's News Trade Bulletin for the month of November has an article, "Representative Newsmen," which contains an account about a prominent Dane, Mr. Martin R. Ackerman.</p>
   <p>He came to this country fifteen years ago with his mother, who was a widow, and his sister. He was a hotel bellboy for some years in Michigan. After saving some money he went to Chicago, where he started to deliver newspapers, first on foot, then with a handcart, and finally with a horse and wagon. Now he has a very prosperous newspaper stand and bookstore on the corner of Huron Street and Milwaukee Avenue which is the biggest of its kind on the West Side. He also carries an extensive mail order business reaching all over the United States and Canada.</p>
