   <p>p.2........As previously reported the business men on North Avenue, will honor the Danes on Denmark's Constitution Day, by decorating the street for a whole month with columns, coats of arms, flags, pennants, flower arrangements, electric baloons, etc; the buildings along the street will also be decorated. North Avenue Business Men's Association is in charge of the arrangements; on the committee are among others, Corydon and Mayer. The whole affair will cost $1,500 - to $2,000; but the association is not worried about the expenses. Anything for the Danes!</p>
