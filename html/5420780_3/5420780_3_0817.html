   <p>In a letter to the Record-Herald, dated Copenhagen, June 27, William E. Curtis says in part:</p>
   <p>"There does not seem to be any public interest in Denmark on the subject of selling the Island of St. Thomas to the United States. The radical and liberal parties favor the sale. The conservative party, which is a very small minority, is opposed, but has the support of the king and the ministry, which has thus far been successful in preventing the adoption of positive instructions for the sale. The king has said that he wishes to hand down to his successor on the throne the same territory he has governed through his life, and that, while Denmark may not need a base of supplies in the American hemisphere at present, no one can tell when such an advantage might be valuable. Therefore, as long as he lives it is not probable that the sale will be accomplished,and the crown prince is usually of the same opinion as his father. It <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is believed that when Frederick ascends the throne he will continue the same policy that Christian has pursued.</p>
   <p>"There is not the slightest possibility of the sale of St. Thomas to Germany, as Mr. Lodge and some of our other politicians in the United States have suggested. Denmark will sell nothing to Germany. The Danes hate the Germans as bitterly as they are hated by the French, and for similar reasons.</p>
   <p>"The proposition to sell the Danish West Indies to the United States is a commercial speculation originating with and promoted by a syndicate of businessmen and politicians who expect to realize a large commission for their services. Their plan is to secure the passage of an act by the Danish parliament authorizing the sale at a stated price, which is to be kept secret, and then negotiate with the United States on a basis that will give them a profit of $1,000,000 or more. The scheme is well understood by President McKinley and Secretary Hay, who have repeatedly declined to negotiate with agents sent to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Washington by the syndicate. At least two have appeared there, and both were told that the United States Government could not consider any proposition that did not come through the regular diplomatic channels, and no such proposition has ever been received from that source.</p>
   <p>"Nor has the subject ever been discussed officially with authorized representatives of the Danish Government at Washington. So far as I can learn, the United States minister at Copenhagen has encouraged the syndicate to persevere in its efforts, and a general impression prevails that he has held out hopes of success. He is personally intimate with members of the syndicate, and if he is not careful he will find himself involved in a scandal which is sure to follow a successful conclusion of their scheme. Members of parliament and influential politicians outside, newspaper editors, bankers and speculators, number unknown, are all expecting a large rake-off when St. Thomas is sold, and it is rumored that considerable money has been and will be used to influence the proper persons. A gentleman who is well posted concerning the intrigues, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>declared today that Denmark was threatened with something like the Panama Canal scandal in France."</p>
   <p>As will be seen, Mr. Curtis has reserved himself completely upon this question. When, during the first McKinley administration, rumors about a contemplated sale of the Danish West Indies began to fill the press, Mr. Curtis was one of the very first among prominent Washington correspondents to give them currency. He introduced to his readers a certain faker whom he represented as a secret agent of the Danish Government, explaining with much circumstantiality why the Copenhagen Government had found it necessary to adopt such irregular methods of conducting negotiations through the Danish minister at Washington.</p>
   <p>Among the Danes here in Chicago these disclosures were regarded with a great deal of amusement. They knew the "secret agent" as an expert bluffer of unlimited cheek, but were somewhat surprised to see him trap, with such apparent ease, an old and trained hand like Mr. Curtis. As explained by the Skandinaven at the time, there was absolutely no foundation for the rumors about an impeding sale, the idea of which was obnoxious not only to the old king and the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>cabinet, but also to the people of Denmark. The rumors originated with a gang of would-be speculators in Denmark and the United States, who endeavored to deceive and influence public opinion and governmental action in both countries by means of a flood of manufactured or bogus cable dispatches.</p>
   <p>It is fortunate that Mr. Curtis has learned the truth at last. But it is unfortunate that he should fall into fresh errors. It is not true that "the liberal and radical parties" in Denmark favor the sale. Nearly all of the liberal leaders have in the most emphatic terms expressed their opposition to any sale, and they are backed by their followers. The businessmen of Denmark are practically a unit in opposition. Nor is it true that Denmark would not transfer the Islands to Germany. On the contrary, the possibility of trading the Danish West Indies for the northern strip of Schleswig, which is still held by Prussia in violation of Article V of the treaty of Prague, is in Denmark looked upon as one of the very strongest reasons why the Islands should not be sold to the United States or any other power.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>What Mr. Curtis has to say about the power and influence of the St. Thomas syndicate is undoubtedly a gross exaggeration. There has been nothing in the discussion of the matter by the Danish press to warrant such sweeping assertions. The active members of the syndicate are people who are not Danes in blood, but men with shady reputations if they have any at all. They have the support of one boulevard newspaper, which makes a business to ridicule everything and patriotism in particular. But their corruption fund is so limited,and the rogues among public men in Denmark are so scarce that the suggestion of a huge scandal, "something like the Panama Canal scandal in France," is utterly unwarranted and absurd.</p>
   <p>Mr. Curtis has placed the United States minister at Copenhagen in a rather compromising position. He is, we are informed, personally intimate with members of the syndicate, has encouraged it to persevere in its efforts, and if he is not careful he is likely to find himself involved in the scandal. This is equivalent to saying that Mr. Swenson is a member of the syndicate or has received a share of its alleged corruption fund. No responsible newspaperman <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>would prefer such a serious charge against a representative of the government unless he felt absolutely convinced of its truth. Yet, the Skandinaven is unwilling to believe, until better evidence is produced, that Mr. Swenson has done anything to justify such accusations. In view of his early associations, his training, and strong religious convictions, it is all but impossible to believe that he should have sustained personally intimate relations with members of a corrupt clique; and considering his tact, discretion, and knowledge of the machinery of our government, it is equally unlikely that he should have "held out hopes of success" to the scheming coterie. It is probable that some irresponsible gossipmonger or some enemy of Mr. Swenson has poured this tale into the ears of Mr. Curtis and thus made him an unconscious talebearer of vicious slander. While it is true that the general superficiality and unreliability of his letters from Copenhagen detract from the gravity of the charge, Mr. Swenson will probably call upon Mr. Curtis for a full and complete retraction.</p>
