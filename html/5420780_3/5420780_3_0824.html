   <p>The Danish countess, Schimmelmann, is in financial trouble. Her trip to America on her own yacht "Duen" (The Dove) cost her $28,000, and she had to borrow $5,000 more from Evangelisk Selskab (Evangelical Society). This amount she has not been able to pay back in spite of her promise to do so.</p>
   <p>During the winter she was in Chicago, she fed about 50,000 people out of work. When she went to Denmark, she had to leave her yacht here in order to satisfy her creditors. She would not have been able to cross the Atlantic in it during the winter storms.</p>
