   <p>Danish Beer and Continental Beer Gardens is the title of a little book by Dr. Max Henius, which has just been published.</p>
   <p>Our readers will remember that Revyen a few months ago gave a summary of the lecture which Dr. Henius delivered before the American Brewer's Association at its convention in Atlantic City. Henius's book is this lecture, which has now been printed and bound in an attractive little volume with numerous pictures illustrating the Danish brewing industry and the system under which beer is being retailed in various European centers.</p>
   <p>The booklet presents strong arguments for sound temperance, and a severe indictment against the American bar system and the abuses which go with it.</p>
