   <p>The committee for the National Day at Riverview Park had its last meeting August 19. It was resolved, in view of the fact that the Danes of Chicago had celebrated two Danish National Days with great success, that all Danish societies and lodges elect delegates to a central committee before October 20, and that this committee work for the next Danish National Day, June 4, 1911, or the first Sunday in June hereafter.</p>
   <p>The income from the Day was $3,057.65, and the expenses were $2,362.75, which leaves a profit of $694.90.</p>
   <p>To the Danish Children's Home a donation of $230 was made, to the Danish Old People's Home $230. A Danish family, that of A. N. Torsager, received $50.</p>
   <p>The balance, $184.90, will be handed over to the new committee when it is elected.</p>
