   <p>Stark Republicans have always taken offense of the popular custom to accept foreign honors when such have been in the offing as tokens of appreciation. Ever so often a proposal to restrict this evil by means of legislation pops up. We have a tremendous faith in laws in this country, you know. The law ought to make the boundaries absolutely air tight, we think, so that nobody would escape. But still the lawmakers do make mistakes, and consequently a dense fog of hypocricy enshrouds the whole issue.</p>
   <p>The constitution prohibits American citizens employed by the government to wear honorary decorations conferred on them by the governments of foreign countries, unless a special permit from Congress is obtained. The identical state of affairs is prevalent in other countries, however, only with the exception that it would be the ruler of the respective country who would grant a permit, not a congress.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Now we ought to make it so that it would be impossible for any American citizen to accept foreign tokens of honor without violating some law, sponsors of the movement maintain: We should display our distinct contempt for the old world's gewgaws, they say.</p>
   <p>But isn't it a fact that this democratic country of ours is more crowded with people wearing foreign tokens of honor and titles than any other country in the world? If we don t support the idea in one way, we do in some other way. You will not find very many grown-ups in this country who do not possess some sort of a uniform or regalia which to wear at special occasions. Few are the ones who do not use their buttonhole for some sort of decoration, or at least would like to.</p>
   <p>One of my best friends, a faithful republican, of course, but nevertheless he holds the privilege of wearing six different uniforms, swords including, two of them are swords of honors.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Fully dressed,he is more elegant than a chamberlain, in fact, judging from his way of dressing you would think he was a Hindu prince.</p>
   <p>We have Knights a galore, thirty-two orders, varying in degree, the top one elevating its owner to a position of ultra grandeur, and when wearing them all, you would think he had dressed up for a carnival. Students have their fraternities, and are decorating themselves with jewel studded insignia.</p>
   <p>It isn't men only who love to decorate themselves. The women proudly wear their Eastern Star and Red Cross medals as tokens of appreciation for their work of knitting socks for the soldiers; the trade unions have their insignia, etc. It does not at all appear like tokens of honor are disregarded.</p>
   <p>And titles! We've gone so far as to have a title called "Imperial Wizard". We surely have the set-up that will show who of us amount to something and how much. Did you ever hear the story about the nigger who was late for work one morning and offered the excuse that he had attended a meeting in the lodge <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the preceding night where the brothers had a lovely time installing officers. He himself had been granted the title of "The Supreme Ruler of the "Universe;" but that was a minor position, however.</p>
   <p>An attempt to chase the honor and title evil out the front door will cause it to enter through the back door in disguised form which in reality is the same thing. As a matter of fact the evil proves to satisfy a need, or rather a very natural human want. At any rate the custom has been popular as far back as our history goes. Every time it was abolished it has promptly reappeared.</p>
   <p>In France it was abolished with the fall of the kings; but it re-appeared in the Republic which has its Academy Order, its Legion of Honor, its Medal of Honor, Medal of Merit and Cross of War, (Croix de Guerre) all instituted to satisfy man's natural want and need for official recognition when of service to humanity in general, and the public demand for means of showing appreciation.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>We all want to be recognized in some way or other; some are satisfied with money only, others strive to obtain power and others again enjoy plain public appreciation.</p>
   <p>A country is always in need of people whose ambition it is first of all to be of public service, and it is not at all a bad idea to acknowledge such minds by granting them a token of official recognition.</p>
   <p>That's why we have medals, titles and tokens of honor in this country too. George Washington and Paul Jones received the two first medals ever given in the United States. The Medal of Honor was instituted in 1861 and was the only medal to be had in the United States for a long time, excepting the silver or golden medal for life saving which Congress is authorized to grant.</p>
   <p>After the World War a number of new orders and medals were instituted, the best known of which is "The Distinguished Service Cross, " instituted 1918.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Of course, such medals are predominently used as tokens of appreciation for heroic deeds for which a war is opportune.</p>
   <p>A soldier who reveals an unusual lack of consideration for own safety is eligible and apt to receive one.</p>
   <p>Heroisen cannot be appreciated in terms of money, or at least we do not feel it can or should be.</p>
   <p>To my knowledge the American army and navy have now sixteen different kinds of honorary decorations, while Civil Service still has but one, the medal for life saving. But there are a number of other medals of merit and honor available for scientists, explorers, etc., people who can't be blamed for being more interested in public recognition than the rest of us. On the contrary they generally consider the cause more important than the reward.</p>
   <p>Honorary lodges have been instrumental in the struggle for world progress and many important achievements can be attributed to the pshycological effect <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of their functions. They should not be regarded as undemocratic unless our conception of democracy is that of a uniform mob suppressed to the lowest standard.</p>
   <p>Of course, it can be misused like everything else. None of man's creations are perfect.</p>
   <p>Honorary orders are commonly used as tokens of courtesy between nations, and when conferred to a person the honor is meant for the position he holds; for instance, the leader of a social movement would be the recipient of a token of honor granted in consideration of the benefits brought about by the movement. Or a modal can be used to signify an important historic event.</p>
   <p>To become a member of the French Academy no doubt would convey the feeling to the person concerned that be belongs among the leaders of the nation's spiritual life. Such feeling may make a person happy and humble at the same time.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Where honor leads to arrogance, it has hit a wrong place; but aside from that I do not at all believe that a proposal to do away with medals and the like is an expression for any particular democratic point of view. The benefits obtained through the encouragements honorary decorations have caused, outweighs the negative results by far. There is hardly any reason to call a halt.</p>
