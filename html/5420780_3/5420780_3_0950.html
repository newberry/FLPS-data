   <p>Few Danish-Born Citizens in Chicago have a more successful career to look upon than Andrew H. Greenberg, retired builder and banker.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenberg was born in 1855 in Hygum near Redding, Slesvig, and in 1881 he arrived in Chicago where he soon found work as a carpenter. Being an able journey-man, he had no difficulty in keeping steady work, and in comparatively short time he had saved enough money to start his own contracting business in which he was quite successful until the depression, following the 1893 World's Fair, temporarily slackened the activities of the building industry.</p>
   <p>But the depression could not slacken Mr. Greenberg's energy and initiative, so he made a swift turn from building houses to selling dry goods, for which there was yet a demand. In partnership with S. T. Corydon he started a store on the corner of Fairfield and North Avenues.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>However, his devotedness to the trade in which he was brought up, was too strong, and therefore, when times again were favorable for the building business, he sold his part in the dry goods store to Mr. Corydon, and started in anew as a house builder.</p>
   <p>In 1907 Mr. Greenberg bought a section of land at the northwest corner of North and Crawford Avenues where he established a real estate office and started to put up buildings on the land which then was an open prairie. "Wise" friends, well-meaning rather than foresighted, predicted total failure to be the result out of this enterprise in a section of the city far away from all transportation save horse teaming; but Mr. Greenberg, possessing an unfailing instinct for business developments, unaffected by the opinion of others, carried out his plans and finished within the first year not one but six buildings, which, to the astonishment of his many "wise" friends, were fully rented even before they were fully completed.</p>
   <p>This was pioneer work in the best sense of the word, and attracted by Mr. <span class="page-break">\3</span>Greenberg's success, others soon followed in his footsteps and covered the adjoining sections with modern homes and business buildings. For this new settlement Mr. Greenberg became a much honored and trusted adviser and financier compelling him to add banking facilities and a safety vault to the real estate office.</p>
   <p>Then, in 1913, advised and backed by his trusting friend, James R. Forgan, president of the First National Bank, Greenberg founded The Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank of which he became president. This bank has been a most valuable support to the entire neighborhood, and it is well worth noting that this is one of the very few banks, in the outlying districts of Chicago, that stood the test under the 1929-1933 economic and financial depression.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenberg, now a widower since his good wife, Bodil Kirstine, passed away on April 29th, 1932, resides in one of the first houses he built <span class="page-break">\4</span>more than 25 years ago, and he is yet busily engaged in managing his properties in the district, which, to the honor of its founder, today is recognized as one of the finest and most prosperous business centers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>His time having been fully occupied by his business, Mr. Greenberg has seldom taken part in social activities; but in all fairness it must be said that few men in the Danish colony in Chicago have more cheerfully and liberally contributed to charitable and other worthy causes than Andrew H. Greenberg.</p>
