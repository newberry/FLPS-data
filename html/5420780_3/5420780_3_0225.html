   <p>p.2.col.1......Officers and Directors of the society are recommending that stock-holders change its policy and status; that is, eliminate the stock and make the operation of the society "not for pecuniary profit." At the last annual meeting it was decided to drop the Export &amp; Import clause of the constitution so there will not be any commercial angle to the order.</p>
   <p>It is pointed out that, because of the commercial aspect the society has not been as popular as anticipated. Hence with a change in status where reasonable dues and more social activities a larger and more popular society will probably result.</p>
   <p>No commercial gains having been made there will be available for refund to stockholders approximately 50% of the original $10.00 fee share paid at the time the society was organized. Share-holders are given an option of cashing their shares or reviving a life membership in the reorganized society with no further payments of dues.</p>
