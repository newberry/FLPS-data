   <p>We believe that it is hardly necessary to elaborate on what tomorrow means to the Danes, especially those who, here in Chicago, will celebrate the day on a grander scale than ever before.</p>
   <p>June 5, 1849, is the most auspicious landmark in the history of "old Denmark." The old kingdom has seen many greater days during its long existence that dates back at least to the beginning of the Christian era; but the happiest, the most blessed event in the life of the Danish people is the birth of constitutional liberty fifty years ago--June 5, 1849.</p>
   <p>Today and tomorrow the glorious, heaven-sent Danebrog [the Danish flag], the oldest flag now in use as a national emblem, will be flung to the breeze in Denmark, from Danish ships scattered over the broad seas, among our Danish <span class="page-break">\2</span>fellow citizens in America, here in Chicago, and wherever sons and daughters of the "old land" happen to dwell.</p>
   <p>Fifty years is a brief space of time in the life of a nation; yet, so young is civil liberty in the world that the semicentennial of a free constitution is a comparatively rare event and one that well may attract general attention in all enlightened lands. The blessings of liberty would seem to have been allotted among the nations in accordance with the rule that "the last shall be first and the first shall be last." The oldest written constitution now in force we find in the New World, while the youngest, generally speaking, are found in the Old World. The organic laws of our republic and the oldest states antedate all others, and next in seniority ranks the constitution of Norway. The constitution of Denmark, adopted fifty years ago, is one of the oldest now in vogue in Europe.</p>
   <p>Denmark's organic law of 1849 is generally regarded as a gift from a king to <span class="page-break">\3</span>his people. In one sense this is true. Frederick VII was a man of the people with his ear close to the popular heart. The liberty wave of 1848 had swept Denmark in its onward course, and though no disturbances had followed, a restless longing for liberty had been left in the Danish heart. The king knew the unspoken wish of the nation, and announced his readiness to surrender his power and to accept a constitution to be framed by a constituent assembly representing the people. A burst of popular enthusiasm greeted this act of unprecedented royal generosity and wise statesmanship. Rebellion in the duchies had already roused the national sentiment of the people, and now their patriotic enthusiasm gathered fresh strength from the promise of constitutional liberty.</p>
   <p>Thus was Danish liberty born--under the high pressure of popular sentiment. The new organic law soon received its baptism in blood through glorious victories for the Danish army over the German forces on the border. But during the depressing days after the unequal struggle of 1864, the constitution of 1849 was mutilated; in its present form it presents a rather singular compromise between popular and vested rights. But the remarkable progress of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Danish people during the last fifty years insures a complete restoration of the constitution of 1849, sooner or lsater. It is this constitution that lives in the hearts of the people; it is the birth of this splendid charter of liberty that they celebrate today and tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Denmark's "Liberty Day" has a beautiful setting--the fresh bright glory of early summer. It carries a suggestion of stately beach forests arrayed in their best; blooming meadows rich in tender fragrances and cheerful crowds of people in holiday attire. And when the eventful days of 1849 are portrayed in speech and song to the enthusiastic multitudes, out of the mist of the past, splitting the black clouds of intervening years, appear the kindly features of the beloved king who scorned power that he might give liberty to his people--the only king whom history will place among the champions of popular liberty, the only king whose memory will grow dearer to the nation as liberty shall advance in the land. Yes, tomorrow every Dane in Chicago will turn out, singing in the bright sunlight the songs of old. We shall hear, "Vift <span class="page-break">\5</span>stolt paa Kodon's bolge" (Wave Proudly o'er Kodon's Seas), and we shall dream of dear old Denmark.</p>
