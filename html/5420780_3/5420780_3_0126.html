   <p>The Census of 1910 showed that there was 181,000 Danes in the United States. There are 147,000 children who were born here of Danish parents. There are about 72,000 children one of whose parents was Danish.</p>
   <p>To this number must be added the great number of those from South Jutland, who in the Census are counted as Germans, but in fact are the most ardent Danes anywhere. The number of Danes in the United States is therefore more than 225,000.</p>
   <p>The figures for Illinois are: 15,684 Danes in 1900 and 17,368 Danes in 1910. The Danes make up 1.4 per cent of the population in Illinois. There are 11,551 children both of whose parents were Danish, and 4,600 with one Danish parent.</p>
