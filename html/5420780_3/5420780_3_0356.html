   <p>A meeting called by Dania to discuss the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Danish Constitution was well attended. As the Central Committee was split into West Side and South Side sections, however, most of the societies were against the participation of the Central Committee in this affair; they believed that it would only split the colony further. Most lodges were also against holding a celebration merely to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Constitution, because they felt that the changes made in the Constitution in 1866 were so reactionary that they practically abrogated the Constitution of 1849. These societies believed that the splendid victories of the German-Danish war of 1848-1850 should be celebrated instead.</p>
