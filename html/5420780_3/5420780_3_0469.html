   <p>At the annual conference held in Racine, Wis. in 1893 a new constitution was written. 36 ministers signed, but eighteen refused; these eighteen later on formed "Det Danske Evangelisk-Lutherske Kirkesemfund" which later took the name "Den Forenede Danske Evagelisk-Lutherske Kirke." (The United Danish Evagelical Lutheran Church.)</p>
   <p>[These two churches are known by their shorter name, The Danish Church and The United Church. The Danish Church is based on the doctrines of Bishop S.N. Grundtvig; and the United Church is based upon the great revival in Denmark lead by Vilhelm Beck; this church is deeply pietistic.</p>
   <p>In the Danish State Church in Denmark these two religious view points share the same churches and their ministers are trained at the same theological school, the University of Copenhagen; but in this country they have not been able to find one another, and they do not get along so well where they both work in the same community.] J.E.</p>
