   <p>The Trinitatis Church has co-operated with St. Stefan on the South Side in publishing Bud og Hilsen, a monthly paper. The costs have been $96.12. A Yearbook has also been published at an expense of $146.88, but the Yearbook brought in $157.50 in advertisements.</p>
   <p>Since the first Sunday in Advent, Einar Rosendale and Knud Overgaard have mimeographed The Sunday-Bulletin with names of the hymns and the oratoriums played by the organist, and the text of the sermons for that Sunday; and also small notices about what is going on in the Church during the coming week.</p>
