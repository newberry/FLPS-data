   <p>The Danish National Day in Riverview Park, June 5, was a success. More than six thousand tickets were sold. If we include the children, who came in free of charge, the crowd surely numbered about ten thousand. About fifty Danes came from Racine, Wisconsin, and forty from Dwight, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Ivar Kirkegaard spoke about the Danish constitution; Mayor Seidel of Milwaukee spoke about Socialism, and Dr. P. C. Kjaerbye, of Fresno, California, about the aim of the Danish societies in America. There was singing by a choir of girls under the leadership of Joel Mossberg and by Magneten. There was also a gymnastic exhibition, by twelve men from Freja under the direction of Mr. Simonsen. The main attraction of the day was the newly elected Socialist mayor of Milwaukee. Many Danish Socialists were present to hear him. The Danish Brotherhood did not participate with the exception of Lodge No. 58.</p>
