   <p>The Danish Church had its annual meeting in Tyler, Minn., June 14-17, with 41 ministers and 60 delegates from the different congregations. There were about 400 visitors from all over the country. It was decided to build a new Danish Children's Home in Chicago near Humboldt Park, but it was not to exceed $16,000. There will be a Danish Day School in connection with the home.</p>
