   <p>The following resolutions were adopted by the officers of the Danish Brotherhood of America, at their annual conference in Omaha, Nebraska:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, it has come to the attention of this organization, the Danish organization, the Danish Brotherhood of America, that the Congress of the United States has passed a law, to take effect July 1, 1927, restricting the number of immigrants permitted to enter the United States from Denmark; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Section 11, of the Immigration Law of 1924, reduces the number of Danish immigrants to enter the United States from 2,789 to 945, making the quota of immigrants admitted from Denmark so negligible that discrimination appears to have been made against our native country and its citizens; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that as officers of the largest Danish fraternal organization in America, and as law-abiding citizens of the United States, we enter our most emphatic protest against such discrimination, and that we as a body, both <span class="page-break">2</span>collectively and individually, as separate lodges and individual members, convey at once to the President, our Representatives in Congress, to the Secretary of Labor, and also to the chairmen of the Legislative and Immigration Committees in Washington, D. C. a unanimous protest, with the request that Section 11 of the Immigration Act of 1924 be repealed, and that the present quota of immigration from Denmark be retained.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that copies of these resolutions be sent to the Danish Sisterhood of America, and to all other Danish fraternal and social organizations, churches, and religious societies asking the members to join with us in a unanimous petition so that our birthright of freedom may be honored and protected by the government of the United States, in recognition of the fact that the Danish citizens of America have always endeavored in every way possible to promote the welfare and progress of their adopted land, and to that end have dedicated their best efforts, their most loyal support, and their wholehearted allegiance."</p>
