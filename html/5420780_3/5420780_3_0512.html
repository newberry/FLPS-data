The Church started with fifty-six members, but by January 17 there were 173.</p>
   <p>The annual income was $1,050. Toward the erection of the church $3,200 was paid. This sum was raised by the members and by Danes outside the Church. The furniture was made without charge by the members. Altar lights, etc., were donated by the women's society of the Church. In 1875, the debt of the Church was $1,719.88. An interest of six per cent per annum was paid on that amount.</p>
