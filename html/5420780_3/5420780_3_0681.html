   <p>At the concert in the Danish Workmen's Singing Society's hall on Rockwell Street, in which representatives from all our singing societies participated, we found Dr. Max Henius eagerly in action. The Doctor has just returned from his fifty-eighth journey across the Atlantic and has brought fresh greetings from Opera Singer Johs Fons, our world-famous fellow countryman.</p>
   <p>After the concert, the singers thanked Dr. Henius for the interest which he has always taken in Danish choruses and congratulated him on the rare badge of honor which he had received in Denmark on his last trip, namely, the Medal of Merit in Gold.</p>
