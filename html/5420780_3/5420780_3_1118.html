   <p>Carl Munk, 883 North Mozart Street, died February 20, at the age of seventy-seven. He was the son of a school teacher of Soesmarke, Lolland, Denmark. For some years he was a grocer in Slagelse, Denmark. He came to Chicago in 1853 and lived here longer than any other Dane. He was a grocer in Chicago for a while, and then for many years was a saloonkeeper on East Chicago Avenue, which soon became the center of the Danish settlement.</p>
   <p>For many years he wrote free of charge for Hejmdal, Fremad, and Den Nye Tid. The last twenty-five years were the happiest in his life; this was all due to his good wife Mathilde, with whom he recently celebrated his silver wedding.</p>
   <p>He was one of the founders of Dania and became its president in 1865 and 1866. He was also one of the organizers of Dania's first masquerade, which took place in German Hall on the North Side.</p>

   <p>He never took the streetcar, but one could often see him walk all the way out to South Chicago or Pullman to discuss the topics of the day with old friends. Lagoni, George Olsen, and Hoffenblad were among those who came to his funeral.</p>
