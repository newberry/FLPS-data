   <p>Peter Nissen, who four to five years ago suddenly became famous as he sailed across Niagara Falls in one of his balloon boats, lost his life December 1. His boats were called Foolkillers. Foolkiller I went to the bottom of Niagara Falls, while Foolkiller II carried him over the Falls safely; it was for some time exhibited in a Dime Museum here in Chicago. On November 29 he entered Foolkiller III at the foot of Ohio St. The balloon was made of waterproof canvas over a thin skeleton of wood; it was 35 feet long and 15 feet in diameter; inside was a chair upon which the inventor sat. The balloon rolled on the lake and was lost from sight in about 15 minutes. His body was found December 1 on the coast outside Stevensville, 15 miles South of St. Joseph. Peter Nissen was born at Emmellev, near Tonder, Denmark. He was only forty-two years old. During the nineties he started a business college on Milwaukee Ave. Later he was bookkeeper for Jessen &amp; Rosberg on Kinzie Ave. He was for some time a member of Dania and Walhalla.</p>
