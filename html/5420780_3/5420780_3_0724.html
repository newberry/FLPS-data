   <p>The Danish-American Association has published a quarterly bulletin containing reports as to its activities. The association has extended its work to comprise what is being called a bureau of "cultural exchange" which, in connection with the press bureau, serves to inform the public about cultural relations between Denmark and America.</p>
   <p>The association is now publishing a bulletin containing information about Denmark in general. The title is "Danish-American Bulletin", and it is being printed in English.</p>
   <p>In the first issue just published, an article on the subject "Agricultural Co-operation in Denmark" by the Library Commissioner of Wisconsin, John F. Sinclair, appeared. The author has visited Denmark and his report, which has been published in full by the State Board of Public Affairs <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of Wisconsin, is the result of his observations.</p>
   <p>In the near future, the lecture about Denmark by Doctor Egan, will appear in the bulletin.</p>
   <p>Further, the press bureau of the association is preparing a "Danish-American Bibliography" purported to be a complete index of all English literature about and the Danes as far as possible.</p>
   <p>Finally, the bulletin brings a list of fifty new members which is encouraging news.</p>
