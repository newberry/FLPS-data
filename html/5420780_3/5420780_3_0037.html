   <p>p.1.......The National Committee has this year decided, in connection with the festival, to arrange a Danish tag day, as has lately been done both in America and in Denmark as well as in other countries. The purpose is to collect the largest possible fund for the assistance of those of our countrymen who are in distress. The committee hopes thus to lay the corner stone of a monument, as beautiful and noble as can be erected by any nation. All we Danes, who gather tomorrow, far from the coasts of our homeland, to revive the memory of our childhood home, its customs, its people and language, should be happy to do our share towards alleviating suffering among those of our countrymen who has been hit by sickness or other misfortune. We appeal to every Dane to make his contribution, large or small. None of us who will celebrate tomorrow know what the future has in store for us, but let us express our joy, by extending a helping hand to those that are less privileged. There are many of our countrymen in this great city fighting against odds. Let us help them! We will thereby make this day of <span class="page-break">2</span>festival doubly happy for ourselves. Let none of us be without that tag tomorrow! It will express our will and ability to help those who are losing out in the struggle for existence. Let us give what we can.</p>
