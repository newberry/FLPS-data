   <p>Carl Hansen writes an appeal to all Danish societies to unite at least once a year for the celebration of the Danish Day of Independence, which is June 5. He knows that it is very hard to get the Danes in Chicago to unite, for there is too much jealousy between the different societies and the different individuals. But once, in 1899, the Danes got together and celebrated their National Day in a proper manner, and the result was the biggest gathering of Danes ever seen outside of Denmark, a crowd of ten thousand.</p>
   <p>The Danes in Chicago ought to elect or send delegates to a permanent National Committee. This was attempted in 1899, but the president, Niels Juul, was attacked so violently in Den Danske Pioneer (The Danish Pioneer) that he gave up, and dropped the whole thing.</p>

   <p>This year it will be sixty years since the Danes got their own constitution in 1849. The occasion will be celebrated on June 6.</p>
