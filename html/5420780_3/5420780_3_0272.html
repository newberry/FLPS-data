   <p>At Dania's last general meeting, it was decided that any Dane who wished to join Dania without subscribing to the funeral and sick benefits, could do so by paying annual dues of four dollars in advance. Such members, of course, are not to vote upon matters pertaining to the funeral or sick benefit society, but they are to be shown the same honor at their funeral as all other members, and such expenses are to be paid by Dania.</p>
