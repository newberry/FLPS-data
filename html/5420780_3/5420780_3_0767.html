   <p>p.4.col.3.........Mrs. Julia Rosenberg, who has made such a warm place for herself in the hearts of Chicago's Danish colony ) again on Wednesday gained new friends by visiting the Danish Old Peoples Home and the Danish Orphanage. In both institutions she won the love of the inmates with her generous offerings of the songs they love; two whole hours of music in each place. Mrs. Rosenberg's love for her people and their music and her unbounded generosity in the giving of pleasure to the helpless and otherwise unfortunate is strongly reminisent of - Jenny Lind. Love and sacrifice combined with a wonderful talent cannot but attract and win the very soul of her listners and assuredly the life of inmates of these homes has been made brighter and less lonely.</p>
