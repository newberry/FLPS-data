   <p>Henry Johnson, a prominent business man of the northwestern part of the city, is one of that group of valuable citizens who have gained wealth and business standing entirely through their own resources. He was born in Denmark June 28, 1844, and is a son of Jens and Caron Hanson. His father was a butcher by trade and carried on a business of his own in that line.</p>
   <p>Henry Johnson was educated in the common schools of his native lands, and having learned the butcher's trade he continued with his father until he reached the age of twenty-two years. He then left home, and in 1866 came to America, locating at first in Wisconsin, where he worked in a saw mill. He came to Chicago the next year and for a period of sixteen years worked in various furniture factories of the city, acquiring considerable mechanical skill and saving quite a sum of money. He next opened a factory on Erie Street, in company with Hans Paulson, but two years later sold out his interest and again <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>took up factory work.</p>
   <p>In 1886, for the second time, he entered business on his own account, establishing an undertaking office at Nos. 794 and 796 West North Avenue. So successful was this venture that he has continued the business at the same location ever since. He erected the building at the above number in 1885, and in 1897 built another building at No. 264 Milwaukee Avenue, where he has another undertaking establishment. He also conducts a fine livery in connection with each branch. In the conduct of his affairs he has ever been energetic and economical, the result being that all his efforts have been crowned with the greatest success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson was married in 1869 to Miss Kittie Rasmonson, who died in 1891. She was the mother of two children, William and Amy, both living. Mr. Johnson <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>was married in 1892 to Gensena Marie Madsen. Two children have blessed this marriage, Gensena and Lenora Christina.</p>
