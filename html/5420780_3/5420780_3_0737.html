   <p>p.2.....Dr. Max Henius, who lately has garnered much honor and fame as general manager of the great brewery exhibition at the Coliseum has, according to advices from Copenhagen, been named Commander of "Dannebrog" by the Danish king. Coincident with the exhibition, the famous Wahl-Henius "Institute of Fermentology" and "Brewing Academy" have observed their Twentieth anniversary,and this occasion, together with Dr. Henius' never failing work for the promotion of Danish-American interests, have presumably been instrumental in the bestowal of this honor.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, this is the highest order ever conferred upon a Danish-American.</p>
