   <p>A split in the synod of the Danish Evangelical Church is imminent. Differences of opinion in regard to the inspiration of the Bible, place of the Bible in the church, origin and date of the Apostles' Creed, and whether the Bible is the Word of God, or whether it but contains the Word of God, are the subjects of controversy. Opposite sides in the dispute are taken by T.H.Helvig, and C.Vig, leading professors in the seminary. That this controversy might be disposed of, a special meeting was held yesterday at the Danish Trinity Church at Bickerdike and West Superior Streets. The meeting was attended by noted Danish Divines from different parts of the Northwest as well as by numerous laymen. The meeting opened yesterday morning with prayer by the pastor of the church, the Rev. A.S. Neilson, who is also President of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association of North America.</p>
   <p>The Rev. O.L.Kirkeberg was elected chairman.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon the question of division on the ground of difference in doctrines came up for discussion, and addresses were delivered by the Rev. A.S.Nielson, F.L.Grunttvig, A. Dan, and O.L.Kirkeberg, who spoke against division, and the Rev. Mr. Soholm and Prof. C. Vig for division. The greater part of the assembly does not favor division of the church, and is outspoken for tolerance, union and peace.</p>
