   <p>The Scandinavian Fraternity Review has a few words to say about "hyphenated Americans."</p>
   <p>"We Scandinavians who have become citizens of the United States ought to feel rather proud of our "Americans," for unlike the native-born we are Americans by choice instead of Americans by necessity. Still we need not forget the land from which we came, any more than a man who has a good wife need forget his mother. He has married the former, it is true, and owes her his first allegiance, but to the latter he owes his very existence and all the fond recollections of his childhood days."</p>
