   <p>The oldest Danish society in Chicago, Dania, now thirty-six years old, has recently declined somewhat. But at its last meeting it was resolved to cancel the initiation fee of four dollars after March 31. All you have to do to join the society is to bring a doctor's certificate that you are in good health, pay the membership dues for three months and the funeral assessment. It is expected that many new members will join our oldest and finest society, which also owns a very fine Danish library.</p>
