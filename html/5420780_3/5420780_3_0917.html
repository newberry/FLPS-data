   <p>A gray-haired man, reclining in a swivel chair, greeted me. The vigor and snap with which he proceeded to sweep away formalities, even the rings of smoke arising from his pipe, made him a "personality"--Mr. J. Christian Bay!</p>
   <p>Mr. Bay is head librarian of the John Crerar Library, located on the northwest corner of Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, directly north of the Chicago Public Library. This library (the John Crerar) deals chiefly with, and was organized upon information concerning the natural, physical, and social sciences.</p>
   <p>"My weakness," commenced Mr. Bay, "my hobby, my greatest desire is managing a library. I am interested in presenting to the public, easily and promptly, useful books.</p>
   <p>"In 1900, the Library of Congress, which is the national library of the country, was reorganized--thus bringing together, people from all over the United States, <span class="page-break">2</span>who were interested and desired to help in this project. Incidentally, I was one of them. Partly because it was such a large library containing over one million books (now containing about three million), it offered a trememdous opportunity of seeing books gathered from all parts of the world and also of learning methods of library work. Practically all the people who were engaged in this work went out into the world soon after and took charge of other libraries.</p>
   <p>"Do you see those two pictures on the wall?" asked Mr. Bay.</p>
   <p>"No," I answered, rather bewildered, for a quick scrutiny revealed neat gray drapes adorning three immense windows; two huge bookcases filled with magnificent books, and about nineteen pictures hanging on the wall. Still, my impression was not of overcrowdedness, but on the contrary, everything was arranged with good taste.</p>
   <p>"Look again," he commanded. "Right above those books aside from the door. Do <span class="page-break">3</span>you see them now?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Those two men are connected with the Library of Congress. The one is Dr. Herbert Putnam, head librarian; the other, Mr. Charles Martel, chief of the Catalog Department. They are two of my most esteemed friends."</p>
   <p>A mediative silence ensued. It was broken when Mr. Bay asked me if I were of Danish descent. When I said yes, he handed me a booklet of magnificent pictures of Denmark. Amidst my cries of gratitude he interrupted rather volcanically and requested that the interview be resumed.</p>
   <p>[INTERVIEW WITH J. C. BAY]</p>
   <p>(Continued from Mar. 24, 1933.)</p>
   <p>"Did you always wish to be a librarian?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"No--oh, no! When I was young, I wanted to be a traveler and to explore, especially, the tropics. That was partly because my family had traveled so much. My father was an old "Forty-niner" in the gold rush. He took a steamer to Baltimore and went down to Cape Horn, South America, and then up to California. So you see I have an innate lust for traveling and exploring.</p>
   <p>"In 1925, I went to my native Denmark. When I traversed the same fields, climbed the same steps, and reached for the doorhandle of my home, I remembered my childhood days and the times when I could not reach high enough to grasp that handle. A flood of memories overwhelmed me and I was lost in the chaos of loneliness, which fostered a feeling of ennui. Three months later, when I perceived the Statue of Liberty, and the skyscrapers dotting the coast of New York, an exotic thrill ran through my veins; the greatest thrill ran through my veins, the greatest thrill I have ever had! For this was home!"</p>
   <p>An interval of silence followed as Mr. Bay drew aside the drapes to allow a <span class="page-break">5</span>stream of light, issuing forth, to brighten the room. A beam of sunlight lit upon a gold letter opener, flickered, and, disappeared. We gazed out of the window and saw the steady flow of automobiles wending their way through an endless maze of traffic.</p>
   <p>"Shall I tell you how I came to write a story?" asked Mr. Bay, wistfully and dreamily. He continued," Of all the places I have visited there are none I like so well as I do Kentucky --partly because it is rich with legends, stories of the past, pioneer life, and old relics. It was while I was visiting Kentucky that I came to an old Trappist Monastery so named because the men living there never talk. When I entered the place I felt a cloak of the middle ages shroud me and completly envelop me in darkness, silence, and gloom. A few miles away was civilization, but here was utter wilderness, a replica of the past ages. I was ushered into the presence of an Abbot who was a dear friend of mine. Here the first inkling of an idea for a story was born. On a desk before us stood a magnificent golden <span class="page-break">6</span>chalice. Four gems: a diamond, a sapphire, a topaz, and a ruby were inserted in the base. The ruby was chipped! How had it became shipped? The Abbot declared that the chip was probably caused by some careless fellow in a factory where the stones had been set or when it was polished. The next morning, as I was sitting in my anteroom, Mr. Young E. Allisen, author of that famous poem "Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest," entered. As he was rather deaf, I wrote on a sheet of paper, "The Chalice of the Chipped Ruby," and immediately retired. We met in the sunny gardens a little later and he said "The Chalice of the Chipped Ruby would make a dandy title for a book." After a heated debate between us, it was finally decided that I should write the story. I wrote it--a book of fancies! Here is a copy. Read it some time and tell me what you think of it."</p>
   <p>I read the book. Herewith follows a short paragraph taken from it--a paragraph in which the Abbot is telling what he has learned from the Chipped Ruby concerning the Monastery and people:</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"We may discover any minute some weak spot in our armor of supposed firmness. Now you know the main cause of our silence and seclusion: We live by faith, but our very faith impels us to fear being chipped, as you said, in contact with the world. We may differ on many points, but none of us care to be found with a flaw. Even you men of the world do not wish to expose yourselves. When you are caught unaware, a waste of time is at least involved. To avoid exposure --is one lesson of this Chalice of the Chipped Ruby!"</p>
