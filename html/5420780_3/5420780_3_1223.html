   <p>Dr. [N. P.] Pearson, whose Danish name was Petersen, is dead at 72 years of age. He did not mix much with the new generation of Danes. He belonged to the Free Masons, who arranged his funeral. He was a skillful doctor, married twice and had a beautiful daughter who was deaf and dumb. He was well-to-do when he died. He belonged to the old timers, such as Consul Otto Dreier and Dr. Jacobsen, who have also passed away.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Dr. Pearson was a brother of the Danish Consul in Chicago, Mr. Andrew Petersen.]</p>
