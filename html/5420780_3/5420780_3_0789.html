   <p>We have been informed by telegram that two Danish citizens of Chicago have received the Order of Knight of the Danish Flag; they are, Dr. Max Henius and Henry L. Hertz. They, however, have not received direct confirmation. The crosses have not been received either, but they are expected to arrive at any moment.</p>
   <p>Henry Hertz, who is an employee of the Federal government, will receive the insignia through the Department of Foreign Affairs, by means of a special permission granted by Congress. He is not permitted to wear it as long as he is in the U. S. service, and there is no indication that he is going to quit his job for the pleasure of doing so.</p>
   <p>We presume the appointments are made as a result of Admiral Richelieu's recent visit to America. If the two gentlemen are the only ones upon <span class="page-break">2</span>whom these honors are to be conferred, several cases of "heartburn" [sic] is likely to result.</p>
   <p>However, we are of the opinion that the persons mentioned are worthy of the honor. Both men have reached a high position in American life while at the same time safeguarding the welfare of their fellow Danes.</p>
   <p>Neither of them have ever exhibited a radical front or displayed contempt for such honors, as people so often do, and yet accept them at the first opportunity.</p>
   <p>They cannot be classed as snobs praising Royalty at every possible and impossible occasion as do so many Danes; and which, for instance, is illustrated in the crazy idea of Danes in America erecting a monument to the Danish king. Therefore, we think that this bit of knickknack is deserved by the two gentlemen. They are not better men than before, but the honor bestowed does not detract from their reputations.</p>

   <p>Henry Hertz is leaving Chicago Tuesday, to board, the ship "Hellig Olav," for a trip to Denmark, not to express his thanks for the appointment (which he cannot do before receiving it), but to consult Professor Bjerring, the famous oculist. Mr. Hertz's eyes have been bothering him for a long time. Of course, he will maintain his interest in the Danish-American Association on his trip.</p>
   <p>He will be accompanied by his wife. They will return to Chicago at the end of September.</p>
