   <p>The uninvited missionaries, who come to the Jewish neighborhood to "Save" the lost souls of the unfortunate Jewish children, came Sunday evening to the corner of Roosevelt Road and St. Louis Avenue, and began their task of saving Jewish souls. Many passers-by stopped to hear one of the missionaries. This speaker, in a characteristically missionary-fashion, began to ridicule the Jewish-belief, insulting the Jews for their refusal to transfer their thoughts to the Christian-belief, which would lead them to the Eternal Light and to everything that is good, and so forth.</p>
   <p>Protests were heard from among the audience. The missionary was asked to be a bit more tactful in his speech in the heart of the Jewish neighborhood. The speaker refused to heed his advice. Then more material-protests came: various fruits and eggs were thrown. The missionary, who had come to preach to the Jews, Peace and the Real Truth, which only through him is to be discovered, pulled out a revolver and threatened the crowd. This aroused many, and they began to fight.</p>
   <p>Policeman William Rooney came at that moment and placed himself alongside the missionaries, and he was forced to fight the growing and angry crowd, who at the moment did not distinguish him from the missionaries. The missionaries left during the riot. The police broke up the mob and arrested five for resisting officers of the law.</p>
