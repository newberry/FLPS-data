   <p>About 100 Jewish families who left Chicago during the hot months, and who settled themselves in tents in Braeside, Illinois, will, in a few days, be forced to move back to the City.</p>
   <p>Those whose permits expired this week, which permits are taken out monthly in the City Hall, and who applied for renewals, were informed that no further permits would be issued.</p>
   <p>Braeside, which for a few years was the summer home for just a few, became, last year, and especially this year, a full-grown town. Nearly 100 tents ware set up. Each family brought with itself its entire housekeeping equipment.</p>
   <p>The Forest Preserve Bureau announced that it has refused permits because of lack of proper sanitation for so many, which might result in a serious epidemic.</p>
