   <p>Mr. Leon Mandel, the New York member of our Chicago firm, Mandel Brothers, invited a dozen or so of the well-known members of our Jewish community, to meet him on Washington's birthday, at 3 P.M., in the library-room of the Standard Club. At the stated time and place, he offered as a gift from himself to our Jewish community, the sum of twenty-thousand dollars, for the purpose of establishing an industrial school building for Jewish girls, or Jewish boys and girls, as should be seen fit, annexing as the only condition that our Jewish public should work out a plan whereby the maintenance of the institution should be permanently secured. As one of the special reasons for appropriating this sum for a Chicago charity, it is stated that it is in Chicago mainly where Mr. Mandel has made his money.</p>
