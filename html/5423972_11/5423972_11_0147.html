   <p>Rabbi Idelson, representative of the Denver Consumptive Sanitarium, is going to speak this Saturday at the Hungarian Synagogue, corner of Marshfield Ave. and Polk Street.</p>
   <p>We hope that the importance of the Sanitarium and the oratorical ability of the Rabbi will arouse the enthusiasm of the Hungarian-Jewish element in Chicago, so that they will be as liberal with their donations to the worthy cause as are the other congregations in the different sections of Chicago.</p>
