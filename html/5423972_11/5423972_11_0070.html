   <p>One of the best-known German physicians of this city, Dr. M. Mannheimer, died suddenly the day before yesterday at the Auditorium Hotel. About a year ago he went with his family to Europe to improve his health in the old country, as he was suffering from a disease of the brain. His hopes for improving his health, however, were shattered completely, and he recently returned to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mannheimer was born in Bavaria forty-six years ago. He studied medicine at Munich, Erlangen, and Vienna, and came to Chicago in 1864. Soon after he established himself in the old Tribune building, across the street from the Sherman Hotel, he was appointed Assistant Health Commissioner. Since 1865 he was a member of the staff of physicians at the Alexian Hospital, and in a similar position he was active at the Michael Reese Hospital. About a year ago his strenuous professional activities began to react unfavorably upon his health.</p>
