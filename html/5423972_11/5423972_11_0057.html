   <p>As previously stated in these columns, of the nominations made by the recent Democratic convention of Cook County, we publish herewith a life-like portrait of Mr. Philip Stein, who received the unanimous nomination for Superior Court judge. Mr. Stein is well known in our city as an able jurist, and enjoys withal a host of friends. He was born in Rhenish Prussia, near Essen, the seat of Krupp's celebrated cannon factory, in 1844. He began his studies in school when only four years old. At the age of ten he came over to the United States with his parents, who settled on a farm in Wisconsin, three miles from the now well-known watering place of Waukesha. From 1854 to 1859 young Stein went to school during the Winter and worked on the farm during the Summer. He attended the high school in Milwaukee from 1859 to 1861. Mr. Stein entered the state university of Wisconsin in 1861 and took a full classical course. He made his mark as a student, and was graduated as the valedictorian of his class in June, 1865. Then Mr. Stein went to Europe and spent two years at the universities of Heidelberg, Bonn and <span class="page-break">2</span>Berlin, where he devoted himself to the study of the civil law, philosophy and history. Returning to America in 1867, Mr. Stein studied law in Milwaukee for two years, and was admitted to the practice of the law, late in 1868. Immediately afterward he settled in Chicago, where he has been engaged in practice ever since. During the great fire of 1871 Mr. Stein's place of business was burned and he lost all. Mr. Stein has always taken an active interest in German societies, and in July, 1872, he delivered the address at the laying of the corner stone of the present building of the Chicago Turngemeinde, 256 N. Clark street. Since then he has served two successive terms as speaker, or president, of the Turngemeinde. A few years after the fire, he also served a term as vice-president of the Germania Maennerchor. Mr. Stein was married in 1875. By a coincidence, the maiden name of Mrs. Philip Stein was Emma Stein. The fruits of this marriage are five pretty daughters, the eldest being thirteen years of age. The children speak both English and German. The only time Mr. Stein has participated in active politics was in the earlier stages of the movement in 1873 which resulted in the formation of the People's Party of Chicago and the nomination and election of Mayor Colvin. In 1887 he became a member of the firm <span class="page-break">3</span>of Kraus, Mayer and Stein, which was joined last March by Judge Moran, late of the Appellate court, since then the firm has been Moran, Kraus, Mayer and Stein. His partner, Adolf Kraus, the representative Bohemian, is an uncle of Mr. Stein's wife. As a practitioner, Mr. Stein has not confined himself to office practice nor to any special branch of the law. He tried the first case that was tried in a court of record in this county, after the fire. This was in the old high school on W. Monroe street, before Judge Gary, now of the Appellate court. Sidney Smith was on the other side. Mr. Stein conducted the mandamus proceedings in the Pulver insurance litigation, it will be remembered, the object of which was to compel Judge Hawes to sign a bill of exceptions. Mr. Stein was successful in this case. He also took part in the famous Lindauer litigation and the prohibition proceedings before Judge Tuley, and in the Pacific Railroad and Union Stockyards litigation. While Mr. Stein has taken an active interest in politics for several years, he has never held office. He is prominent in many Hebrew secret societies. A morning paper announced editorially, recently, the following: Mr. Stein is a lawyer or ripe experience and rare learning. Even a party adversary, the Inter Ocean admits as much, saying that he is a very learned lawyer and a man who has attained distinction at the bar; he laid a foundation for success, in thorough training.</p>
