   <p>On the 29th of May, he succumbed. Mr. Pollak, has been prominently foremost in all our benevolent movements ever since his arrival in Chicago, in 1846. And was enterprising as he was genial, having erected the first brick building on State Street, and although, he lost all in the great fire of 1870, he nevertheless liquidated all his debts in full.</p>
   <p>Joseph Pollak, was also a prominent politician in his day. President Lincoln, appointed him assistant postmaster. In 1872, he was elected clerk of Cook County. Subsequently, he was appointed a Justice of the Peace, which appointment he relinquished some years since. He was active, and indefatigable member of the United Hebrew Relief Association.</p>
