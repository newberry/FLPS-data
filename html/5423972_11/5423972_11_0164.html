   <p>The "Yankee" of Jefferson Street.</p>
   <p>Wisdom, views, thoughts, and perhaps oddities, as told by a Jew who himself speaks half "Yankeeish" and half Jewish and who looks at the world from a semi-Yankee point of view.</p>
   <p>If you believe that the Jews - nation, people, religious sect or whatever you may wish to call them - have varied interests and differ greatly, you are sadly mistaken. They are the same whether you meet them quietly sipping their tea, in a coffee shop, in a restaurant, playing pinochle or manipulating chess characters on a chess board.</p>
   <p>True, Jewish children just as other people's children are divided into many groups and classes. Observe Jewish newspaper writers at their work, observe them again in a debate, and you shall see that the Jewish people are fertile with new ideas and reforms, and their lives are not completely restricted by the Rabbinical "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots." And this same spirit prevails not only among newspaper theorists, but among practically every day people whom you readily meet in restaurants, saloons, and coffee shops.</p>
   <p>Observe, especially, these brothers of ours as they sit at a glass of tea or at a goulash or chess board. Everything seems to be forgotten and a feeling of unity prevails as they sit concentrated at their moment of interest. National distinctions are obliterated. There exists no longer, a "Galitzioner," or a "Litvak," or a Rumanian or Pole. He is no longer the worker, or the boss, the Socialist, the Zionist or the bourgeois.</p>
   <p>We propose to those who wish to abolish classes among Jews to start an energetic, scientific natural, "tea - coffee - goulash - pinochle - chess" movement and their problem shall be solved. We do not mean that movement should carry a six-fold nomenclature such as the one we suggested. They surely could find a better, more fitting, and acceptable name if they tried. The name should be simple and may or may not be scientific.</p>
   
   <p>I would like to tell you of one restaurant which I thought was frightfully bourgeois, but which upon inspection turned out to be a center for radicals. I had started to tell you of the Yankee from Jefferson street who greatly aroused my interest, but I slipped off into the realm of science. I met this very interesting Yankee in a restaurant the name of which I will not divulge but which I shall try to describe adequately hoping perhaps that I will thereby earn a free glass of tea or the like. This restaurant with a thoroughly bourgeois reputation aroused my interest and I decided to see for myself. The bourgeois, are there represented by a lawyer without a practice, by a doctor about to get his degree, and an advertising agent who talks of his business deals but makes none. As a result, neighborliness permeated the atmosphere through out, and the atmosphere of the "Jefferson Street Yankee" effloresces with the spirit of unity.</p>
   <p>The conversations prevailing run high, wide and various. Many are those debating whether or not the Jew should retain Yiddish as his language, this by speakers who speak both a broken Yiddish and a broken English.</p>
   
   <p>It appears that the Jefferson Street Yankee is sort of conciliator between the many views, theories, programs and strivings in Judaism. This Yankee is usually a peddler but believes in working hard. This gives him the opportunity to work lightly, to take easy and to work in a natural manner. It affords an opportunity to express many views on Jewish topics and .....</p>
   <p>However, I feel my readers now have a sufficient inkling of my conversations with this Jefferson Street Yankee.</p>
