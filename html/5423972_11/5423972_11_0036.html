   <p>Mrs. Elise Frank died last Monday at her home, 2522 Michigan Ave., at the age of 81 years. At the time of her death, she was rated as one of the wealthiest widows in Chicago. Mrs. Frank was a sister of Michael Reese, the multi-millionaire Californian, founder of the Michael Reese Hospital and other institutions. Her gifts to charity were large. In 1884 she founded the Society for the Education of Jewish orphans and had since given much money to the support of this institution. Besides this she liberally endowed the Home for Aged Jews as well as aiding other deserving institutions.</p>
