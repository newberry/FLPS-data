   <p>Several weeks ago when it was hourly expected that trouble would be caused by the unemployed workmen of this city, who were crying pitifully for bread, and when no one seemed to heed their pleadings, David Kallis came to their assistance and saved thousands of men, women and children from starvation by providing a plan whereby 6,000 families were fed daily.</p>
   <p>Twenty-four years ago, David Kallis came to this city a poor boy, for twelve years he was a match peddler on the streets of our city. By industry, integrity and strict attention to business, he has made his way in life until he is now one of our most prosperous men.</p>
   <p>Too much cannot be said in the endorsement of such men as Mr. Kallis, and it would afford us greater pleasure, if instead of endorsing him for County Commissioner we were endorsing him for Mayor.</p>
