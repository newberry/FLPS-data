   <p>In company with our friend Mr. Israel Cowen, a rising legal luminary of this city, we attended the dedication of the Beth Hakneseth Israel, new temple, corner Clinton and Judd street, which occurred last Sunday. We had a brief confab with Mr. Leon Zolotkoff who publishes a jargon (Yiddish) newspaper, with Hebrew letters, in our city, on Canal street.</p>
   <p>Our friend quizzed the aforesaid editor about his singular syntax and construction; i.e., being neither German, Hebrew, or Russian. With true Semitic retort, Zolotkoff retorted, "It is the effort of the Germans to spoil our beautiful language." Well! How we did laugh.</p>
