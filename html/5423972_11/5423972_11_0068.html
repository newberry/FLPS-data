   <p>Dr. Bernhard Felsenthal was born on Januray 2, 1822, at Munchweiler, in the Rheinpfalz, Germany.</p>
   <p>In 1854 he came to America and his first charge as a minister was a small Jewish congregation at Madison, Indiana. Three years after his arrival in Chicago, in 1861, he became minister of Sinai congregation. When, in 1864, the Jews of the west Side formed Zion Congregation, Dr. Felsenthal received and accepted a call from them. At first, the congregation comprised but 50 families. It has now increased to 150. Dr. Felsenthal was minister in charge of Zion Congregation from the time it was founded in 1864 until 1887, when he was elected rabbi emeritus and retired from active labor.</p>
   <p>In 1866 at its annual meeting, the University of Chicago conferred on Dr. Felsenthal the title of Doctor of Philosophy. Dr. Felsenthal has published a great number of pamphlets, many of which have met with considerable success.</p>
   
   <p>Among the most important are "Ueber Juedische Reform" (1858), "Kritik des Missionswesens" (1868), a criticism of the Christian endeavors to convert the Jews and "Juedisches Schulwesen in America." He also published a Hebrew Grammar (1868) and Reader. He has been a frequent contributor to several periodicals, and his articles have attracted much attention.</p>
   <p>Not only is he held in the highest esteem by the members of his own congregation but by all the Jews of this city and country.</p>
   <p>The directors of Zion Congregation have issued invitations for the celebration of the 70th birthday of Dr. Felsenthal, to be held at Zion Temple today, January 2nd. Several addresses will be delivered and in the evening there will be a banquet in the vestry of the Temple.</p>
