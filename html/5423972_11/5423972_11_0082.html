   <p>An important convention was inaugurated last Tuesday at Peoria, Illinois, at which nearly six hundred delegates from all states in the Union were represented. We note that Mr. Adolf Loeb, the insurance underwriter, 170 La Salle Street, and Mr. A. Gottlieb, the architect, were delegates from Chicago.....We doubt not that Congress will be successfully urged to provide means for constructing this great high water way. The people and country demand it.</p>
