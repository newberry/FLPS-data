   <p>Rabbi Meyer Shulevitz, sixty seven years old, is one of the most untiring workers the Shelter Home has had in many years. For the last eight years, he has been constantly at work for the holy cause. Day in and day out, you will always find him at his post, always ready and willing to do something for the cause at a moment's notice.</p>
   <p>The Shelter Home is greatly indebted to Rabbi Shulevitz for his tireless efforts on its behalf. You can always find him at all weddings and funerals, and in all places where he can get a few donations for the Shelter. Although he is a man of nearly three scores and ten, he is always on his feet stepping about and looking for ways and means to collect funds for the cause, and the most noble part of this great character is, that he does not accept any compensation whatsoever for his great work; in fact, he often spends his own money when there is a deficiency.</p>
   <p>We hope and pray that our good Lord in heaven will reward him for this work by sparing him for many, many years to come.</p>
