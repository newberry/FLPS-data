   <p>We, the refugees from the Kiev Russia Program, who came to Chicago in these free United States, wish to announce that we are going to organize our Landsleit (Countrymen) of the Chicago community. The best and the most logical way for our Jews to organize is to organize a Synagogue. This was the custom, centuries before, and this is the way we are going to organize now. We are going to organize a Synagogue of Kiev Jews. You are requested to look up and get in touch with as many landsleit as possible and get them to become members of our new Synagogue.</p>
   <p>With this object in view we are calling a mass meeting of all Kiev Jews of Chicago, men and women, for Sunday, October 29th at 7:00 p.m., at Siegel's Hall, 1125 Blue Island ave. Some of the best speakers of the city will address you. Come join us in our holy undertaking.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>The Committee of Kiev Jews.</p>
