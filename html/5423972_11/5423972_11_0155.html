   <p>At the meeting of the Board, it was reported that Professor Albert Einstein contemplates visiting Chicago on the noon of March 14th, en-route from California back to Germany. He is speaking in N. Y. on the evening of the 15th, at a large testimonial dinner, the sponsors of which include a number of very prominent people. The present plan is to have a luncheon with tickets at $25.00 a couple. The proceeds will go as in the case of N. Y. to the Hebrew University of Palestine, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency and a charity to be selected by Mrs. Einstein.</p>
   <p>A number of men in the community have approved the project. A large committee will be obtained for this luncheon, both Jews and non-Jews.</p>
