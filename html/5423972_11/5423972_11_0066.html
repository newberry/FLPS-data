   <p>Rabbi Liebmann Adler was born in 1812 at Staat-Lengefeld, Saxe-Weimar, Germany. He came to America in 1854 and was called to the Beth-E1 Congregation at Detroit. He remained there until 1861 and built up the congregation until it was one of the most influential in the United States in those days.</p>
   <p>From Detroit, he came to Chicago in 1861, in response to a call from Kehilath Anshe Ma'ariv as reader, teacher and preacher. From 1861 to 1883, Rabbi Adler worked zealously and tirelessly for his faith. In the latter year, because of his advanced age, and his long and active services in the interest of Judaism, his congregation retired and pensioned him.</p>
   <p>His interest in the secularized public schools lasted until his death. His zeal in behalf of the maintenance of the Union, manifested itself during the late Civil War in pulpit utterances and by contributions to the columns of the secular and denominational journals.</p>
