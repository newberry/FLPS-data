   <p>The talk about Mr. Henry Greenebaum as Mayor of Chicago is ridiculous. If it were not probably intended merely as a joke, apropos of the conflagration, it would be abominable. It is not necessary to point out the utter impropriety of suggesting any such unfit person as Mr. H. Greenebaum for an office which, in this emergency, demands the highest order of abilities, the most comprehensive understanding, and the most unquestionable purity and integrity.</p>
