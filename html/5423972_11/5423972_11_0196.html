   <p>Some days ago a question was raised who was the first office holder of the Jewish race in Chicago? It was stated to be David Kohn, Esq., who was appointed City Clerk by the Honor John Wenthworth when Mayor of Chicago. It would be interesting to have a brief chapter from the pen of "Long John" on his recollection of the first Jew in Chicago, or some sketches of the activity of the early Jews in our city. If you can prevail upon him to write something, it will no doubt be interesting.</p>
