   <p>There has been founded in Chicago a new society by the name Give Strength To The Weak. The society is what its name implies. A rabbi who is afraid of the president of his synagogue, may become a member. A cantor who is afraid of his rabbi, may become a member. A Kosher food supervisor who is afraid of his butcher, may become a member. The society will give everyone moral support and will fight [like a] lion against all oppressors of the weak members of humanity. The Give-Strength-To-The-Weak Society is a very useful institution. It is needed in Chicago as much as one needs food to sustain life because the number of weak-kneed and scared people here is very large. Would you like to know who is the honorary president and who is the president of this society? This is still a secret. You will learn this secret at the right time.</p>
