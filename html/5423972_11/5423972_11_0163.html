   <p>The Presidents of All Synagogues Are Asked to Make Specific Mention of the Maos Hitim Appeal.</p>
   <p>The United Maos Hitim Committee appeals to all presidents and leaders of all Synagogues in Chicago to make special mention of the Maos Hitim at services tomorrow evening, and to impress them with the necessity of making their Maos Hitim contributions as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Maos Hitim committee will have its next meeting next Tuesday at the Waller Street Talmud Dorah, where all presidents are asked to come and help in the organization of the Maos Hitim Committee.</p>
   <p>Committees of the United Maos Hitim Committee are contacting all city civic leaders without receipt books of the United Maos Hitim Committee, and with that committee's authority to solicit contributions. It is no more than right that people approached for contributions should cooperate to their utmost to this noble cause.</p>
