He came to Chicago when about 14 years old. After the death of his father, the boy took charge of the family. Engaging in the Dry-goods business, he was successful and amassed a considerable fortune. The panic of 1857 left him bankrupt. He compromised with his creditors and in 1865 paid compound interest. Again in 1871 he met with disaster. The great fire of that year swept away his possessions. He then embarked in the cattle business and was successful from the start. After recovering part of his lost fortune, he went to all his former creditors, and, though not legally obligated, he paid them in full, with accrued interest, for every dollar, a fact in which he took great pride.</p>
