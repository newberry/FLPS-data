   <p>Countrymen of Minsker, Gubernia (Province).</p>
   <p>On the 24th day of this month, I leave for Minsker, Gubernia. Therefore, you still have time to see me and to give me your messages for your friends and relatives. Do not neglect this opportunity. Thousands of your fellow countrymen have done so already and now it is your turn. Do not create pain for your wives and families across the sea, for when I give a message to her neighbor, but not to your wife, what excuse can I present to her as to the absence of letter or money? I will have to tell her that it is your own fault. It will not cost you a penny - come and discuss the matter with me.</p>
   <p>I am taking letters and photographs free and I will explain my task to you without any obligation on your part. Bring the address of your relatives and come to see</p>
