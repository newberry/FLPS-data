   <p>A Tribune reporter yesterday morning called upon Mr. Henry Greenebaum at his bank on Fifth Avenue to get from him an explanation of the apparent deficiency shown in the expert's report, made from the books of the West Park Commission, and published in yesterday's Tribune.</p>
   <p>Said the reporter: "I want you Mr. Greenebaum, to give me a brief explanation of the reports published in this morning's Tribune."</p>
   <p>"My dear sir," responded the gentleman, "I am glad you came; but, really, there is nothing to explain, or even worth noticing. However, in justice to myself, I will say that my accounts are correct in every particular."</p>
