   <p>The Board of Aldermen in Chicago at present consists of representatives of all the nationalities, although the majority seem to have combined to form the socalled "Whiskey Ring." As the various aldermen react politically and otherwise so will the nationalities they represent have reason to be proud or ashamed of them.</p>
   <p>The Swedes have as representative Alderman John Killander. Unfortunately, he is not of the type of whom they can feel proud.</p>
   <p>Alderman Killander belongs to the majority which is on terms of enmity with the mayor, that is, he is a member of the "Whiskey Ring." We do not know whether he has whiskey interests privately, but he votes with the "Ring." Relative to this one should note that the' open saloon' element and the hypocritical reform element are nowadays working together, hand in hand, destructively, as far as the Board of Aldermen is concerned. We do not know where Mr. Killander <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is getting his orders; he himself says that he is voting according to his own conscience and best ability. If such be the case, his conscience must be in the habit of going to sleep at precisely the hours when it ought to be fully awake. As to his ability, there is probably little to say, except to sympathize with him for its poor quality, as it is revealed thru his actions during the past few months. But in doing so, one cannot refrain from wondering how he could succeed so well in earlier years both as City Sealer and as Alderman. It was said of him that on a certain occasion he combined with some others of the Board to criticize the Commissioner of Buildings, at that time rather sharply for negligence in office. The complaint then was that Killander was criticizing a Swede. But on that occasion he was right, for the fact of nationality must not interfere with justice, especially not where important matters are concerned. For this reason it is the duty of the Swedes in Chicago to express their dissatisfaction when one of their nationality, in office, is misrepresenting them.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Kuriren does not know what kind of great work Alderman Killander has done in favor of the twenty-third ward. This paper has even held that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>those who have specialized in a matter are the best judges relative to the issue. But the specialists of a ward are the voters of the ward. Now it is clear to common sense and also a matter of experience that the interests of a ward are best served when the representative of the ward is working in close harmony with the Mayor. Neither the individual part of the city nor the city as a whole is gaining through a state of disagreement or of antagonism between aldermen and Mayor.</p>
   <p>John Killander's posing as a "Statesman" has depressed the majority of the Swedes in Chicago, although to many it is a laughing matter. The fact is that William Hale Thompson has long been a favorite with the Swedes here; they voted for him almost unanimously for Mayor, and since his election he has become, if possible, even more popular among them. He has surrounded himself with men of our nationality. Two members of his cabinet are men of Swedish birth, and the number of Swedes appointed to office in the service of the city now is far greater than at any time before.</p>

   <p>The Swedes do not claim to be better than people in general, but they do have a keen sense of justice, and Mayor Thompson's actions in connection with the two big strikes, recently, made a deep impression upon them. His closing of the saloons on Sundays also won favor after the matter had been understood, and his personality, his open and unostentatious manners, which we came to know before the election, have remained unchanged after his election to Mayor, and this we appreciate. We have had many experiences of a different type with earlier Mayors.</p>
   <p>But all of this seems to have passed unnoticed by Alderman Killander. Whether from his own inclination or on orders he has been voting consistently against everything advocated by Mayor Thompson and more still, he has supported with evident enjoyment everything that could embarrass the man whom Chicago recently gave the greatest vote of confidence ever extended to any of its citizens throughout the history of the city. It is an old saying, that if you want to make a friend into an enemy, lend him money. An so mean is human nature that this rule may be <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>applied to other matters of helpfulness. Two years before Mr. Thompson became Mayor, he made personal sacrifices and used his influence to bring about the election of John Killander as alderman. Perhaps the latter was not aware of this little detail concerning the aldermanic election in the year 1914, in ward 23.</p>
