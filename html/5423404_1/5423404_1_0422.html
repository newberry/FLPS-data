   <p>During the months of September, October, and November of this year, seventy-seven corporations in the United States distributed a total of $1,387,309,000 in dividends to stockholders. Here are some of the more notable instances:</p>
   <p>The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, 400 per cent, or $500,000,000; the Standard Oil Company of New York, 200 per cent, or $150,000,000; the Singer Sewing Machine Company, 33-1/3 per cent, or $30,000,000; the Victor Talking Machine Company, 600 per cent, or $30,000,000; the Northern Paper Company, 200 per cent, or $16,000,000; and the Atlantic Refining Company, 900 per cent, or $45,000,000.</p>
   <p>And this, mind you, is going on in a period of depression. Such an orgy <span class="page-break">\2</span>of dividend distributions has never before taken place in this country or in any other part of the world. It demonstrates clearly that the ruthless and well-organized campaign for the reduction of wages which has been conducted during the last two years totally lacks any economic justification.</p>
   <p>The smaller the amount paid out in wages, the bigger the dividends which can be distributed among stockholders. Then, too, higher wages might mean smaller profits for the corporations. It is obvious that high dividends are only possible at the expense of the workers. Significant statements have been made by men high in the councils of the big corporations to the effect that these enormous disbursements will make it difficult to press through any wage increases during the coming year.</p>
