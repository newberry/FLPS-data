   <p>Among the candidates on the Republican ticket in Chicago, there are two men who especially deserve the support of Swedish voters: our well-known countrymen Carl R. Chindblom and Samuel E. Erickson.</p>
   <p>The former has represented the Tenth Congressional District in a manner which reflects honor upon him, and which has steadily strengthened his position in the District. He is now seeking re-election, and we have no doubt that he will be successful.</p>
   <p>Erickson is a candidate for Clerk of the Superior Court of Cook County, and is well qualified for the office. He is known for his ability and dependability, and if one may judge by his decisive victory at the primary, his election next Tuesday is almost a certainty.</p>

   <p>Both of these candidates ask and deserve the support of their countrymen, and we take it for granted that they will get it.</p>
   <p>Voters should study the records of all candidates, and vote accordingly, Party considerations should not be allowed to play an all-important role in the mind of the voter, because in local and state politics the ability and other personal qualities of a candidate are more important than his party affiliations.</p>
