   <p>A New Swedish-American Organization of National Scope with Prominent Countrymen at the Head. Named After John Ericcson.</p>
   <p>p. 1.. A new and extensive alliance of citizens of Swedish birth or descent, has just been organized and given the name "John Ericcson League of Patriotic Service."</p>
   <p>Preparations for the same have been going on for some time past by interested parties in different parts of the country and at a meeting on Monday at University Club, by the sub-committee, form and body was given to the organization and its purpose announced. These are accordingly as follows: To support the National War Program, to act as a society-link for patriotic work among citizens of Swedish <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>descent, to work for National Unity, and for a better understanding and closer co-operation between the United States and Sweden.</p>
   <p>The organization's officers have stressed the point, that it is not in any way their purpose to compete with any similar societies existing;on the contrary they are for co-operation of all like societies towards a common weal, including all religious, charitable, political and social organizations.</p>
   <p>John Ericsson League of Patriotic Service is non-political in its character, but openly supports the Republic's President during the war. The purpose is also to gather hundreds of thousands of people of Swedish descent in America into a large and sympathetic force, which will encourage the people and government of "the old land" to resist every attempt Germany might make against Sweden's suzerainty and possessions.</p>
   <p>Members of the sub-committee are: Harry Olson, Chief Justice of the Municipal Court, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>President; Henry S. Henschen, State Bank of Chicago, Treasurer; Harry A. Lund, Collector of Customs, Minneapolis, Vice-President; Edwin Bjorkman, Author, Washington, Secretary; and Chas. S. Peterson, President of the Swedish Club and Dr. Gustaf Andreen, Rector at Augustana College, Rock Island, Ill.</p>

Bengquist, New York; Andrew Lanquist, Chicago; Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, President Swedish-American Ladies' Club; Eric Norton, St. Paul; Victor Olander, Chicago, and Chas. S. Peterson.</p>
   <p>Headquarters will be in this city, but later special headquarters will be established in New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco.</p>
   <p>The reason why so many persons living here were elected to the executive is this; that it was considered desirable that the majority of this committee could come <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>together without any delay, when exigency so demanded. With headquarters in this city, it was also deemed advisible to invest this committee with authority to transact any business within the sphere of the organization.</p>
   <p>The first general meeting will be held in Minneapolis next Saturday, at which time a campaign for the "War Saving Stamps" will be started amongst the large Swedish population in Minnesota.</p>
