   <p>The dear old Hemlandet awakened from its deep slumber the other day and spied a big streetcar strike, a terrible case of rule by the crowd, and a "government which is unable or unwilling to guard the lives of the citizens." Further, the paper saw a streetcar company "compelled to keep, at its own expense, armed guards, not under the control of the government."</p>
   <p>Noticing these matters, the dear old paper was caught by an urgent impulse to sing the praise of the professional strikebreaker. This is what the paper wrote:</p>
   <p>"Unafraid they are, scornful of danger and death; armed to their teeth, these men, under the leadership of a brave commander, force their way through the ranks of the strikers and the crowd of bums, breaking down the siege by these and guarding the nonunion workers."</p>
   <p>Only the very old or those with a twisted view of conditions will be able to detect any scorning of danger and death in the attitude of those who, armed to the <span class="page-break">2</span>teeth, are placed on a streetcar, surrounded and guarded by police officers, while their opponents are unarmed and peaceful men and women and children who are suffering deprivations on account of the presence of these "heroes". We would feel inclined to call these "heroes" a gathering of robbing sharks who are feasting upon the victims of a vengeful corporation. The "brave commander" is more of a scoundrel than Jesse James, and is surpassed by none in meanness.</p>
   <p>Old Hemlandet saw those "death-scorning" men force their way through the ranks of strikers and bums, breaking down the siege and protecting the nonunion workers--namely, themselves. But the paper was dreaming; the siege existed only in the imagination of the editors.</p>
   <p>Being ultra-Republican, the paper saw the Democratic government in the city unable and unwilling to protect the lives of the citizens. A wide-awake observer saw two thirds of the whole police force of the city placed at the service of the streetcar company; a dozen policemen on every streetcar; about eight hundred police officers patrolling the sidewalks of Wentworth Avenue and Clark Street between Washington and 79th Streets; part of Clark Street closed to traffic simply <span class="page-break">3</span>to let the streetcars pass unimpeded. And the wide-awake observer further saw peaceful pedestrians taken hold of and shoved about and mistreated by the police because they did not move quickly enough with their bags. But old Hemlandet noticed nothing of all this.</p>
   <p>As the old paper rested in its dream, in the border region between sleep and wakefulness, the vision arose before it of the streetcar company being compelled to supply armed guards at its own expense. It was but a vision due to failing eyesight; the men who appeared to the Hemlandet as noble protectors of life and property were merely low, professional strikebreakers, imported from St. Louis and other cities.</p>
   <p>And so the paper went soundly to sleep again, dreaming dreams of the past bravery of the Visigoths, and of their military prowess during the happy days of Gustaf II Adolphus.....And a youth stood outside the chamber of the aged one calling out: "You are complaining, old Hemlandet, but your complaint is stupid."</p>
