   <p>According to a report just received, it has pleased King Gustav V of Sweden to make the noted educator, Dr. David Nyvall, a Knight of the Order of the North Star. Dr. Nyvall will receive the decoration from the hands of the Swedish Consul in Chicago, Carl O. De Dardel, at a banquet which will be given in his honor tomorrow night.</p>
   <p>Among Swedish-Americans few names are so highly esteemed as that of David Nyvall. Every Swedish-American who has taken part in church work or in other cultural activities knows this countryman of ours at least by name, and any account of our people's accomplishments in these fields would be entirely inadequate if Dr. Nyvall's name did not appear prominently therein.</p>
   <p>Dr. Nyvall has done his most important and fruitful work as an educator. In 1888, more than forty years ago, he had already received the position of assistant instructor in the Swedish department of the Chicago Theological Seminary. Later on we find him as a private tutor in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and also as a teacher in the preachers' school of the Swedish Mission League of America in that city. Still later he became associated with North Park College in this city, whereafter he accepted the position of rector of Walden College in McPherson, Kansas.</p>
   <p>During the years 1910-1912 he held the chair of professor of Scandinavian languages at Washington State University, and at the end of that period he accepted the post of rector of North Park College here in Chicago. He is still attached to this institution as rector emeritus.</p>
   <p>Space does not permit any detailed description of Dr. Nyvalls activities as publicist and lecturer. But he is the author of numerous books and articles, and he is still active in this field, in spite of the fact that his health has been failing in recent years. He has been much in demand as a lecturer, and it is through such activities that he has become best known outside church circles. Thus not only as an academic man but also as a hard worker has Dr. Nyvall been so highly honored by his countrymen at home in Sweden.</p>
