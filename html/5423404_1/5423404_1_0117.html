   <p>The interest in the introduction of Swedish as an elective course in our high schools is still alive and active in various parts of the country. It is reported from Spokane, Washington that a committee has been appointed to prepare plans for such an arrangement, and last week a dispatch from Minneapolis, Minnesota told of the remarkable increase in the number of high school students attending classes in Swedish and Norwegian during the current term.</p>
   <p>These two news items are of great interest, first, because they show that the efforts in behalf of this cultural cause are continuing unabated, and, second. Because they indicate that in localities where high school instruction in Swedish has been initiated, the result has been satisfactory. It has been feared in some quarters that as soon as the novelty wore off, the interest in these courses would decline, but the report from Minneapolis is <span class="page-break">2</span>reassuring, and there should be no letup in our efforts to expand this program so that more and more high schools will include Swedish in their curriculums.</p>
   <p>Instruction in the Swedish language in our high schools is of the highest importance to the cultural and educational progress of Swedish-America, and such a program should have the support of every one of our nationals.</p>
