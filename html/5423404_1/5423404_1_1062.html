The name adopted is the Swedish Political Club of North Chicago, and only Swedish citizens of the North Side and Lake View are entitled to membership in it. Some discussion took place over the matter of admitting those who were members of other political clubs, and an amendment to one of the articles was offered, which provided for the exclusion of any Swedes from the club who belonged to Republican, Democratic, Greenback, or any other party organizations, but it was voted down, and any Swedish voter living in the district indicated above was made eligible.</p>
