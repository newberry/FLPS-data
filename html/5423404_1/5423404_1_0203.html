   <p>The delegates to the great temperance convention, which was held a short time ago in Chicago, were much pleased with the progress of their cause. The Anti-Saloon League's propaganda and educational work all over the country has undoubtedly done a lot of good, and its enthusiastic supporters claim that they have hardly started yet.</p>
   <p>In certain quarters the hope seems to be entertained that this strong movement directed against the saloon evil, is only a temporary phenomenon, but we suspect that they are mistaken. It may rather be the beginning of a powerful popular movement, which will not be stopped in its course until general prohibition is on the statute books of the United States. The sentiment within our great religious organizations, as <span class="page-break">2</span>well as within orders and societies of various types, points in that general direction. Also, representatives of a new generation are coming of voting age, a generation which in the schoolroom has received instructions in regard to the destructive effect of liquor on the human body and mind. The importance of this kind of educational work is not sufficiently appreciated.</p>
   <p>The progress of the temperance movement in the United States is being watched with keen interest in Sweden, where the recent great strike gave rise to a strong sentiment for general prohibition. Its opponents have publicized many stories, both humorous and sad, illustrating the complete fiasco of this system in America, but most of such stories are, naturally gross exaggerations if not downright lies. It is being pointed out in Sweden that there is serious disagreement between our federal government and the individual states regarding the manner in which the liquor problem should be handled, and it must be admitted that such disagreement does <span class="page-break">3</span>exist and is an obstacle to a happy solution.</p>
   <p>However, there are many illustrations of the beneficial results of strict liquor control. Let us consider the state of Kansas. J. K. Codding, warden of the state penitentiary, declares that thanks to the prohibition law, which, by the way, is rather drastic and strictly enforced, forty-nine counties did not send one single prisoner to the institution last year, while thirteen counties sent only one each. The use of alcoholic beverages is unpopular in that state, and to have liquor in one's possession is a criminal offense. Those that drink are as a rule elderly people who acquired the habit in their youth. No young man or woman with self-respect and ambition uses liquor, and even business interests in the cities refuse to tolerate the existence of saloons. Such establishments as are caught operating illegally are promptly closed, and evasions of the law will gradually disappear.</p>
