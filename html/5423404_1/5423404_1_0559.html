   <p>For some time a housemaids' union has existed in Chicago, and quite a few have joined it, but we are informed from reliable sources that our Swedish sisters remain aloof and show no inclination to become members of the organization. This is particularly remarkable since Swedish girls are generally known to be bright and alert. The cause or causes of this attitude are not quite clear, but we understand that many of the girls just avoid the issue by saying that they are planning to take a trip to the old country, and wish to put off the organization question until they return.</p>
   <p>Without any special reference to Swedish girls it is also being rumored that many maids do not like to have it known that they are employed as maids, and do not want to be seen near a maids' union hall. Do they believe that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>working for a family is any less honorable than, for instance, working in a factory? Or is it, perhaps, more respectable to work in a store for starvation wages?</p>
   <p>No, the housemaid's job is at least as honorable as that of her mistress, if the latter can be said to do any useful work at all. We will admit that in a household consisting of two persons who employ from six to ten servant girls, the servants' work is rather unproductive, but that is not the fault of the girls. The Swedish servant girls in this country have done just as much as the rest of their countrymen to make the Swedish name respected and well liked here, and they certainly have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
   <p>With reference to the establishment of this union, it is pointed out that the employers, the housewives, already have their organization, and meet to discuss how to get as much work as possible out of the girls for the smallest possible pay. At this stage the maids' organization is not so much concerned <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with the setting of definite wage scales as with improving present unsatisfactory working conditions.</p>
   <p>Among the immediate aims of this union we note the effort to limit the working day to ten hours and the demand for some time off during the evening. As it is, the girls are on the job from eight o'clock in the morning until late at night. There are mistresses who make their maids sit up until after midnight in order to empty the ash trays and tidy up the rooms when the guests have departed.</p>
   <p>A strong union with the rank and file behind it could undoubtedly do much to eliminate such abuses, and make the housemaid's work more pleasant. In the long run, not only the girls, but their employers as well, would benefit from it.</p>
