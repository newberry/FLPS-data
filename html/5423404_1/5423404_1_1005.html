   <p>The Swedish-American Republican Club here in Chicago, has made arrangements for the naturalization of all countrymen who wish to become American citizens and are thereto entitled. They are invited to be present Friday, Oct. 10 at 7:30 P.M. at the City Hall. Judge Chytraus will preside. Immigrants can receive their first papers without witnesses right after their arrival to America, but two years must elapse between the receipt of the first paper and that of the citizenship certificate (the second paper). It is also required that an applicant for full citizenship must have been a resident in the United States for five years which two witnesses must confirm. People, who have arrived here before the age of eighteen can take out citizenship certificates, but must be able to present a witness who can testify that the applicant has been a resident here in United States for five years.</p>
