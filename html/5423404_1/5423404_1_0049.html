   <p>Last June, Harriet Ostrom a teacher in the Chicago public schools, was suspended, on the charge of having "revealed sex secrets" to pupils in the sixth grade. A few days ago she was ordered before the committee which is to decide whether or not she is fit to teach children in the future. It is indeed regrettable that our schools are so much behind the times in this respect. Ignorance seems to be at a premium, and ignorance also seems to decide what is to be said and what is not to be said. By right, the parents should instruct their children in social hygiene questions, but it is interesting to note that the mother who submitted the complaint about Miss Ostrom can neither read nor write, and is thus hardly qualified to give instruction in any subject. And do parents, as a whole, do their duty by their children in this respect? Most of them do not, and, instead, the youngsters go out among their playmates and pick up bits of misleading information, which, in addition to being wrong, is also <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>destructive. Thanks to the secrecy surrounding the subject, they take an exaggerated interest in everything they hear pertaining to it, and because of the lack of systematic and proper instruction their conceptions are apt to become fallacious.</p>
   <p>Children are considered mature enough to be taught patriotism as soon as they enter kindergarten, and during the last war they were even instructed in hate. If grade school pupils are capable of grasping the intricacies of world diplomacy, one should not be afraid of giving them an insight into elementary hygiene.</p>
   <p>Hypocrisy does express itself in many strange ways.</p>
