   <p>A couple of weeks ago the City Council decided that the people should decide if the cities wise fathers should handle the city railway question or if a general vote should be taken regarding its difficulties. If the question was to be left to the people it was stipulated that petitions with at least 80,000 voters should require it, and that the people should sign these petitions by February 1. However, the aldermen believed it impossible in such a short time to get the petitions ready and get the people's signature so they tried to let the matter drop. The daily newspapers were not of the same opinion as the majority of the aldermen, this was clearly demonstrated by their actions. The morning, noon and evening papers showed their disagreement by attaching petitions to their edition. It might seem ridiculous, but the papers were vindicated. On Thursday the lists were turned in to proper department heads with 184,000 signatures instead of 80,000.</p>
