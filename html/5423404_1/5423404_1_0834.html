   <p>It happened the other day that Editor E. W. of the Swedish Tribune came to realize that he had jumped into the wrong barrel when he undertook to refute certain views concerning the labor question, which this paper had presented. He did not feel inclined, however, to acknowledge his mistake. Instead, realizing the hopeless attitude he has taken, he has caught hold of a foul weapon - the lie - and with this weapon he attacks us to his own great satisfaction.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In the two column article in the Tribune we look in vain for a single argument which in any way refutes the opinions expressed by us; nor do we find in the article mentioned the least proof of our terrible ignorance or of the great wisdom reposing in the present day social order.</p>
   <p>The ability of Editor E. W. to add his own conclusions to phrases or parts of paragraphs which he has pulled away from their connection, then attributing the whole to his opponent, is well-known. Therefore, it will only be necessary to give a few proofs of this practice of his and leave the thinking reader to draw his own conclusions as to the polemics of Editor E. W.</p>
   <p>First, the author of the article states that we, in the proclaimed axiom <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that the workers produce the wheat but eat the chaff, explain that this can merely be taken figuratively - since in no way does it fit the situation of the farmer.</p>
   <p>We reprint the statement here murdered by Editor E. W.:</p>
   <p>"On the whole we except no branch within the great army of labor since we know very well that if one part of that great body is suffering, the whole suffers. But even though there might have been reasons for excepting the farmer, yet, he too, is eating the chaff, figuratively speaking, while stock market manipulators such as Joe Leiter, Philip Armour, and others are swallowing the wheat."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>A further proof of the way in which Mr. E. W. is jockeying with the truth: He accuses us of having said, "Machines make men's work far harder."</p>
   <p>We said:</p>
   <p>"The worker's lot is soul-killing drudgery, and his brains do not get the exercise provided by the work of former days."</p>
   <p>From this Mr. E. W. draws the sublime conclusion that we desire a return to the conditions of patriarchal times.</p>
   <p>Next he informs us that he "tried to pull the editor of the Svenska Nyheter <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>away from the current error that the concept of worker is limited to such as mainly are occupied with muscular labor." He proves "that Svenska Nyheter accepts this unreasonable and illogical concept, making it the foundation for the paper's program and tendency" by our "loudly proclaiming it in the column The Sons of Muscular Labor!"</p>
   <p>Mr. E. W. is probably the only Swedish-American editor to perform that kind of topsy-turvy syllogism; all the others would surely reason somewhat as follows: A paper writing of "The Sons of Muscular Labor," in doing so acknowledges the fact that there are other "sons of labor," or there would have been no reason to use the "muscle" to distinguish them from the others. To console the writer of the article we now inform him that in this <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>world there are also the sons of thought labor. Among the latter we include people who think before they speak in public or write for the public.</p>
   <p>Next Mr. E. W. reproached us for using examples to prove a case, and with reference to the labor - saving linotype machine he says, "but it will not do to overthrow, by individual examples, the incontrovertible fact: The more machines, the more workers."</p>
   <p>Yet in the same breath he forgets his exhortation, using the bicycle as proof of his assertions.</p>
   <p>In conclusion to his remarkable article the author says: "It is as clear <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>as day that the labor movement has entered a wrong track or, to use another expression, has fallen among robbers. The movement which ought to take in the whole world and include practically all of humanity has become limited to include only a few trades, narrowed down to one line of thought, that of the political dreamers. In other words, the movement has been adulterated. It is required that the workers not only act in unison, but also think in unison. All labor agitation is aiming at this goal, first hogtie the freedom of action, afterwards hogtie the freedom of thought."</p>
   <p>We leave this to the reflection of our readers.</p>
