   <p>The public schools are of the utmost importance to America, morally as well as culturally, and even seemingly unimportant improvements may be of considerable significance. From now on the pupils in all public schools of the State of Illinois will receive instruction in humane treatment of all animals, a course which should be of great value to the children and, if one may say so, to certain animals.</p>
   <p>Only one-half hour a week will be devoted to this subject, which is not much when one considers the amount of time spent on educational fads and experiments of doubtful merit, but that this subject was introduced at all is encouraging. There are many things the child should learn in school besides reading and writing. Most young children are somewhat thoughtless, and often find pleasure in annoying and even torturing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>small animals. The little boy who enjoys sticking pins through flies and other insects is likely to become a killer of animals for the fun of it in later years, whereas the boy and girl who, early in life, have had implanted in them kindness and consideration toward helpless creatures have learned something that is bound to make them better human beings. And in the final analysis, is not that the purpose of their training?</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that the boy who is in the habit of torturing dogs and cats is likely, later in life, to torture his horse and even to become a wife-beater. Therefore we heartily approve of this new course in our public schools.</p>
