   <p>Some Chicago newspapers, as well as churches, clubs, and other organizations, have at last started relief work among the thousands of unemployed throughout the city. The situation is serious, and aid is sorely needed; any form of help is received with gratitude by these agencies.</p>
   <p>Our Norwegian cousins have already set up an organization for the purpose of helping their needy countrymen, and it is high time that we Swedes offer a helping hand to ours.</p>
   <p>It is certain that Chicago's Swedish population has been hard hit by the depression and subsequent unemployment, prohably harder than most national groups, for thousands of them are dependent on the building industry, which, as our readers well know, has come practically to a standstill here during the last year. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>thousands of Swedes who have been working in the building trades have therefore been idle for a year or more. The savings of most of them are, of course, already exhausted, which shouldn't surprise anyone. Few workers are earning enough to enable them to build up sufficient reserves to take care of their families for a long period of time. For those who have large families the situation is actually desperate. But the building workers are not by any means the only ones that are facing destitution. Many others, who earned less money by the opportunities offered by this city, are now walking the streets hunting a job, any kind of a job, and they are hungry and cold, without a roof over their heads.</p>
   <p>We Swedes spring from an enlightened but small nation and we have always felt--and we hope will continue to feel--the necessity of standing together. We are glad to see countrymen get ahead, for aside from a touch of envy, perhaps, we take pride in everything which reflects honor on the Swedish name. But when he is down, the Swede avoids his countrymen, for he is ashamed of appearing a <span class="page-break">\3</span>failure. One sees few Swedes begging on the streets, surprisingly few in view of the many who are in dire need, and need knows no law.</p>
   <p>Those of us who are fortunate enough to have a job, and particularly those of us who have been able to accummulate a reserve of money, are now presented with an opportunity to show that we are "chips off the old block" and ready to go to the aid of needy fellow Swedes, as our forefathers always did. The old saying, "a friend in need is a friend indeed," is as true today as it ever was, and there are so few of us Swedes that we should all act as friends and brothers toward one another. And right now many of our brothers need help.</p>
   <p>An investigation conducted by members of Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's staff reveals that the situation among our countrymen here is really much worse than it appears to be to a casual observer. The need is so great that all Chicago Swedes who are well off, by comparison, must get together and render assistance as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>In order to bring about such action we have turned to leading Swedes here, and <span class="page-break">\4</span>asked them to use their prestige and influence in setting up an effective relief organization without delay. All of them agree that immediate help must be given, and have promised their hearty support.</p>
   <p>Herbert Hedman, chief of the Hedman Manufacturing Company, has gone further, and is taking the matter up in the Swedish Club and other organizations to which he belongs. We understand that members of the Swedish Club reacted favorably to his appeal, which will also be extended to the many Swedish societies, lodges, and churches in the city. On Hedman's initiative a meeting has been called at the Hamilton Club, where representatives of all Swedish organizations in the city will get together, and where it is expected that definite plans will be formulated.</p>
   <p>As our readers will know, there are in Chicago many Swedish organizations which quietly do much charitable work among countrymen, but the present emergency is so great that, with the best of will, they could not render more than a fraction of the help which is needed. United action by all Swedes in Chicago is required <span class="page-break">\5</span>if it is to be said of us in the future, as it has been said in the past, that we always take care of our own. We are grateful to Herbert Hedman for his initiative in calling the meeting in the Hamilton Club and hope that the appeal to which he will there give voice will strike a responsive cord in every Swedish-American heart.</p>
