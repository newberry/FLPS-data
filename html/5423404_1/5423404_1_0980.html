   <p>The Eighth Ward Swedish-American Club in South Chicago was formed for the purpose of unifying all political activities among our countrymen in that part of town. Its aims are broad and liberal enough to attract every Swede to whom Swedish ancestry and traditions still mean something. The members consider that the city's Swedish population has not received the political recognition to which it is entitled, and that only through a strong organization will it be possible to get Swedes elected to the more important offices.</p>
   <p>Statistics show that Swedes have contributed much to the development of the Eighth Ward, both as home builders and otherwise, and it is only fair that they should have something to say in the conduct of its public affairs.</p>
   <p>The Club's officers are: Dr. Engelbrecht Nelson, president; C. Greenwald, vice-president; B. Iverson, secretary; and Andrew Ringman, treasurer.</p>
