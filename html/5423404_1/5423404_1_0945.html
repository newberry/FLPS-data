   <p>A New Swedish-American Political Club was organized the other day at a meeting held at the Swedish Club.</p>
   <p>The invitations to attend organization meeting were sent our by County Architect Eric E. Hall, and among other well-known Chicago men, who are taking the initiative toward founding this new political club, are C. Hjalmar Lundquist, Nels H. Olson, Eric F. Grunding, Fritz Shoultz and John A. Sandegren.</p>
