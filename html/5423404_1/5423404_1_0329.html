   <p>The Swedish-American press has probably at no time shown greater evidence of belonging together than has been shown in connection with the conflict between Sweden and Norway. All the representatives of this press have made clear their opinion that it is better for both countries that the separation be accomplished, and that Sweden has nothing to lose by it. But with equal unanimity have the Swedish-American papers contended that the methods employed in bringing about the so-called dissolution of the union were neither noble nor, strictly speaking, honorable. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Svenska Nyheter has been playing on the same string, and, in spite of a protest or two, we still believe that we are right.</p>
   <p>In the number for July 18, we published a protest by a certain Olaf F. Andreasson of North Carolina, and to this we added a few comments. Now an additional protest has come to us from the same person, and will be found on page seven of the present issue of this paper. We have not found it necessary to correct the manuscript, but have printed the letter as written.</p>
   <p>The writer declares that he was born in Sweden, but his language betrays him, showing clearly that even if he were born in Sweden, he has "obtained <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>his schooling" in Norway.</p>
   <p>We do not intend to take up Mr. Andreasson's long letter point by-point, especially since but few of his statements are deserving of answer, but we do not want to pass on his letter in absolute silence.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning of his letter, Mr. Andreasson states that the "trouble started when the king refused to sanction a law adopted by the Norwegian parliament", and then he speaks about the will of the king and the will of the people. But, after all, according to the Norwegian constitution, the king was within his rights in refusing to sanction the law. According to the Norwegian constitution, three successive parliaments, separated by elections, must adopt the same law before such law <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>becomes effective over the veto of the king.</p>
   <p>What Mr. Andreasson says about Norwegianism from the point of view of the Swedes (or perhaps he means our point of view) is simply an attempt at re-shuffling the cards. The question at issue is the politics of the Norwegian cabinet and the Norwegian parliament as against Sweden, and nothing else. Once before, we declared that we hate neither the Norwegians, nor others who are fighting for that which they consider their rights, but we do not like those who break the law, and the Norwegian parliament has trampled its own laws under foot, and has insulted the Norwegian King.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andreasson goes on: "Anybody can understand that the breaking up <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of the union was not pleasant for King Oscar. But it is a great exaggeration to paint the act as a 'knifing the king in his back.' It is also clear that the wound was not as 'fatal' as the king believed at first. As we know, he has already forgiven the Norwegians."</p>
   <p>The fact that the king has forgiven the Norwegians is, of course, simply evidence of the noble heart of the noble leader of the brother nations. And is he now to be disdained for this? Do not imagine that the wound is healed. Oftenest it is so that the persons whose hearts are most prone to feel the hurts are also the ones who most readily forgive. Honor him for forgiving his enemies, but do not blame him.</p>
   <p>"It was the king against a whole nation," avers Mr. Andreasson. Would it <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>not be nearer the truth to say "the whole nation (or, let us say, the government) opposed the king, " who clearly stood alone in an effort to maintain the constitution of Norway.</p>
   <p>Let this be the reply to Mr. Andreasson's protest.</p>
