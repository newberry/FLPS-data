   <p>Those Scandinavians who belong to the opposition held a mass meeting yesterday.</p>
   <p>The assembly was called to order by Fritz Frantzen. The following persons were elected:</p>
   <p>President: A. B.Johnson, Vice Presidents: Geo. J. Hoffman, Capt. Ed. G. Lange, John Wickers; Secretary: John <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Arrvedson.</p>
   <p>We appointed on the committee of resolutions: Jacob Nielsen, Wm. Peterson, Capt. Bergquist.</p>
   <p>After General Lies had finished his speech, the committee on resolutions gave out the following report:</p>
   <p>As the present corrupt condition of our national politics requires the undivided attention of each good citizen, and as the Republican Party no longer defends the principles upon which it was founded, but has opened its doors to corruption, like other parties too long in power, and as the leaders of this party are unable to govern and have proven themselves unworthy of the confidence of the people, and since, to our way of thinking, a complete change of our national policy is imperative, as we are convinced, that the Scandinavian press does not express the views of the majority of the Scandinavian people: Be it resolved that the American citizens of Scandinavian descent approve completely the platform accepted by the opposition party on September 26:</p>
   <p>And be it further resolved that we oblige ourselves to work for the success of the opposition party at the next elections.</p>
   <p>After some further discussions the meeting was adjourned.</p>
