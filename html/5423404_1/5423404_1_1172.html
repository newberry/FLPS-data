   <p>We of the Chicago Swedish Colony, are justly proud of Peter B. Olson, County Clerk of Cook County.</p>
   <p>The County Auditor, Edwin R. Baker, has just finished the audit of Peter B. Olson's books and advises that his records are perfect. Mr. Baker says that this office is as efficient as perfection itself, and is run so honestly that a penny will never be lost.</p>
