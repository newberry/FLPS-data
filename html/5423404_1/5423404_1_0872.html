   <p>Regarding the anarchists in America, in which land they have lived too long, the following is from 1880:</p>
   <p>"The United States is dulled by the delusion that the anarchistic movement is directed by the European immigrants against, European old regimes. It is further reasoned that dogs that bark the most, bite the least, but anyone can now see that this theory is false. Anarchism is a weed that if nourished and protected, does nothing but cause trouble and discontent.</p>
   <p>Therefore, one will usually find that where anarchy is rampant, it has followed in the footsteps of socialism, and that under certain conditions, it lives on because of the liberal tendencies of the Government.</p>
   <p>Anarchism in America, in the main, is given sustenance by immigrating Germans, Poles, Bohemians, and Italians; while the English-speaking people, who have in general said good-bye to socialism, do not profess, nor do they recruit anarchy in their midst."</p>
