   <p>A Swedish Cemetery Association has been founded by several well-known countrymen living on the South Side. It was incorporated last December with a capital of $100,000 divided into shares of $10 each. The association has bought 120 acres at 119th St and Kedzie Av. to be used as a new grave yard which will be known as "Mt. Auburn Cemetery." The officers are E. P. Strandberg, chairman; N. P. Severin, vice-chairman; N. A. Nelson, secretary; John F. Dale, treasurer; and O. C. Petterson, attorney.</p>
