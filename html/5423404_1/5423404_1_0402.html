   <p>The Republican party suffered defeat in the November elections, and the result may be said to mark a victory for the common people in their struggle against the power trust. The candidates who were most feared and disliked by the trust, and which it opposed during the campaign, were victorious, and in regard to their attitude toward the trust they may all be counted as true representatives of the people's interests.</p>
   <p>Among the senators who were re-elected are Norris of Nebraska, Couzens of Michigan, and Walsh of Montana, all three of whom are known as opponents of the power trust. So is Governor Roosevelt of New York, who was re-elected and Governors Pinchot of Pennsylvania, Cross of Connecticut, La Follette of Wisconsin, Olson of Minnesota, and Meier of Oregon, all of whom were elected governor for the first time. Senator Walsh and Governor Roosevelt are Democrats, while the others are Republicans, but belong to the progressive faction of the party.</p>
   <p>It is of special interest to recall the pamphlet published by Governor Pinchot some time ago, in which he dealt with the electric power trust and its affiliated companies throughout the United States. in it he outlined the development of the increasingly centralized control in this field, and showed that no less than eighty-two per cent of the electrical power output in this country is controlled by forty-one corporations, and that thirty-five of these corporations in turn are under the control of six immense so-called holding companies. Pinchot criticized sharply the policies and methods of the trust and pointed out the necessity of placing it under strict government supervision.</p>
