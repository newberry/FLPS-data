   <p>The superintendent of a children's home in Defiance County, Ohio, a Mr. Wagner, reports that the number of children admitted to all such institutions in the State has decreased by fifteen per cent "since old John Barleycorn was put out of commission". This situation becomes especially significant in view of the fact that we are now experiencing a period of great unemployment, when one would expect an increase of applications for admission to all types of charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>There is no reason to doubt the truth of Mr. Magner's statement. He supervises one of the largest children's homes in Ohio, and is well acquainted with conditions within the State. One is therefore justified in concluding that there is less poverty and destitution in the home today than there was before the enactment of Prohibition, and that, on the whole, mothers and children are happier.</p>
