   <p>At 2443-2447 West Kinzie Street we find an establishment turning out one of the world's best beverages, Lundin's En-Bars Dricka (Lundin's Juniper ale). Letters from five of the most prominent Swedish pastors, who recommend the use of this excellent ale and wonderful non-intoxicating substitute for liquors give wonderfully authentic advice for the welfare of the individual from infancy to old age.</p>
   <p>We quote the letter from Pastor C. A. Bjork, principal of North Park College of Chicago and president of the Evangelical Mission of America: "All who have their own welfare and that of their fellow men [in mind] should welcome Lundin's Juniper ale in their home because it is the world's best aid in eliminating intoxicants."</p>
