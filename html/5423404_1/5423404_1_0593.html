   <p>It is not to be denied that it sounds quite reasonable when a person expresses his anger at the situation, more and more prevalent now that crowds of workers are compelled to loaf because they are prevented by their comrades from working in spite of their willingness to work.</p>
   <p>The anger at being thus compelled to loaf appears very reasonable. At the first glance, this we admit. But does not this question also need consideration from other points of view? Is it not possible that in expressing our anger at the loafing imposed upon us, we are looking at things from a point of view <span class="page-break">2</span>which has long ago become obsolete?</p>
   <p>All of us agree that everybody ought to work, and that "he who does not work ought not to eat," and equally clear it is that nobody has the right to live from the toil of others, if he be able to work. The logic of this is that working is as necessary for the maintenance of life as eating. Consequently, to prevent a man from working is an attack upon one of man's most sacred rights. It means, quite simply, the beginning of an act of murder.</p>
   <p>But it is clear that the work in question must not be of a type to hurt the rights of others. Were this rule taken away, then the work of the thief, in stealing, would also be justified.</p>
   <p>But does not a worker hurt the rights of others if, in case of a strike or <span class="page-break">3</span>a lockout, he interferes with the workers who are striking, or who have been locked out? We must remember that most strikes and lockouts have been caused by the workers insistence upon the most primitive of all, the right to exist.</p>
   <p>Most people will admit that if the strike be just, or a lockout unjust, then the fight of the workers should not be interfered with. But who is to decide on this question of justice? Who is to determine which party to a labor struggle be on the side of justice? To some newspapers, and to a certain type of people, the employer is invariably right; to a certain other type, the worker.</p>
   <p>For this reason, a legally established arbitration board is necessary; for <span class="page-break">4</span>there are more people who are abnormal where the question arises of distinguishing between right and wrong than about which the deepest philosophy ever dreamed.</p>
   <p>In order to gain perspective, let us transfer the question to some other field. Let it be assumed that military officers, judges, etc., did not have their tenure of office, and their salaries determined by law, but could be discharged any time. Let it be assumed also, that there were plenty of aspirants willing to assume the offices in question at practically any salary offered. Now, if a conflict should arise in regard to salary in these fields, would our conservative newspapers then raise a clamor if the men established in office should try to prevent the new aspirants from taking the places of those fighting for salary increase?</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The onward march of a social class to independence and sustenance may demand heavy sacrifices, and frequently, in regard to this it happens, as in other departments of life, that "to the just events do happen as had he done the deeds of the unjust." But every undertaking of cooperation which has for its goal the raising of the standard of living, of morals, and of the worth of man ought to be encouraged, not discouraged. And this because it ever was, and ever will be the only way to more just social conditions.</p>
   <p>But how unreasonable, it will be objected. The demands of the workers often are.</p>
   <p>As to this, we admit freely that often the workers place their demands too <span class="page-break">6</span>high. But where is the class to be found which does not try to gain as much as possible. Are we to expect a higher degree of modesty in demands from the workers than from other social classes?</p>
   <p>It also needs to be remembered that there is a nemesis in the march of the ages. The workers have claim to payment for the injustice perpetrated against the laboring class by our whole civilization. The farmers have claimed, and are still further claiming the debt which society has been owing them for ages. After the farmers come the laborers. It is to be hoped that those in power may have the wisdom to regulate through equitable laws the relations between employer and employe. Laws to meet exceptional cases, laws to regulate strikes will not correct the unjust conditions. On the contrary, they may accentuate the feeling of injustice. Only through mutual understanding can the evils be corrected.</p>
