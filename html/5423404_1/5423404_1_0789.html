   <p>Complaints that in the large cities, particularly New York and Chicago, we find large numbers of unemployed, in New York over 100,000 men and in Chicago at least 25,000. These figures seem unnecessarily high but if it was only half or one fourth as many it would be too many. Best of all would be if each one who wanted work could get it. The why of the large number of unemployed cannot clearly be explained.</p>
   <p>The large cities are the stopping place of the unemployed during good times as well as during the bad, but in bad times more come to the large cities, in fact the number has doubled, in hope of better chances then in the smaller centers. That the workers who are unemployed should become more numerous when they gather at a particular place is only natural. Of the unemployed here in Chicago it is a question as to whether one fourth are Chicago's workers.</p>
   <p>To persons in small cities who for the time being find themselves out of employment, our advice would be not to go to New York or Chicago seeking work. As soon as the factories start up the old employes have always been given the first call and strangers had to wait till last. To maintain themselves in the large cities cost just as much as in the smaller one. A word to the wise is enough.</p>
