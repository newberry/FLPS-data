   <p>It is a fact long known that chauvinists in one country hate chauvinists in another country. The border line between the countries constitute for them a total turn over of right and wrong, good and evil. These concepts, as applied on his own side of the border, mean to the chauvinist the exact opposite when applied on the other side. Note, for example, how our Swedish chauvinist papers have been crying over the strong pressure exerted in Norway against otherwise-thinking people during the summer of conflicts just closed. Especially during the time of the referendum, the chauvinist press in Sweden was fairly flooded with reports of offenses against freedom of thought in Norway. Most people read such reports with a quiet feeling of thankfulness that Swedes do not offend in this manner, and so they become convinced that the Norwegians are a particularly bad set of people. Even people who can hardly be considered as chauvinists, now and then cherish this opinion. We read a letter from a Swedish woman, highly educated and gifted, who expresses her satisfaction at not having to live in such a country as Norway, "where the rabble stone the windows of those suspected of having an opinion opposite to those of those who for the time being are in control." "In Sweden," she says, "people like to have a person speak his opinion, if only they get used to it." This latter statement indicates that she is not a chauvinist. For such a one will consider suppression of opinion something entirely different if exerted in Sweden-by those on the side of correct national thinking of course-than when similarly exerted in Norway.</p>
   <p>In Norway, such persecution of otherwise-thinking people is mean, acts to be condemned; in Sweden it is an excellent deed and is to be highly commended. For there is, as we well know persecution for opinion's sake, in Sweden as well as in Norway. It is not easy to say in which of the two countries conditions are worse in this respect. Perhaps there is slightly less intolerance in Sweden-at least there ought to be, since Sweden has been independent for a longer period than Norway. But a difference in sympathy for those who"speak out their opinion," from those who happen to be in power, do we never remember having observed.</p>
