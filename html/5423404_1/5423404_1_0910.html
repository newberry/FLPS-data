   <p>This year an unusually large number of our countrymen are candidates for public offices, which is a sure sign that Swedish-American influence in politics is on the increase. Among the reasons for this state of affairs is the fact that we are now co-operating more closely than we formerly did and that the inherent competence of our group is becoming more generally recognized.</p>
   <p>We would never take it upon ourselves to tell our countrymen how to vote, though some other publications are regularly in the habit of doing so. It is not for us to try to infringe upon their political or spiritual freedom of action, but we do feel that we can be true to this principle and at the same time endorse Swedish candidates regardless of their political affiliations. We have noted with satisfaction that a number of colleagues who are ordinarily <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>strongly partisan in politics are, to some extent, following our example in this respect.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of the present political campaign we want to remind our readers that Swedish-American candidates for policial offices of varying degrees of importance need the support of their countrymen, both during the campaign and at the polls. And they are entitled to it, not because of their nationality but because they are capable of rendering fine public service in the offices which they are seeking. It has been demonstrated that when a Swedish-American obtains the nomination he is will qualified for the job, and a general and vigorous support by his national group will, in most instances, outweigh the opposition which he quite often encounters among other nationalities. Nationality does count a lot in politics, and the old adage about blood being thicker than water still stands; it also holds good among Swedes. Swedish-American unity at the polls will make for greater influence in national affairs, and enable the group to make a more telling contribution to the happy development of our society.</p>

   <p>But it is necessary that we forget party quarrels for we cannot afford to be divided. If we are going to wait for other nationalities to elect Swedish-Americans to public offices we will wait a long time. We should support an able countryman, even though we may disagree with him on certain political matters.</p>
