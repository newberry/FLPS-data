   <p>Most doctors agree that it is easier and more desirable to prevent a disease than to cure it. But the nation does not been able to apply this rule to its economic ills. The coal miners' strike, for instance, was expected long before it was actually declared. Any strike the effects of which are felt in every factory and in every home is an industrial illness. But even though it was known with a fair degree of certainty that the coal miners' strike was about to occur, no attempt was made to prevent it.</p>
   <p>Nowadays, it is not considered good practice to let diseases cure themselves. But this maxim does not been to apply to strikes; and if a strike should get out of hand and if the situation should become critical, the Government is expected to step in.</p>
   <p>It seems clear, then, that if the government has the power to cure, it should also be able to do something in the way of prevention. As long as strikes are the only effective weapon strikers have in their struggle against capital, it should be reasonably easy to predict where and when a strike is about to break out; and unbiased authorities should be able to do much to prevent the strike. But when one observes how the Railroad Commission is right today almost causing a strike to break out, one realizes that our authorities are far behind our doctors, and have not yet adopted the principle of prevention.</p>
