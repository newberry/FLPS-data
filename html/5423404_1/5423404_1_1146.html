   <p>An election of great importance to everybody in Cook County will take place next June 7. On that date fourteen judges of the Circuit Court are to be elected for a term of six years. There are altogether forty-two candidates, of which fourteen are Republicans, fourteen Democrats and fourteen Socialists, and it is our task to pick those that are most competent, honest and otherwise desirable.</p>
   <p>Among the forty-two candidates there is only one Swedish-American, namely, Attorney Edwin A. Olson, and he is on the Republican ticket. He won the nomination with a large majority, and it is now up to us to see that he is elected. There are many reasons why we Swedish-Americans should vote for Mr. Olson, and no reason whatsoever why we should not. He is an able jurist and will add to the prestige of the court.</p>

   <p>His career has been one of accomplishment. Born in Cambridge, Illinois, in 1868, he attended high school in his home town, and then the Elliot Business College of Burlington, Iowa. In 1890 he came to Chicago penniless but determined to make a place for himself. Fighting against odds he managed to study law, was admitted to the bar and has with increasing success, practiced his profession here in this city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson is an attorney for the Scandia Life Insurance Company, the largest of all other Swedish-American business organizations, and for the Swedish Baptist Mutual Aid Association of America, Svea Building and Loan Association, Chicago Cemetery Association, and for several other large corporations. In addition, he has a considerable general law practice.</p>
   <p>He has been very active in welfare work among our countrymen, particularly as a member of the Board of Directors of the Englewood Hospital and as vice president of the Swedish Old People's Home Society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>He also presided over the committee which recently, during one week of campaigning, raised ten thousand dollars for the new home in Evanston, of which he is a director.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson also served a term as president of the Swedish Republican League of Illinois.</p>
   <p>It would be truly regrettable if we pass up this opportunity to elect such an able and representative Swedish-American to the Circuit Court. There-fore, countrymen, let us all go to the polls on election day and, in the Republican column of the ballot, place our mark in front of the name of Edwin A. Olson.</p>
