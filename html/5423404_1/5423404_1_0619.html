   <p>Several Swedish girls employed as switchboard operators in the Central Exchange Station put on a one-day strike last week. The reason for the strike was that they were forbidden to walk through the passage from Washington Street and enter through the main entrance of the new exchange building. The manager of the station demanded that they enter at the rear entrance, to approach which the girls were forced to walk through an alley lined with side doors of saloons. Several of the girls had been bothered by drunken men and immoral women hanging around these entrances. As protests against such pestering did no good, the girls decided to strike for the privilege of using the front entrance, and with the entire service at a standstill, the management was compelled to compromise, and permit the girls to enter via the High Door.</p>
