   <p>Among the candidates nominated by the Republicans at last week's convention we note the name of Carl R. Chindblom, nominated as candidate for county commissioner. Mr. Chindblom, one of our most capable attorneys, is an outstanding figure in our Chicago Swedish colony.</p>
   <p>Carl R. Chindblom was born in Chicago on December 21, 1870 and graduated in 1890 from Augustana College, after which he taught in the newly-established Martin Luther College in Chicago. In 1897 he took up the study of law, and in 1900 was admitted to the bar. He has practised law in Chicago ever since.</p>
   <p>Chindblom has always been an ardent Republican, and in 1903 and 1904 served very efficiently as president of the Illinois Swedish Republican League. Since January he has acted as attorney for the Illinois Board of Health.</p>
