   <p>Unemployment has now become so widespread in this country that it is causing grave concern in high quarters. The situation is really serious. The families of most of the unemployed are in actual need, and most people whose hearts are in the right place regret that so little is being done for the innocent victims of this catastrophe. The cold season is approaching, and if appropriate measures to meet it are not taken the suffering will increase tenfold.</p>
   <p>People in responsible quarters realize this, and the governors of some states have called in leading industrialists and other big employers for consultation regarding ways and means of putting the largest possible number of people to work.</p>

   <p>Last week Governor Emmerson called a conference for that purpose, and it is to be hoped that it will result in increased employment opportunities for the great army of unemployed in the state. Something must be done, and it must be done soon.</p>
