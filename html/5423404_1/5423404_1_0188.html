   <p>Anybody who has failed to notice the steady progress made by the temperance movement during recent years must be a poor observer of social manifestations. It is winning new adherents right along in spite of the efforts of the liquor barons to discredit it and the principles for which it stands.</p>
   <p>Even if one cannot always subscribe to the methods employed by the leaders of the temperance cause, one must certainly admit that their purpose signifies a social reform which is both necessary and desirable, and plenty of arguments may be presented in its favor. The old and partly worn one about the destructive effect of liquor on health may be re-enforced by economic considerations, for it is easy to show the beneficial results which have ensued in communities where the traffic in alcoholic beverages has been restricted or even prohibited by law.</p>
   
   <p>The state of Kansas stands out as the best example. It has been a prohibition state for thirty years, but the law is being more strictly enforced now than ever before. The population approaches two million, and taxable property amounts to $1,130 per person; bank deposits are $113 per person, and in no other state do so many families, in proportion to population, own their homes. Poverty and the number of those suffering from mental disorders have been sharply reduced during recent years, and a checkup which took place some time ago showed that last year forty-nine out of the state's one hundred and five counties did not send a single convict to the state prison, while fifty county jails were empty. A few years after the prohibition law went into effect, divorce cases in the state had decreased by forty-five per cent. When such figures are compared to those of the "wet" states, their significance becomes clear. And this is not all of it! The death rate in Kansas is lower than that of any other state in the Union, and for that matter lower than that of any country in the World. In the field of education the state holds a unique place. One out of every one hundred and twenty persons attends college, and on the basis of such a percentage even the "cultured" state of Massachusetts is far behind.</p>
   
   <p>Of course, the liquor laws are being broken in Kansas in various ways, but the number of offenders are diminishing, and the younger generation considers the use of liquor degrading.</p>
   <p>Such figures as cited above place the familiar plea for "personal liberty," the good old stand-by, in the shadow. To be sure, this much-abused phrase has a certain appeal for all of us, but it is so elastic that it can be used in defense of the craziest acts.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday will be observed as "Temperance Sunday" by organizations all over the country, which on that day will make special efforts in behalf of the cause. This article, such as it is, may be considered our modest contribution.</p>
