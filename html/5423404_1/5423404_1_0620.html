   <p>Fifteen weeks ago, the conflict between the union of the typographers and the employers in this industry culminated in a strike which touched, however, merely a limited group of the 10,000 typographers belonging to the union in the United States. One might call it a trial strike, even though the strike really concerned the basic principles of the organization. However limited in scope is the strike, the employers' organization has had a stiff task in its attempt to quell it, and when now, on January 1, 1906, the strike will comprise 10,000 men, embracing all the larger printing establishments in the country... the fight will be infinitely more intense for those printing establishments which want to "run their own business," and not permit the orkers any say in the matter.</p>
   <p>Years ago, the typographers' union decided on an eight hour normal working day. It was well understood that a strenuous strughle would be required to carry the decision through in reality, but victory in the matter was important. It meant the persistent straggle of the pioneer against ignorance and prejudice, and if victory is won, it means that other unions will take up the fight against other narrow-minded employers, and the fight will continue until the eight hour day has been adopted by all factories and shops in the country.</p>
   <p>Understanding this, other unions ought not stand idly by as mere onlookers, they must step into the fight, both morally and financially, in favor of their struggling brethren.</p>
