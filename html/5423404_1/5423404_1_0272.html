   <p>Our readers are reminded of the Julottan service which will take place Christmas morning at 5:45 A.M. in the Trinity Swedish Lutheran Church. It will be heard over radio station WMAQ. [Translator's note: Julottan is an early Christmas morning Church service, an old Swedish custom]. Dr. Gottfred Nelson will preach, and Christmas hymns will be sung by the church choir.</p>
   <p>Another Lutheran service will be heard over station WCFL, and the Swedish part of it, with Dr. Julius Lincoln preaching, will begin at 6:00 A.M. and will last one half hour.</p>
   <p>During a later part of the service the English language will be used and Mrs. Jennie Ekblom Peterson, president of the Swedish Choral Club, will sing.</p>
