   <p>At the primary election this coming Tuesday the question will not merely determine whether the thirty-five aldermen whose term has expired are to be re-elected. The significance is more far-reaching. Through the election it will be determined whether William Hale Thompson is yet possessing that confidence of the people, of which ten months ago he received such overwhelming evidence.</p>
   <p>To be sure, nothing is more uncertain than public opinion, but after all, this public opinion should not make a turn about over night unless there be a sufficient reason for it. If then the people of Chicago who so recently gave Mr. Thompson greater acclaim than any candidate for office has received during the whole history of the city were to vote against him now, it would seem that something must have occured to make him seem unworthy of the confidence imposed in him.</p>

   <p>He started his career as mayor by settling two big strikes, settlements which brought him well earned praise from all sides and from all over the country. Shortly afterwards came his Sunday-closing of the saloons. For this matter he simply did his duty, but of course it took great courage to do it, since none of his predecessors had dared do it. Mayor Thompson's appointments to office have not been successfully criticised by anyone. The State's attorney who is a democrat and who must therefore be considered one of Mr. Thompson's opponents had to declare, in the name of justice, that the complaints in regard to appointments by the mayor were merely political.</p>
   <p>Now it is a fact that Mayor Thompson from the very beginning of his term has met with strong opposition in the City Council. This opposition became the majority in the council when Mr. Thompson decided to obey the law and close the saloons on Sundays. Ever since, his activity as executive of the city has been practically paralyzed in cases where the consent of the board of aldermen was required to put into effect any measure for the welfare of this city proposed or desired by the mayor.</p>

   <p>The deliberations of the city council are open to the public. Thus it is possible for the public to learn the nature of the opposition there to the mayor, and also who are the aldermen that urge this opposition, who are the leaders in this attempt to humilate Mr. Thompson and who are trying to nullify all efforts of his for the welfare of the city. At the meetings of the city council most of the time is now passed in denunciations by certain aldermen, of the mayor. Questions of practical import for the city are disregarded.</p>
   <p>Under these conditions, Mayor Thompson has no choice but to appeal once again to the people. He is asking that the people give him a new vote of confidence by returning to private life those aldermen who have been the worst noise maker in the city council and to elect in their place men who are willing to co-operate with him for the good of the city.</p>
   <p>With few exceptions, Mayor Thompson is opposed by the newspapers,as was the case at the time of his election. But we believe that the people, now as then will judge on the basis of the facts presented by the mayor and known from the deliberation of the city council, so that the mayor may look forward to without fear to the results of the election.</p>
