   <p>Across the street from the Svenska Nyheter building is located another Swedish newspaper, perhaps not too highly esteemed by the thoughtful Swedes in our city. Last week, our contemporary experienced one of his periodic attacks of pessimism, and this time the attack so affected the editor's mediocre thought activity that he wrote an editorial through which his gall against the Swedish National Association and Senator Charles Darrow is given free vent. In this editorial in which events are treated in somewhat less than factual fashion, we read: "To the genuinely Swedish festival held last Sunday in Elliott Park, the board of directors of the Swedish National Association had not found itself capable of any better plan than to invite, or rather hire Clarence Darrow to speak to the Swedish group." Our contemporary continues, and informs us that Mr. Darrow is a Socialist or an anarchist, that he demanded pay for speaking before the peace commission on behalf of the coal miners, that he was the only one in the Illinois legislature who opposed Samuel Erickson's motion to come to the aid of the destitute Norrlanders and Finns to the amount of $5,000, that he fooled the Labor party, and sold out to Carter Harrison, and adds that "Mr. Darrow, in his speech at the mid-summer festival, urged the Swedes to join the Democratic party en masse."</p>
   <p>In order to take up the successive points in the editorial in their sequence, it seems suitable to call attention to the fact that to the "genuinely Swedish festival," our complaining contemporary did not consider it necessary to be represented, although tickets had been placed at the paper's disposal. To such extent is the editor of the paper interested in a "genuinely Swedish" gathering. This lack of representation does not prevent the editor, however, from asserting, with his usual untruthful assurance that the "Socialist or anarchist," Clarence Darrow, urged the Swedes to join the Democrats. For the logic of this assertion we seek in vain. Does our contemporary, the faithful servant of Mr. Lorimer, the "sweetheart" of Speaker Miller, and the "little girl" of of Governor Yates, mean to assert that a Socialist would urge anybody to join the Democratic party? Hardly. Our pessimistic contemporary is merely trying to scare the girls who are reading the paper.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, the contemporary in question has never criticized the Swedish National Association for having invited Senators Mason, Hopkins, and Juel, the Attorneys Luther, Laflin, Mills, and Elliott, to other "genuinely Swedish" occasions. And what is the reason? Simply that the political beliefs of these gentlemen were similar to those of the complaining chief editor of our contemporary. But when the Swedish National Association invites Mr. Darrow, a man whose equal as to intellectual keenness is difficult to find; who does not permit himself to be tied by decrees of any party; who dares expose that which he considers wrong, no matter what friend or foe may say of it; who is called a radical by the conservatives, and a conservative by the radicals, then our contemporary feels that criticism is needed.</p>
   
   <p>The main reason for this criticism is clear. Mr. Darrow attacked the vast monopolies which every Swedish-American, who loves truth and justice, will try to aid in crushing by means of law.</p>
   <p>The attack by our conceited little contemporary against the Swedish National Association and the speaker at the mid-summer festival will need no further reply.</p>
