   <p>According to the widely quoted law of supply and demand the price of coal should have fallen considerably this winter. But in preparation for the coming new wage agreement with the miners, the coal corporations have either entirely discontinued or greatly curtailed their operations. One purpose, among others, of this action is to gain the sympathy of the public during the discussions with the workers.</p>
   <p>The corporations point out that during the war the hourly pay of the miners increased by 114 per cent, but they fail to show how much the working time was reduced during the same period. The miners are paid only for the actual time that they work, and total working hours have been reduced in order to keep the price of coal at its present unreasonably high level.</p>
   <p>A coal strike seems unavoidable. The miners are willing to accept a lower hourly rate if they are guaranteed regular work. But such a guarantee would throw a monkey wrench into the corporations' system of regulating the supply of coal and, consequently, its price.</p>
   <p>In this connection, it is well to remember that the United States Congress went to considerable expense to investigate conditions in the coal industry. Several Senators urged the introduction of much-needed reforms, but thanks to the conniving of the representatives of the operators none of the proposed reforms materialized.</p>
