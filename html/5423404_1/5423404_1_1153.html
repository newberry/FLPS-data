   <p>The Chicago Daily News, has published the results of its privately arranged "election," by which it sought to find out the people's choice for mayor, of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This private "election," which shows that Fred Busse received <span class="gap">[gap]</span>,928 votes and mayor Dunne 1,845 votes, is of little value, because the voters are no doubt, of the same mind as the Daily News itself.</p>
   <p>There were also 6,649 votes cast, in this private "election," for renewed franchise to the street car company and 1,439 against it. This is also showing the wrong side. It is very doubtful, that the Chicago voters should 
    <span class="page-break">2</span>
    be more interested in the franchise, than in the selection of a mayor, however, if Mr. Busse is elected the street car problem will be solved.</p>
