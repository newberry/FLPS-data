   <p>The multimillionaire and street railway magnate, August Belmont, of New York, some time ago, when a conflict between his companies and their employees seemed imminent, declared publicly: "All right, is they call a strike we have fifteen hundred well-trained streetcar men to take their places."</p>
   <p>In these words he revealed a fact which only a few people previously knew, namely, that the well-known strike wreaker James Farley has at his disposal an army of fifteen hundred men, ready on short notice to go to any part of the country and Greek strikes. They are now employed in various street railway companies, but on Farley's orders they are prepared to leave their jobs with their employers' permission, and go to the locality where they are needed. The companies who cooperate in this arrangement are found in San Francisco, Ealtimore, Materbury, Bridgeport, Jersey City, Newark, and Screanton.</p>

   <p>We blame the companies less than we do the Miserable beings who let themselves be bought and sold as though they were cattle. The former are, of course, aiding each other out of sheer self-interest, and that is more than can be said of those workers who have steady employment throughout the year, and still, from sheer meanness, will travel thousands of Miles under a still meaner leader to aid in breaking a strike of underpaid fellow workers who are trying to improve their condition by demanding a few more cents a day for their work.</p>
   <p>The conduct of such an army of strikebreakers is actually nauseating to right thinking people. Its only purpose is to ruin the happiness of others, crush their hopes, and defeat their attempt to secure a more bearable existence.</p>
   <p>We could forgive those who for the sake of self-preservation are forced to take over the jobs of striking fellow workers. But only God can forgive these professional strikebreakers, who for no good reason at all sell their services to the streetcar magnates. There is no more contemptible individual on the <span class="page-break">\3</span>face of the earth than a professional strikebreaker. One should avoid him as one would the plague. Stay away from him as you would stay away from a person afflicted with leprosy. Consider him a traitor, and treat him with the utmost contempt. He is a thief, for he steals bread out of the mouths of babies. He is a cheat and a double-crosser,for in his home community he pretends to be an honest worker and good comrade. He is a murderer, for he kills his better self and his fellow man's belief in the fundamental good of humanity. He is a slave for he can be bought and sold. Do not attempt to analyze his soul, because that is dirtier than anything else about him, and the attempt will only cause you painful disdain.</p>
   <p>It is hard to believe that a strikebreaker was created in God's image.</p>
