   <p>During the last few years Swedish-Americans in various parts of the country have demonstrated a degree of unity and well-directed energy in the political field which bodes well for their future. They are beginning to demand the political recognition to which they are entitled and the jobs that go with it. No longer are they satisfied with, and thankful for, the political crumbs which have been thrown to them by the bosses. Where the Swedes formerly felt they were doing well when one of their nationals was put on as a school watchman or janitor, nowadays the superintendent of county schools may well be a Swedish-American. Or, a city where a few years ago, a Swede needed a lot of luck in addition to influential friends to get on the police force, may now have a Swedish-American police judge.</p>
   <p>At the coming elections next fall Swedes will also be in the running for higher <span class="page-break">2</span>state offices. The outstanding candidate is Governor Eberhart of Minnesota, who has been renominated by his party, and whose record in office has been the subject of favorable comment in many leading newspapers even outside of his own state. In the state of Nebraska a strong movement is under way for the purpose of electing our countryman, C. P. Anderbury, as attorney general, and in the same state, another Swede, State Controller Lobeck, is seeking a seat in Congress.</p>
   <p>The re-election of State Senator Landee, here in Illinois, is of special interest to Swedish-Americans in the state,aside from the fact that a man of his recognized ability and integrity is much needed in the legislature right now. His name is prominent in connection with much progressive legislation, and he is known as an uncompromising foe of reaction in any form. It looks as if he will be nominated at the primary, which takes place on September 15.</p>
   <p>We dare say that as real merit more and more becomes the chief consideration <span class="page-break">3</span>in making nominations for public office, Swedish-Americans will come more to the fore in American politics.</p>
