   <p>The Scandinavian Branch of the Machinists' Union held its regular monthly meeting at the Svea Hall, last Wednesday. At this meeting it was unanimously decided to change the name of the organization to the "Swedish Machinists' Union", in view of the fact that only Swedes have become members. The following members were elected officers at this meeting: Olaf Widerberg, chairman; Gettfrid Johnson, recording secretary; John Lindquist, financial secretary; and P.M. Pearson, treasurer.</p>
