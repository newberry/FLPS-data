   <p>Last Friday, October 20, the pure Swedish flag was raised upon America's soil for the first time in ninety years. It was raised from the house of Gus [no last name given]where Svenska Nyheter is located. Here the blue and yellow cloth, relieved of the mark of union with Norway, was waving to the music of the wind. Proudly lay the yellow cross upon the blue expanse, and the old flag pole stood strong as an oak in the forests of the Northland, and proud of the honor of having a part in this day of festivity.</p>
   <p>The worthy old flag sang its own song of the sons, who patiently bore the meanness and hypocricy of an old monarch, and who sheathed the sword rather than shed the blood of a brother of a broad-minded people, who preferred peace to war. Now it is playing quietly with the rays of the sun, dreaming of days to come. There are bright times for all who build and dwell under its shadow.</p>
