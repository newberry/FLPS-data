   <p>District Attorney Edwin A. Olson some months ago tendered his resignation to the Attorney General in Washington, D. C., requesting that he be relieved by Jan. 1st.

   <p>Subsequent to the above writing it has been officially announced that our well-known contryman, Attorney George E. Q. Johnson, also a Chicagoan, has been appointed to succeed Mr. Olson.</p>
