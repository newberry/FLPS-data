   <p>At this writing the financial result of the festival which Chicago's Swedes held last Sunday in Soldiers' Field, for the purpose of raising relief funds, has not been announced. But already it has been pointed out that even under the most favorable conditions this affair could not possibly bring in sufficient funds to finance the relief work which, to all appearances, is bound to be required during the coming winter. The employment situation does not show much improvement, and regardless of last Sunday's results, other means must be found of raising additional funds, for there will be many needy.</p>
   <p>The depression has now lasted for almost two years, and an upswing should be due. But the great mass of the unemployed have not experienced any improvement in their condition. In fact it is becoming worse every day, as more and more of them reach the end of their savings and other resources. It is, therefore, clear that the <span class="page-break">\2</span>need for relief will be at least as great, perhaps greater, next winter than it was a year ago.</p>
   <p>Much is being said and written about the best way of administering relief, but indications are that methods adopted last year will be continued. It was, for instance, the practice to refuse aid to families that owned a home, even though the property was mortgaged to the limit, and was sure to be foreclosed unless aid was given. The fact that the head of the family was a homeowner simply made him ineligible for relief.</p>
   <p>It is evident that this principle works a great injustice on many people. The fact that a person managed to acquire a home when times were good shows that he was ambitious and had a proper sense of values. Such people certainly do deserve aid when they get into financial difficulties through no fault of their own. But those holding the purse strings do not see it that way. Let them lose their little homes, even though they represent years of toil and sacrifice. Who cares? And at the same time professional beggars who have <span class="page-break">\3</span>never done an honest day's work, and who throw their money to the winds when they happen to get hold of any, get everything they need. For them times are good, but for the honest, proud worker times are really tough.</p>
