   <p>The question of good schools have always interested the Swedish people and the last few weeks have given Mayor Thompson an opportunity to fullfil his pledge to make the school system of Chicago, second to none, and, if possible, first in the land.</p>
   <p>The great daily papers in Chicago, have, again failed in their attempt to discredit our Mayor. All their talk of impeaching the Mayor for misfeance is just a lot of tommy-rot. All their attempts to proceed along illegal lines have failed to date, and will continue to fail. Not even the almighty newspapers can do that which is manifestly wrong on sight. It is to be hoped that they will <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be punished for their illegal activities. The new School Board which took office under the New Law, will not be as subservient to these newspapers, as was the old Board. So at least to this extent they have received a certain amount of "rebuke" for their stubborn disregard against the welfare of our great school system, in which our rights and liberties are firmly tested.</p>
