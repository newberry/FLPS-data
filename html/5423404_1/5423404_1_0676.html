   <p>Stockholm, Sweden, July 28, 1903. Most of the newspapers in Stockholm today express their satisfaction at the outcome of the negotiations concerning the lockout. Especially is there satisfaction that a committee has been appointed to work out proposals for the peaceful settlement of future conflicts. The Socialdemokraten writes: "Not only has a new flare-up of the conflict been avoided, but the labor organization has been recognized a priori as a party to the negotiations, on equal footing with the employers. As a matter-of-course, the lockout and picketing ceased simultaneously. This action presupposes the recognition of the labor union. The attack against the right to organize....has been repulsed, and the field has been cleared for collective labor agreements as the only practical way to regulate labor conditions.</p>
   <p>"The critical moments of uncertainty are past, but with no less interest will the negotiations be studied, their purpose being to introduce into our industry the practice of constitutionalism--based upon collective negotiations."</p>
