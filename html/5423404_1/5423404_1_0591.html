   <p>We have previously stated in our columns that labor will not get its rights unless by some means it gets the backing of political influence strong enough to defeat the ruling parties. The truth of this statement has become evident, especially to unions, i. e., to organized labor. The cold shoulder heretofore given to labor by the political machines leaves no doubt in the minds of intelligent workers that such influence must come independently of unreliable political heads. The leaders of our big parties have mastered the art of becoming stone deaf in the ear nearest the laborer seeking his rights.</p>
   <p>A political upheaval can be brought about by labor if labor and socialists will compromise and fight the existing parties wholeheartedly and steadily. The voters thus combined can easily swamp the other parties even if they merge.</p>
   <p>It is already self-evident that labor will not much longer accept the "crumbs <span class="page-break">\2</span>falling from the rich man's table"; neither will the laborer much longer play the part of a handy Andy, running errands and doing the hard work for our lawmakers, without having something to say about it when laws are being made.</p>
   <p>Political parties and candidates to date have made promises which they invariably have broken. The promises were evidently made to be broken.</p>
   <p>Every law passed presumably in the interests of labor has been so distorted and complicated that with the many inevitable amendments, the writer of the proposed law himself would find it impossible to recognize the law as one proposed by him. The big parties foolishly think that labor is brainless enough to accept and appreciate a law that gives them not even the semblance of a benefit, and labor is now thoroughly disgusted with this stepmotherly treatment.</p>
