   <p>Fourteen Swedish theological students took their examination last Thursday at the Swedish section of the theological faculty at the University of Chicago. The instruction there is held in the Swedish language and so is the examination.</p>
   <p>Professor C. G. Lagergren made the farewell address to the students, which was answered by C. F. Wiking, from Evanston, chosen by the class for this purpose. This examination was the first one since the amount of time required for study was changed from three to four years. Two of the graduated: C. W. Swndmarkoch, and Carl Anderson are going to stay in the city; two go as missionaries to China, and the ten remaining will go to different states.</p>
   <p>They will all receive their diplomas Midsummer Eve. Witnesses to the examination were Reverend Charles Palm, from Evanston; P. A. Hjelm, Chicago; O Hedeen, Brooklyn, and C. A. Sandvall, Minneapolis.</p>
