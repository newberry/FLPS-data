   <p>Swedish Evangelical congregations in the Lake View district have held two joint meetings in order to discuss the need for, and the possibility of, closer cooperation among these congregations for the purpose of bringing about a stricter enforcement of laws and regulations within the district. The last meeting was held last Wednesday night. Delegates from several congregations attended, and it is expected that more will join the drive later.</p>
   <p>At these two preliminary meetings, the delegates have exchanged ideas on whether or not such united action is really called for, and in what ways it might benefit the community. There seems to be general agreement that an organized effort is not only desirable but necessary in order to obtain the full co-operation of the authorities charged with maintaining law and order.</p>
   <p>It is well known that liquor is being sold, that saloons are operating without interference, that questionable pictures are being shown in neighborhood theaters, <span class="page-break">2</span>and that gambling dens and disorderly houses are being conducted next door to the homes of decent citizens. The police and other law-enforcement bodies need the assistance of right-thinking men and women, and it will be the purpose of the proposed organization to offer its aid in getting rid of these evils.</p>
   <p>At Wednesday's meeting the delegates decided on unified action of the Swedish churches on the North Side, and first steps toward formation of an organization were taken. The following officers were elected: Pastor C. G. Wallenius, president; Pastor Harry Lindblom, vice-president; architect Oscar Johnson, secretary; and Eric Johnson, treasurer.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to map out a plan of action, which will be discussed at the next meeting, to be held July 13 in the Swedish Mission Church of Lake View.</p>
