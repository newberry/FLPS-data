   <p>p.11.....The "Swedes' Street" one can properly call Rhodes Avenue, between Sixty-sixth and Sixty-seventh Streets since the four Swedish builders, Messrs. Ernest Johnson, 6620 Rhodes Ave., Martin Holmgren, 6628 Rhodes Ave., Fred Nelson and J. Whiteman are owners of not less than twenty of the newly-built, stately buildings, which rise invitingly and pleasingly. The houses are already rented while it will be about a week before they are completed. We wish our enterprising, well-known countrymen out there on the "Swedes' Street" continued success.</p>
