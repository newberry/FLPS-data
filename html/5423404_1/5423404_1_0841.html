   <p>The old time types of government implied rulership by a class or by an individual. The systems did not work well. The ruling class suppressed the other classes, making life miserable for them. The individual rulers by and by came to think of themselves as far elevated above the people ruled by them, a demigod or a god was the only term that would indicate their loftiness. The people, consequently, became of small importance and were treated accordingly. The American form of government was adopted to give the common people scope, to escape suppression. Our government has <span class="page-break">\2</span>existed for more than one hundred years, and now there are many pessimists who declare that democracy, too, has failed. Many undesirable conditions prevail in this country which do not exist in Europe. The question arises, "Had we better return to one of the older forms of government? Is government by the people a colossal mistake attractive in theory but impractical?"</p>
   <p>The trouble is that so far we have not had a real government by the people. In the city, the state, and the national government we find that many of those who were chosen to represent the people, are in fact representatives of great corporations, and that in their capacity as such they are working against the people, not for the people. But a change is taking place. Roosevelt's election as president was a hopeful sign of the people having <span class="page-break">\3</span>awakened. Soon the day will come when city, state, and country will be governed for the benefit of the people, and the representative who has worked against his constituents will be afraid of facing them once more. This can be attained.</p>
   <p>"If it is not attained then the reason is that the people do not have sufficient intelligence to want honest and capable men as their representatives."</p>
