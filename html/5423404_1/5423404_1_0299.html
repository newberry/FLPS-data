   <p>The Swedish-American press in the United States is giving out warnings in their editorial columns to Swedish-Americans who intend to visit their homeland. They caution them to be very careful not to show American manners too much in regard to their outfit of American clothing, shoes, gold watches, etc., when they visit Sweden. They should avoid mixing English words into the Swedish language.</p>
   <p>One Swedish-American newspaper has very often complained that the newspapers in Sweden ridicule and besmear their countrymen from America. For our part we do not care much for such small town manners, because the writers do not understand a better style.</p>
