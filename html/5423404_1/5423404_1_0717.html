   <p>The co-operative idea is being introduced in the entirely new field of housing here in Chicago. In several localities, people who ordinarily rent apartments have formed organizations, based on the co-operative principle, which have erected buildings in which members can rent apartments on favorable terms.</p>
   <p>The latest enterprise of this kind is sponsored by the Own-Your-Own Association, of which Albert Ericson is the president. It operates on the North Side, and now has two large apartment buildings under construction--one at 4137 and the other at 4626 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>The current high rent in Chicago is the reason why people are turning to such co-operative undertakings.</p>
