   <p>Congressman Lorimer, representing the Sixth Congressional District now has a rival worthy to oppose him, Luther P. Friestedt, of Chicago's Swedish Colony. Mr. Friestedt was born in Watertown, Wis. on Apr. 13, 1860, and is how in the prime of life and holds high positions in several local and foreign business concerns of size and quality. In Chicago he was elected alderman in 1902 and 1904.</p>
   <p>In 1905 he resigned as alderman in order to take a business trip to foreign countries. He is president of the British Steel Piling Company of London, England, and was, until recently, a member of the Outer-Belt Park Commission of Chicago. He is still a prominent figure in the Chicago Athletic Society, the Western Society of Engineers and other outstanding Chicago organizations. His reputation in Chicago business and politics makes him an ideal candidate for Congress.</p>
