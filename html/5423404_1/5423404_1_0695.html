   <p>The quiet forces in a strike suffer the same fate as the quiet forces in everyday lives--they are hardly ever noticed.</p>
   <p>A strike directly influencing the lives of twenty thousand workers, and which goes on week after week, is silenced to death if the strikers do not break the laws in any way. Nothing good is being said in the papers of these twenty thousand men, women, and children in Lowell, Massachusetts, who have gone about for more than a month, idle. They have given no occasion for action by the police or by the militia. No effort is being made to encourage them in their calm determined fight against the powerful employers. But if, as it might happen, some hot-heads among the strikers lay obstacles in the way of some "foreign" strike breakers, then is the press more than willing to paint the "strike riot" in the blackest colors. Then it will warn of the <span class="page-break">2</span>serious consequences. It will condemn the strike leaders who are unable to control the strikers. The press will express its concern that the workers are not obeying the laws of the land.</p>
