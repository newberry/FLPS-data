   <p>The depression, which has hit America and Europe and most other parts of the world, reaches deeper and extends further than any previous one. It is conservatively estimated that there are four million unemployed workers in the United States and England; Germany and Russia have about two million, each. In France, conditions are not so bad and in the Scandinavian countries employment is about normal, possibly, even somewhat better than usual. There is also unemployment in Italy but that country has Mussolini.</p>
   <p>England and Sweden, and a few other countries, have undertaken unemployment relief, which is of some help, but is not sufficient. In Germany, the Government is trying to make the employers take care of the situation. In France, the workers are still so well off that they can afford to indulge in strikes. Italy's dictator sees to it that new opportunities for work are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>provided when the old ones give out. The Russians are accustomed to starvation and they are hungry now. But how about conditions here in our own rich United States?</p>
   <p>In this country workers are living on hope, the hope that better times are coming, and on reports of how bad they are right now. The National Business Survey Council, which was appointed by President Hoover, has just published its report; according to it, no improvement in industrial activity is as yet noticeable. Even the building industry, which the Government has made special efforts to nurse along, is still at a low ebb.</p>
   <p>No concrete measures for the alleviation of hardships among the unemployed have been forthcoming from any quarter. But the newspapers have started a "buy now, build now" campaign and people are still hoping. Nobody doubts that good times will be here again, maybe next month, this fall, after New Year's, or next spring.</p>

   <p>It has been said that he who waits for something good to happen never waits in vain. But there are workers who have waited for employment for more than a year and one can readily imagine their position. We hear someone ask, "Why didn't they save their money when times were good?" The answer is, that for the majority of workers, wages are never high enough to make possible the building up of any reserve that amounts to anything, and what savings some of them may have melt away fast when their families have to start living on them. And, by the way, how would storekeepers and other businessmen like it if workers, in normal times, cut their expenditures to the bare necessities? It would not do American business any good.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the crisis which we are now experiencing will teach American leaders a lesson, so that they will make plans and take measures that will make the country better prepared to meet the next one. A nation cannot live indefinitely on hope, and it is no longer true that no one who is willing to work has to starve in this country.</p>
