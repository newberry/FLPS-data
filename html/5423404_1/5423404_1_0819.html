   <p>The Scandinavian Committee for Socialist Propaganda has, in accordance with its agreement with the Central Committee of the Socialist party, decided to send out a Scandinavian organizer, who will visit those localities in which it may be possible to organize a Scandinavian branch of the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>In order to make this plan a success it is necessary for the organizing committee to obtain the co-operation of comrades and friends in various parts of the country, who will keep the committee informed of the possibilities of establishing such branches in their communities.</p>
   <p>We are planning to send out our organizer early in the fall, and his itinerary will to a large extent be determined by the information which we receive from you, our friends, who are scattered about the country, and are acquainted with <span class="page-break">\2</span>conditions in your respective localities.</p>
   <p>We are, therefore, asking all such friends of the Socialist cause to get in touch with the Committee's corresponding secretary.</p>
   <p>With brotherly greeting,</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Committee for Socialist Propaganda,</p>
   <p>N. Juel Christensen, Corresponding Secretary,</p>
   <p>1691 North Rockwell Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
