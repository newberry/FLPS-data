   <p>The Republican county convention opened at ten o'clock last Thursday morning at the First Regiment Armory, while an hour earlier the Democratic convention had opened at the North Side Turner Hall. The Socialists held their convention at Brand's Hall, Erie and Clark Streets, in the evening. The Democrats' session was at times really a stormy one, while order and a touch of harmony ruled the other two.</p>
   <p>Among the Republican candidates we note several Swedes: Harry Olson (Twenty-fifth Ward), for chief justice of the Municipal Court; C. R. Chindblom (Twenty-fifth Ward), for county commissioner; A. Bergman (Twenty-third Ward), for sanitary commissioner.</p>
   <p>Among the Democratic candidates we find no Swedes, but on the Socialist ticket there will appear the names of James P. Larson, for sheriff; H. W. Johnson, <span class="page-break">2</span>for clerk of the Probate Court; <span class="gap">[gap]</span>els Anderson, for city commissioner; August Lund, for county commissioner; John Hanson, for associate judge; and R. E. Olson and Alfred Carlson, for trustees of the sanitary district.</p>
