   <p>That a casket trust should be known to exist in Chicago charging such unnecessarily enormous prices is an unprecedented crime.</p>
   <p>Undertaker R. G. Smith, 1305 Michigan Avenue, had a discouraging experience last week. Several months ago he made a contract with the Chicago Federation of Labor to inter adults for $50.00 and children for $35.00. For these prices he furnished a beautiful casket, the hearse and three vehicles for pallbearers and the bereaved. Last week his supply of caskets was sold out, so he went out to buy a complete stock of new ones from the trust. Wherever he applied, he was refused, so, he has decided to appeal to the government.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smith charges that caskets, for which the trust demands $150.00 costs eighteen to twenty dollars to make. Until he went up against the trust, he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was able to buy these caskets for thirty to forty dollars. During the last six months the trust has increased the selling price from seventy-five per cent to even higher prices. As a sample of the voraciousness of the trust, he states that the casket in which William McKinley was buried, and others of equal quality, sold for five hundred dollars whole it actually cost fifty dollars to manufacture.</p>
