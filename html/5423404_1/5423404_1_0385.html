   <p>EDITORIAL: The Swedish Tribune, Chicago, reprinted an article from Goteborg's Handelstidning, Sweden on its editorial page today:</p>
   <p>"When a Swede goes to the United States of America he is surprised to see how much a man does there. The American worker receives higher wages than in Sweden, but he does much more work during fifty-nine hours in the week. He is able to better his position, to get married early, to own his home and his dear garden.</p>
   <p>The shops and the factories are conducted in a different way then in the Old World.</p>
   <p>The European company extends the factory activities when business is increasing, but when times are not so good they cut down everywhere. The European factory owner makes his machines and tools better when forced to <span class="page-break">\2</span>do so by competition and moves out to the country or to a smaller city where there are no such industries as his factory, if the wages become too high.</p>
   <p>The American has another system, he tries to increase his business as much as possible by using agents, travelling salesman, advertisements, and by forcing his machines and his workers to the limit. He doesn't wait until he is forced to get his machines and tools into better shape. Improvements save time, strength, and money. He makes satisfactory arrangements if the wages are too high.</p>
   <p>The American factories are elastic in regard to the market. Their machines are not making their owners so dependent on their workers as in Europe, where a factory owner sometimes cannot deliver orders at a certain time, because his workers "take some days off."</p>
   <p>It doesn't take a long time to learn how to use the American machines and tools, even for a man who never has used them before. Small factories are, therefore, not afraid to take orders to be delivered on time. And they make it. Many Swedes have accomplished that here in the Middle West, and when the Swedes in <span class="page-break">\3</span>America have learned accuracy and understand that they will be out of work if they "skip," they are said to be the best workers in the world.</p>
   <p>A factory owner in America would lose his customers if he could not be depended upon to keep his promises... It is, therefore, necessary that he in turn be able to depend upon his employee's accuracy and promptness.</p>
   <p>Take for example, a pair of shoes. More than a hundred different machines have been invented for this industry. Modern shoe factories have organized large communities. The forty-four different parts in a pair of shoes are now made in the large factories of America by fifty men, women and children. The consumer can now buy a pair of shoes forhalf the price they cost ten years ago.</p>
   <p>American shoeworkers are paid by the day. The wage for a fifty-nine hour week is $11.63. Every worker has his own account and is charged with the quantity of leather he receives. If he cannot do a certain amount of work a day, or if he is careless with the leather and uses too much, he is fired.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It takes very skilful workers to bring a pair of shoes into the proper final form, and they are paid more than the other workers. No machine has yet been invented to do this important work.</p>
   <p>When the Swedish workers in America become familiar with the American working methods they are said to be excellent workers and quickly raise themselves up to the higher wage levels.</p>
   <p>If those in Sweden would adopt these American working methods,they would be much better off. There would be new life in our Swedish factories, and Sweden as a whole would benefit tremendously."</p>
