   <p>The Anglo-American press, with few exceptions, know about as much concerning the political differences between Sweden and Norway and the causes, as the savages of South Africa know about conditions in Alaska. On account of this, one may read, day after day, of the Norwegian people who are being "downtrodden by the Swedes." The sympathy has constantly been on the side of the Norwegians, and the Swedes have been considered somewhat as slave owners on a small scale. Since the beginning of the revolution, neither the Norwegians in their homeland, nor the Norwegians here, have uttered a single word to lift the American nation out of this state of misinformation. Quite to the contrary, the Norwegian press both here and at home is jubilant because Norway is now a free country, and the joy-intoxicated sons of Norway are singing songs of victory. If one had dared, two weeks before the so-called "coup of state," even to hint that Norway was not a free country, our brothers would have rejected the insinuation with justifiable wrath. Now conditions are different, and one is keenly aware of the contradictory attitudes. The "downtrodden" Norwegians have broken loose from underneath the heel; they have torn the rope (usually called the "union-tie") that fettered them, and now they do not want anything further to do with Sweden-the country which, like a mother, guided their first staggering steps on the road towards independence.</p>
   <p>The one hundred per cent Norwegian from Norway, has for nearly one hundred years complained that Mother Svea has treated him in the manner of a step-mother. He has been ungrateful from the very day he gained liberty, and now he bites the hand which steadied him.</p>
   <p>"Downtrodden" Norway has suffered painfully from having its foreign policy conducted in common with Sweden. Of the twenty-seven salaried consular positions, seventeen have been held by sons of "suffering" Norway, and of the nine ministers to foreign courts, only four are Norwegians. But in spite of this, Sweden has compelled Norway to pay one-fifth of the expenses for this system of representation.</p>
   <p>"Poor" Norway, you fought hard to get rid of the offensive union-sign from your flag, and because of that removal, you have lost lost millions in increased tolls from foreign ports. Your tradesmen, ship owners, shipmasters, and manufacturers warned you, but you remained deaf. It will cost'you millions and millions again to continue on the way which you now have begun to follow, and some future day your immature politicians -with the bragging Nansen at their head-will sorely regret their ill-conceived actions.</p>
   <p>What will you accomplish, Old Norway, in having Mr. Nansen as your president? A president who does not know the history of his own country and who is incompetent as a statesman.</p>
   <p>And why do you want a Swedish prince for your King when you slapped the old honorable monarch's face with your dirty hand? And why do you pretend friendship, officially, to the Swedish people and the Swedish crown, when in your heart you hate both?</p>
   <p>And why did you not politely thank the Swedes for the nine hundred thousand crowns they presented you with at the time of the Aalesund fire, while you bowed low before the German emperor and wrote long editorials of appreciation-because he gave you, on the occasion mentioned, ten thousand marks? And why do you not appreciate the favors accorded your ship-owners by the Swedish lumber companies? They give your marine nearly all freight from the ports of Norrland. And lastly, Norway, why, do you so hate your brother?</p>
