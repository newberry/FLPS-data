   <p>You have probably read in the daily press that quite a few of the big factory owners in our city intend to move from Chicago and locate their factories in some lonely place or in some smaller city, far away from the "union-infested" city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Did you ever consider, during your leisure hours, just what is the cause of these scares, as we shall call them until further notice?</p>
   <p>It is no use placing the blame on the unions. People lacking the ability to think independently may bite on that book, but the wide-awake and thoughtful citizen knows better. Be is aware that the mighty movement to organize all labor extends to practically every city, to every branch of industry, to every factory in the country, and no manufacturer can escape it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In addition, the organized workers in Chicago are no more difficult to deal with than those of other cities.</p>
   <p>Now consider another thing....Have you never grasped the simple truth that a businessman is a businessman at all times, that as long as he keeps within the law he has no scruples whatever about the means he employs to get work and money out of his victims? How make some effort to discover whether the manufacturer, so sadly beset by "labor troubles," does not happen to have some friend (of the same name as the manufacture) who is the owner of a piece of land, which is nonsalable and unsuitable for farming, somewhere in Mishigan, Misconsin, Indiana, or Illinois. If he does own such a piece of land, he need merely put up a factory building on the land, and then sell lots to his workers, who then become"owners of their homes". We is then said to be building a small, thriving town or a small "model village" around the factory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The home owners struggle and save in order to pay for their homes. Then one day, it is said that the workers are again asking for too much. The manufacturer again moves his plant; he organizes another "model community," for removed from his first venture. Quite a number of such manufacturing sites are to be found throughout the United States. Thousands of abandoned factories reveal the areas here workers had once settled, where they had built their own homes in the expectation that they would find permanent work at the factory.</p>
   <p>When one considers the various factors involved in manufacturing, it will be quite clear that, except for such reasons as are mentioned above, it would be ridiculous for the larger manufacturers to leave Chicago and move to some hamlet. The progress of any manufacturing industry in this country depends in a large measure upon the speed and ease with which manufactured goods can be shipped and raw materials obtained, and upon the price demanded for these raw materials. but there are only a few places which can be compared with Chicago with respect to speedy transportation and <span class="page-break">\4</span>low prices for materials. Many manufactures in the smaller cities and towns are also fully aware of these facts, and so we have a steady stream of manufacturers coming to Chicago to start their factories here.</p>
   <p>The scare referred to does not work. Some other method must be discovered to frighten organized laborers away from their unions.</p>
