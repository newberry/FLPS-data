   <p>The aldermanic election takes place today, Tuesday, April 5. We hope that none of the Swedes who have the right to vote will fail to use this right. The election places are open from six o'clock in the morning till four o'clock in the afternoon. The citizens would do well to vote "yes" to all the questions appearing on the small ballot.</p>
   <p>Do not forget to vote!</p>
