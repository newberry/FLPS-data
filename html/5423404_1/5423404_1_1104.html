   <p>Judge Harry Olson</p>
   <p>Chicago.</p>
   <p>My Man:</p>
   <p>Ever since the day when your political bosses called you to stand as a candidate for the mayoralty, you have unjustly, and without cause attacked the good name and honor of myself and family.</p>
   <p>I cannot understand your motive or aim in attacking me in this manner without any challenge on my part. If you were an honorable man, you should inform the public that you have asked and accepted my help and support for twenty years.</p>
   <p>What do you hope to win through your attempt to turn the enmity of the people against me? The circumstance that you and I have Swedish blood in our veins <span class="page-break">2</span>is nothing to be ashamed of. I am proud of that. You should also be proud of your blood. If you have a spark of manliness in you, not to speak of gratitude, desist from bearing false witness against another American citizen, who was your friend in your hour of need!</p>
   <p>Stop your cunning sharp methods of lying about me, while you secretly and sneakingly seek your way among antagonistic political parties and turn your court into a meeting place for political servants and takers of bribes, where money from the traction interests helps to pay the cost of your Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde campaign.</p>
   <p>In friendship,</p>
   <p>Fred Lundin</p>
