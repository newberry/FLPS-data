   <p>Financial interests in the East are raising a howl of protest against the proposed appointment of a farmer as a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank. It is claimed that such an appointment would indicate a trend toward class legislation and Bolshevism, in spite of the fact that the proposal does not suggest that any particular class be represented. However, under the existing rules it is expressly understood that the Board is to consist of bankers exclusively.</p>
   <p>Experience has shown that the polices of the Bank are not formulated with a view to the interests of agriculture. Its directors are all big bankers, and its credit system is based on short-term credits only, Mostly thirty, sixty, and ninety days. This suits the purposes of business and industry, but is practically useless to farmers and stock breeders, who, as a rule, need credit for from one to three years. It seems clear that this institutions could be of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>much greater service if a man with a thorough knowledge of the needs of the farmers were appointed to its Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>The big bankers have always taken it for granted that their opinions should be decisive in all questions involving the use of this nation's wealth. But the Senate proposal concedes, in principle, that those who produce this wealth should also have something to say about the use which is to be made of it.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that this proposal only provides for the addition of one farmer member to the Board, which certainly could not be dominated by him. But he would, at least, be in a position to keep an eye on the activities of his colleagues. Even that is too much for the bankers, and they would have us believe that Bolshevism is about to invade the country. Such propaganda is entirely unfounded, and its purpose is to mislead the people. The fact is that if all the directors were farmers they could not possibly make a bigger fiasco out of the reserve bank system than has been made of it by the professional speculators.</p>
