   <p>Financial interests in the East are raising a howl of protest <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the proposed appointment of a farmer as a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank. It is claimed that such an appointment would indicate a trend toward class <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Bolshevism, in spite of the fact that the proposal does not suggest that any particular class be represented. However, under the existing rules it is expressly understood that the Board is to consist of bankors exclusively.</p>
   <p>Experience has shown that the polices of the Bank are not formulated with a view to the interests of agriculture. Its directors are all big bankers, and its credit system is based on short-term credits only, Mostly thirty, sixty, and ninety days. This suits the purposes of business and industry, but is practically useless to farmers and stock breeders, who, as a rule, need credit for from one to three years. It seems clear that this institutions could be of much greater service if a man with a thorough knowledge of the needs of the farmers were appointed to its Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>The big bankers have always taken it for <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that their opinions should be decisive in all <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of this nation's wealth. But the Senate proposal concedes, in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that those who produce this wealth should also have something to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to be made of it.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> addition of one farmer member to the Board, which <span class="gap">[gap]</span> could not be dominated by him. But he would, at least, be in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to keep <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they would have us believe that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> about to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> tirely unfounded, and its <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the people. The fact is that if all the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they could not possibly <span class="gap">[gap]</span> fiasco out of the reserve bank <span class="gap">[gap]</span> than has been made of it by the professional <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
