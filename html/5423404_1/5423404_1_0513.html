   <p>It may be that a mistake of a forgivable nature caused the accident on the Wabash Railway at Seneca, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Two trains were traveling on the same track, directed only by telegrams. It seems that the wording in these telegrams were not correctly construed by the train dispatchers. This was most unfortunate, because the inevitable consequence was that the two trains collided with one another head-on. The weather was clear, the head-lights of the locomotives could be seen for a distance of five miles in either direction.</p>
   <p>The only way in which such accidents can be entirely stopped is for the individual States and the United States government to formulate laws for <span class="page-break">\2</span>the railroads, making it absolutely compulsory to double track their road-bed, particularly for express and through service; also to install the automatic blocks system.</p>
   <p>The Interstate Commerce Commission should be charged with the supervision and enforcement of the laws. It would seem to us then that no further accident of this nature would be possible. Nothing can excuse the State of Michigan for its laxity in regard to railroad safety control.</p>
   <p>The traveling public is certainly entitled to the utmost safety as they travel over our various railroads.</p>
