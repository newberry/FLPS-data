   <p>This school is organizing a class which will open next Monday night, October 14, and in which Swedish newcomers may receive instruction in the English language. The class will meet every Monday and Thursday night from 7:30 to 9:00 o'clock for a period of nine weeks.</p>
   <p>The course is planned especially for Scandinavian students, and differs, therefore, considerably from the courses offered by the public night schools.</p>
   <p>Everybody who is interested is invited to attend, and to come to the school Monday or Thursday night next week, when registration takes place.</p>
   <p>The college is located at Kedzie and Foster Avenues.</p>
