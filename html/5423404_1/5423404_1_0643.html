   <p>We believe that many a month has passed since a strike has created such an uproar as the strike of the drivers of carriages and hearses, now going on in this city. We are certain that never before have the people of Chicago found so much to say about a strike as they have about the present one. The strike-hating press contains new denunciations of the strike every day, and a contemporary [a rival editor], otherwise thoroughly businesslike, becomes utterly sentimental... as he considers the fact that the remains of a judge and of a mayor had to be carried to their graves without the customary finery and richness of ceremony which attend the burial of people of such rank.</p>
   <p>The blame for this strike is being placed completely upon the shoulders of labor. The drivers had the presumption to think that they were entitled to more than twelve dollars for seven days of work; they considered that fourteen dollars for seven days of service was not too much for their none too <span class="page-break">\2</span>agreeable labor. ....The fact that the strikers are willing to have the points at issue settled by a committee consisting, on the one hand, of workers, and on the other, of such prominent citizens as Harry G. Selfridge, F. C. Peabody, F. G. Hartwell, J. S. Field, R. J. Thorne, and H. B. Steele does not count with the baiters of labor. To them, the workers are henceforth merely a bunch of rascals who dare refuse to carry the bodies of a judge and a mayor to their graves in style.</p>
   <p>The employers, who, time and again, have increased the prices for burial equipment, are of course not at all to blame for the strike! Or are they? Did they confer with their workers to avoid the strike? No! Would they agree to have the questions at issue settled by an arbitration board? No! Did not the employers' organization threaten to drop from the organization every employer who would take steps to settle the strike with his workers? Yes! And yet the employers are said to bear no blame for the strike!</p>
