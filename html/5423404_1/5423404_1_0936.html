   <p>There is no more important element of the Republican Party in Cook County than the Swedish-American voters. They can poll 10,000 votes this fall. Additions are being made to their number every week. Before every election for the last three years the names of from 500 to 1,000 Swedish-American voters have been added to the registry lists of this city.</p>
   <p>The new and the old citizens of Swedish birth and blood have always been loyal to the Republican Party. They have never wavered. They have been sometimes treated shabbily in the party conventions, but that treatment did not weaken their allegiance to the party, and its principles. They have deserved well of the party and the party leaders. This fall they ask that one of their representatives shall be nominated for some important county office.</p>
   <p>They present two men, Mr. Erickson, a young man who has done splendid work in promoting the naturalization of his countrymen, and Mr. Nelson, who has served in the County Board most acceptably. The nomination of either for a country office will be acceptable to the Swedish American voters. They do not care to accept anything less. Their requests are modest. Their representations are modestly presented. The Republican leaders ought to use their influence to the end that they shall be favorably considered and acted on.</p>
   <p>It will be the height of folly to ignore the claims of this element. To grant their request will inspire them with enthusiasm for the ticket. It will give a wholesome stimulus to the naturalization movement amongst the Swedish, and will add from 1,000 to 1,500 good Republican names to the registry list of voters in the county. If the Republican leaders, in order to carry out some bargain to some chronic officeholder, or to "fix" a slate geographically for the benefit of bummers, or to "round out" a combine of spoilsmen, fail to satisfy the fair and just demands of the Swedish-American voters in Cook County this fall, they will invite and deserve defeat.</p>
   
   <p>The Republican leaders are enough, if they are brave and honest enough, to ignore the demands of the chronic office holders, and of the greedy, mangy curs who pack Republican conventions, and make deals and trades, and try to boss the party. The eight prominent gentlemen who have been selected as the representatives of the different sections of the party have the power, if they have the will, to present a ticket to the voters of Cook County which can win this fall. Having undertaken the task, they will be held to a strict accountability if they fail. And their most important duty will be to name a Swedish-American for some place on the county ticket. That will lead necessarily to other nominations which ought to be satisfactory.</p>
