   <p>Postmaster Fred Busse has now decided to run as candidate for Mayor in Chicago on the Republican ticket. He has been assured no other name would be mentioned for nomination at the Republican city convention meeting two weeks from today. President Theodore Roosevelt is said to have assured Mr. Busse that he could keep his position as postmaster during his political campaign, if he wished to do so. Mayor Dunne will probably be nominated by the Democrats, but Mr. Carter H. Harrison has also decided to appear as aspirant to the Mayor's chair in Chicago, seeking the Democratic nomination also.</p>
