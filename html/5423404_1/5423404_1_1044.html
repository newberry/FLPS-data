   <p>Blue prints and the cost of building the underground transportation system has been turned in by City Engineer John Ericson to the City Council. It is shown that Chicago can for the cost of $50,000,000 build a tube from Chicago Ave., and Orleans St., on the North to Twenty-Second St., and Wabash Ave., on the South and from Halsted St., on the West to Michigan Ave. The undertaking could be built in sections, and in this way the city would only have to pay out about $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 per year. The two deck system was dismissed by the engineer. The streets would be 66 feet to 100 feet wide, with double tracks. It is estimated that these lines could accommodate 86,000 passengers per hour. It is necessary, the report explains, to build this as soon as possible before the traffic becomes too large.</p>
