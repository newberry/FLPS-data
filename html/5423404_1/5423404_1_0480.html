   <p>The public now and then learns of a most despicable method used by some of the larger industries to get workers--a method which is even prohibited by law. We refer to the practice of importing workers from other countries. It is probable that in only one case out of a hundred is discovery made of the illegal means employed, and for this reason the matter is all the more serious, both as it concerns the foreigners that have been duped and the American workers.</p>
   <p>During the past few days, however, one case of the kind referred to has been brought to the attention of the public, and it is to be hoped that the firm which is so openly violating law and order will receive its deserved punishment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The attorney general of the United States has obtained clear evidence that the Ellsworth Coal Company of Ellsworth, Pennsylvania, has imported hundreds of coal miners from South Wales, by means of advertisements in the foreign press. In several newspapers in Wales the company had inserted the following announcement:</p>
   <p>"Wanted: Three thousand miners, in the State of Pennsylvania, America; lumberjacks, loaders, and machinists; wages from four to six dollars per day. Further information may be had from Jones Brothers, Craig Post Office, Pontypridd, South Wales.</p>
   <p>This attractive offer caused many miners to sell their furniture and house-hold goods and to migrate to Pennsylvania with the intention of getting work in the mines. Even on the first pay-day, those who were accepted realized that they had been fooled. The American workers for the company could <span class="page-break">\3</span>have told them long ago that such would be the case; for a company that only pays its regular workers about two dollars a day would hardly pay newcomers to the work two or three times that much for the same period.</p>
   <p>The heartlessness of this practice of enticing busy workers from their homes and hearths, from their opportunities of making a living, and luring them by false promises to a strange country can only find its parallel in the motive which prompted the act. And what was the motive? To defeat the miners' union which successfully fought the mine operators during the strike called some time ago. Realizing the impossibility of bringing about a split in the ranks of the union by the employment of American laborers, the coal barons turned to foreign lands and, with their false promises, prevailed upon the people there to leave their dear ones in order to take advantage of the possibilities of improving their lot in the Pennsylvania coal fields.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>If our country were in need of capable workers, and if coal mining was in danger of being suspended as a result of such a shortage of workers, then one might sympathize with the coal barons. But as long as not even the workers that have been with the mines for years have been given steady work, season after season, the action by the company is doubly reprehensible.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that the Ellsworth Company will be given a sentence that it will not be likely to forget.</p>
