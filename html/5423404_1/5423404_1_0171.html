   <p>p.12.......Yesterday a bill was proposed in the State Legislature wherein is asked $250,000.00 for the building of a new normal school in Chicago. The bill was produced by James A. Peterson a member of the school board, who deems the building of the new school a matter of very great importance.</p>
   <p>For the time being there is only one normal school in Chicago, and it is located in Englewood. Mr. Peterson takes the stand that the North and West side, also the Lake View and Jefferson students have far too great a distance to travel to this school. For many the trip takes a couple of hours or more in the morning and evening and besides the time which is wasted the trips are rather costly.</p>
   <p>Since most of the students are living in the areas mentioned, Mr. Peterson proposes that the new school be called Northwestern State Normal School, and be built in the North or West area.</p>
