   <p>Those who have made their purpose in life the singing of lamentations, those who say that practically all humanity consists of oppressed and plundered slaves and that only the introduction of common ownership can save us from finally starving to death, these predictors of disaster and song-writers of lamentation do not at all permit themselves to be convinced by the fact that "mankind" really goes forward economically.</p>
   <p>They see all through smoked glasses, and to them all appears dark and gloomy.</p>
   <p>Certainly nothing is perfect in the world, for since man himself is imperfect, he cannot fashion anything perfect. Those who say they have infallible means of making all mankind happy are only quacks who for a payment in one form or another seek to force upon others their patent medicines. All we can do is to correct as many disproportions as possible, but we cannot do this without a feeling of courage.</p>
