What is sadder than to meet a person who believes himself to be cultured and polite only because he or she possesses a certain readiness in song or music? The schools of our day have a great responsibility in this respect. The music-students should even study literature, history, a bit of psychology. Dr. Bartholomew's text book "Mental Science for music-students," is excellent for this purpose. May it be introduced and diligently used at least at all our Swedish-American institutions of learning.</p>
