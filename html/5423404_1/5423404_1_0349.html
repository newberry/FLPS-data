   <p>The Swedes in America like societies. This is clearly shown by the multitude of Swedish societies and orders existing in this country at the present time, organizations which compare favorably with those of genuine American origin, both economically and in their cultural development. The Swedish societies may not boast of as many members as the American societies, but this is caused, naturally, by a lesser number of Swedes in this country.</p>
   <p>In certain circles, the thought has been discussed of uniting all the various organizations under one central association to comprise all the states in which there is a large Swedish population. The realization of this thought is still a matter of the future, yet a great step has been taken towards the forming of an association as mentioned.</p>
   <p>About a year ago, the Swedish Aid and Unity Society of America sent out a call through the Swedish-American press to all the Scandinavian orders in the United States to take the idea of union under consideration, and to send delegates to a meeting announced to be held in St. Louis. The Association sending this call to union has its headquarters in Michigan, and its field of operation covers the northwest. A number of organizations in the east, the west, and the northwest took account of the exhortations in the press, and plans were made and preliminary programs drawn up for such a central organization which is certain to be formed sometime this Fall.</p>
   <p>The societies represented at the meeting in St. Louis have held their annual meetings and adopted the reports of their St. Louis delegates.</p>
   <p>The idea is attractive and worthwhile; it is also capable of execution. In this effort at union, there is no attempt to intrude upon the methods or activities of the various societies, or to alter their by-laws. What is intended is simply to form an organization consisting of delegates from the existing societies or orders, at the meeting of which plans may be formed for the common benefit of all. Cooperation thus brought about will doubtlessly bring good results. Besides increasing the efforts of the individual societies for worthwhile accomplishments, the union may serve, we hope, to give heavy blows to the often commented on jealousy among the Swedes.</p>
   <p>The need for self-preservation demands that the Scandinavian societies organize into an association as here indicated, and build it on a basis to make it possible for all societies with related aims to join. We Scandinavians become Americanized very soon, yet, even to death the customs and the languages we learned in the land of our birth cling to us. In order to guard the things which differentiate us from other nationalities in this country, we must stand strong, and strength is won through union. On the day when the language of our fathers is forgotten in our societies as in our homes, on that day Scandinavian associations in America have ceased to exist. Let no one imagine that he who does not value and love his mother tongue will thrive and feel at home in a Scandinavian society; he will prefer the American type.</p>
   <p>For this reason, we who wish to remember, we who wish to enjoy this rich, vigorous language, must work for the idea of a central association.</p>
   
   <p>We note with regret that the two Swedish orders which have their head-quarters in Chicago, the Svithiod and the Vikings, were not represented at the meeting in St. Louis. why, we do not know. Perhaps, they imagined themselves strong enough to stand alone. One thing is certain, however, they will lose nothing by adapting the idea and work for its realization.  </p>
