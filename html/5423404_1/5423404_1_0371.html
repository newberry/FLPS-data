   <p>If the terrible should really happen in the future that Russia takes Sweden, she will still not take Swedish-America. One third of the Swedes in the world already live in America, and over them Russia will have no power. She will not expose herself to the claws of the American eagle. Who knows if Swedish culture, education, language, belief, etc. just in America is not beginning to receive permanence which perhaps can be compared with just Sweden's? Perhaps one at home, through helping us now, helps himself in the future. Who knows? But Swedish-Americanism can never be wholly the same as "Swedishism."</p>
   <p>This is also pointed out by Dr. Gustaf Andreen, president of the Augustana Synod. The Svenska Kuriren's standpoint that we as quickly as possible become only Americans, and Hemlandet's (The Homeland) that we as much as possible, become only truly Swedish, are both one-sided. The Synod president's standpoint is this: it appears that the Swedish <span class="page-break">\2</span>people transplanted will become transformed; it will become something new. We are Americans, but just the same Swedes. The literature which flowers among us, the manner of thought, manners (traditions) and customs, the outlook which obtains all is made new, made young. It cannot come about that a little Sweden will be built in America; Swedish-America must be part of just America.</p>
   <p>For this reason the Swedes at home may not judge us only from the Swedish viewpoint. They should put themselves in our place, and later with Thorild, judge all after its quality. Thereby we shall better understand and better help each other.</p>
