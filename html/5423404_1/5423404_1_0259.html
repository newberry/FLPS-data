   <p>One day of happiness was the lot of one of our Chicago Swedes. Becoming Mrs. John Sundberg yesterday, she fainted today, when advised that Sundberg had a wife and children in Sweden. This seemed unbelievable, but when confronted by his wife for one day, he admitted that the accusation was true.</p>
   <p>Johanna Sundberg, a cousin of the bigamist, swore out a warrant for John Sundberg, who was immediately arrested.</p>
   <p>At the East Chicago Avenue police station, he made the following confession: He left Sweden for America, hoping to save enough money to buy a home and in order to bring his family here. During the first two years he wrote his family regularly. After two years, he wrote no more. Yesterday he married, committing bigamy; today he is under arrest.</p>
