   <p>Republicans, Progressives, and independent voters of Chicago have decided to co-operate during the coming mayoralty election here. The plan is excellent, and the fact that influential people of differing political opinions are able to disregard party considerations and pool their resources for a common purpose is an encouraging sign of the times, indicating, as it does, the prevalence of independent thinking and a realization that party politics is at times contrary to the common weal. In this enlightened age political bigwigs may no longer count on slave-like obedience by the electorate, and particularly in municipal politics it is often desirable that party loyalties be discarded.</p>
   <p>The fusionists here in Chicago acted wisely in selecting Chief Justice Harry Olson as their candidate for mayor. Judge Olson is a man of unquestioned <span class="page-break">2</span>personal integrity and proven ability, and enjoys the confidence of the general public. He is a Republican but not a narrow-minded party man, and his victories at previous elections, even when other Republican candidates were defeated all around him, are testimony of his great popularity.</p>
