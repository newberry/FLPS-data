   <p>In last week's issue of this newspaper, we published an article written by Professor A.A.Stomberg of the University of Minnesota. The Professor discussed the study of the Swedish language in our schools, with particular reference to the University of Minnesota.</p>
   <p>It gave us great pleasure to receive, read, and print this article, for Professor Stomberg is perhaps better qualified than anyone else to speak with authority on the subject.</p>
   <p>His message is of great interest to Swedish-Americans even to those who prefer to remain neutral in regard to the language question.</p>
   <p>Professor Stomberg's statements are of special interest to Swedish-American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>parents, and to their children in our high schools and colleges. He presents the advantages of knowing the Swedish language; he also gives a number of reasons--practical as well as sentimental--why it should be studied by all persons of Swedish descent. He declares that to do so is not at all a waste of time. In Minnesota, for example, the Scandinavian languages enjoy equality with all the other language groups. There, knowledge of Swedish is a valuable asset, both in scientific work and in business. It is significant that in the newly established School of Business at the University of Minnesota, Swedish is placed on an equal footing with the other great languages.</p>
   <p>In a convincing manner Professor Stomberg points to the desirability, if not the necessity, of studying the Nordic languages. The literature and culture of the Northern countries have much to give to the world. This is well known among the educated classes.</p>
   <p>For the reasons mentioned and for many other reasons not mentioned, it should <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>be clear to youth of Swedish descent that it is in their own interest to learn the language of their fathers. For most of them it should be easy; they learn the fundamentals at home, and in a very short time they gain a fine command of the language. Many a student, after finishing his linguistic studies, finds that he has made a mistake by neglecting Swedish; but then it is usually too late to do anything about it.</p>
   <p>Professor Stomberg's excellent article performs a double service. In the first place, it delivers a telling blow to "know-nothingism", and secondly, it reminds Swedish-American parents, and youth that in their Swedish language, culture, and tradition they have a valuable heritage which they cannot afford to dissipate.</p>
