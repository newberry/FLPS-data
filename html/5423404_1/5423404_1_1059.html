   <p>The arrival last week at Chicago of the Norwegian steamer Wergeland naturally gave cause for festivities and other expressions of joy - all of which we deem very proper - although Wergeland is neither the first Norwegian sea-going vessel nor the first foreign steamer that has made its appearance in the harbor of Chicago. However, after these expressions of hilarity have waned and the glamor of festivity faded away to make room for the sordidness of everyday life, this welcome visit from afar should not be forgotten. This incident should, instead, serve as food for thought even with those, who rarely go to the trouble of using their reasoning faculties, and even with our honorable congressmen and the so-called "political leaders", who are enjoying the self-assumed authority to select "the people's" representatives in the Capitol at Washington.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably the arrival and visit here of the Norwegian merchant vessel Wergeland institutes a strong reminder of Chicago's need of a direct waterway connection with European harbors. It forcefully brings home the necessity of the doing away with the costly and time-wasting reloading procedures and the high freight rates on the railroads, which now form a part of waterway shipping from foreign parts. The present transportation arrangements of reloading at New York, followed by expensive freighting of goods of Scandinavian and other European origin intended for consumption in the States of the Middle West and the West, is ridiculous. Such a procedure adds to the cost of the goods to the consumer.</p>
   
   <p>On the other hand consider that customs duties are the same, whether the goods are unloaded in New York or the importations go to Chicago direct.</p>
   <p>The very circumstance that the owners of Wergeland did not make any money on this trip is an undeniable proof of the fact that the canals linking the St. Lawrence River with the Great Lakes are not of sufficient depth. If they had been only a few feet deeper, the Wergeland would not have had to unload a part of her cargo at Montreal, in order to take on the same load again at Kingston. It goes without saying that the unloading and reloading processes, together with the rail freight charges between these two points, devoured all the profit that otherwise might have accrued.</p>
   <p>Adequate and sufficiently deep waterway connections between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes should be a goal, toward which all the representatives in Congress from the Western States should work unceasingly. They should be made to know that this is a matter of vital interest to the populations of the great West and Northwest, inasmuch as the lack of such a waterway increases the costs of many of the essentials of life and at the same time reduces the prices on their own products for shipment to Europe.</p>
   <p>We fully realize that the interests of the big railroad companies are diametrically opposed to those of the people, but our representatives in Congress should bear in mind that they are there primarily for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the people. If they run the errands of the railroads, then they fail shamefully in their duties to their constituents. If they persistantly fail in their duties, new congressmen should be elected in their stead. In addition, the City Council of Chicago should, at each new session of Congress, petition the Federal Government at Washington concerning legislative measures for the inauguration of deepening the St. Lawrence - Great Lakes waterway as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>Translator's Note: In the May 18 issue of the Svenska Tribunen there was a brief news item of following contents:</p>
   <p>"WATERWAY SHIPPING BETWEEN NORWAY AND CHICAGO. The steamer "Wergeland" at present is riding the waves somewhere on the Great Lakes on her journey from Tonsberg, Norway, direct to Chicago. She is carrying a cargo of 3000 pounds of salt fish and cod-liver oil."</p>
