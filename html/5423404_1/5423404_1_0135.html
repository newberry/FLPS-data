   <p>Registration in this fine Swedish educational institution is now going on. The new term opens September 7. The catalogue of the school gives information about such matters as courses, living accomodations, possibilities for work during the school term, vocational advice, and so on.</p>
   <p>More than half of the students that attended the institution last year earned all or part of their expenses by working at jobs of various kinds. The young men earned their way by working as guards on the elevated railroad, as watchmen in buildings, and at similar jobs; while girl students earned their room and board by working as maids in homes, by doing office work, or at other jobs for which young women are particularly well adapted. This goes to show what fine opportunities this school offers for young people who are ambitious and willing to work hard for an education.</p>
   <p>Dr. David Nyvall, the able head of the institution, is at this time visiting among the mission congregations in the state of Kansas. Professor C. J. Wilson, an associate of the school, has just returned from a trip through Iowa and Nebraska. Both of them report that Swedish-Americans throughout the Middle West show a great and active interest in this fine Swedish educational institution, the North Park College.</p>
   <p>An unusually large number of inquiries have come in during the summer from prospective students from Middle Western states; and the coming school year, the thirtieth in the history of the school, promises to be a great one.</p>
