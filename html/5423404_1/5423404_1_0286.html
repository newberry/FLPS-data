   <p>In a letter to the editor one of our readers, Mr. J. F. Mozart, proposes that a meeting of Scandinavians in Chicago be called for the purpose of discussing matters of mutual interest. We quote from the letter:</p>
   <p>"Most of us Swedish-Americans are interested in following the developments in Sweden. The meeting of the three Scandinavian kings in Malmo is undoubtedly of great significance for their respective countries, but except for a few brief dispatches in the press, not much attention has been given it here. Why is this?</p>
   <p>"Seldom has a rapprochement of the Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish nations been more opportune, and it may have an important bearing on their future. The Swedish king, Gustaf V, called the meeting at Malmo. Who is going to take the initiative for a Scandinavian meeting here in Chicago?"</p>
