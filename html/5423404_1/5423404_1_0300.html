   <p>The Swedish press is at present stirred up in regard to an address the Governor of Minnesota, A.O. Eberhart, has made at Stillwater, Minn., where he is said to have recommended that the Swedish language be abolished at the church services conducted by the Augustane Synod Ministers and also in the Synod's schools. The same papers state that great indignation prevails among the Swedes in America on account of Governor Eberhart's statement.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Kuriren read in a Minneapolis newspaper recently about the governor's speech in the matter, and is of the opinion that he recommended the use of the English language at the Augustane Synod church services in order to draw the younger generation to these churches and services.</p>
   <p>Everybody here knows that the English language is the mother tongue for the second generation. The young people speak English, and think in English. But it was not mentioned in newspaper that Governor Eberhart had recommended that the Swedish language should be omitted in the Synod's schools. The governor, himself, is very fond of the Swedish language. We, therefore, doubt that he really had said anything concerning the Synod's school in the matter.</p>
   <p>It is very easy for the newspapers in Sweden to talk about such things, and to be stirred up over the fact that the Swedish language is not better cared for in America, and that the second generation is not educated in the Swedish language. But the upgrowing generation be it children of Swedish, Norwegian, German, Polish, or Italian, parentage, will be Americans, and not Swedes, Norwegians, etc. The Swedish language is decreasing in value at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois. This is the truth, even if it is not pleasant to hear it in Sweden. The directors of a college in America must consider the wishes of those who want to be educated there. The directors cannot, in the interest of the college, enforce teaching a subject nobody wants to study. But we are pleased to say there is a society at the Augustana College in which the Swedish language is used in the conversation between its members. This society is under the direction of the president of the college.</p>
   <p>It is a fact, which is to be regretted, but which cannot be changed, the upgrowing Swedish-Americans prefer English to Swedish, and the majority of young people do not want the Swedish language at all.</p>
