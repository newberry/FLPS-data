   <p>Last week one hundred fifty shoe workers at the Selz-Schwab and Company shoe factory went on strike, and it is expected that fifteen hundred other employes of the company will do the same. The strikers belong to the Industrial Workers of the World. The majority of the strikers are Nordics, and the press committee has sent a letter through Mr. A. Wickstrom, a member of the committee, which reads as follows: "The Nordics in Chicago wish to announce that a strike broke out in the firm of Selz-Schwab and Company who manufacture shoes under the trade name, "Royal Blue" and "Perfects," well-known brands. Fifteen hundred workers, will soon lay down their work, demanding higher wages, and we believe it is the duty of every Swedish man and woman to support this strike. The management of the above mentioned Company has made it unusually difficult for the workers during the last year. Many have been unable to earn more than $5.00 a week, and on this small pay their wives and children must exist. It has been difficult during the summer, but it will be worse during the winter when other life-sustaining necessities are required, such as coal, etc. Help us win this just strike. We need financial support. The headquarters of the strikers are at 55 North Clark Street. You may send any donations you desire, and address your letters to Mr. A. Wickstrom, or Mr. Albert Simpson.</p>
   <p>Mass meetings have been held, and others will follow. The next one will be December 27, in Brand's Hall on Clark Street.</p>
