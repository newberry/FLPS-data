   <p>Secretary of Commerce Hoover, who has called a national conference for the purpose of discussing the unemployment situation. It is possible that this conference will lead to some effective action, but in view of the [slight] <span class="page-break">2</span> benefits accruing [to the workers] from similar conferences in the past, we confess that we do not expect much of it. What can such a conference do? What means has it at its disposal for putting into operation such decisions as it may make, and such measures as may be proposed for the alleviation of suffering among the unemployed?</p>
   <p>There are throughout the country a great number of public improvement projects which ought to be started and completed, but the Government at the moment is unable to finance them. When Congress convenes next month, ways and means of starting public improvement works may come up for consideration, but it is safe to say that months will pass before any definite proposals will come to a decisive vote, and by that time winter, which is the hardest time for the unemployed, will be practically over.</p>
   <p>A large percentage of the unemployed are war veterans, and government spokesmen declared recently that if the proposed bonus should be paid to them now, the treasury would go broke.</p>
