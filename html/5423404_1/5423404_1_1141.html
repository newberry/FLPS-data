   <p>John A. Linn, former clerk of the Circuit Court, died last Saturday in his home at 426 West Division Street. Linn was born in Sweden in 1849, came to America at an early age and settled in Chicago, where he soon became active in politics and municipal affairs.</p>
   <p>He worked first for the water department, later with the police department, and in 1885 he became Alderman of the old Seventeenth Ward. In 1894 he was elected County Commissioner, and in 1896 Clerk of the Superior Court, to which office he was reelected four years later. In 1904 he became notary of the Circuit Court from which post he was removed two years later, due to irregularities in his accounts.</p>
   <p>The two last years of his life he spent in retirement, which was to some degree lightened by those of his old friends who did not desert him in his misfortune. These friends declare that he died of a broken heart.</p>
