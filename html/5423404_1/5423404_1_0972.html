   <p>The Swedish-American Republican Club of Cook County arranged a "Sympathy banquet" last Thursday at the Swedish Club for those candidates on the Republican ticket, who either won or failed at the last election. Attorney Alfred A. Norton acted as toastmaster. Alderman John Kiellander was the first speaker, and was followed by several others. The general opinion was that such banquets should be held often.</p>
