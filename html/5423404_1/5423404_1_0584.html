   <p>In this age of labor unions it happens frequently that victory-drunk labor leaders present propositions which are the products of points of view far removed from common sense. Thus the other day Secretary Turley of the drivers national union expressed his opinion that the soldiers ought to organize, and that their organization ought to become affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. He says: "The soldiers are workers, and I consider it entirely proper that they form a labor organization and stand together for the protection of their rights. Why not? Does anybody believe for a moment that they would refuse to go to war against foreign foes because they were organized?"</p>
   <p>We are going to reply to the question of this young, soft-brained fellow. First we are compelled to refute his assertion that soldiers are workers.</p>
    <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a><p>In order to be worthy of the name worker, it is generally considered nevessary that the aspirant to the title be producing something of value. If anyone can prove to us that the soldiers of any country at all are producing anything but misery and death, then we are ready to accede to Mr. Turley's claim that soldiers are workers. Assuming that some clever fellow could present the required proof, we shall answer Mr. Turley's question. Let it be assumed that soldiers are workers and belong to a labor union, abiding by the principles maintained by the class-conscious worker. According to these principles, every son of toil is a brother and a friend. Following the principles of labor unionism they would necessarily refuse to go to war against soldiers from other countries who under a similar assumption would also be workers and consequently brothers and friends. We assist striking workers in other countries with money now, and to be consistent, we must also assist striking soldier-workers, thereby weakening the defense of our own country while strengthening that of other countries. We suppose that Mr. Turley when looking at the matter from this point of view, will acknowledge tht he was shortsighted in his desire to
    <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>organize his "soldier-workers".</p>
    <p>On the occasion mentioned, Mr. Turley also spoke in favor of labor organizations for mailmen and other servants of government. Here again he made a false move. We form unions of the workers in order that they may be able, through collective action, to gain a better living and to defend themselves against unjust and arbitrary treatment by employers. But the servants of the government will hardly need organization for such a purpose. The mailmen cannot be dismissed from their jobs except on investigation and trial, and their wages are not reduced, rather they are increased. If all the workers had as just and reasonable employers as the letter carriers, there would be need of labor unions.</p>
