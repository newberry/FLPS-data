   <p>The Republican primary election will be held in the city next Friday, March 1. It is at the primary that it is necessary to have ones eyes open to see to it that the right delegates are chosen in the city convention and to support good candidates. Afterward it is too late to try to do anything.</p>
   <p>It cannot be inculcated enough that only the primary gives desirable men the opportunity to give their party their moral support. It is civic duty to select good candicates and this end cannot be entrusted to others, than delegates for the right, who can be depended upon. Each one should therefore help to nominate the right delegates to the convention. The winning or losing of the party depends on these means and judgments.</p>
