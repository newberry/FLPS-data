   <p>Without a doubt, there is at the present considerable unemployment in the country. Such a situation is always bound to be a source of uneasiness and apprehension. At the present time, there is a real danger at hand as a result of the singular circumstance which the world-shaking War has created in almost every country the world over.</p>
   <p>Certainly, we have been spared most of the horrors of War, more than other nations. One can also say that America has suffered less from the War than any other of the nations participating therein. However, one should not forget to add the significant reservation, heretofore. For it is only <span class="page-break">2</span>apparent, both in consideration of time and place, that we have avoided serious consequences of the War. On the day of reckoning, our account will in all certainty be greater than that of any other country.</p>
   <p>How will it be possible to pass from a state of War to one of peace without great changes in employment? The War created a scarcity of workers, partly because millions were called to active War service, and partly because the manufacture of War materials necessitated increased labor power. All of a sudden, the situation changed. Soldiers by the thousands were released from military service, and work in the munitions factories stopped abruptly.</p>
   <p>The grand promises of available positions for those who left their peace-time <span class="page-break">3</span>occupations for War service, proved to be without foundation, partly due to prevailing circumstances, and partly because they were materially impossible to fulfill. In many cases, the employers had found that the new circumstances to which they had been forced to adjust themselves were more or less agreeable. To return at once to a pre-War system of work division, which was prevalent before the War, would involve great trouble. There would be too big an increase of expenses without the slightest guarantee of an equivalent increase in income. The mass discharges of soldiers and recruits, without giving them a suitable recompense so that they could reestablish themselves to normal functions in society, naturally created an over-supply of labor which, in turn, resulted in a serious unemployment situation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>For the employers, there is an ulterior reason to be careful even if this policy is in conflict with their humanitarian feelings. Wages have been forced up to such heights during the days of the War that they cannot be maintained by the employers who are liable to all the risks which economic conditions and peace-time competition create.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, the surplus of labor constitutes no serious problem. The States must take care of the discharged soldiers. The outlay for the support of the soldiers for a few months would be insignificant compared with War-costs. And it would be but simple injustice to expect satisfaction as a result.</p>
   <p>The necessary lowering of wages is certainly a more difficult problem. But the way to its solution is clear. No injustice will be done when a lowering <span class="page-break">5</span>of wages is followed by a corresponding increase in buying power. In other words, when the prices of food and other necessities have returned to normal, the main reason for the increase in wages has disappeared. The main reason for a fall in wages is, of course, the increased number of work seekers. Against this, no laws regarding minimum wages, no prescripts by unions, can long struggle victoriously.</p>
   <p>If one realizes these basic truths, then one has also the simplest solution of the immigration question. A bill has been introduced in Congress to stop the influx of foreign labor for four years. It is our conviction that the present crisis in the labor situation will not last the year out. During the remaining months of the year, (1919) the present domestic labor will be absorbed, though <span class="page-break">6</span>naturally, not at the same wages as have been paid by the munitions factories. But if we only give our employers an opportunity to catch their breath, so to speak, it will soon be shown that the demand for workers will be greater than the supply, and that, therefore, both wages and the price of necessities will be maintained in reasonable relationship.</p>
   <p>Inside of a year, there should be a considerable lack of unskilled labor, a lack which can be filled only by the importation of foreign labor. If this lack is not filled, American workers will suffer. This, they will soon see themselves.</p>
   <p>We doubt, therefore, the need, or even the wisdom of a law limiting immigration. But we are nevertheless convinced that we preach to deaf ears, and that such <span class="page-break">7</span>a law will soon be enacted. Let it come and prove its worth. In a free country, one does not need to fear an iniquitous law, because it invalidates itself.</p>
   <p>What we have stated above, and all that can be said with reference to the regulation of the labor market in the United States, depends on our quickest possible return to Republican principles, so that the American labor market is again protected by suitable import levies on all articles which can be manufactured in this country.</p>
