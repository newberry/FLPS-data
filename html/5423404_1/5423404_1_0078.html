   <p>Sometime ago, Professor Sigurd Anker of Blair College, Nebraska, wrote to William E. Curtis, complaining that children of Scandinavian parents in America were only slightly interested in education. Mr. Curtis is a newspaperman, well-known among Swedish-Americans because of his travels in Scandinavia.</p>
   <p>On receiving the letter from Mr. Anker, he did not know what to think of such an accusation, so he wrote to the presidents of some of the high schools an universities in the Northwest, asking their opinions in the matter [Translator's note: Replies from six educators from as many states are recorded in the editorial. All of them express similar opinions. The two given below, indicative of the scholastic attitude of the Scandinavians in two states where they were present in considerable numbers, are also indicative <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the replies given by the rest of the educators quoted in the editorial.] J. W. Olson, State superintendent of education in Minnesota answers:</p>
   <p>"The secretary of Minnesota State University expresses his opinion that about one-third of the students registered at the school are of Nordic descent. Having conferred with men acquainted with the facts concerned, I am inclined to believe that about the same percentage at the high schools in the state are of the same blood. The Swedes have Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, Minnesota; the Norwegians have St. Olav College, Northfield, Minnesota. The Scandinavians also have two theological schools, and about a dozen preparatory schools for the universities. In my opinion, the high schools located in the Scandinavian districts are doing as good work as the high schools in other districts, and are supported as readily and as well."</p>
   <p>W. L. Stockwell, state superintendent of education in North Dakota says: "As to the Scandinavians in North Dakota, there is no class of the population which is more eager for education than they. The Scandinavian youth, Swedes, Norwegian, <span class="page-break">\3</span>Danes, Icelanders, crowd our public schools, our high schools, and our universities. I feel safe in stating that full forty per cent of those who receive instruction in our educational institutions are of Scandinavian descent."</p>
   <p>Professor Sigurd Anker should study his figures once more before he attempts to have his estimates recognized.</p>
