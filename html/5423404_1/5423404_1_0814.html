   <p>Earlier this month a Scandinavian Socialist convention was held in Chicago which was attended by delegates from several Middle Western states. The following Chicago organizations were represented: the Twelfth Ward Scandinavian Socialist Club, by Emil Faernquist; the Seventeenth Ward Scandinavian Club, by Claus Nicoll and Georg Olson; the Karl Marx Club, by A. W. Malmquist and Thorwald Jensen; the Lake View Scandinavian Club, by Karl Bergstrom; the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society, by John C. Hansen; the Scandinavian Social-Democratic Sick Benefit Association of 1895, by F. Andersen and R. Hansen-Stenhill; the Scandinavian Socialistic Propaganda Committee, by R. F. Holm, Steffen Christensen, and N. Juel Christensen; the Scandinavian Socialist Club Norden of Evanston, by John Nordlund and William Olson.</p>
   <p>The organization of a country-wide Scandinavian Socialist League has been under consideration for a long time, and this question was taken up at the convention. It was agreed that the formation of such a league would signify an important <span class="page-break">\2</span>forward step and promote Scandinavian unity in matters affecting the Socialistic movement. The desirability of League control of the Scandinavian-American Socialistic press was pointed out by several speakers. A committee was appointed to draw up preparatory plans for such a nationwide organization. The Chicago members of this committee were T. Jensen and N. J. Christensen.</p>
