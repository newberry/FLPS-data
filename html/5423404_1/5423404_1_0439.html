   <p>Many American industrial plants are running twenty-four hours a day, including Sunday. This may be necessary in some cases, but the bad part of it is that they operate with only two shifts of workers. The night shift usually works thirteen hours, and the day shift eleven. The pay is poor, the homes of the workers are poor, and their manner of living is poor and dreary. It happens quite often that the men go to sleep on the job out of sheer exhaustion.</p>
   <p>These people may truthfully be called slaves. On election day they vote as their foreman tells them to vote. The factory owns them body and soul. There is hardly time for them to eat and sleep, and no time at all for recreation. The job pays them enough to keep body and soul together so that they can keep on working-and nothing more.</p>
   <p>Can any thinking person deny that these unfortunate people are living in a state of slavery?</p>
