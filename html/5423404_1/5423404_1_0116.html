   <p>The daily papers tell about an eight year old Swedish-American child, who teaches French to students ten and twenty years older than herself. She attends to her duties in all seriousness. When the day's toil is done, she goes for a horseback ride in Jackson Park; this is her ideal recreation. She is the daughter of Professor Torild Arnoldson, of Utah State University, at Salt Lake City, and granddaughter of the late editor, peace advocate, and Nobel Prize winner, K. P. Arnoldson. She, together with her mother, who studies at the University of Chicago, lives with her grandmother at 5496 Dorchester Avenue, Chicago.</p>
