   <p>A verdict of "not guilty" was returned last Saturday by the jury in the case of Wright, McCabe and Phelan, who were charged with the murder, on July 5 last, of our countryman, Axel Lund. This verdict of exoneration comes as as unexpected, and, at the same time, disgusting surprise to all those who had been childish enough to believe that justice would take its course, even though the criminals were Irishmen. This verdict is a farce and an outrage! If it no longer constitutes evidence of guilt and criminality, when a man in an open street is shot through his heart and then robbed, all this in the presence of two eye-witnesses; and when one considers further that the criminal is caught immediately thereafter with blood-besmirched coins in his pants-pockets, then one might question the value and use of having judges and a police force and paying them salaries. The only recourse, it now seems, is to carry a gun for the protection of one's life and property; although it is very doubtful if anyone except the Irish will be permitted to use this weapon without getting punished. But, at any rate, one would much rather run the risk of spending a few years in jail than to take a chance of being shot down like a dog by this abominable type of street marauders, who prey upon the public; and in their desire for a few dollars seem to have no regard for human life. <span class="page-break">2</span>A large gathering of friends and fellow-countrymen of the accused trio thronged the courtroom last Saturday, and sent up a jubilant howl when the verdict was announced. In the name of decency it must be said that this verdict of exoneration constitutes an indirect and an <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the privilege enjoyed by these sons of Erin to murder and plunder citizens of other nationalities without being brought to justice. If this crime had been committed and the trial taken place in the South, and the victim had been a Yankee, these murderers would long ago have hung as ornaments from a tree limb or a light post. Here they are exonerated and set at liberty to resume their dishonorable deeds.</p>
