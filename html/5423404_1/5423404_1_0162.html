   <p>The Chicago night Schools opened yesterday and we take the opportunity to urge our adult Swedes to enroll, especially in the department teaching English. In another department is taught what our boys and girls learn in the public schools, while the third department offers instruction in technical subjects. To encourage our Swedish men and women we pass this statement: In the Washington Evening School during the last two years, three hundred of our countrymen were greatly benefited by the instruction they have received in speaking, reading, and writing English. No minors are allowed in the evening classes and these classes are free.</p>
   <p>Transportation to these classes is very direct. Take Grand Avenue or Milwaukee Avenue to Morgan and there you are.</p>
