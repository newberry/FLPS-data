   <p>The proposal of a Swedish-American Line is not new. It has been discussed for many years. R. Lundgren, steamship owner from Gothenburg, Sweden, and very much interested in the matter, is in the United States at present. His plan is to start one Swedish and one American steamship company. Each company should build and place one modern steamship on the new line of the 10,000 ton type. A capital of 25,000,000 Swedish kroner is necessary to build the steamships and to met other expenses involved. It is expected that both Swedish emigrants and those who are homebound would prefer a direct line. Our best wishes for a successful start!</p>
