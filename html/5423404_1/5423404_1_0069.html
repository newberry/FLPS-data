   <p>At the Chicago Commons last week a number of graduates were credited with having solved the problem of living. They have learned how to manage a household skillfully on a ten dollar income, with enough left over for clothes, carfare, and numerous other expenses.</p>
   <p>These young ladies learned nothing about the art of cooking, buying necessary furniture, or serving tasty meals.</p>
   <p>We regret to advise that several of these educated fools are of Swedish descent. We report the following: Carrie Hansen, Emma Erickson, Jennie Solberg, Mabel Hansen, and Christine Thompson.</p>
   <p>To our readers:- Do not mistake this article for a matrimonial advertisement, it is only a news item. We feel that the entire Swedish colony will find it as distasteful as we did.</p>
