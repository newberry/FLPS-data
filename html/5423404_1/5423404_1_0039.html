   <p>The Scandinavian department of the International Students' Association has made arrangements for a "Scandinavian evening," and the event will take place in Mandel Hall of the University of Chicago next Friday evening, beginning at eight o'clock.</p>
   <p>Siri Nordin is chairman of the Committee on arrangements, and to all appearances the program will be very interesting. Representatives of the Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Icelandic nationalities will take part in it. The singing will be taken care of by the well-known Orion Male Quartet, two members of which, Joseph Blomgren and Hjalmar Ebbeson, will also render selections from "Gluntarne," accompanied on the piano by Mr. Ebbeson's daughter Margaret. [Translator's note: "Gluntarne" is a long, continuous series of Swedish heroic poetry, set to music, and highly regarded by Scandinavians, as well as by all other lovers of this type of expression.]</p>

   <p>The program includes a demonstration of Danish gymnastics, especially the system developed by Niels Buk, and also Norwegian national dances, Icelandic folk songs, and violin music. The affair will wind up with a dance, to which everybody is invited.</p>
   <p>Mandel Hall is located at University Avenue and 57th Street.</p>
