   <p>Last Friday at 2:30 A.M. two-hundred fifty of Western Union Telegraph Company operators went on strike.  The strike was not sanctioned by the national organization heads; it was declared that it was against their orders.  It was called in sympathy for the union members in Los Angeles, California who were compelled to quit work. The company had filled their positions with strike breakers while the union members' difficulties were being discussed.</p>
   <p>The operators in Chicago wished to know if strike breakers were employed in Los Angeles; Chicago sent a telegram, and received immediately the word to go home,from the Chief Operator.  Other men were called to accept the telegram from Los Angeles. By midnight one-hundred operators had been sent home, and the strike was declared. Only four persons remained at work. Later in the day the Postal Telegraph Company operators joined the Western Union strikers.</p>

   <p>In how many cities the Chicago operators example was followed could not be learned until on Saturday at which time it could be clearly understood that the same feeling existed among the operators in Kansas City, Cleveland, Cincinatti, Helena, Salt Lake City, Dallas, New Orleans, Colorado Springs, Spokane, Birmingham, Butte, El Paso and Denver. In these cities eleven states were represented. On Friday the number of strikers mounted to 2,360. Only forty operators stayed on the job. Here in Chicago they were 1,400 strong. It is only here and in New Orleans that the Postal Telegraph Company has been drawn into the conflict, as it is really only the Western Union whose union is involved. The only lines the union allows to be operated are those carrying newspaper articles.</p>
