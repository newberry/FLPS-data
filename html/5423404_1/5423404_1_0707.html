   <p>The cooperative temperance cafe "Idrott" announces that a branch restaurant, will be opened at 5248 N. Clark Street a week from Saturday, Sept. 20th. The new place will have facilities for the public similar to the original at 3206 Wilton Avenue, although they will be on a smaller scale. They will comprise reading rooms, library, etc.</p>
   <p>The increased migration of the Swedish people northward, from Lake View to Edgewater, Summerdale and Rogers Park, makes this addition very desirable.</p>
