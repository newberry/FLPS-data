   <p>The Swedish American Republican Club in the 25th Ward was organized at a meeting Wednesday at the Republican Headquarters, Broadway and Larence Ave....Officers were elected, and it was decided to distribute membership blanks to anyone interested in the worthy objective of the club. The club resolved that it is to the advantage of the city as a whole as well as for the Swedish-Americans of Ward 25 that Wm. Hale Thompson be elected to direct the affairs of the city, and for this reason his candidacy for mayor was endorsed. This was done by acclamation and under thunderous applause by the two-hundred Swedish-Americans present.</p>
