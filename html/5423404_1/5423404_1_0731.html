   <p>During periods when business activity is slow, and when private enterprise is not operating on a normal scale, public works should be undertaken. That is just the time for completing projects which will have to be done sooner or later anyway. Such work may well be postponed during more active periods when business is expanding, in order not to compete with private enterprise in the demand for labor and capital. Such procedure is simply logical, and is being advocated by the Social-Democratic newspaper Nytid (New Times). The paper declares that such a policy would be wise and to the advantage of all; but when it comes to its practical application disagreement arises, and when someone demands action he meets plenty of opposition. Opponents of the scheme then insist that the state must not monopolize capital, for to do so will tend to paralyze private enterprise, which needs the capital if it is to start industry moving and employ labor for the production of goods. These people fail to see that during a period of depression private initiative is unable to become active even if capital is readily available.</p>
   <p>But it is, of course, of the utmost importance that the public works which are undertaken be productive and useful. They must be of the kind that will benefit the community and the nation and tend to stimulate private activity.</p>
