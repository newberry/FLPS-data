   <p>As an example of the general inaccuracy of the statements made by, and the information contained in, the American newspapers, we are quoting excerpts from an article published in a recent issue of "The Financier", a journal of finance and commerce.</p>
   <p>This paper says that the first savings banks in Europe were those instituted in Belgium in 1869. This paper goes on to say that savings banks came into existence in France in 1883, in Hungary in 1886, in Italy in 1875, and in Sweden only ten years ago. But that is not all. It makes the further claim that Europe has imitated the American system of savings banks.</p>
   <p>Now, if the writer, who prepared this ill-smelling concoction for the glorification of our big American financiers, had gone to the trouble of consulting an encyclopedia, he would have found that savings banks were proposed and suggested in Europe by the great Daniel Defoe as early as 1697. He also would have found that such banks were founded in great numbers in several of the European countries during the latter half of the eighteenth century; and, as far as Sweden is concerned, the first savings bank in that country was founded over seventy years ago, inasmuch as the first Swedish bank of that type was founded in the City of Gothenburg in the year 1820.</p>
