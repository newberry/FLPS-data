   <p>Occasionally our big corporations turn out to be big thieves. In making this statement we are not referring to rumors which circulate among us, and the truth of which cannot be proven, even though one may be morally convinced that they are true. We refer to a recent decision by a federal court, in which the court ruled that the Southern Pacific Railroad had unlawfully obtained possession of oil lands valued at fifteen million dollars. This is, of course, simply a polite way of saying that the land had been stolen. It really belonged to the people of the United States.</p>
   <p>Such disgraceful acts could not be perpetrated if the railroads were owned and operated by the government, as is the postal service. The public would then be served instead of being robbed. The United States mail service is not dishonest and is not interested in exploiting the people and their resources; this is more than can be said of our railroads.</p>

   <p>There are indications that the idea of government ownership of the railroads is gaining in public favor.</p>
