   <p>Editorial: The French communistic newspaper, Lecridupeuple (The Voice of the people) in one of its latest editions has an article, dealing with Aug. Palm and his propaganda to introduce socialism in Sweden. The newspaper recommends Palm to all socialists abroad, especially to the Swedish socialists in America and asked that they hurry to his assistance in order that "the uncultivated Swedish people might as soon as possible know all the wonderful things socialism and communism are promising the whole world."</p>
   <p>A Frenchman ought not to talk of the ignorance among the Swedes. The fact is that Sweden stands first among the European countries when it comes to education, and France very low.</p>
   <p>Palm can not expect any response to his teachings among the Swedes in their own country or here in America.</p>

   <p>Socialism doesn't grow so very well in a republican country like the United States. It can be used as a protest in some of the countries in Europe against misuse of wealth, because the people there have no means of changing the situation for the better. The Americans can change certain things in a peaceful way in accordance with the constitution. </p>
