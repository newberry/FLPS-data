   <p>Our political and industrial undertakings will meet with troubled times again and again as long as the individual grabs for himself that fruit of labor which ought to benefit all.</p>
   <p>So far, we have failed to find the methods by which, under present conditions, would enable us to keep clear of these grabbers with their flexible conscience, who use us for stepping stones in their climb towards the pinnacles of power and riches.</p>
   <p>The property held by an individual or a corporation in this country owes its value to the American people. Were it not for these seventy-six million people, every railroad would be simply streaks of rust across the land; every skyscraper would be as valueless as the old temple ruins in Ceylon; every square foot of Broadway in New York as cheap as the icy stretches <span class="page-break">2</span>of Greenland.</p>
   <p>And yet the fact is that the fruits of the mental and physical labor of these seventy-six million people are gathered in by a small group of individuals. When we notice on the one hand enormous riches, and on the other dire poverty we see the result of this harvesting by a few. And who is to blame for the conditions thus brought about? The answer can only be, the people are to blame.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the way of voting by organized labor. There are about 2,000,000 members in the labor unions, a force large enough, if the members stood shoulder to shoulder, to control the national elections. But the members themselves do not realize their enormous power, and the labor leaders do not inform them. So the power of the labor unions is split up, some votes here, others there, to serve some selfish labor leaders, or to some political fakers. These individuals take advantage of the situation. Over the backs of the workers they climb into fat governmental jobs, and once lodged there, they soon forget everything beyond their own ambitions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The great mass of organized workers gain nothing from their voting; strictly speaking, it would not matter whether the organized workers were voting or not.</p>
   <p>The labor unions are kept quiet through the expediency of various political leaders by throwing some political job to some of the labor leaders who then, as a rule, forget the cause of labor and afterwards care for nothing except to grab whatever money comes their way, and to gain rich and influential people as friends.</p>
   <p>Two thousand years ago, the organized workers in ancient Rome were fooled in a similar way as are the union members of today. A French historian mentions that the sailors and the bakers in the city of Rome had unions, well organized and influential. Whenever these unions brought forward demands for higher wages the leaders of the unions were made knights or senators. This tickled the vanity of the union members so that they forgot about their demands; the masses continued to toil patiently as before, while the knighted leaders bent their efforts to have their children <span class="page-break">4</span>married into the families of the older nobility with the bluer blood.</p>
   <p>No class ever had any direct advantage of the promotion of a few of its members to positions of power and honor. Will the working people ever learn this fact? Empress Katarina I of Russia was a farmer's daughter, but she never did anything to promote the welfare of the farm girls. Galerius was a swine herd, and Diocletian was a slave, but neither of the two men, after becoming emperor of Rome, did anything to mitigate the conditions of the classes to which he belonged prior to his ascension to the throne. Horatius, one of Rome's most excellent poets, was the son of a farmer, but he did not even remember his former class with a song.</p>
   <p>In the United States, thousands have been raised from the hovel to the palace, but in spite of their rise, they have done nothing to solve the social problems and bring rights to the oppressed ones. In brief: he, who succeeds in advancing in riches and power in this world, will do whatever he can to keep the others in a subordinate position.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Every labor union needs to choose between two ways of action: It may enter politics with united force and in this manner compel the legislature to enact laws beneficial to all the people, or it may ban politics from the union altogether, and thereby give the leader a chance to trade the votes of the organization against some lucrative political position for himself.</p>
