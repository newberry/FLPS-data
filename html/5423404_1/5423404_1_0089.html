   <p>p.6................Our people can not show too great a love for institutions of learning but they should see to it that our cultural adjustments develop in the right direction.</p>
   <p>Our Swedish-American people should be especially interested in the attempts which are made to establish permanent courses in Swedish language, literature and culture in our Swedish-American educational institution. The Swede is all too often an obliging, humble and easily persuaded being. This is because he does not place a high enough value on his own. May we snap out of our phlegmatic attitude and begin to appreciate more "the good Swedish," perhaps others would follow our example.</p>
   <p>A wish: May our Swedish-American school-libraries be supplied with rich collections of Swedish literature in all branches of learning, so that the teacher of Swedish has something real to refer the students to. Anyone enriching the Swedish sections of our school-libraries has accomplished something of national import.</p>
