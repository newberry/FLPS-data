   <p>p.6.... In the old, well-known, periodical, The Atlantic Monthly, Professor Hugo Minsterberg of Harvard University, German by birth, has published an article on "Creative Learning in America" in which one notes the following:</p>
   <p>"Well do I recall a long conversation which, when I was almost a newcomer in the country, and lacking in experience in the ways of the American academics, I had with an Englishman of learning who had come here to lecture. We talked of the low standpoint of American learning, and he said: America will never have a corps of learned men of the first rank, such as are found in Germany and England, before professors in the leading universities draw a salary of at least $10,000 a year and the best men of learning draw their $25,000.</p>
   <p>I was astonished and called this, his conception, pessimistic and materialstic, but he stood by his words and continued: It is not money, in and for itself, <span class="page-break">2</span>which the Americans strive for, but money is to him the measure of success, and, therefore,"the learned way" needs the support of money to make itself respected and influential in the community, so that it may win the best equipped minds.</p>
   <p>My English friend did not succeed in convincing me at that time but since then the years have proved to me that he was right; the years I have spent in contact with hundreds of teachers and other men of learning from everywhere in the whole country; the years,during which I have seen how the most gifted students long wondering just how to follow their bet for knowledge so as to win, at least, a coveted recognition in the community, finally go into law or some business that would yield the desired results.</p>
   <p>Such talk is, of course, not pleasant to hear, but Mr. Munsterberg's views should still be recognized as true, by each and every one who with open eyes have looked at our spiritual, political, and social life, and have noticed <span class="page-break">3</span>the motives, which rule there. Money is looked upon, undeniably, as the measure of success. For him who acquires riches, the way lies open to "the community's heights." Certainly, there are people to be found, who, regardless of all their money, are respected by the whole world, and others who, without any great measure of earthly possessions win great honor; but these are only exceptions not the rule.</p>
   <p>One need not be a worshipper of "the almighty dollar," to give the preference, when choosing a profession, to the one which appears to offer the best economic outlook. Even the one who does not thirst after riches wishes, at least to win a good subsistence, better than his parents enjoyed, and to be able to give his children better opportunities than those, which he himself had. The "learned way" at the completion of which stands a professorship with $3,000 or $5,000 a year, demands long years of arduous preparatory work and offers but little of that reward which obtains from public recognition and diplomas of honor.</p>
   <p>It is, then, not at all strange if the best minds prefer other less strenuous and more promising ways.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In view of this it may well,with reason, be doubted whether it be wise and desirable to continue putting great amounts of money given to the American educational institutions, into costly buildings and costly "inventory." Those schools of learning in the old world which have won world renown and preserved it during the centuries, have won it not through their stately buildings, but through that tribe of men of learning, who were nurtured in them and afterward served as educators. Were it not then, by far wiser to defer for the time being, the building of palatial universities? The money which would be required for the costly buildings could be employed much more profitably if the income from the funds were used for scholarships and for teachers' salaries. This would encourage the most gifted youngsters in following their natural bent, giving their lives to the pursuit of knowledge in the department, in which the individual in question feels himself especially prepared, and in which he might develop new lines of thought.</p>
