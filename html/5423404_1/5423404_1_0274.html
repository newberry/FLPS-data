   <p>Colporteurs Carl Matson and Albert Dahlstrom are now prohibited from preaching their doctrines in the Lake View district. They had a large tent pitched in the vacant space between Fletcher Street and Belmont Avenue not far from Clark Street. Beginning with their first meeting they drew a good crowd every night, but when it was discovered that their doctrines were entirely antagonistic to those of all Lake View churches--that they were preaching an entirely perverted gospel, the three Swedish pastors, Nelson, Hult and Swarty, of Lake View, secured several hundred signatures to a petition that Mattson and Dahlstrom should be forbidden to hold meetings. On Thursday and Friday they were tried by Judge Honore. The three Swedish pastors were ably supported by the Swedish attorney, George E. Q. Johnson and Alderman Dunn. Alderman Williston of the twentyfifth ward and State's Attorney E. T. Wade also supported them and the result was that the false doctrine preachers were ordered to discontinue their meetings in Lake View permanently, and threatened with imprisonment if they disobeyed the order.</p>
   <p>On Saturday evening Mattson and Dahlstrom, with a couple of other men, were taken to the Sheffield Avenue police station in the patrol wagon. From Fletcher Street on, the patrol wagon was followed by several hundred people, men, women and children.</p>
   <p>Those arrested furnished bonds for their freedom and returned to the tent where pandemonium broke loose as Mattson and Dahlstrom entered. No sermon was delivered that night because Police Lieutenant John Damman was present, on Sunday afternoon and evening, the usual meetings were held without any disturbance due to the presence of officers.</p>
   <p>The tent meetings will continue for two weeks pending the trial by jury of Mattson and Dahlstrom.</p>
