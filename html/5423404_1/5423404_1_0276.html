   <p>An unusual dedication in a Chicago Swedish Church took place, on Sunday, June 3, at the Trinity Church (Swedish), on Barry and Seminary Avenues. A beautiful high grade pipe organ, for which this congregation paid $3,500.00, had been installed by Hillgren, Lane and Company of Alliance, Ohio.</p>
   <p>Miss Ellyn M. Swanson, August Anderson, and Robert N. Anderson were the pipe organ soloists that demonstrated the great organ to a capacity audience gathered for the dedication.</p>
   <p>Emil Larson will be the regular organist at this church. We are confident that the music that he plays on the grand instrument will draw many more people than have heretofore attended the meetings in the Treenighet (Trinity) Church.</p>
