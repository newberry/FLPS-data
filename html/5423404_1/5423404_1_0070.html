   <p>We are heartily in favor of the new system of choosing teachers for our public schools established by the Chicago Board of Education.</p>
   <p>The new system requires every applicant to take five courses of study. Each course includes twenty-four lectures. [The studies should last] five years; the applicant may take the complete five-year course in two years in summer school.</p>
   <p>The majority of the School Board is confident that this program will bring satisfactory results to all; both the applicants and their examiners will consider it a square deal for all concerned.</p>
