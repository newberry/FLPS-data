   <p>At the Republican convention held in Chicago last week a member of our Swedish colony, Harry Olson, was nominated as candidate for Chief Justice of the Municipal Court. This nomination was received proudly by our Chicago countryman since it came as proof of the old adage, "let the office seek the man instead of the man seeking the office". A better candidate could not have been drafted by the Republican party.</p>
   <p>Harry Olson was born in Chicago in 1897 and graduated from the Pecatonica High School, after which he studied law at Washington College and Northwestern University Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1891, and since that time has practiced law in Chicago. In 1896 he was appointed assistant state's attorney by Governor Deneen, who at that time was the state's attorney. Olson served during the eight years Deneen held his office. When John J. Healy succeeded Deneen, Harry Olson was requested to continue as assistant state's attorney,and to this day he has efficiently handled his job to the satisfaction of the entire city. We predict a landslide victory for Harry in the coming election.</p>
