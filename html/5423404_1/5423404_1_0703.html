This year 22,000 workers have been out on strike in 249 factories throughout the nation.</p>
   <p>If these factories had not existed, these strikes could not have taken place. Nothing can be more certain, then that the political party which works the most for the revival of industry, is also directly responsible for these strikes. During the period of labor shortage not so long ago, labor disputes were seldom heard of. Therefore, strikes and improved labor conditions seem to go hand in hand.</p>
