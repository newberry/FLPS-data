   <p>The well-known Swedish attorney, George E. Q. Johnson, has come out as a candidate for state senator from the thirteenth senatorial district. This district is bounded by State Street on the west, 63rd Street on the north, the lake on the east, and the city limits on the south.</p>
   <p>Johnson's program is based on the tax question. The present state senator from the district has voted for measures which have caused a forty-two per cent tax increase. Johnson demands that the state administration reduce its expenditures in order to ease the tax burden, and he considers that a state administration, like a private enterprise, should be operated with due regard to efficiency and economy. He has pledged himself to support legislation that will effect a reduction of the tax rate, if he is elected to the state <span class="page-break">\2</span>senate. Since one senatorial vote is equal to three votes in the lower chamber, the office which he is seeking is a very important one, and we hope Swedish-American voters realize this and will cast their votes for their countryman.</p>
   <p>Johnson is well known to the readers of this paper, since he has for several years conducted a legal column, in which he answers legal questions submitted by readers. He is one of Chicago's leading attorneys of Swedish ancestry.</p>
