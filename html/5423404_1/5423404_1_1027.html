   <p>The commission-manager plan of city government has been introduced in some four hundred cities throughout the country. In the majority of cases it appears to operate more to the advantage of the respective communities than the old system, according to which a mayor and a city council governed the town.</p>
   <p>This new form of city administration demands efficiency of officeholders, making them directly responsible to the people for their acts. If they are to hold their jobs they must show ability and devotion to duty. At the same time this new plan does away with pay roll padding, and discourages graft; and we suspect that these are the main reasons why the politicians <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the old school are opposed to it.</p>
   <p>Among the large cities that are trying out the new system is Cleveland, Ohio. For some years the affairs of this city have been administered by a commission and a city manager. On the whole, the experiment appears to have been successful, but there, as elsewhere, it has met strong opposition by certain groups which have done everything they can to make the city abolish the new system and to reinstate the old one. The question regarding the city's administration has been introduced into local politics not less than three times in the last two years, and then referred to the voters for a decision, but each time it has received a negative result.</p>
   <p>The last referendum in Cleveland took place only a few days ago, with the result that the majority voted for the maintenance of the present system. The majority was not great, but was sufficient to show that the local politicians, with all their agitation and propaganda, have not succeeded in fooling all of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>people. The voters gave the present executives of their city a vote of confidence, because they are handling civic affairs in an efficient manner. The people are looking out for the welfare of their own community.</p>
