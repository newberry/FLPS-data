   <p>Few persons have been in charge of the pontificate so long as the recently deceased Pope Leo XIII. For more than twenty-five years he has been pope, during a period when mighty currents of thought manifested themselves, and  <span class="gap">[gap]</span> printed in the book of history.</p>
   <p>Naturally the late pope <span class="gap">[gap]</span> taking an impartial point of view <span class="gap">[gap]</span> forced to admit that in his method of directing the activities of the papacy he has come to deserve consideration as one of the greatest occupants of the chair of St. Peter. We are no devotees of the pope or of the Catholic Church, yet we feel obliged to express our admiration for <span class="gap">[gap]</span> himself in every way to 
be a person of great intelligence, more learned than most of his contemporaries....and broad enough in his views to embrace all humanity and everything that tends to improve human life. As a statesman he could stand comparison with the best....</p>
   <p>Leo XIII has concluded life...History will pass judgment on his acts.</p>
