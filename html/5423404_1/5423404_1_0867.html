   <p>During his travels across the oceans of the sky, in his flying ship, an inhabitant of the faraway planet Mars came to the earth. Here he met an earth dweller upon whom worry had imprinted deep marks.</p>
   <p>--Good Morning, the man from Mars greeted.</p>
   <p>--Good Morning, the earth dweller responded.</p>
   <p>--What is the matter?</p>
   <p>--Hungry.</p>
   <p>--Why don't you eat, then?</p>
   <p>--No money.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>--Go to work and earn some.</p>
   <p>--No work to be had.</p>
   <p>--Why not work on this large stretch of land, planting wheat, corn, potatoes, and the like?</p>
   <p>--The owner will not hire me.</p>
   <p>--That is that?</p>
   <p>--The owner will not hire me.</p>
   <p>--What does "owner" mean?</p>
   <p>--The one who owns the land, of course.</p>
   <p>--Owns the land?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>--That's it.</p>
   <p>--I do not understand you. Listen: Did not God create all the land?</p>
   <p>--So I have heard.</p>
   <p>--Did he not create it so that all his children could live from its produce?</p>
   <p>--Yes--well I have heard so--I think so--I don't know.</p>
   <p>--How did it happen that one person became the owner of all of this?</p>
   <p>--He has bought it, legally.</p>
   <p>--Who makes your laws?</p>
   <p>--We ourselves, of course.</p>
   <p>--Who "we".</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>--The voters--I and the rest.</p>
   <p>--And you--the people who rule--make laws to give away rich lands to individual persons, giving them the power to prevent you from working the land?</p>
   <p>--Yes--that's right.</p>
   <p>--Please raise your hat so that I can observe the shape of your head.</p>
   <p>And the man from Mars flew away in his flying ship, saying to himself: What fools those humans be!</p>
