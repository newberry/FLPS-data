   <p>Northwestern University, of Evanston, Ill., has recently received a donation from John R. Lindgren, Swedish Consul and banker of Chicago. The donation, which amounts to $50,000, will be divided equally into two funds. One will be used to establish and maintain a professor of Swedish language and literature at the above named University. The other will be used as a sort of Nobel prize fund. The principal sum may not be touched, but the interest accruing will be awarded to a person who orally or by writing contributes the best ideas on international peace and religious harmony. Consul Lindgren, who is a member of the Northwestern University faculty, recently declared himself willing to donate the mentioned sum. The fact was made known at a banquet given for the delegates of the Second National Peace Conference held Wednesday evening, May 5, in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>For a long time it has been desired to have a professor of Swedish at the Northwestern University, but the idea never had enough support to be put into effect, and had Consul Lindgren not stepped in at the right time, it would no doubt have remained a desire. Until now those wishing to study Scandinavian culture and Scandinavian languages had to go to the Swedish, Norwegian or Danish Theological Seminary in Evanston.</p>
