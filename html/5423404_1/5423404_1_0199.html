   <p>As is well known, it is the policy of this newspaper to support sincere reform movements, the aim of which are to improve social conditions and raise moral and material standards. For that reason we are much interested in the temperance question, and are in favor of measures which tend to promote sobriety.</p>
   <p>When such an important issue as that of general liquor prohibition for Chicago is now to be decided at the polls, we feel it is only fair that arguments both for and against should be heard, and have, therefore, as have all Chicago's dailies, accepted an advertisement by the United States Manufacturers' and Merchants' Association in which the voters are urged to turn down the measure, and reasons are given why this should be done. It will be found on page fourteen of this issue.</p>
   <p>There are weighty arguments both for and against in regard to this question, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and voters who have heard both sides are in a better position to make an intelligent decision.</p>
