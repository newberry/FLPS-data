   <p>Five Swedish men are candidates on the Republican ticket at the election to be held April 5, namely:</p>
   <p>John Larson, for Alderman from the 23rd Ward;</p>
   <p>Edward Peterson for Alderman from the 30th ward;</p>
   <p>Andrew Ringman, for Town Clerk of Hyde Park;</p>
   <p>John Thoren, for Town Clerk of West Town;</p>
   <p>C.P. Youngquist for Supervisor of Jefferson.</p>
   <p>In this connection we wish to mention that nine of our fellow countrymen are employed in the various departments of Sheriff Gilbert's office. During the regime of his predecessor, Sheriff Mattson, who was a Norwegian, there was only one Swede employed in that branch of our County Administration.</p>
