   <p>One of the most frequent accusations against the trade-unions is that they often do not permit members willing to work to earn a living. When they declare a strike, they force the workers to remain idle, even though the latter might be willing to work on the terms of the employers.</p>
   <p>If one considers what a strike really is, it is easy to realize the necessity of such a rule. A strike is a resort to force when all other procedures have failed, a waging of war with peaceful weapons, so to speak. In real war, a soldier who joins the enemy is punished by death. Imagine a battle during which a group of soldiers turns around and helps the enemy! In peace time it is of course proper to aid those that are in need of assistance. But when a state of war exists, such assistance constitutes treason.</p>
