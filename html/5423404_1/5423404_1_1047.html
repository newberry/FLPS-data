   <p>Preparations are being mady by both political parties in Chicago for the coming election in April regarding the first five years term as a mayor. To ask Republicans and Democrats to consider carefully the problem is only natural. But the "five year mayor" is not the only question of the one of first interest. There are other matters of interest that concern the whole political situation. If we are now to have complete municipal ownership of the city's railway system it would seem that the present mayor would be as good as elected because he has to a great extent prepared the ground for this work.</p>
   <p>But the thinker has and will to a great extent question whether he has managed the affairs as he should have done.</p>
   <p>Both Democrats and Republicans are of the opinion that he has held up the finishing of affairs so as to make the City Railway question into a campaign argument for his own good. The question is so confusing that "experts interested in the situation cannot explain.</p>

   <p>One fact stands out in Mayor Dunne's favor that in questions pertaining to the city and community interests Mayor Dunne has stood on the Corporations' side. Thus it was the fault of Dunne when the city alderman gave away 14 million dollars to the gas company, who have plundered the city and the consumers on gas with unheard of high prices for many years. When the aldermen finished studying the gas rates and wanted the price reduced 75c per thousand cubic feet, Dunne protested and waged a battle that cost the city dearly. And in many other questions Dunne has favored the corporations' side.</p>
   <p>But on the other hand he has been the Catholic priests best worker. In one way he has been a play ball in the Catholic hands. When his work as mayor is finished, when it is seen what he has done and what he should have done, then he will have to admit he was not the best. Dunne is an opponent of Carter H. Harrison who has served four terms and has a vast number of friends and followers. It is quite possible that he will receive the nomination. But that only effects the Democratic party. However many Dunnites will never be Harrisonites. The trouble Harrison will find is that he is not a Republican. He has a large number of best friends who are <span class="page-break">\3</span>Republicans and if he receives the nomination he will receive many votes from the Republican side. But at the same time he will lose many of the Democratic votes. On the other side the Republican party has pretty well decided that Fred Busse will be their candidate.</p>
