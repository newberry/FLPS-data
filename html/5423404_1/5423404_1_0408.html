   <p>Dispatches from Washington carry the news that Democratic and progressive Republican senators demand that the amount of income tax paid by those corporations and industrial firms which will benefit by the Smoot-Hawley new tariff bill be published.</p>
   <p>This demand is justified and should be acceded to, Manufacturers who complain of foreign competition and ask for higher tariff protection, which increases the economic burden of the American people, should be willing to reveal to the public their financial position, which is indicated by the amount of income tax they pay.</p>
   <p>When this point has been clarified it will be easier to determine whether or not higher tariffs are advisable. And it behooves our lawmakers to take measures which are based on facts rather than on the demands of selfish financial interests.</p>
