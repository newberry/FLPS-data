   <p>Nowadays it is silly to be a burglar. There are so many other surer and more elegant ways of stealing that nobody but a stupid bungler would choose the old-time crude, dangerous way.</p>
   <p>On opening one of the large English Sunday papers, one will find long rows of advertisements for collectors, whose sole work will be to go about collecting money a few hours per day, for which work he is to receive $20 or $25 per week. When the simple-minded reader notices this, he thinks it quite splendid to get $20 per week, all the time wearing fine clothes for merely having to fool the people. He applies at the place of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>advertiser, and everything is declared to be in first class order, except for the little matter that the advertiser must have a couple of hundred dollars as security so that a collector bent on dishonesty would not be tempted to abscond with the money collected. Our simple-minded reader will frequently have saved a few hundred dollars, and he turns them over to the advertiser without suspicion. The rest follows in due season; the advertiser flees; the fine "collector" deplores the decay of morals in our time, and the lack of honesty in America, but not of his own stupidity.</p>
   <p>We have seen Swedes send money to all kinds of fakers. One person advertised for patents which he claimed to be able to sell at a high price. There was, of course, the item of $20 to be sent with the application. Hundreds of Swedes have forwarded their money as required and afterwards hearing nothing about the matter; perhaps they do not even receive an answer to their letter.</p>

   <p>The other day a Swede saw an advertisement about a partner needed with money to buy one half of a lucrative business. He paid $600 cash, and a few days later, he had lost it all.</p>
   <p>The Americans are not so often fooled in this manner. They say, "if anybody be able to impose on me, alright; let all the world have its try at me; my permission is freely granted; I admire those who can fool me."</p>
