   <p>Nowadays, we unceasingly hear that "we are living in the era of youth." The expression is heard morning, noon and night, so much that it sounds like a slogan. The idea seems to prevail that it is the young man who is in the saddle and the older man has to accept the condition whether he likes it or not; youth now owns and runs the world.</p>
   <p>In reality, however, the young fellow's role is no greater and of no more importance in our day than it was during the past. Think of Luther in the sixteenth century, Newton in the seventeenth, Napoleon and Pitt in the eighteenth, and thousands of others from the time of Alexander the Great, who, at the age of thirty, had conquered the then known world, to the present time. When we speak of the great accomplishments of youth during the past centuries we should judge them according to the general conditions <span class="page-break">\2</span>prevailing at the time, not according to present conditions.</p>
   <p>The secret of each accomplishment was not a question of age; the man, whether young or old, could, in any generation, have erred and failed. Progress depends entirely upon the ability and ambition of the individual and the goal toward which he aims. The individual who really amounts to something has the same opportunity whether he be fifty or only twenty-five.</p>
   <p>The youth, who enters the struggle for success, imagining that the older men are of no use or value and should be put on the shelf is self-evidently a nuisance and a fool.</p>
