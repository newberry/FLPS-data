   <p>It is estimated that the Socialist party mustered 850,000 votes at the last election, which is an increase of some 400,000 over the number of votes polled at the election two years ago. At that time the party elected altogether thirty-five representatives to the state legislatures of Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, and also one congressman. No wonder, therefore, that a certain section of the American press is becoming uneasy about this "red menace".</p>
   <p>We have long since become accustomed to hearing citizens dismiss every reform proposal with the remark: "This is socialism"--the term "socialism" implying to them something derogatory. It is easy to explain such an attitude among people who, in some way or other, benefit from conditions which are incompatible with the common welfare. But the same attitude is often encountered in quarters where one would least expect it. In America and <span class="page-break">2</span>England and, we may also say, in Sweden, socialism has been presented as a phantom figure of a most repulsive and horrifying appearance.</p>
   <p>In this country progressive movements such as those advocating effective government control of corporations, protection of our natural resources, legislation pertaining to employed women and children, workmen's compensation for injuries sustained on the job, and similar reforms, have met stubborn opposition, even though they are expressions of intelligent and humane popular opinion.</p>
   <p>In England many people are convinced that the much-dreaded socialism is behind the proposal to abolish the House of Lords, and even leading liberals, such as Lord Rosebery, are doing all they can to rescue the Lords from such a disaster. Referring to this situation, Lord Rosebery remarked in a recent speech: "Behind the government one can feel the presence of the socialistic monster, waiting for the moment when the barriers of the second chamber also shall fall." However, such statements do not seem to impress the <span class="page-break">3</span>English voters, and neither do they prevent voters of intelligence and judgment in any other country from supporting desirable and timely reforms.</p>
   <p>An experiment is now being conducted in the city of Milwaukee, in whose city council there is a socialistic majority. This majority, however, is not at all free to put its theories into practice, but its actions will be closely watched throughout the country, and the fortunes of socialism in America will be greatly affected by the record made by Milwaukee's socialist City Council. It is being put to the test, and the result is awaited with much interest.</p>
   <p>When the English statesman, Lord Salisbury, once proposed that the Parliament pass the Workmens' Compensation Act, he made this statement: "We are all socialists now." He wanted to impress upon his audience that an otherwise timely reform ought not to be voted down just because it was sponsored by the Socialist party. And these inspired words by Lord Salisbury are being echoed by the enlightened popular opinion of our times.</p>
