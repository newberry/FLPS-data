   <p>p.6.................May we see to it that we give our children and youth a proper education and consistent in purpose! Every one ought to be as far as possible, that for which he owns the greatest inclination and talent.</p>
   <p>The young ones differ greatly in regard to inclination and talent. Praise God, there is a place for them all. May they then be able to develop in the school-room in such a manner that their natural aptitudes and bents are taken into consideration. Don't plug loads of latin into a youngster who by nature is intended for mechanical or artistic development. Don't force the lover of languages into the grave with the problems of higher mathematics. Let each receive what his talents dictate. First and last then a good and universal education for all, a sure foundation to build upon. This foundation no one should be without.</p>
