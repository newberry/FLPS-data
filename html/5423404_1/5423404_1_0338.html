   <p>Dr. Hedin's Letter in Part:</p>
   <p>We have lost, and nobody regrets it, two and one-half millions of Norwegians. If the natural bonds which join us with two and one-half millions of Swedes in America could be tied more firmly than at any earlier period, then would we reap a blessed gain from the exchange. The Swedish-American <span class="page-break">2</span>has a mission to fulfill when the need arises to defend the land of an honorable past, where stood their cradle and that of their fathers. Now is the time, a period not to be passed by idly, now must the sacrifice be made quickly, or it will be too late. The emigrant must stand his new ground, but his thoughts, his actions, his readiness to give, must turn towards his old home, since the welfare and security of the old home demands it. From you, Swedish-Americans, we expect the powerful impulse which, as a fresh breeze across the Atlantic, will imbue our people with new life and enthusiasm. Like the Dalkarlarne (men from the Dalarne) of old, arise as one man for the aid of your homeland. The Swedes who left their country to stay permanently in the far west deprived their land and people of their force and enterprise. Now it is possible to join in love and in sacrifice to repay the homeland in some degree for the loss sustained by it.</p>

   <p>Yes, there are many ways in which, in times of peace, you can send valuable greetings across the ocean to the soil of your fathers. We are told that the Norwegian-Americans in these days attempt to serve their country through revolutionary petitions to the President of the United States. The Swedes must keep aloof from that sort of agitation. But we are also informed that the Norwegians have collected one million dollars for ships of war for Norway. What is there to prevent the Swedes in America from collecting five millions for the strengthening of the Swedish naval forces? Are the Norwegians more ready to sacrifice, more solid, than the Swedes in America? Is not the present time the proper time for Swedes to show that they have not forgotten their country, and that they are ready for any sacrifice required for the welfare of their homeland? Under any circumstances, they ought not take a back seat for their brothers of yesterday, the Norwegians.</p>

   <p>Swedes in America: do not doubt that I am making this appeal exclusively for reasons of patriotism. I am more at home in Asia than in Europe, and so take the liberty of proposing the following: arrange for a collection of money all over Swedish-America, a Deprivation Week of American dimensions, during which every Swedish man, every Swedish woman, according to means, circumstances, and generosity, put aside his or her contribution. The total of the individual gifts should then be placed in the form of a magnificent national contribution, at the disposal of the King or the parliament with the request that the amount, representing Swedish labor and Swedish enterprise, be employed to surround the coasts of Sweden with a measure of torpedo boat defense as is required to protect our country from attack. Granted that the amount collected will not be at all sufficient for the purpose in view, yet it would be productive of the very greatest <span class="page-break">5</span>blessings. First of all, it would be sufficient as an opening wedge to compel the construction of the means of defense for which we who love our homeland have waited so long in vain. Further, we who are in Sweden would learn from the fact of the giving that in America we have brethren and compatriots who feel, think, and sacrifice in the spirit of Swedish patriotism. And, finally a gift as mentioned would serve as the impulse needed to shake our people out of its long sleep and into the day of action. To you in America, this sacrifice ought not seem hard, it should bring you a degree of satisfaction. However, things may turn out for Sweden during the troublesome times ahead, the memory of the hand across the sea will ever contribute to your joy, and every contributor will feel pleased because he knows that he did not leave unaided the old stone halls and the red huts of the spruce forests at a time when enemies rose up at the borders of the country.</p>
   <p>Stockholm July 10, 1905. Sven Hedin.</p>
