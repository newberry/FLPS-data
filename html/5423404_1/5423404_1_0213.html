   <p>At last! An ordinance submitted by alderman Harkin makes it impossible to increase the number of saloons in Chicago, until the population reaches three and one-half millions. The basis on which this ordinance was made was that one saloon for each five hundred citizens was enough. The present number of saloons (seven thousand) [are in the proportion of] one to every three hundred citizens.</p>
   <p>Assuming that all saloons now in operation will continue, a new saloon cannot be opened until the population of Chicago has doubled.</p>
   <p>Owners of the existing saloons are not in anyway antagonistic nor disheartened by this ordinance.</p>
