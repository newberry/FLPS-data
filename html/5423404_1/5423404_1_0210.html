   <p>As we all know, Milwaukee, Wisconsin is one of the greatest brewing centers in the country, and one will readily sympathize with the city which is now beginning to feel ill at ease due to the vigorous campaign for sobriety which is going on in neighboring states. The local internal revenue office reports a decrease in revenue of $322,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30. Beer alone brought in $3,852,843 during the year, as compared to $4,174,103 the previous year.</p>
   <p>One great corporation after another is now joining the ranks of those who are actively fighting the drinking evil. The Carnegie Steel Company of Sharon, Pennsylvania, for instance, is introducing rigid rules concerning the drinking of intoxicating liquor during working hours, and it may not be long until the company will demand absolute abstinence <span class="page-break">\2</span>of its workers even in private life. Total abstainers are already given preference in regard to employment and promotion. Those that drink to excess are being dismissed.</p>
   <p>Many people think that much progress would be made if Congress would prohibit interstate trade in alcoholic beverages, but it is not likely that Speaker Cannon would permit such a proposal to come to a vote.</p>
