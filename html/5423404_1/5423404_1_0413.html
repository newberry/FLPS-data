   <p>Four years ago, there was only one single banking institution in the United States operated by a labor organization. But at the present time there are no less then thirty-three such banks in this country. In 1920, the then existing labor bank was capitalized at two hundred thousand dollars, while today the total capitalization of all American banks of this kind amounts to one hundred million dollars.</p>
   <p>This is one field in which the post-war reconstruction effort has moved in the right direction, and to all appearances this development is destined to continue for the benefit not only of the workers but of the entire nation. At the same time, this expanding banking activity, together with other successful financial undertakings by workers, may serve to bring capital and <span class="page-break">\2</span>labor closer together, and ultimately lead to better understanding and cooperation between them. For labor is beginning to realize the importance of large blocks of capital employed for a common purpose, and the capitalists are learning that labor is capable of controlling and employing its own accumulated reserves for its own benefit.</p>
