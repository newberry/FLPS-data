   <p>The following are excerpts from an article written recently by Ernst Skarstedt: "The Americans," he says, "are no doubt one of the most selfish people on earth. It can not be denied that they have many good qualities for which they can be proud, and their country stands far ahead of other countries in many ways. It is a very rich country, it is powerful, and independent. But there is a limit to everything. When they talk and write as if they themselves have created their liberty and success without the assistance or help of other nations, then their pride becomes disgustful, because it is unreasonable. But the selfishness of the Americans is somewhat diminishing now, thanks to their frequent visits to Europe. Every nation has its own weakness. While America is boasting of its successes, inventions, and its industry, Sweden has its past of which to be proud, its old hero history, its war actions, and war glory, at the time <span class="page-break">2</span>of Charles XII, Gustaf Adolphus, and other famous Swedes. We are always reminded about all this during our Swedish National festivals here, our banquets, picnics, etc. Thus both the Americans and the Swedes have their weaknesses in the matter now mentioned. But it is useless to take these things too seriously. It can also be seen from a comical point of view." The author concludes his article with good advice that we "ought to brag less, but act more. Let others praise us and talk about us." This, he says, "is reasonable, and ought to be taken at heart, both by Americans and Swedes."</p>
