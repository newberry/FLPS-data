   <p>p.6.................In our colleges the so-called "elective system" works much evil, but it is "modern" and "fashionable," and therefore we all must in greater or less measure bow to its majesty. Where the traditional courses were studied, one knew what a student had gone through; now, on the other hand one knows nothing about it. In some schools there are hundreds of combinations of subjects possible, and all lead to A.B. In the East, where the idea has long been practised, real protests are being raised against its adoption as a pedagogic principle. The boys choose as far as possible the easiest subjects to be able if possible to get through as possible, and - many of the best professors with the weightiest subjects speak to empty benches. Strange enough among us Swedish-Americans, Bethany and Gustavous Adolphus Colleges are more conservative than Augustana in regard to this question.</p>
