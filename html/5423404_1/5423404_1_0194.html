   <p>The smoke and dust emanating from the recent battle between friends and opponents of local option are clearing up, but the decision is not at all considered final, and the advocates of temperance are getting ready for a renewed fight.</p>
   <p>The action of revenge which the "wets" have undertaken against those who signed the mass petition is distasteful and is looked upon with disgust even among the opponents of local option. Many people are asking with what right these people are posting the names of petitioners on the walls of saloons and poolrooms for the purpose of making them the object of ridicule, and otherwise annoying them. Not that such action can have any retarding effect on the temperance movement itself, but it does cause some trouble for a few individuals in their respective <span class="page-break">\2</span>neighborhoods. It is both enlightening and distressing to observe the extremes to which certain elements will go in the name of personal liberty.</p>
   <p>The recent defeat of the crusaders against the drinking evil was more apparent than real; they are more than ever convinced that the disappearance of the saloon is only a question of time, and are determined to keep up the fight for reformatory and legal measures to shorten this time.</p>
   <p>The saloon as a source of municipal revenue is abominable. Nobody will hire a drinker, and many progressive employers are already going so far as to demand absolute abstinence during working hours. But still the saloons have their staunch defenders; in fact, they are even being forced upon certain communities. The situation would be ridiculous were it not so pitiful. Imagine how quickly the problem would be solved if women were given a voice in the matter! But their opinion does not <span class="page-break">\3</span>seem to count in spite of the fact that they and the home are the greatest sufferers from the destructive effects of liquor.</p>
