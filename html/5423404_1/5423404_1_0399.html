   <p>In spite of promises that wages and the standard of living would not be lowered, the board of the United States Steel Corporation has now decided to reduce the pay of its workers by about ten per cent, and other corporations in this as well as in other fields have hastened to follow the example set by the mighty steel trust. And now that a beginning has been officially made, one may expect that the so-called readjustment will be made general. It is true that living expenses have been decreasing, but the standard of living, particularly that of steel workers, certainly cannot be said to be reaching excessive heights, and it would seem desirable to maintain it at its present level.</p>
   <p>But the idea seems to be that the workers must help the corporations to pay their stockholders the dividends that they are accustomed to. For it is claimed that due to present conditions dividends have been much reduced, and in some cases are not being paid at all. If the workers had received their just share of the profits when the latter were high, it would be only fair to ask them to make sacrifices now when corporation earnings are lower. But the fact is that when profits were sky-high the corporations resorted to the method of increasing the number of shares popularly called "watering the stock," so that, on paper, dividends did not appear abnormally high, and this method made it easier to refuse the workers' demands for higher wages. It also aided the corporations in their demands for tariff protection, which gave them a favored position on the market and further increased their profits. Thus it is seen that during normal times, as well as in times of abnormal prosperity, the workers have had to be satisfied with their daily bread. Now, when really hard times have fallen on the country, they are expected to share their crumbs with their masters.</p>
   <p>Even if it proves true that the standard of living can be maintained due to the reduced cost of living, employers should realize that reduction of wages will not tend to encourage the return of prosperity. The increased turnover of consumers' goods caused by reduced prices will be outbalanced by the lowered incomes of the workers, and in the end the businessman and the manufacturer will be the losers. The one and only idea seems to be that the stockholders must get theirs, though it would seem to the average man that they ought to be able to get along on smaller dividends on their watered stock, for they too benefit from the reduced living costs.</p>
   <p>At the time when industrial leaders promised not to take measures which would tend to lower the standard of living, the workers agreed not to bring about wage disputes. But now that employers have found the time ripe to reconsider their attitude, workers may be expected to do the same and to meet the challenge with force. The magnates have undoubtedly considered this possibility but are taking a chance in the hope that present conditions on the labor market have so demoralized the workers that they have no power with which to resist. However, they should not be too sure. The old draft horse might have one good kick left.</p>
