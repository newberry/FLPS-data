   <p>Who doesn't know Mr. Ludvig Larson, on the corner of Chicago Avenue, and Sedgwick, near Hesselroth's old drug store? All Swedes who have lived in this good city for a few years know him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larson has been in the restaurant business for a generation there on the ground floor; and the second floor is known as Larson Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larson, together with his wife, nee Ida Ekblom, were pleasantly surprised in the old, honorable, Swedish-American manner, last Saturday in their home, 565 Arlington Place, by about one hundred friends. The occasion was Mrs. Larson's birthday. It has always been celebrated with a grand coffee party. Mr. Larson wondered why in the world there were so many men at Mr. Larson's kettle-drum. However, later in the evening, he was enlightened when the director, John E. Ericsson, seized a coffee cup by the ear, raised it, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>inquired, if it were possible to obtain a bit of a "prod in the weather." Oh, yes-John E. is never long-winded so he was served willingly. He began by congratulating Mrs. Larson on her birthday, but rebuked the lord of the house for permitting his silver wedding anniversary, which fell on October 24, to pass uncelebrated by the many friends of the family.</p>
   <p>Ericsson, speaking for all the guests, wished Mr. and Mrs. Larson many happy years ahead, and reminded them that friendship never dies, that the friends they have acquired still stand as a fortress of protection about them. As a remembrance of the day and friendship, Mr. Ericsson, in behalf of those present, presented a charming loving cup in silver, and in it were many ringing, new, white silver dollars. Mr. Larson expressed thanks for himself and Mrs. Larson, for the beautiful gift, but still more for their friendship. The evening hours passed quickly amid pleasant conversation and merriment.</p>
