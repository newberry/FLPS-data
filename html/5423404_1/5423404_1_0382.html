   <p>Editorial: The Swedish Tribune, Chicago, in one of its editorials today refers to a public meeting which was recently held in Upsala, Sweden by the Society of Students and Workers. Professor Harald Hjarne was the speaker at this meeting and the topic was "The Revival of Scandinavian."</p>
   <p>"There has grown a population of two million people of Swedish descent in the American west," said the speaker, "whom the Swedes in Sweden have neglected. It was, therefore, dependent on the Swedish-American themselves to preserve their love for the old country, its memories, and traditions while they were growing together with the American people. Sweden should establish a spiritual tie with its children in that far land and thus lighten their efforts for a closer affiliation with other Scandinavians in America. The Nordic stock could then become a prominent factor in the life of the new country. A happily attained unity between the Nordic brothers in the far west could exert a favorable influence towards the efforts of unity in old Scandinavia."</p>

   <p>The meeting was reported in the Swedish liberal newspaper Aftonbladet, Stockholm, on April 13th and was sent to the Swedish Tribune, Chicago. The paper also gave its own opinion in the matter, saying"that it is surely not the lowest class of people in Sweden who went to a far country to win a better living then the old home could offer." The paper also tells the Swedes to give the Swedish-Americans all the co-operation which is needed, and at the same time encourage them in their efforts to preserve the characteristics of the Nordic stock through a closer affiliation with our Scandinavian brothers in America.</p>
   <p>These statements of both the professor and the paper are surely going to encourage many Swedish-American hearts, "says the Chicago Swedish-Tribune "but they can hardly convince us that these friendly feelings towards the Swedish-Americans and our new country are shared by the majority of the population in Sweden, so long as a large part of the Swedish press -even the liberal press continues to disregard our new country, the Americans - inclusing us - and have such false views in regard to the Spanish-American war.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the sorrow the Swedish press created among us during our war <span class="page-break">\3</span>with Spain, in which many hundreds of our countrymen offered their lives and blood - is not blotted out.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Swedish Tribune completes its editorial with the following statement taken from Aftonbladet:</p>
   <p>"Sweden so far has been seeking her spiritual inspiration from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and France. But we of the Nordic race are more closely related to the great Anglo-Saxon stock, and it is time that the three nordic people should begin to draw inspiration from this race. We think that it is for the common good of the world that the reapproachment between the English and the American branch of this race is developing. The smaller nations could count on a strong defense for their independence if they to affiliate themselves with this approaching alliance. But the way for such an affiliation could be best prepared through the tightening of the bond, which unites us with our Scandinavian brothers in America."</p>
