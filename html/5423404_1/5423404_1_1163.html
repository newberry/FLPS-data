   <p>Assistant State's Attorney Harry Olson, who has been elected Chief Justice of the Municipal Court, was born in Chicago thirty-nine years ago, graduated from Pecatonica High School, continued his studies at Washington College, graduated from Northwestern Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1891.</p>
   <p>Five years later, our present Governor, Charles S. Deneen, appointed him Assistant State's Attorney, an office which he held for eight years, and for which he demonstrated such extraordinary fitness that Deneen's successor, John J. Healey requested him to remain at this post.</p>
