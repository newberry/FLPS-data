About seventy persons attended, among whom were delegates from the lodges Illinois Swedes and Jupiter, the Idrott Young Peoples' Club, and the Lake View Swedish Socialist Club.</p>
   <p>The new building, which is owned by the organization and which houses the restaurant business, has now been completed at a total cost of $78,566.68. The new restaurant is much larger than the old one, with up-to-date equipment in all departments. It employs twenty-six persons, including those in the bakery shop.</p>
   <p>The financial report showed that last year's net profit amounted to $7,000.70, and the total assets of the organization, as of December 31, 1923 were $28,014.09.</p>
