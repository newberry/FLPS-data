   <p>America is a young nation, and, like all youngsters, does not hesitate long between thought and action, when action is required. This was demonstrated during the World War, when an army of millions of men was equipped and trained and sent to the battlefield within a few months. It has also been amply demonstrated when catastrophies of some sort have hit some part of the country or some distant land, Americans have always been ready to render quick aid and sufficient aid when fellow human beings were in need. Knowing that this is so, one can not help wondering why so little has been done during the last few months to alleviate the unemployment and consequent hardships of innocent people, a situation which now exists throughout the country. The explanation may well be that the widespread unemployment and the suffering which follows in its wake react on the average man and woman just as do the numerous fatal automobile accidents. It is becoming so commonplace that people's sensitiveness to it has become dulled, and those that are not directly hit by it do not feel that it concerns them.</p>
   <p>However, it seems of late as if both the authorities and the general public are beginning to realize the seriousness of the situation, and that something must be done to help the unfortunate victims of the depression. The Federal Government has set about to untangle the unemployment problem, and so have some state governments. Here in Illinois a commission was appointed, a couple of weeks ago, to submit plans for putting people to work. And the Chicago City Council met in special session last week to discuss this all-important question, but no definite action was taken, and the proceedings were not such as to lead one to hope for much from that quarter. The majority, supporting the mayor, bragged about its accomplishments, while the minority, lead by Alderman Albert, harshly criticized the administration's actions of the last few years.</p>
   <p>Unemployment is now so extensive, and its consequences have become so grave, that there is no time for useless talk and controversy, and that goes for the City Council as well as for the various relief committees that have been formed and those which are to be formed by other groups. What is required is quick and efficient action. All nonessentials must be disregarded, and every effort aimed at the one goal: to bring relief to the needy and to promote measures which in the shortest possible time will bring about improvement on the labor market.</p>
   <p>The Swedes in Chicago and in other localities have been hard hit during this depression period for the simple reason that so many of them are ordinarily engaged in the building industry, where the unemployment has been and still is more general than in any other field. Many Swedish families, as well as single persons, are, therefore, now destitute, and to them applies the same saying that applies to all others who have been out of work for a long time: "Quick aid is double aid".</p>
   <p>In the near future a relief committee is expected to be formed to assist the already existing welfare agencies in their work among our unfortunate countrymen, and there is all reason to believe that substantial aid will be forthcoming.</p>
   
   <p>It comes in the nick of time, for winter, the most critical period, is approaching. Let us hope that spring will bring better days, with no need for more aid. But it certainly is needed now.</p>
