   <p>At a meeting of the Chicago Council last week, the Harkin Ordinance prohibiting the opening of a new saloon till Chicago's population increases to twice its present number, breaks the ratio decided upon by the ordinance, allotting one saloon to each five hundred citizens. Present saloon keepers may sell their licenses if they wish and any saloon keeper convicted of violating this law may have his license revoked.</p>
   <p>We have classed the Harkin Ordinance as a monopoly breeder and continue to do so. The man of small means cannot pay the enormous license fee now set. Before the term of his license expires a rich man may buy his license or privilege and continue the service that otherwise would cease to exist; leaving the little fellow to find another method of keeping body and spirit together a little longer. This ordinance is a disgrace.</p>
