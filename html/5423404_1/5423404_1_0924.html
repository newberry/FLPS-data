   <p>After more than three years, or from the time he was elected and took office as governor of Illinois, a small army of the capitalistic local republicans have by word of mouth and thru certain press reports besmirched and blackened governor Deneen as if he were the poorest governor the republican party could have elected to the highest position the state has to offer. Deneen had two opponents when he ran for the governorship; they were the rich son-in-law of the Pullman's, Mr. Lowden, capital's gold boy, and the former governor Yates, the people's choice, but Deneen was also of the people's choice because he had always been friendly, understanding, honest and of good character. With these qualifications he had won the peoples confidence and he has never misused it. Therefore, he has grown in popularity among the people. But his fiendish friends, Lowden's and the politicians have hounded him. The Chicago Journal has not published one issue without making shameful and unbecoming remarks. It seems as if the Journal is Lowden's organ or the capitalists political mouthpiece.</p>

   <p>The Inter Ocean has in print and cartoon hammered at Governor Deneen as if he were a friendly horse thief. They have made complaints against the governor about his work, they have blamed him for things which he had no part in, and was not guilty of. And now another occasion presents itself for them to vent their ire and abuse upon him. Regarding the state's poor-houses and other institutions where the governor is responsible for working personel. In these institutions it is claimed that grim conditions exist among the unlucky patients that find themselves in these places.</p>
   <p>The most horried falsehoods have been concocted of how persons there have not only been tortured but even murdered. Deneen's bitter, if not fiendish opponents, have so painted the handling of the unfortunates. Governor Deneen ordered the last legislature to appoint a committee of investigation, to look into these charges and report their findings to the legislature. This has now been done, and the investigation reveals the blackest lies were made up by a person who was fired from one of these institutions because he was not qualified for the work. This gentleman as far as he is known has lent himself as Deneen's persecutor, and the stories have been made worse. That is what the report brings out, and Deneen has given a complete report of the conditions in these institutions and he points out the improvements that are necessary, <span class="page-break">3</span>but could only be made at extra expense to the state. The governor has upon various occasions pointed out these necessary improvements that must be made, but his messages fell on deaf ears. The short comings that were found were of course of the former governor's administration.</p>
   <p>But behind all this lies something else which concerns Governor Deneen; namely, that is, he is seeking re-election, so this is leading to what will follow. If his opponents can, thru this misinformation,belittle him among those whom he is popular,they feel his defeat will be accomplished, and in his place they will nominate a candidate for governor of their own choice. If his opponent is able to keep the people in the dark,then naturally the old guard will become the power. Every one of us ought to know what that means.</p>
