   <p>Brother John D. Rockefeller explained to his Sunday school students recently why he had such success in business. He said: "God, the eternal Father, Creator of the heavens and the earth, has been helping me." It is wonderful to meet now and then a true, living christian in this sinful world, but doubly so, when the person in question is a brother especially endorsed by God. "Unfathomable are the ways of God," but we hardly dare think that God revealed himself to Brother John D. and inspired him to act at the time when he won control over the oil wells of the country. We are rather inclined <span class="page-break">2</span>to long for the hay when we are to see the Brothers Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, and Baer, fight for the seat at the right hand of God, from which place they are at present trying their best to dislodge the Son of Man.</p>
