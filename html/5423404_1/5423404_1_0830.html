   <p>An unusual dinner was given the other day at St. Regis Hotel, New York. So singular was it of its kind that it would be almost a crime to relegate it to silence. At this dinner the whole table service was of gold; silver was too cheap. Thirty-six persons partook of the dinner, and the cost of this one meal amounted to $50,000., or $1,400. per couvert. The world was alight with well-being, and it is to be hoped that the guests felt completely happy.</p>
   <p>In the same paper in which this affair was related there also appeared a report on the state of poverty in New York. Of this latter article, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>millionaire and philanthropist, Robert Hunter, was the author. He reports that in the city of New York there are 70,000 school children who are compelled to go hungry to school day after day, and that within the city there are 666,000 people suffering want.</p>
   <p>Frequently, do extremes touch in life, but rarely did we see clearer proof of this than in the present instance.</p>
   <p>Within the luxuriously furnished hotel, in the dining room, are seated thirty-six men and women eating delicacies from golden plates, and the mere flowers adorning the guests had cost enough to provide many meals for a workingman's family. In the morning of that day, 70,000 boys and girls go to school without breakfast. The thirty-six have no thoughts for the 70,000; at <span class="page-break">\3</span>the popping of corks from champagne bottles, the cutting of gold knives into tender meat, the fragrance from the choicest flowers of the greenhouses, one does not naturally think of such disagreeable and insignificant matters as the fact that 666,000 among ones neighbors are lacking food. If a thought of these should have entered the mind of one of the thirty-six, it would have been suppressed the very moment it was born. One cannot afford to spoil a $1,400 dinner by trifles.</p>
   <p>The guests at the St. Regis hotel dinner were no worse sinners than the rest of us; they were children of their age, children of our age, governed by selfishness, and unable to see and understand the needs of others.</p>
