   <p>In spite of the statements of the big dailies in the city, it seems that the majority in the city council, formerly so inimical to Mayor Thompson, have had a strong sense of having been defeated on Feb. 29, because the attitude of some of the members has been changed in such manner that Mayor Thompson has as many aldermen supporting him as he had opponents before the primary. Not even the great leader Merriam seems able to stop the mayor now.</p>
