   <p>According to recently compiled statistics there are now one million chronic alcoholics in the United States. One third of this number die annually as victims of their vice, and are replaced by as many new recruits who each year join the army of drinkers, thus keeping the main body intact.</p>
   <p>Impartial sociologists realize that this situation constitutes one of the most serious problems of our times.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of medical authorities which took place in New York City not long ago ways and means of preventing and remedying this evil were discussed, and several proposals were submitted. Among other things, it was suggested that a number of institutions be established especially equipped for the treatment and cure of alcoholics, and that school children be given instruction on the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>destructive effects of liquor. Direct legislative and punitive measures were also mentioned.</p>
   <p>However, it seems clear that not much progress can be made as long as society itself does not shrink from making cash profits from the liquor traffic.</p>
   <p>Deterrent measures taken in order to discourage drinking differ considerably in severity and effectiveness. Some are humane, even helpful, while others have no place in a civilized society. As an example of the narrow-minded reformer who does the cause more harm than good, we give you the minister of Seattle, Washington, who from his pulpit proposed that drunkards be punished by whipping, the number of strokes to be determined by the degree of their offense.</p>
   <p>While such discussions are going on, "wets" and "drys" are having it out on other fronts, with varying success. The battlefield is world-wide, and a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>misdirected demand for personal liberty, together with a selfish desire for profits, even if these profits be made at the expense of other people's misery, are the most dangerous enemies of the temperance cause. But those who believe in human progress will not abandon the hope that this problem is surely, if slowly, moving toward a satisfactory solution.</p>
