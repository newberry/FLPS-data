   <p>The Swedish Illinois Republicans gathered in Chicago to lay plans and at the same time commemorate John Ericsson. Last Tuesday, from Chicago and all parts of Illinois, as well as other States, the Swedes gathered at the Swedish-American Republican Annual meeting and festival. It was the 17th Convention held, and it had a greater attendance than any previous affair. In the large hall on the 6th floor of the Auditorium Hotel the meeting was called to order by its president, Assistant State's Attorney Oscar D. Olson. Delegates from Bureau, Cook, DeKalb, Dupage, Ford, Fulton, Henry, Kane, Kendall, Knox, Livingston, McLean, Mercer, Ogle, Peoria, Rock Island, Sangamon, Warren, Will and Winnebago counties were present. Those present took in the sights of our large city. Cook had the largest number of delegates, one hundred altogether. Kane was next with forty-two. The business progressed rapidly, and the delegates were confronted with the job of selecting party leaders. Charles R. Hurburgh, of Galesburg, Ill., was elected president; Gus Johnson, of Rockford, vice-president; <span class="page-break">\2</span>John Kjellander, of Chicago, secretary; J. F. Peterson, from Geneva, was re-elected as treasurer. A resolution to oppose the direct primary law was adopted. A reason for this was that if a majority of the delegates talked in favor of this law, it would mean the same as supporting Senator Hopkins, and this the convention delegates did not wish to do. President Roosevelt's Administration was praised and hope was expressed that President Taft would follow in Roosevelt's footsteps. Even Governor Deneen's Administration was praised. Resolutions were adopted regarding the new waterway project. It was also decided to erect a monument to John Ericsson, to be completed not later than Mar. 13, 1912, and to unveil it at that time.</p>
   <p>The new president is one of the most prominent Swedes of the State. He was born Jan. 10, 1872 in Sweden, but was only one year old when his parents emigrated to this country and took up residence at Altona, Ill., where he grew up. After finishing his college education, graduating from both Abingdon <span class="page-break">\3</span>Normal College and Knox College, he served as a professor in the Magnon, Ill., schools for five years. In 1900 he became Deputy Sheriff of Knox County; in 1902 he was elected Sheriff and was elected again in 1904. In 1906 he was elected Senator and has taken an active part in legislation.</p>
   <p>At 8 o'clock the hall was filled with 500 Swedes. The celebration in memory of Captain John Ericsson was to take place here. This work with the "Monitor" was commemorated, and here some of the outstanding sons of this country were to speak about the craftiness of mother Sweden's children who have been adopted by the United States. The old Swedish flag, with its heaven blue and golden yellow, with the white stars on the blue, hung on the speakers' table. A particular pleasant sight was Major General Frederick Dent Grant, with his full dress uniform, taking part in the banquet.</p>

   <p>He was received as if he were the President of the United States. Men cheered and applauded the stately old soldier. Master of ceremonies was Axel E. Thompson. Among the speakers was Lieutenant-Governor Eberhardts, of Minnesota, who spoke in memory of the inventor of the "Monitor." Former State Senator Berry, from Carthage, spoke warmly and enthusiastically of Illinois, historically and institutionally. General Grant's speech was accepted with a great deal of enthusiasm. A.C. Bartlett talked about "Affairs and Politics." Former Senator Mason also spoke. The next convention will be held in Galesburgh, Ill.</p>
