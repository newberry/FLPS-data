   <p>A truly important event will take place a few days hence when the citizens of Cook County go to the polls to elect fourteen judges to the Circuit Court for a six-year term. It is self-evident that a good judge must be a man of keen judgment, unbiased, and unbribable, and at the same time possess a thorough knowledge of the law. A judge certainly should be a man, in the best sense of the word, with both brain and heart in the right place, and it is of the greatest importance that the best men be elected to the office, regardless of political affiliations. A judge should be above politics.</p>
   <p>We want to remind our countrymen of the Swedish candidate Edwin A. Olson, who has the endorsement of the Chicago Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary now to repeat what we have previously said about Mr. Olson, <span class="page-break">\2</span>except to say that he is unusually well fitted for the judgeship, and we do urge all Swedish-American voters to cast their ballots for him on election day, June 7.</p>
