   <p>p. 5. The Greek school "Socrates" will give a three day Bazaar at the school building.</p>
   <p>All the societies and merchants are urged to send their merchandise, either to the committees that go every where for that purpose, or to the school directly. The School depends for its existence upon the generosity and munificence of our people.</p>
   <p>When our committees are visiting your stores do not let them leave empty handed. The School is yours, your property, your institution. Give until it hurts. That is the Greek spirit.</p>
   <p>Socrates School.</p>
