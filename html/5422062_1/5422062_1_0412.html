   <p>As matters stand now, it is evident that the Greek youth will spend the rest of their lives in America. The problem of keeping the Greek spirit alive in these young people is facing us today. Let us examine the methods by which this could be done.</p>
   <p>First, and probably most important, is the Greek school. But a fine school with proper teachers and learning facilities, not the kind that exists today and serves only as a burden to the churches.</p>
   <p>The Greek schools should be well organized under one head. This head would be under the supervision of the Greek Churches. The buildings should be light and conducive to study and inspiration. If the schools were properly <span class="page-break">2</span>run, they would attract all the Greek youth to their doors.</p>
   <p>With the help of Mr. [Mickolas A.] Salopoulos of the Saloniki, this is being attempted, and we feel that our dreams will be realized. We hope that our Greek youth will have the opportunity of studying the Greek language.</p>
