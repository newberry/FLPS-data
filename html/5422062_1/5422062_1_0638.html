   <p>The greatest curse that can befall an individual who frequents the Kaffenia [cafes] is for him to become a slave to gambling or card-playing.</p>
   <p>In one minute a man can lose the earnings derived from a week's or a month's labor. In these cafes there are professional card-sharps who prey upon innocent men who are seeking amusement at what they believe to be an honest gaming-table.</p>
   <p>Anyone who happens to be standing around, watching one of these card games will see and hear many ugly and demoralizing things. Avaricious faces, weak mouths, cunning eyes and foul words are common sights. While often as not the evening will terminate with a fight or a knifing.</p>
   <p>The police records of American cities are sufficient proof of the above statement.</p>

   <p>Arrests of twenty or thirty Greeks, for disturbances arising from gambling are a common occurrence. There is a funny side, even to this disgraceful story. It is customary for the Kaffenia to bear names such as "The Acropolis," or "The Venizelos". Therefore it is not unusual to see an account of an arrest, in an American newspaper that reads something like this: "Parthenon and seventeen other Greeks arrested"; or that: "Acropolis and Venizelos arrested". The names Acropolis and Venizelos are believed to be the names of the cafe proprietors. So it is evident, that we are even exposing ourselves to ridicule, which is, at times, even worse than disgrace.</p>
   <p>In the eyes of the American people, gambling is considered a disgraceful and sinful pastime. Because they are very practical people, they believe that gambling is a form of cheating or stealing. They consider a gambler to be a very undesirable person and place no trust in him.</p>
   <p>Of course, all card-players are not gamblers. Many of our young men, innocently play cards to amuse themselves for a few hours. However, by doing so, they are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>confronted by two dangers. One is, that they will develop the card-playing habit which is as easy to form as a drug-habit; and the other is, that by hanging around these cafes, they will acquire bad associates and immoral habits. All, of these things can only bring ruin and disgrace to a young man. No good can come from any of them.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all the Greeks, who immigrate to these shores to keep their conduct and their morals so high that they will gain the respect of the American people. Card playing is demoralizing for the soul and ruinous to the financial status of the player and his dependants. It puts disgrace and shame upon the Greek name and must be done away.</p>
   <p>Down with card-playing!</p>
