   <p>The Bootblacks Protective Union, No. 17852 affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, through its president, Mr. A. Peponis, won an important case in the Criminal court.</p>
   <p>The result was that one of the leaders of the terroristic mob was convicted and sent to a penal institution, his name was J. Sandler. The other two named Wm. Shaw and R. Burke, are fugitives of the law.</p>
   <p>The three hoodlums, self-styled organizers, of shoe repair shops, extorted money from Greeks, by forcing them to become members of their organization. The refusal of the Greeks was rewarded with breaking of windows of shops, and other terrorisms. The conviction of Sandler ended the mob-rule.</p>
