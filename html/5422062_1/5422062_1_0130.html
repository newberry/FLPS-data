   <p>All American students use the letters of the Greek alphabet as names for their fraternities and sororities. It was about time for Greek students also to name their societies with Greek letters; and credit for initiating this custom is due to the Greek students of Grand College, who recently chose for their emblem the letters, Phi Sigma Epsilon, which stand for the Greek words meaning Educational Society of Greeks.</p>
   <p>This brilliant society consisting of fifty Greek boys under the presidency of Theodore Mouzakiotis, will hold its first ceremony next Monday from 10:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. A beautifully arranged program awaits those who attend with George Spannon, lawyer, as the speaker of the day. He will talk on the purpose of the organization and the value of cooperation. The first ceremony of the Educational Society of Greeks was held at Grand College, 2245 Jackson Blvd.</p>
