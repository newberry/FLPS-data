   <p>Heretofore Greek immigrants have arrived in America, that is, men and women, young and old, boys and girls, likewise queer musical instruments, loom-woven blankets, dried fruits, rare liquors, and what not, but a Greek immigrant dog had never before set foot in Castle Garden, Ellis Island.</p>
   <p>The dog Ivanof whose picture you see below is the first immigrant to arrive in this country and was sent to Mr. John Christaros, a coffee merchant in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Ivanof, a native of Kilkis, wears around his neck a war medal for distinguishing himself as an enemy of the Bulgarians. His spying was very valuable to the Evzones.</p>

   <p>We advise Mr. Christaros, for the peace and welfare of Chicago, to keep this new addition to the Greek community far away from Bulgarians, lest a Chicago Greco-Bulgarian war should break out, which undoubtedly would be disastrous for the Bulgarians, who are in the minority.</p>
