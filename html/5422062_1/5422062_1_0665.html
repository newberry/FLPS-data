   <p>Does a girl make a good match through sheer luck, or from her personal attributes? This is a question that has puzzled Greek parents for hundreds of years. In fact, parents of all nationalities. No one has ever figured out the right conclusion, because each one analyzes the problem from a subjective point of view. The parents of girls who have made successful marriages--and the girls themselves--assert that a girl must be worthy and have many commendable attributes if she is to get a good husband. They believe that if a girl is attractive, well-built, and has a pleasing personality she will automatically find happiness in her married life. For this reason, we often hear it said that this girl or that did not deserve her fate. This is also why a girl who does not marry early or well is said to be lacking in some certain qualities.</p>
   <p>Then, there is another school of thought among our people. Parents who are adherents of this school preach that a girl gains nothing by sitting at home with folded hands. They are the proponents of the hunting method. Therefore they pursue a prospective male as assiduously as a hunter stalks his game. They, too, are sure that this is the only successful way to get a good husband for a marriageable daughter.</p>
   <p>There are still others who maintain that pure luck, or fate, is the main factor involved. They base their arguments upon certain more or less undeniable facts. They point out the many lovely, talented, respectable, and refined girls who marry late in life and, even then, do not make good matches. Somehow, they cannot be blamed for believing that marriage is a matter of luck. Every day one sees some girl who has come from a small village in Greece marry a fine young man before she has been in America a month; while some cultured girl who could have been an asset to a husband, and is more fitted to live in the American atmosphere, remains unmarried. Another argument which has never been answered satisfactorily is that a widow or a divorcee with children often finds a husband, while some single girl cannot.</p>
   
   <p>Although some people believe in fate and others in worth, the great majority of them are certain that the existence of a sizable dowry is the surest, shortest route to a good marriage. The larger the dowry, the better the marriage, they contend. People who believe that a dowry is the best inducement to a fine match, cannot be condemned as mercenary. They have seen the power and influence of money in their everyday lives. They know it is the best bait for a fine young professional man, or a wealthy man's son. They also present some of its other advantages. They say, for instance, that an ugly girl who otherwise would remain unmarried often secures a husband because of her dower. All men--aside from those youths who marry for love in the period when a young man wants his heart's desire and nothing less--love money and its power; as a result, they will prefer a girl having a dowry. In fact, because of the money involved, many Greek men have been known to marry women who were actually repellent to them. Although many elegible men protest their lack of interest except in finding a good partner, curiously enough, their first question is still, "Has she a dowry?"</p>
   
   <p>Perhaps the dowry is an evil custom which has caused great unhappiness among Greek families, but it seems to be a necessary evil. The truth of the matter is that the more fortunate parents are in favor of this custom which enables them to obtain the best marriage prospects for their daughters. But, actually there is only one benefit connected with a marriage dower. A girl who has a dowry goes to her husband on a more independent and more nearly equal footing than one who has not. She feels that she is not a burden to him and that, therefore, he is, in a way, obligated to her. As a result, there is usually more equality and consideration manifest in their married life than would otherwise be the case. Perhaps that is why divorces are so few in countries in which the marriage dower is the custom.</p>
