   <p>The members of the Greek Students Delta Epsilon Pi Club of the university of Illinois wish to publicly thank all those who hastened to sponsor their recent dance. Aside from those who attended, they want to thank the various Chicago and New York Greek newspapers that announced and advertised the dance, the Rusetas Ice Cream Co. which donated the refreshments, and Mr. N. Limperis for the flowers. These university students worked hard to make the dance a success and they are grateful to the Greek people for making it so. They are eager to have more Greek students at Illinois, and ask all high School graduates to consider enrolling there.</p>
   <p>Members of the club are D. Panagopoulos, President; B. Brinios, vice-president; N. Sotiras, Secretary; J. Kilavos, Treasurer; and K. Alexopoulos, N. Doukas, K. Zannis, B. Lambros, N. Limperis, G. Dikonomos, P. Papadupoulos, A. Sakelaropoulus, K. Triantafillos, and B. Hambilomatis.</p>
