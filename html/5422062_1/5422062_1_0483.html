   <p>P. 3. -- Both the West Side and the South Side churches have for a long time maintained Greek schools for our boys and girls. Over three hundred pupils attend classes in these two schools. But why has the North Side church as yet no school? Why is the matter neglected? Are the boys and girls of the North Side to be deprived of the opportunity to study the Greek language and Greek traditions?</p>
   <p>Let us hope that our fellow-Greeks of the North Side will soon see the necessity of a school and follow the example of the other two churches.</p>
