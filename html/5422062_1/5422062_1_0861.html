   <p>p. 1.- During these days Halsted Street is in its glory. Greeks from very distant quarters come to the Greek quarter, the capital as they call it, to procure their Easter provisions, such as Easter cakes, pastries, lambs alive or roasted, and candles for the Sepulcher and the Resurrection (Easter-mass).</p>
   <p>The Greek people wish to celebrate their Easter with all the magnificence possible and they do not care about the expense.</p>
   <p>The churches also are crowded with people during the night. Masses and hymns for the Sepulcher were sung by young girls, quartettes and by singers with the finest of voices. The churches of Holy Trinity, Saint Nickol's Assumption, and Saint Spyridon of Pullman, adhering to native customs, took around the Sepulchers with lights and music, and the American people followed this beautiful spectacle with admiration.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greek continues in its national traditions and the new generation is just as Greek as the ones who immigrated here from Greece.</p>
