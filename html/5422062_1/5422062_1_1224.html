   <p>Mr. P. S. Lambros</p>
   <p>424-425, New Era Bldg. Chicago</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Your touching expression of sympathy, and those of our Greek friends, in the appalling disaster which has stricken our country, so terribly, have been received with deep appreciation by myself and by the Committee of Relief of the Italian Colony.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank you very heartily for the subscription started by your paper, and the amount already collected; the remittance of which will be very highly appreciated especially if forwarded at once, possibly before eleven o'clock of the 2d day of January, 1909, as we shall be cabling at that time, and as every dollar transmitted now is worth five dollars a week hence. Allow us in return to beg you and your countrymen to accept our best wishes for the coming year.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>SABETTA</p>
   <p>For the executive committee</p>
