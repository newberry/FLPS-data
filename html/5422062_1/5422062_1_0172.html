   <p>p. 2- The twenty-four night schools of Chicago, which closed for the season last Friday, report the number of students attending classes and their various nationalities. In the school at Monroe and Morgan Streets, 325 of 723 students were Greeks. In the Jones School at Harrison Street and Plymouth Court, 192 of 500 students were Greeks.</p>
   <p>The new term begins on October 3, and it is believed that the number of Greeks attending classes will be much larger than in the past because many Greeks have an idea of going into business for themselves.</p>
