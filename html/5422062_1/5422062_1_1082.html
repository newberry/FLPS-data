   <p>The proudest man in Chicago today is Tom Sherman of 6558 Greenwood Avenue.</p>
   <p>Eleutherios Venizelos, acclaimed by many "the greatest citizen of Greece," recognized him as he sat in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel and crossed the entire length of the room to speak with him.</p>
   <p>"Tom, I greet you," the world-renowned statesman explained, laying his hands upon the youth's broad shoulders. "May I ask you ...what is your mission here?"</p>
   <p>Sherman, who had gone to the hotel in the hope that he might get a glance of his friend, was radiant. He explained that he now resided in Chicago and was operating his own confectionery store at 9500 Michigan Avenue.</p>

   <p>During the Balkan war of 1912-14 Sherman was personal chauffeur for M. Venizelos. He drove him and Solon W. Chomarianos, surgeon general of the Greek armies, to all points along the line of fighting.</p>
   <p>"What do you think of the former premier?" Sherman was asked.</p>
   <p>"Venizelos is the greatest man who ever lived," came his instant, fervent answer. "He is very kind and very just. That is the most one can say of any man."</p>
   <p>Representatives from the Greek Ladies Charitable association greeted Mme. Venizelos during the morning. This organization devotes itself to the promotion of Greek welfare in this country. Included in its delegation were Mesdames C. H. Demetry, president. Anton Deligianis, John Askounis, T. K. Valos, C. Theodore, Hercules Aphamasopoulos and Angelos Geokaris.</p>

   <p>This was the first public appearance of the gracious woman who became a bride shortly before their trip to America. Except for an interview with a reporter from The Daily Journal, she has seen only those intimate friends whose acquaintance dates back to days passed together in Greece, England, or in Red Cross headquarters in France. While her husband has been receiving delegations of countrymen, she has been touring Michigan Boulevard, the Art institute and the loop stores incognito.</p>
   <p>Fifteen thousand Greeks are expected to attend the special mass at St. Constantine's Greek Orthodox Church on Sunday, when M. Venizelos and his wife worship there. Among those coming from distant cities to the services are M. and Mme. Jannopoulo of St. Louis. He was official representative of Greece at the Louisiana Purchase exposition, and is now Consul General.</p>
   <p>A message from Gov. Small to P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, was received Friday, inviting M. Venizelos to visit Springfield and lay a wreath upon the tomb of Lincoln. The Venizelos party will leave Sunday night for Santa Barbara, where they will pass a three-month vacation.</p>
