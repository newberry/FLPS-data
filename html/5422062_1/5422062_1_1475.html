   <p>A strong spirit of nationalism has been steadily growing among all classes of people of all nations in which the people are still free. Before the World War this spirit expressed itself in the guise of patriotism. However, the postwar period--especially the last five years--has seen the replacement of patriotism with nationalism. At first thought this may not seem significant, but an analysis of the basis of nationalism proves its importance beyond doubt.</p>
   <p>This movement is based upon the belief that one nation or race is far superior to any other--a conception which is never involved in feelings of patriotism. This new spirit which has gripped the hearts and minds of modern people is a natural outgrowth of the World War--the war which created two new problems for every one it solved--that is, if it solved any. At present the attitude of all peoples is intensely and acutely nationalistic. We hope that the new <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>channels of thought and the new social systems which are making their appearance will lessen this dangerous kind of thinking, and that man will regain his sense of moral, political, and patriotic balance.</p>
