   <p>Five thousand Greeks gathered at the Auditorium Theatre to witness the play of the Greek Drama, "Thaskalitaa," performed by six hundred pupils of the school "Socrates." The great success of the performance was attributed to the hearty co-operation of the various Greek societies. Noted amongst them were, "The Society of Young Greek Girls"; "The Lovers of Music"; "The New Generation"; "The Greek Youth", etc.</p>
   <p>Congratulations for the Directors of the Greek School, who leave nothing undone that should be done for the exevation of Greek culture.</p>
