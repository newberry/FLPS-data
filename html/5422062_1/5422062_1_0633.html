   <p>An American who had recently arrived from the United States entered an aristocratic bar a few days ago in the after-midnight hours and asked the waiter for a cocktail.</p>
   <p>"Impossible, sir," answered the waiter, who happened to speak a little English.</p>
   <p>"Well, then, give me whisky and soda."</p>
   <p>"Sorry, sir, but not even that."</p>
   <p>"The devil!" shouted the American angrily. "I want to drink! Give me any kind of liquor."</p>
   <p>"I am sorry," said the waiter again, with an expression of genuine grief at being unable to satisfy a customer of whom he would have received a good tip. "I can give you absolutely nothing because we must close. The hour is getting late, and there is a policeman outside."</p>

   <p>"What the devil!" exclaimed the American in anger. "Is such a thing allowed in a civilized country? Why don't you also pass a prohibition law so that people may drink any time they choose?"</p>
