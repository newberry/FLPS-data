   <p>p. 6.- We extend our grateful thanks to Woodlawn Chapter No. 93 for its kind and gracious act in giving thirty dollars a month to the teacher who goes three times a week to teach the Greek children of the Chicago Orphanage Asylum. This shows the true Christian spirit and we are very proud of these Ahepans.</p>
