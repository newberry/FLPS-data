   <p>According to G. F. Zook, United States Commissioner of Education, the number of school-age children in America who do not attend any school whatsoever is over two million. Over two thousand schools, in half the states, did not open this fall. On top of all that, sixteen institutions of higher learning have been forced to close their doors. As we pointed out sometime ago, the public-school system is on the verge of breaking down.</p>
   <p>And all this because school boards are composed of men who think in terms of dollars and cents and are mentally equipped to work as bartenders rather than as directors and managers of the education of the youth of the land. Our entire superstructure of modern civilization is the result of public education. If we allow that to fail, then we shall automatically revert and become semibarbarians.</p>
