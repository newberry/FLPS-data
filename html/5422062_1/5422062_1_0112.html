   <p>Next week, 20,000,000 American pupils will resume their studies in the American schools. Chicago, during 1930-1931, will spend $40,000,000 for educational purposes.</p>
   <p>What have the thousand of Greeks in Chicago done for their children's education? In proportion to the Americans, we should give $800,000 to this worthy cause. It will be amazing if we give $80,000, not because we can't afford it, but because we continue to function as of twenty-five years ago. We do not realize that the world is progressing and is leaving us behind.</p>
   <p>We must either give our children proper schools and proper teachers or stop trying to give them a Greek education altogether, especially if we insist on using old methods and systems.</p>
   <p>The Greek education of our young generation must become a problem of every Greek in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago. We need every single person's help in fostering Greek education for our children and preserving the Greek language in America.</p>
