   <p>The dance given by the Kastriton Society last Sunday night, for the benefit of the Greek schools of Chicago, was a tremendous success. It was attended by nearly three thousand people, and was dignified and enjoyable throughout the entire evening. The assembled guests had a fine time at this long-to-be remembered evening.</p>
   <p>The organizers and supporters of this dance are to be congratulated for their interest in such a patriotic and progressive cause. The pictures taken at the dance are available to all who wish to purchase them.</p>
