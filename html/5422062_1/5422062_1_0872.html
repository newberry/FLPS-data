   <p>Pomp and a pretty baby girl brought water from the river Jordan and a bishop all the way from Boston to-day for the christening of the wee but important daughter of Mr. and Mr. John Raklios, 6326 Sheridan Road.</p>
   <p>Virginia Rose, exactly eight months old, the youngest member of the Raklios household, entered the Greek Orthodox Church as scarcely any other baby ever did.</p>
   <p>Little Virginia may not have appreciated the finery, but perhaps even an eight-month old baby can admire a layette as complete as that presented to her by her god-mother, Mrs. Ariadne Lambros.</p>

   <p>Bishop Alexopoulos, aided by Father Constantine Demitry and Deacon Michael Masokopakis, performed the ceremony of baptism and confirmation and administered holy communion to the baby girl.</p>
   <p>The baptismal font in the drawing-room of the Raklios mansion was decorated with an American flag. To-night there will be an even greater celebration, and two hundred guests will be entertained by Mr. Raklios in the Gold Room of the Congress Hotel.</p>
