   <p>The great accomplishments of the world seem to be made by persons of good character. Our advancement is due not to the plodding ordinary individual, but to the person of spiritual strength. For example, take a child whose character is well defined and good, and compare its life's progress with that of a child whose character is common and undependable. Nine times out of ten the undependable and ordinary child will end up by working for the unusual child.</p>
   <p>History also gives examples. George Washington was an unusual character. Aaron Burr was a common individual, but he was considered a man with a great mind. Nevertheless, he was not trusted, while people swore by the name of Washington. People who show themselves to be dependable are trusted.</p>

   <p>The same is true in the business world. Much swindling has been done by concerns that were of evil character. They fooled people by giving insincere advice concerning their investments.</p>
   <p>Concerns of the greatest dependability are the ones that survived and were successful in the end. When you are doing business with an organization. make sure that it is of good, dependable character.</p>
   <p>By doing so you insure your own safety.</p>
