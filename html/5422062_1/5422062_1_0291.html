   <p>The organization of the Greek schools in America must become the primary point of our discussions towards which all our attention must be turned. On this point, primarily, we request the attention of the Legate because his mission is closely connected with the organization of the Greek schools in America, which ought to be placed under the direct supervision of the church rule, for the sake of their early function and their unified organization.</p>
   <p>It is about time, after all, that it should be understood, that the communities, despite all their efforts and their good intentions to establish schools, have failed in their management, and that the existing schools do not correspond with their mission. Nor is it possible for them to ever fulfill the same, if the manner of their governing does not change. The job of directing our schools is over and above the powers of those who govern the communities. It requires specific knowledge and communities who manage the schools know either the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> teachers, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>er how to schedule the school program.</p>
   
   <p>For all <span class="gap">[gap]</span> reasons mentioned, the school must be subordinated to a uniform supervision and of such there is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in America <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the electrical authority. That is why we appeal to the Most Rev. Legate and implore his attention as one from whom the Greek people of America, beside the solution of the church problem, demand the formation of a Central School Committee, under the presidency of the Archbishop, and which will assume the directorship of the Greek schools in America. It also should provide them with a fit tutoring personnel, and schedule the program according to the environment and needs of the Greek children.</p>
   <p>Of course, we do not mean to say that the communities would be relieved of the burden of supporting their schools, and expect everything from the ecclesiastical authority.</p>
   <p>The schools will remain always communal and their financial support will be borne by the communities, and it is today, but the church authority will council them in the different matters not within their scope, so that, by the cooperation of all with the church authority, the schools will attain their goal and become worthy of their mission.</p>
