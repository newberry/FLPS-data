   <p>A lawyer was telling about one of his cases. A sober, well-respected Greek family man came to him for advice one day. His house, he said, was falling down. When the lawyer tried to refer him to a real estate agent, he explained that his daughter was in love and therefore the foundation of his home shaken.</p>
   <p>"Aren't you glad?" the lawyer replied. "Love is no sin. You should be proud of her."</p>
   <p>The worried old man told his story as follows: The girl had fallen in love with an Irishman. To her father this meant disaster. The boy was merely taking advantage of her. He was young, lazy, scatterbrain, having nothing but a Ford and dimes to feed it gasoline. When the girl's father found out, he whipped her and threatened to send her to Greece. He tried to marry her to two or three Greek fellows, but the girl replied they were "old Greek men". The father, who is afraid his daughter will run away, states he is a broad-minded man. Still he admits that the girl should marry someone she loves, a hard-working, honest man, but Greek!</p>
   <p>"If Greek men marry American women, why shouldn't Greek girls marry American men?" the lawyer asked.</p>
   <p>"We marry American women to established homes and support wives and to raise children," the father replied. "That is different."</p>
   <p>He left without explaining where the difference lay.</p>
   <p>Many Greek parents will be confronted with this problem from time to time, and each must solve it in his own way. In a few years from now, it may not make such a big difference. Our associations with other nationalities might change some of our views a little. Who can tell?</p>
   
   <p>We dedicate his name to immortality. It is Samuel Walrock, and we wish that some one of his caliber might be found in Chicago for the sake of families which have many children and are reduced to despair when they try to find lodgings.</p>
