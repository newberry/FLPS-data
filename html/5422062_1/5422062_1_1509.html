   <p>Another remarkable speech was delivered to the nation by the President on Wednesday night, his immediate audience being the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ of America who were assembled in Washington for their twenty-fifth anniversary.</p>
   <p>This last speech was the most clear-cut of all the President's addresses. In it, he came out openly with statements to the effect that his object was to uplift the masses of the people--even though this is done at a loss to the capitalistic class. He talked of socially-controlled prosperity, which is equivalent to saying that the Government will see to it that no man, woman, or child goes without the necessities of life.</p>
   <p>Truly, this country is entering upon a new era which, from all indications, promises to be finer than its predecessor. By all standards of reasoning the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>course that the Administration is following has all the qualities of high statesmanship. Errors will surely be made. Strong opposition will have to be enlightened, and, in many cases, fought; but the ultimate result will be a victory for justice, righteousness, and a square deal for all.</p>
   <p>For this state of affairs the government alone can pave the way. What the present Administration has accomplished until now may not be miraculous; but it is nevertheless worthy of the admiration of the average man and woman of America.</p>
