   <p>The troubled condition of the world in these days of war, revolution, and profiteering makes it necessary for every racial group to forget its differences and make a sincere effort to live in harmony with the other races of which America is composed. Care must he taken that the internal and "external" [i. e., inter-group and homeland] problems of the groups should not become the cause of enmity or hatred among them. The problems of the [American] nation should be the only problems, and all the foreign groups should submerge their own until the national problems are solved. The national dangers can only be overcome by a united front of loyal, patriotic citizens.</p>
   <p>Each race or nation has many and varied needs which must be fulfilled. The extent to which they are fulfilled is in proportion to the effort and sacrifice made by the individuals comprising the race or country. A country must have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>domestic peace if such factors as religion and religious beliefs, educational facilities, military organization, commerce, transportation, and every other activity engaged in by a society or nation, are to operate at their highest rate of efficiency. No barriers or antagonisms should be put in the path of our country's progress at this period of its history.</p>
   <p>It has been proven that only those nations whose citizens are willing to make sacrifices, and to live together harmoniously, have become great powers. This theory is not only true of nations, but of groups, races, communities, and church parishes, also. And so we come to the point we wish to emphasize: in the United States there are thousands of Greeks who are united by their common religion and customs. These Greeks must rise above their own petty desires when the interests of the Greeks--as a racial group--are at stake. This must be done even if it means sacrificing individualism. We Greeks must govern all our actions so that they do not injure us as a group. We must elect capable people to direct our churches and schools.</p>
   <p>The clergy must exercise especial care when giving advice. Theirs is a sacred <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>trust, and they must emulate the brood hen who hides her chicks under her wings at the slightest hint of danger. The council of each church must be composed of serene, intelligent men who are aware of the heavy responsibilities the position entails. Good judgment and a strong sense of justice must be theirs.</p>
   <p>The professional men--who are really the ones to make an impression upon the other races--must possess integrity and stability. Their lives must be exemplary in order that they may keep the respect of the society they serve, and from which they obtain their living.</p>
   <p>Journalism--the foundation stone of any successful society--is duty bound to print the unbiased truth and to influence the opinion of the group in the right direction. The nation must come first, and then the individuals who comprise it. That is something the journalist must never forget.</p>
   <p>The rest of the members of the society in which we live must conduct themselves in a manner befitting citizens of this great country. Harmonious and co-operative action will benefit all concerned. But as long as our race continues in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>its egoistic, superior, jealous, and backbiting ways, it will not be of any help to its generous foster motherland. As long as our churches are not conscious of their sacred duty; as long as our children are not taught to respect the wishes and thoughts of others, we shall not be worthy of being called American citizens. Until then, our country, our society, and our church are not secure. This is not an individual problem, and no one individual can solve it alone. The time has come for concerted action and thought on the part of all the people of America. However, the Greeks in particular are in need of self-denial and self-abasement more so than others.</p>
