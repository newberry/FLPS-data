   <p>A well known Greek, who belongs to the Republican Party, criticized me the other day when I accidentally met him, for publishing an article titled "Mob Masters." However, what I wrote was not due to animosity, on my part, or to any other emotion. I simply said that the Republican party has recruited for this election especially the best mob masters and demagogues it has, in order to win the election. Because of some accusations <span class="gap">[gap]</span> made, I desired to tell him a few things publicly so that he may understand what my motives were in publishing this article.</p>
   <p>The law of the African jungle, for the people that lived and still live there, is cruel. But the law of Wall St. within our civilization and skyscrapers, has made here life more miserable than that of the African jungle. I wonder if he has any doubt as to that? Well, my friend, this law cannot be eternal! It cannot be eternal because people change their minds and this change in thought must be shared by those who profess they are or desire to be, leaders. Do not forget that Rome fell just because its leaders did not want to change their opinions and face the new situation with fearless and steady eyes.</p>

   <p>Do not forget that no nation, no matter how rich it may be, can forever build up marble skyscrapers, loading everything on the backs of the toiling workers and farmers, nor can laws last which eternally favor only one class of people, regardless of whether these people are called Duponts, Morgans, Rockefellers, or Fords, and, it is inconsequential; how much power, material or mental, these people possess. No power can oppress, indefinitely, millions of people, so long as these people know it and are in position to think! Failure to recognize this thing was way civilizations fall in the past. The civilizations of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Tyros, Sidon, Greece, Rome, Carthage.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, you must not forget this, that in this crisis conditions do not improve immediately or by self-measures, nor can one medicine cure all maladies. And if in this, the richest country in the world see that poverty, ignorance and brutality, in the many is something altogether wrong and illogical, improvement is impossible.</p>

   <p>I had this in wind when I wrote that article, under the title "Mob Masters." We have believed, and we still believe that every man who sets himself against Governmental progressive effort is a timid man used to prejudiced ideas, who is afraid of tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Anacharsis once said, "That social system is the best, under which the least injury inflicted upon one is to be considered as inflicted upon all." The many today are suffering and as such they need neither our pity nor our philanthropy, they need only justice.</p>
