   <p>Those who are familiar with Greek literature know well the meaning of the saying, "Do not touch the anagyris." This plant's distinguishing characteristic is that it gives off a disgusting odor when touched or moved. When we use the saying, we mean, "Do not mention or bring up for discussion a subject from which the most painful impressions will be gained."</p>
   <p>Exactly this could be said about the Greeks here in Chicago and in America generally. The same advice would be given to the sociologist seeking to study and report on our racial, national, and community life in America. Such would be the case because the greater part of our Greek people, thanks to our corrupt organs of opinion and to our clergy, has been transformed into an anagyris, which, upon being touched, gives off its hideous smell. Yes, this unbearable odor has paralyzed our minds and has so corrupted us that we are unable to retain any prestige either socially or politically. This <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>degeneration and corruption of ours, however, is not only affecting us as a group but has begun to annoy the American people, who, their patience exhausted, may soon demand a house cleaning, and may resort to economic pressure of a sort that will quickly result in our ruin.</p>
   <p>In order that we may not be considered unjust and superficial in our criticism, and at the same time diggers of our own graves, let us begin straightforwardly and honestly by asking our people in every branch of endeavor and in every occupation a few questions. By this means it will become clear whether or not we are justly criticizing Greek officials and leaders, and whether or not we are sincere in our discussion.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning, as evidence of our sincerity of purpose and our true patriotism and our interest in our common destiny, we address the first inquiry to ourselves--to the publishers and editors of the Greek press: Are we true journalists? Do we understand the great significance of our mission in society and in the state? Or have we become news gatherers and journalists <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for mercenary purposes, wearing the mask of the journalist to defraud the people and mislead the simple-minded folk who are in need of social and intellectual instruction and enlightenment? Do we believe in our calling, or are we playing a farce at our own expense as well as at the expense of others?</p>
   <p>Even if we are true to our purposes and intentions, an observer might properly ask us: "What are your qualifications, wise and brilliant Greek journalists in America? Are you in a position to exercise your profession? Can you justly claim to be sociologists, and preachers of sermons, and exponents of the good life? In other words, what is your past and what is your knowledge, that you undertake the responsibility of so great a mission? Where and how have you been taught to offer intellectual and social enlightenment to others? Is it not true that your own lamp is extinguished and even lacks the small amount of oil necessary for your own illumination? You have evidently not heard, since your education appears to have been a meager one, the saying that 'if you are to save others, it is necessary to consume oil instead of wine'.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Have you studied at night by the light of a lamp, or have you wasted your time in saloons and taverns?"</p>
   <p>If we cannot answer these questions creditably, we will no doubt claim that we are empiricists, that we are free-lancers. Even then, we may be told: "You admit that you have had no formal education, but claim that you have been taught through experience and application. Therefore, we ask you again: Have you understood the requirements of a journalist? Yes or no? Have you not heard that the journalist must be, first of all, a man of encyclopaedic knowledge and good cultural background, and must possess, in addition, a high degree of social intelligence, if he is to teach and impose himself upon his readers? He must be a sincere lover of the truth; he must be of irreproachable character, above sordid material interests; and he must be courteous and self-sacrificing. A journalist must conduct himself with all due consideration for his fellow journalists; and he must be a loyal fighter for the interests of society and of the country in which he lives and for which he should be willing to make any sacrifice. Consequently, he must use the columns <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of his newspaper as intellectual storehouses from which the reader may draw mental food for his enjoyment and instruction. In this manner the reader may improve himself and prosper.</p>
   <p>"The newspaper is now used as an organ of deliberate falsehood, defamation, devilish machinations, and profanity, for all of which even the patrons of the cheapest taverns would be ashamed. May we ask what fruits you journalists have produced socially and nationally that you demand the respect of society? To whom shall be attributed the disastrous disunity and the unbearable strife existing among us? Have these not worked havoc with our community and with our national interests, thus reducing us to uselessness? Where is your courtesy and your co-operation, through which all would gain and by which you would make yourselves useful? What is the social good arising from your precious work? Degeneration, disorganization, condemnation, and inestimable material and moral disaster. This, in short, is your kind, and these are your doings, for which you have the insolence to ask our help."</p>
   <p>After the journalists, let us examine our priests, those whom, because of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>their high mission, we all look to for guidance. We submit the following questions to them: What is your mission and duty? Is it to read benedictions and confer blessings, to sing the "ra, riri, rau" and ask for collections, and to create factions for the service of your own material interests? Or is it to teach us the meaning of goodness, peace, love, tolerance, kindness, and the redemption of society through sacrifice? When you, with few exceptions, do not teach us these things and do not practice them, but do instead the exact opposite, then we, the laity, will doubt whether you are indeed true servants of God. It may be that you are followers and children of Ignatius Loyola, since you have proven that you do not possess the decency expected of clergymen. Have you exemplified love and virtue through your deeds? Have you inspired the people with confidence in your calling? Where are your instructive and enlightening sermons and your friendly relations with other members of the Orthodox clergy?</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Dollar worship, and professional hatred within your calling, prevent you from doing anything worthwhile. Since the great majority of you are not true servants of God, but merely black-robed decoys, why do we need you? To ridicule what is sacred? To build churches, which instead of becoming temples of peace, harmony, love, and consolation, become scenes of disputes, fights, and humiliation of our nationality and faith, as well as hiding-places for some of our most sinister activities?</p>
   <p>We now turn to our men of the professions, and we ask them: What is your duty to society as members of the various professions? Is it to commercialize your profession, or are you duty-bound to become social factors by means of lectures and appearances at public gatherings? Is there any unity among you? What are your accomplishments in the various Greek communities? Where is your consideration for members of the other professions? Have you ever spoken in public for the purpose of promoting our common interests, and have you taken the initiative in attempting to unite our many communities and lead them <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to the right course of action? Have we not heard and seen some of our men in the professions, who by some unforunate accident acquired a diploma, going about abusing other physicians, lawyers, and teachers? Why are you seeking for the cause of this deplorable situation among the uneducated masses, when it is your obligation to furnish intellectual guidance and enjoyment to them, since you are considered the intellectual leaders in any society?</p>
   <p>Let us also ask ourselves whether, as representatives of the various professions, we have been sufficiently trained, and are prepared to make the contribution expected of us. Why has our fountain dried up? Or are we contented merely to bear the weighty title of a member of the professional class? We are the life and pride of our nation. Our present activities and conduct may well mark the beginning of our downfall.</p>
   <p>We now address the businessmen, and ask them if they realize the true significance of business and commerce in society. The businessman is the ideal <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>conductor through which the life and activity of society circulates. He enriches and supports all the professions and occupations. Therefore, the businessman must be an exemplary character and worker. The foundations of his existence and progress are good faith and upright character. You know that the honesty and good will of the businessman, though intangible and abstract qualities, are his real fortune. Or do you believe that anyone can do business without adhering to some elementary business principles? A businessman, to be assured of success, does not so much need huge capital and great resources as he needs an understanding of proper methods and attitudes. He must also maintain a high social standing, so that he may effectively attempt to influence the community towards the bettering of existing conditions. In this respect, the value of a business club, or chamber of commerce, becomes immediately evident. By means of such an organization, Greek business enterprises can be systematically organized and promoted; and we can advertise to better advantage our own products and those imported from our homeland. Thus our homeland and our people here will both be greatly benefited.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>We now come to you, the people, the victims of the indifference of our political leaders and professional men. We speak to you who have been so shamelessly exploited in the past by your leaders. We now ask you: Why did you come to this country? In order to gamble, to indulge in every form of vice, to live in places that are unhealthy and polluted--both morally and from the standpoint of sanitation? Or did you come here to work, to progress, and to become prosperous, thus demonstrating that you have fulfilled your mission? Why have you, after kissing your parents and brothers good-bye in your native villege and crossing yourself in your small church, failed to improve here? Do you not know that you must live righteously and conduct yourself properly, respect other people's property, love both your native and your adopted country, attend church regularly, and love your fellow countryman as if he were your most beloved brother? And here you are doing these things [i. e.; the evil things mentioned previously: gambling, etc.]. At your death, in view of the reckless and miserable life you are leading, of what avail will your economies and savings be? When you condemn your fellow <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>countryman and speak evil of him, or allow others to do so, before the American people, are you not disgracing yourself--are you not digging your own grave? What opinion will the stranger have of you when he hears you attacking and abusing your own brother? Think calmly and you will find that the old saying, "whatever you do or see in your neighborhood will be visited upon your own home," is true.</p>
   <p>What is true of us as individuals is true of us as a group also. Should we not repent and change our ways by respecting one another, by co-operating and living in peace and harmony, knowing that the good fortune and success of our fellow countrymen will reflect honor upon us, too? Who will feed me if I am hungry, who will take care of me if I become sick, who will bury me if I die? No one but my brother, my fellow-countryman.</p>
   <p>The foreigner is always a foreigner. There is only one race, one people, that accepts the principle of brotherhood in regard to those who live, work, and prosper in this country; only one people helps you to progress and rejoices <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>in your success and prosperity, appreciates you and receives you within its warm bosom--the American people, with whom, we must admit, we have never tried to become very intimately associated.</p>
   <p>Let us unite, then, and let us seek to cultivate more intimate relations with our American environment, in order that we may attain happiness and success. If we do not follow the advice we have given, we shall become a social anagyris. Whoever ventures to touch us will stir up a most disgusting odor, until the day comes when the disagreeable plant will be utterly destroyed.</p>
