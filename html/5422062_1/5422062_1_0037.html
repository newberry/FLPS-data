   <p>p. 1.- We imagine that our readers carry in mind the annual dance that is to be given by the "Greek Women's University Club."</p>
   <p>We do not remember a time, since we were publishing the Greek Press, that any of the entertainments of any nature, given by the "Greek Women's University Club," were not of the best. We hope that all, without exception, who attended the dances, lectures, and receptions of the Women's University Club has the same opinion.</p>
   <p>The whole credit for the success of the dance, the main purpose of which is to strengthen the fund maintained by the club for the winners of scholarships by the Greek girls in different high school and colleges, will belong to all who will attend it.</p>
