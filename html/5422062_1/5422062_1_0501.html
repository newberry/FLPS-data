   <p>Literary men of world note have said, "When you are in doubt, read Greek." The divinity of the founder of Christianity could not have been fully revealed unless it had been expressed in Greek. Beauty, rhythm, harmony, and wisdom find their natural expressions in the Greek. language; and the knowledge of Greek must be acquired in school.</p>
   <p>We are delighted to learn that the Greek colony of Chicago, after long delay, has done the inevitable thing, that is, it has established a Greek school for our American-born children, and thus, as the saying goes, the coming generations will be able to converse with gods. Greek-American children educated in both languages are bound in years to come to shine much more brilliantly than any of their contemporaries. Greek-American youth, with American enviroment and American education and idealism supplemented by the knowledge of the Greek language and certain traditions of their immortal ancestors, will undoubtedly excel and become leaders among leaders. Is there in the world anything else better worthwhile than real mental development?</p>
   <p>A Greek school at last! The Greek community in Chicago, which is considered the largest in America, has two Greek churches already and two more in the making, but it has had no Greek school. This is the first to be established. The church could not function properly and effectively without schools. The true light of faith is revealed only through knowledge which is acquired in school. Let us hope that this is only the first of a number of Greek schools, and that others will soon be founded.</p>
   <p>The following is an excerpt from the Reverend Father Pegeas's address at the community's meeting to establish a Greek school:</p>
   <p>"Greek letters, Greek philosophy, and Greek genius prepared the way for the Savior's holy advent, revealing to mankind the greatness of the Greek mind, which has enlightened the world, and whose power and influence cannot be subdued either by tyranny or by misfortune."</p>
   
   <p>This learned servant of the church, who is free from bias, fanaticism, and narrow-mindedness, has never ceased, since he came to us here, to point out the necessity of establishing a Greek school.</p>
