   <p>p. 1. -- Tonight, Jan. 19, at 8 P. M., the Greek Ladies' Philanthropic Society holds its annual dance in the Masonic Temple. The preparations for the ball indicate, according to the president, Mrs. Aspasia L. Diamesis, wife of Dr. Diamesis, that it will be the finest affair which the society has ever produced. Professional men, business men, industrialists, churches, and all the Greek organizations are represented at the ball tonight because it is given for the benefit of all the Greek schools in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Editor's Note: It is idle to proclaim the necessity of making the dance tonight a success because we all know that it is our duty to do so for the sake of our schools in Chicago.</p>
