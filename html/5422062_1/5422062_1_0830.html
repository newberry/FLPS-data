   <p>With medieval pageantry that included the singing of songs hundreds of years old, Chicago's 75,000 Greeks, last night, observed the Good Friday of their religion.</p>
   <p>The ancient rituals, a high point of the Greek Holy Week, began at the Orthodox Church of Aghia Trias, 1101 S. Peoria, and concluded with a solemn funeral procession through the street in which thousands of communicants paid homage at a bier bearing an effigy of Jesus.</p>
   <p>The effigy, bathed in Hellenic perfumes, was buried in a cenotaph covered with rose petals. It was the 1,901st annual commemoration of the death of Jesus.</p>

   <p>For hours yesterday, the preliminaries of the celebration had occupied pious Greeks. In a bier at the foot of the Byzantine icon station in the church of Agia Trias lay the effigy. Children had been singing Byzantine songs dating to the early Centuries.</p>
   <p>At 10 P.M. there were 15,000 Greeks gathered about the church. The priest gave a signal; a prayer and hymn were offered and the men and women filed past the bier to kiss the effigy.</p>
   <p>The directors of the church then carried the cenotaph through the streets, halting in front of Hull House to offer a prayer of gratitude to Jane Addams, friend of the immigrants in Chicago. Scores of communicants marched behind the cenotaph.</p>
   <p>Tonight the worshipers will gather again at the church in pitch darkness. At the stroke of midnight the priest will enter, crying joyfully, "Christ is risen!"</p>
