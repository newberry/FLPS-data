   <p>We are asking all Greek cooks and waiters, who are not already members, to hasten to join our organization. Alone, one cannot accomplish anything but, united, we are unconquerable. We cannot live on the petty wages we get, we are merely existing. This condition will not change unless we do something to make it change.</p>
   <p>Our organization needs first of all a strong base - one that will not topple over with the first gust of wind. Cooks and waiters, you are this base. We need you! You will not only do us good by joining, you will help yourself. We look after members who are ill or unemployed. We are striving for shorter working hours and more pay. This for your benefit.</p>
   
   <p>Think it over, get a copy of our canonisms and read it. You will see that the best step for you to take is to join our organization and help us fight for you. We cannot do it alone.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will take place on Nov. 18, Friday at 9 o'clock, Roosevelt Hall, 645 North Clark St.,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Nov. 12, 1910</p>
   <p>President</p>
   <p>C. Ballis.</p>
   <p>Secretary</p>
   <p>J. Kostakos.</p>
