   <p>With great joy and pleasure we are informed that Mr. Wicholas Cheronis, Doctor of Chemistry, was proclaimed by the University of Chicago a Doctor of Science.</p>
   <p>In order to obtain this degree one must make extensive investigations and climax the work with a thesis written on a scientific basis.</p>
   <p>Dr. Cheronis is one of the very few Greeks to be proclaimed Doctor of Science and he has every right to be proud of this promotion, which honors not only himself, but the entire Greek colony as well. It also greatly pleases his brother, George Cheronis and his father, James Cheronis, to hear of the Doctor's success.</p>
