   <p>P. 1. --- The Solon Ladies' Society, of the recently established Solon School, located on the North Side, have organized a bazaar for the benefit of the school's treasury. In this bazaar they will exhibit for sale a variety of beautiful and attractive objects, and they expect all our compatriots to attend the bazaar, which will last for three days, allowing every one to attend and enjoy the beauty of the new edifice.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, Sunday, a holy mass will be performed in the church of the school, and we urge all to attend, for by so doing they will not only fulfill their religious obligation but also support our new school, which is destined to render so many services to Hellenism in America.</p>
