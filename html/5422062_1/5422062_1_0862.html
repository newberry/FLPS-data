   <p>We wish to announce to our pious fellow-countrymen that the litany for the miracle which occurred in the holy Church of St. Nicholas, will be recited next Sunday, May 13th, immediately after the holy mass.</p>
   <p>Following the doxology, the litany will be recited with the saint's icon displayed, and the regular prayers will be said.</p>
   <p>The salutations to the saint composed for the occasion by Archimandrite Ambrosios Mandilaris, will be sung. There will also be a sermon on the occurrence of the miracle.</p>
   <p>Hymns to the saint will follow, sung by the well organized choir of women of the parish.</p>
   <p>Every effort has been made that devout worshipers may enjoy spiritual peace and composure in the rich retirement of the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
   <p>Refreshments will be served to all immediately after the holy litany by the Women's Society of St. Nicholas Parish.</p>
