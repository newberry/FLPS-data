   <p>p. 2-.........We find the following item in the Chronicle, a Chicago newspaper:</p>
   <p>"Greeks should not continually be blamed for our short-comings. James Duggan, a native American, wounded with a knife, Tsef Moustos, a Greek restaurant-keeper at 350 State Street, after a quarrel over Duggan's refusal to pay for his meal. He was held by patrons of the restaurant until police came. Those who were close to the cash register at the time attested the unbecoming conduct of Duggan. The wounded man was taken to the hospital, where doctors said that he would recover.</p>
   <p>"According to statements which the police have gathered, Duggan told Moustos that the food was rotten, and that he would not pay for such a meal. The Greek retorted, 'Now could you finish the meal if it was rotten? The plate is empty?</p>
   <p>That made Duggan angry, and he stabbed the Greek." Star's note: It would have been much better for Moustos to lose the price of the meal, avoiding any discussion, and if Duggan had repeated the trick, police should have been summoned. Now not only is the price of the meal lost, but Moustos is lying wounded in the hospital. Common sense and coolness might have prevented this unpleasant occurence. Let us hope that other Greek restaurant-keepers will avoid similar incidents, which occur daily.</p>
