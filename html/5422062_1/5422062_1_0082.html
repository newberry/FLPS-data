   <p>p. 5.- The much heralded dance of Delta Epsilon Pi, a fraternity of Greek students of the University of Illinois, will give its third annual dance Dec. 17th, at the Knickerbocker Hotel.</p>
   <p>It is the imperative duty of all the Greeks of Chicago to honor the forthcoming dance of the Greek students' fraternity with their presence. These struggling young Greek students of today are the apostles of the Greek race in America. These young men, born and raised here, speak the Greek language fluently, an strive to perpetuate the traditions of our race. They need our cooperation. They deserve it. Let us make the dance a brilliant success.</p>
