   <p>p. 2.- Last Sunday, June 28, in the Homer School Hall of St. Nicholas Church of South Chicago, the school festival and granting of diplomas to more than a hundred and thirty students, boys and girls, took place with great success.</p>
   <p>In spite of the suffocating temperature the parents and many others of our countrymen who care for the preservation of the Greek language in this hospitable country came to this festival to witness the progress made by the Greek youth and to encourage morally their young offspring to love our great country.</p>
   <p>The exercises of the students in reciting monologues, dialogues and one-act comedies were evidence enough of their zeal for learning our mother-tongue and also gave hope that in spite of adverse conditions the Greek population of America will uniformly preserve sentiments that are purely Greek.</p>
   
   <p>Archimandrite Daniel Gavril as well as Instructress Maria Kouklaki are entitled to congratulations for the progress shown by the students. Both these teachers, indefatigable, unselfish, and making sacrifices to overcome every obstacle, have succeeded in inspiring confidence in parents that the Greek school of St. Nicholas Church is fulfilling its mission for the benefit of the Greek race.</p>
   <p>After the program the Ladies' Sisterhood of St. Nicholas Church, served refreshments to those present, who left the festival with pleasant impressions.</p>
