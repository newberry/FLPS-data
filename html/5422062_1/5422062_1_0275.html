   <p>p. 1- We have dealt repeatedly with the pitiable condition prevailing in Socrates School, and we shall keep hammering away until things get straightened out.</p>
   <p>But the condition of the school is getting worse continually, inasmuch as winter is approaching, and no repairs whatever have been made, despite the fact that the community has assigned the sum of three to five thousand dollars for repairs.</p>
   <p>We are informed, for all that, that the community council handed over to the president bonds worth $3,000 with which to do the repairing. The decision of the conference, however, was not that bonds should be given to the executive council of the school, but that the council of the community should make the repairs, since the building belongs to the community, and the community is responsible for the expense.</p>
   
   <p>Inasmuch as the executive of the school has issued false accounts, and an audit has proved that the financial accounts were destroyed, and that a sum of money was embezzled, why has the community council entrusted the bonds to him, and what guarantee has it that the president of the school will allot the money to the work of repairing the school (if it ever is to be done), and what report will the president render for the same? Why, the recent example is still fresh in mind, when he did not give any account whatever of his entire term of administration of the school, and furthermore, his figures have been proved to be totally false, presented with intent to deceive the community.</p>
   <p>The responsibility for this pitiable condition is wholly upon the president of the community, if he realizes what his duties are.</p>
