   <p>Greeks of Chicago and suburbs, are informed that the Greek-American school, Socrates will give its annual dance at Plasterers Temple Building 332 S. Marshfield Ave., Mar. 29th.</p>
   <p>In spite of the prevalent depression, the school must remain open and continue its educational work for our new generation. Therefore, all the Greek societies and associations are urged, for the success of the dance, not to hold a celebration of their own on the same date as the Socrates dance.</p>
   <p>Socrates school day is, therefore, designated as Mar. 29th and all are invited to the celebration. Assist Socrates school by coming to this dance.</p>
   <p>The School Committee.</p>
