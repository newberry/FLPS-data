   <p>The first of the year was celebrated in America in the particular fashion that Americans have adopted of welcoming the New Year.</p>
   <p>While it is true that nowhere in the world the first of the year provokes such enthusiasm as in America, it is also known that this enthusiasm causes an abundant sacrifice to Bacchus. In America we can furthermore say that the first of the year corresponds with the feast of Bacchus of the ancients, and no law can stop the sacrifices to the God of cheerfulness and joy.</p>
   <p>We Greeks, on the contrary, try to gain entrance to the shrines and sanctuaries of Fortune and to sacrifice before her even our last penny in order to gain her favor.</p>
   <p>And for us Greeks no law prohibiting card-playing could check us in offering our worship, on New Year's Eve, to the great God, whose name we changed to "St. Basil" when we became Christians.......(dots in the original-Translator). This custom is so well known to Americans that many special permits are issued by the police for the occasion, allowing card-playing in various Greek centers.</p>
   <p>This privilege has been granted to the Greeks since the establishment of the Greek community of Chicago, in the year of our Lord 1890, the first day of which the parishioners celebrated by playing "Tertso-tero" in the various centers of that time. But just because the police authorities did not yet know this Greek custom, they arrested all the players and led them to the police station, and it became necessary for the priest of the Greek parish, the late Father Fiampolis, in order to set them free to go there and state to the chief of police that it was a religious custom. And ever since that time they have been free to go on with their religious customs........(dots in the original - Translator).</p>
   <p>Faithfully, therefore, our fellow-nationals have celebrated this year also, in the most panegyric manner, their religious custom, at various public places and also at home with much reverence and compunction and with all-night ceremonies.</p>
