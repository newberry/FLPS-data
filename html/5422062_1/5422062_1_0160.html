   <p>p.1--Because of our present national misfortune the Plato Club of Greek students has decided to give its second annual dance in the Tiger Room of the Sherman House, Clark and Randolph Streets, at 8 p. m. on January 28 for the benefit of the refugees, our compatriots, who have suffered so terribly at the hands of the Turks in the catastrophe of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The organizing committee will not spare time or expense, and the affair should be a signal success.</p>
   <p>The Greek community of our city, which sincerely admires the Plato Club, will thus have another opportunity to show its interest in the organization by attending the dance.</p>
   <p>The proceeds are to be devoted to a sacred cause, and no one should be absent.</p>
