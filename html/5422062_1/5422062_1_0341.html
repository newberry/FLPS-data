   <p>Last Sunday, the school festival of the Greek-American Educational school, Solon, under the auspices of the Church of Annunciation (Evangelismos), took place. This school was built on the North Side of our city in an ideal spot and is the last word in the art of building. It cost $200,000, and has been completed only a year. It is affiliated with the Church of the Annunciation and the parish of St. James. Just as the Church of Annunciation, whose priest is Rev. Nikitas Kesses, so does the school, Solon, with its church, St. James, whose priest is Rev. D. Sakellarios, truly deserve the respect of Chicagoland, for this fine showing which is due entirely to the indefatigable work of the members of the Church and the Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>This scholastic holiday of the Greek pupils of Solon school started at 4:00 o'clock and ended about 7:30. With only a year's establishment, there are enrolled 100 pupils in the school, who, directed by their teacher, Mrs. Basiliki Xrisostenou, presented their various poems, recitations, songs, plays, dialogues, etc. with such success that the audience applauded them again and again to show their pleasure and surprise.</p>
