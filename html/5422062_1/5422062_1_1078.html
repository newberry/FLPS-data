   <p>In America, each succeeding year is one of greater opportunity than the year before. We welcome 1922, therefore, as the year of greatest opportunity. Many business men are American citizens of Greek birth or descent. They have dedicated themselves to the United States, and here in Chicago, in common with all other Americans, it is their ambition to make this country the land of the free and this city the great accomplishment of its own "I will" spirit.</p>
   <p>In the world war, 7,500 men of Greek birth or descent went to the colors from Chicago and in nearly every instance they came back with the words "excellent character" written by Uncle Sam on their discharge papers. In the Liberty Load, Red Cross and other war service drives, those at home felt honored to contribute to the limit of their resources.</p>
   <p>Let our slogan now be, "I will work to make 1922 the year of greatest opportunity."</p>
