   <p>The American Society of the Greek Community of Chicago is protesting against the treaty with Bulgaria as putting a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> on that country's alliance with Germany, penalizing the other Balkan states which fought with the allies, and leaving the ground for father warfare in the Balkans.</p>
   <p>Paul <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, president of the society, speaking for its membership, made up of American-born or naturalized Greeks, declares the terms of the treaty, which probably will be signed by the Bulgars this week, make Bulgaria the richest and happiest of the Balkan states.</p>
