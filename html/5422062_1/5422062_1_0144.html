   <p>All American students use the letters of the Greek alphabet as names for their fraternities and sororities. It was about time for Greek students also to name their societies with Greek letters and credit for initiating this custom is due to the Greek students of Grand College, who recently chose for their emblem the letters Phi Sigma Epsilon, which stand, in Greek, for Educational Society of Greeks.</p>
   <p>This brilliant society, which has a membership of fifty Greek boys and is headed by Mr. Theodore Mouzakiotis, is holding its first ceremony next Monday from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. A beautifully arranged program is awaiting all, with George Spannon, a lawyer, as the speaker of the day. Mr. Spannon will talk on the purpose of the organization and the value of cooperation. The first ceremony of the Educational Society of Greeks was held at Grand College, 2245 Jackson Boulevard.</p>
