   <p>p. 1.- Praise for the Record-Herald, its special correspondent, Wm. E. Curtis, and its dramatic critic, James O'Donnell Bennett, is contained in resolutions passed by representatives of 20,000 Greeks of Chicago at a meeting in Hull House last night. Among those resent were N. Salopoulos, Greek Consul in Chicago, and the presidents of fifteen Greek societies in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The appreciation expressed in the resolutions was both on account of the recent series of articles by Mr. Curtis on Greece and Greek ideals and Mr. Bennett's critical review of a production a short time ago of the "Elektra." The latter was thanked also for the sympathy he has shown in the efforts that are being made for a renaissance of the Hellenic drama. Raymond Duncan, founder of the Philhellenic Propaganda, was in attendance and spoke in favor of holding a large mass meeting in one of the down town auditoriums for the purpose of better acquainting the general public with Greece and its people as they are today.</p>

   <p>It was decided to hold the meeting within the next two weeks, and it is expected that the affair will be one of the largest demonstrations ever held by the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
