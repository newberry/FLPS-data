   <p>The spirit of wine has died.</p>
   <p>This spirit--which never in its existence caused disease, or failed to rout deadly microbes; and since its creation, always appeared at joyous festivities--is dead in the United States.</p>
   <p>It was given a years reprieve and was then sentenced to die on June 30.</p>
   <p>The fanatical lovers of wine made great efforts to obtain as many gallons as possible, in order to prolong their joy after the wine presses ceased running.</p>

   <p>Anyone who failed to see the places where liquor could be bought on the eve of Prohibition hasn't seen anything. People of all classes and all ages waited patiently in line, holding ten and twenty dollar bills in their hands, with which they were going to buy wine, whiskey, and liquors.</p>
   <p>....Among these people so joyously buying liquor, was a group who did not have the necessary amount of money to purchase their beloved wine. To them this night was of the greatest torment.</p>
   <p>For the first time in my life I desired to be wealthy in order that I might give some bottles of their favorite drink to all who could not buy--without doubt I would have been given the title of "Great Benefactor."</p>
   <p>Poor things! The State only thinks of you when asking for your vote; and <span class="page-break">3</span>when it has it, it even takes the glass that gives you happiness from your lips. Nevertheless, we are going to obey the law to the letter. And you poor, deprived people have my sympathy.</p>
