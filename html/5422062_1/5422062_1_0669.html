   <p>The Greeks seem to have forgotten that the purpose of life is for more than unceasing labor. Labor is the finest and the only honest means of achieving material success. But overzeal in this respect has very serious effects on the culture, knowledge, and social-mindedness of an individual. Such a person--and we have too many of them in the Greek community of Chicago--attempts to evaluate everything in terms of dollars and cents.</p>
   <p>Money is one of the greatest possessions of man. Nothing can be done without it--directly or indirectly. Some people are respected for their individual value; but, unfortunately, they who are greatly admired by the majority usually have siezeable bank accounts. Therefore, all of us work as hard and as long as we can, so that we, too, may become rich and be envied and admired by others. Of course, this is characteristic of all people, but it seems that this attitude is more noticeable among Greeks than among other groups.</p>
   <p>For an example, you may think of any Greek businessman with whom you are acquainted. We find that although all the other stores are closed in the evening, he remains open....He has no system for himself, his family, or his business. His employees work like slaves because of his greed. If someone makes even the slightest criticism about his method, he answers in an egotistical and defiant manner. This continues until one day he is surprised into wakefulness.</p>
   <p>He discovers that his children are total strangers to him, considering him as a greedy father who has never left his cash register long enough to romp with them. If this does not happen, his awakening comes from some other source. One day he will say to himself, "I have worked like a slave since my childhood, and have never enjoyed even one day of the best years of my life. What has it all gotten me?"</p>
   <p>Usually the realization of a wasted life comes too late. There is nothing to start living for. The patient and uncomplaining wife has faded and lost her spirit because of the many lonely and unhappy years she has spent in semi-widowhood.</p>
   <p>Money throws over one a magic spell; but it can never take the place of social relationships which are so important to man's existence. A man should spend many happy hours in his home with his family. It is neither normal nor conducive to his family's happiness for him to enter his home late at night, like a boarder. Why don't Greek businessmen imitate the Americans who work reasonable hours and have ample time for rest, pleasure, or study. Very few Greek men eat dinner regularly at home; and the most pitiful victim of all this is the Greek wife. She toils from morning until night, from year to year, to rear her children alone and to provide them with a good environment. In accordance with her life's training she prefers to sacrifice her youth and to remain shut in the house, rather than to rebel against the man who is so inconsiderate of her natural rights.</p>
   <p>Not only are the women cheated, but the men themselves are cheated. That is why they are often heard to say that America is not a good place in which to live. Why did they not say that in Greece? Because people in Greece always take time for a siesta, a song, or a cup of coffee at a cafe. No one in Greece is greedy. It is only when these same people come to America that they become bitten by the "goldbug".</p>
   <p>It is not too late to change. Live each day as if it were your last, for some day will be. Only then will the Greek community make great social progress and keep the younger generations from becoming enemies of all that is Greek.</p>
