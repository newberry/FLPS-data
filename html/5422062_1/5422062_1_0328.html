   <p>The Socrates school, the lighthouse of Greek letters, had its festival last Sunday. In the large Garrick Theatre where many Greek performances have taken place, many came before the time set and even before the doors of the theatre were open.</p>
   <p>The program which was varied and well-planned was a great success, the boys and girls performing like true actors.</p>
   <p>The Socrates school deserves the position of being the first educational establishment. At the desks of Socrates school have studied many Greek boys and girls who preserve the flame of the Greek spirit.</p>
   <p>In the halls of the school building have come day after day, year after year, thousands of boys and girls who have been taught the Greek ideals by their teachers.</p>

   <p>To carry out the purpose of the school, it has taken twenty long, laborious years. The teachers, principals, and directors have had a hard struggle against economic conditions since the beginning of the school's existence. But the work still goes on with increasing enthusiasm and strength, in spite of these difficulties.</p>
   <p>The pupils of the seventh and eighth grades resented a splendid performance on the stage. They did not recite the poems customary with students of the lower grader but took part in dramas, comedies, and dialogues with such skill that they put to same the amateur actors and even some prefessionals.</p>
   <p>The sight of ten boys and girls on the stage, singing the Greek national anthem and other song, moved the audience. The mothers were almost in tears of joy, the fathers bursting with pride, and the audience applauded, continually to show their pleasure. When fifteen Greek boys, under the direction of George <span class="gap">[gap]</span> played their violins, the rafters resounded with applause and shouts.</p>
