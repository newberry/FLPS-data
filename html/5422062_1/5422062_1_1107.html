   <p>There are many individuals in the Greek communities throughout the United States, and especially in Chicago, who, like parrots, having managed to learn a little of everything, and having acquired a superficial social refinement under which there really hides nothing else but filth and dirt, are posing lately as leaders among the Greek people. They also pose as sociologists, reformers, intellectuals, and patriots. They are interfering especially with the political activities of our Greek communities in spite of the fact that they are frauds.</p>
   <p>They have become such a great nuisance that the various peace-loving communities are greatly annoyed, and are now thinking seriously of getting rid of these new bright leaders of our Greek society. These people are not conscious of the fact that they are worthless parasites and hypocrites. They are engaging in their doubtful profession so ridiculously, by posing as popular political leaders; thus provoking the laughter and jeers of their supposed followers.</p>
   <p>In our wish to become better understood by these would-be sociological Don Quixotes, and the readers of the Saloniki, we are forced to sacrifice valuable time in describing, broadly, what qualifications one should possess if he is to become a leader; with the right to impose his will on others for their own benefit.</p>
   <p>To be recognized as the leader of a society, party, or organization, one must have abilities and talents superior to those whom he wishes to govern. That is, he must distinguish himself by his greater knowledge, wisdom, character, and executive ability if he is to be a leader and win the confidence of the people. But these qualifications must really exist; otherwise, no matter whether an individual is recognized as a leader by being elected or is self-appointed, he becomes a dangerous, ridiculous, and harmful person, and disgraces the office which he occupies. Any office, to be honored and respected by society, must be occupied by a worthy man who is conscious of the high mission and requirements of his distinguished position.</p>
   <p>These are reasonable and lawful expectations of all public offices and responsible positions. If society is to progress, it must use great care to select the proper leaders. These men will assume the responsibility to guide the others along the course of progress and constructive work. These are the things every society should think about and strive for.</p>
   <p>As an illustration: how can a judge who is worse than the judged, render an impartial decision? Will his decision be respected? How can a criminal and sinful clergy pray to God for the salvation of his good flock; or how can he undertake, as a spiritual father, to receive penance and catechise a layman who, except for some small sins is sinless, otherwise? Is it not just as absurd that an ignorant, illiterate, crude, hypocritical, lying, and exploiting layman should be able to lead his superiors for his own selfish, social, religious, and patriotic interests?</p>
   <p>On the basis of these observations we suggest to those shameless and brainless charlatans that they study themselves; so as to find out if they are qualified to fill the position which they pretend to occupy. In case they are not qualified, as is most probable, they should submit the question to the Greek people; and they will decide as to the fitness of the individuals to assume the responsibilities of society's leaders.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the repulsive presence of these fakes--with their ignorance, stupidity, and audacity--has not been felt within our Greek community only; but they have been bothering the American public, also. They have the nerve to pose before the officials of the American people as leaders of the Greek community of Chicago. It is, perhaps, needless to say how shamelessly we, the good, hard-working and decent Greeks, have been misrepresented and harmed. These unspeakable characters have given the American officials and people the impression that the Greeks immigrants are lacking in enthusiasm and patriotism.</p>
   
   <p>Those who have associated with us long enough, know that the Greeks--though they may have nothing else--are, at least, loyal, devoted, and faithful to both Greece and America to the point of fanaticism.</p>
   <p>In the face of this shamelessness, let the Greek people consider how they can defend and protect their reputation and good name in this country. We have been accused of lacking patriotism, sentiment, and enthusiasm by members of our own nationality. But, this is not all. We are giving rise to a worse evil. According to a wise old Greek saying: "The apprentices will learn just what the master teaches them." Greeks, you must give serious consideration to the question we are putting to you, if you are to achieve a high standing in the American community.</p>
   <p>What will the Americans think of you when they learn that, without any protest, you allow such men to act as your leaders? Naturally, they assume that these leaders are your most able men. Is this not moral suicide? Is it not self betrayal, and self-destruction, both socially and nationalistically?</p>
   
   <p>Then we complain that we are being treated unjustly, or being ignored by the American people. Is it not our fault if we give them cause for doing so?</p>
   <p>It is shown that we have patriotism and an extraordinary sense of loyalty. Because we possessed these characteristics we have given much money to both the American and Greek causes. We, as a people, know how to do our duty to our homeland and to our adopted country. Figures and statistics prove, that in comparison to other nationalities we have done more and contributed more both to Greece and to America, as soldiers and as financial supporters, than they have.</p>
   <p>Why, then, are we treated unfairly? Because, while we are otherwise endowed with so many good qualities and virtues, we have not the will and the determination to manage our common interests to the best advantage. We must throw out those go-getting half-wits who pretend to be our leaders. We must raise ourselves to our proper station by making others recognize our contributions, our efforts, and our sacrifices.</p>
