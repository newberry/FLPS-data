   <p>p. 4.--Hundreds of Americans who with their families participated in the Greek picnic given by the patriotic and philanthropic Panhellenic Society of Chicago immensely enjoyed the hospitality of the Greeks.</p>
   <p>Refreshments in abundance and in great variety, tantalizing music, startling Cretan dances, and folk-songs were the main features of the program. As to the worship of Bacchus, the Greeks of Chicago are not so far behind those who in ancient times celebrated the Dionysia or Bacchanalia. They certainly know how to honor the Greek god of wine; nevertheless order, harmony, and sobriety are their racial characteristics, and the affair was a special success and gave unlimited pleasure to the Americans.</p>
   <p>Affairs of this kind to which Americans are invited are very beneficial to the Greek community in Chicago; they promote understanding of our customs and habits and promote friendships and closer relations between the two races.</p>
