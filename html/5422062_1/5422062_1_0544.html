   <p>p. 5. - Woodlawn Chapter No. 93 of Ahepa, did a very gracious and noble thing. It voted to give Miss A. Kaloidas of St. Constantine School $30 a month. Miss Kaloidas had been donating her services to teach 30 Greek orphans the Greek language at the orphanage at 51st and Vincennes.</p>
   <p>The originator of this plan was Rev. Petrakis of St. Constantine church. It was Rev. Petrakis who also obtained permission from the orphanage to teach the children Greek. Since last October, the children have been taught from 4 to 6 on Thursdays and 11 to 12 on Saturdays.</p>
   <p>A. Peponis, president of Woodlawn Chapter, heartily endorsed this plan and put it up to a vote. The motion was unanimously carried amid much applause and enthusiasm.</p>
   
   <p>We congratulate the Woodlawn chapter for showing such fine spirit in promoting the perpetuation of the Greek tongue among the poor orphan children who have no Greek influences surrounding them.</p>
