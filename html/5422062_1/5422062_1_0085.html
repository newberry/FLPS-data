   <p>p. 7.- The recently established Academy of Political Science in Athens, urges Greek students attending Colleges and Universities in America, to enroll in the classes of this institution.</p>
   <p>The erection of the Academy was achieved by Pan-Hellenic contributions, including $10,000, from Greek-Americans. The $75,000 bequest of the late Alexander Pantos, and the many other contributions from Egyptian Greeks, undoubtedly will strengthen the fund of the institution.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Academy is to render the educational career of the new generation more useful in social and political activities, and to mold better citizens for generations to come. It aspires to become the educational and cultural center of national affairs and national regeneration, and the connecting spiritual link of Mother Greece with her far away sons, living all over the world.</p>
   
   <p>Students abroad wishing to enroll, would not have to go to Athens to attend classes. They would receive and follow the instructions of the educational committee in charge of the institution. This study would continue for three years, then the students would go to Athens for graduation, receive their diplomas and be baptized in the love of Greece and Greek letters.</p>
   <p>Requirements for enrollment in the Academy are a high school education, an annual fee of $25, and $75 for books for the three year course. Students from America are required to attend classes in Athens for the period of three months preceding graduation. They will not be obliged to take examinations in courses already taken in American Colleges and Universities.</p>
   <p>The Academy is under the immediate supervision of the ministry of education and its personnel is comprised of the best talent of the land. For further information communicate with the Academy of Political Science, Sygrou Blvd, Athens, Greece.</p>
