   <p>To all the Reverends, the Honorable Executive Boards of the communities, the reverential whole of church goers, and beloved children, your Archdiocese appeals and desires its wishes to be gratified.</p>
   <p>That, during the sacred day of Easter, with soul-humility and actual love for our needy and suffering brothers in Christ, we pray that the candle holding joy of, "Christos Anesti," (Christ Arises) be extended to the homes of the needy and suffering and to those who lack consolation.</p>
   <p>None should stay out of the "Nymfonos" of Christ. None should be hungry. None should be depressed.</p>
   <p>"Christos Anesti", universal joy to all.</p>
