   <p>The Executive Committee of the Greek school "Socrates" publicly expresses its gratitude and appreciation to the society of Greek young women "Hellenic Youth" for its good work in aiding the financial needs of the school.</p>
   <p>The maintenance and upkeep of our Greek schools in Chicago, depend solely upon the munificence and generosity of the Greek public. The Hellenic Youth will lead the way in the gathering of funds for our schools. Rain or snow, fatigue or time are not deterents to those young and ambitious Greek girls. The money must be raised, and they never stop until it is raised. They have our gratitude and congratulations.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee.</p>
