   <p>p. 24.- Some folks maintain that America is the home of the ancient Greeks, reborn in another land, after a long period of rest, in accordance with the law of reincarnation and that the Grecian architecture of our public buildings here, and our great interest in sports and games are but two of the many sign-posts in support of the theory.</p>
   <p>The Greek families in Chicago and all over the United States perpetuate the heritage of Grecian embroidery. Beautiful needle-work is done by Grecian women and girls of Greek origin. Noteworthy among the many beautiful patterns is the Cretan embroidery.</p>
   <p>A silk embroidery is made on a linen ground, home spun, of course, and woven in a closely plotted conventionalized design of foliate scrolls. Birds, other animals, and rosettes are embroidered in brilliant red, blue, green, yellow, pink and other colors. It is primitive in its style <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>showing Byzantine influence; pairs of birds or animals, face some central motif supporting the Tree of Life.</p>
   <p>It was the custom in the Ionian Islands to embroider pillow cases, bed spreads, the hems of skirts and sleeves with original beautiful designs. Friezes of birds, such as peacocks and double eagles, also trees and flowers in charming patterns were borders. Girls about to be married had on hand frocks, bedspreads, bed curtains, valances and pillow cases, all in the designs for which their mothers were famous.</p>
   <p>Flax and cotton were both grown on the islands, and silk was raised at home and spun, so that the embroideries were entirely a handicraft in the finest sense of the word.</p>
   <p>Greek heritage is not confined to the Greeks, but spread all over the United States and the rest of the world. Greek influence is felt every- <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>where. But Greek influence is more apparent in the United States than anywhere else.</p>
   <p>At Barnard College, in New York City, the spring of every year brings such a flood of interest in all things Greek, that one finds still another argument for that fascinating idea. Each year, in the gymnasium, freshmen and sophomores, together with faculty advisors, and undergraduate assistants and advisors, stage a beautiful spectacle known as the "Greek Games."</p>
   <p>In this classic festival, which is really a contest between the sophomores and freshmen in athletics, lyrics, costumes, music and dancing, several hundred girls dressed in the costumes of the ancient Greeks, present a drama with music and dancing, which is yearly attracting more and more attention from the outside world.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>At the festival many contests take place too, which makes it all the more interesting and thrilling. Judges award wreathes for the best dancing, the best lyrics, the best costumes, while the discus throwers, hurdlers, hoop-rolling teams, chariot racers, and torch racers all hope for the coveted laurels.</p>
   <p>Only sophomores and freshmen take part, following the custom established in 1903, when the sophomores of the class of 1905 challenged the freshmen to a contest "private and informal with a suggestion of the ancient Greek festival bout it, and including a competition in poetry." From this small beginning, the "Games" have grown importance each year at this school.</p>
   <p>One of the foremost of all of the many committees appointed to work on the different features of the "Games" is the costume committee. Providing <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>proper Grecian dresses for something like 250 students is no mean assignment and from February on the needles fly. Everything must be true to classic Greek standards.</p>
   <p>So the folks who maintain that America is the home of the ancient Greeks, are absolutely right.</p>
