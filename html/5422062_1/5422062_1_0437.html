   <p>With a feeling of joy, we inform the public that the board of trustees of the Holy Trinity Church has finally decided to build a new school building on the lot belonging to the church. There already are two building on this lot. One is used as a school....and one is used as a private dwelling. The school committee was trying to decide whether to (1) remodel the two buildings at a cost of about $6,000; (2) build a wing joining the two buildings at a cost of about $10,000; or (3) build a new building from the ground up. An architect has estimated the cost to be about $28,000.</p>
   <p>After much deliberation, the third plan was decided upon by the committee. The Atlas Exchange National Bank, whose treasurer is Mr. Nick Kyriakopoulos, ....has offered financial assistance by making a loan and by issuing bonds.</p>

   <p>The community, especially all parents, must support the efforts of the committee. This is one of the finest things that has ever been decided upon by a church board. Forward to progress!</p>
