   <p>Dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>I wish to thank you very much for sending me your article entitled "Pericles and Lincoln."</p>
   <p>I shall read it with much interest. Your speech before the Hamilton Club of Chicago was very fine indeed.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Henry R. Rathbone.</p>
