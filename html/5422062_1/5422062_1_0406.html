   <p>The school term will begin in a few days, and the doors will be thrown open for the new generation waiting to be educated and introduced to all that experience and progress have so far succeeded in storing up in the treasury of human knowledge.</p>
   <p>Among the countless institutions of learning in this country there are already many Greek schools, and others are constantly being founded, so displaying the ardor and zeal of the promoters of Greek education but also their imprudence and lack of forethought. One may well be astounded by the holy Zeal of those who are in such a hurry to disseminate Greek letters and education generally, but one may also well ask, How can people in our age be so superficial and so ignorant as to imagine that schools can spring up like mushrooms and with a few benches and a teacher chosen at random undertake the education of tender youth and even the dissemination of Greek culture!</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>And yet that is the real situation. Most of our schools in America are founded in that fashion. The faculties are appointed as above described. Now if by any chance a teacher happens to be conscientious and desirous of doing something, he strives and struggles with all his might, doing the best of which he is capable, to accomplish- what? Practically nothing!</p>
   <p>For in the first place it is impossible to found schools in this manner, and in the second place a school cannot be managed by persons who have no connection with the school and do not know what a school is because they have never attended one.</p>
   <p>Whom are we to blame for the condition of our schools? Whom shall we hold responsible, of whom demand an accounting? <span class="page-break">3</span>Shall we accuse those who without foresight, to be sure, but with ardent zeal continue to found Greek schools in America? These people, after all, are justified in their efforts by the need for schools as shown by the prevailing ignorance.</p>
   <p>For all these Greek schools in America were founded not specifically to please their founders nor to display their names but for the purpose of satisfying an evident pressing need. We have hundreds and thousands of Greek children in the various Greek communities of America. There is not a town or village in the United States where these are not Greek families, for the Greek race is noted for its fecundity.</p>
   <p>These children must go to school. Their mothers and fathers want them to do so.</p>
   <p>Something within them tells them that their children ought to have a Greek education. This is the need that gives the impetus to the founding of schools, which is carried on without system and without organization, just "off hand."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Could not a way be found to correct this fault? Could not a center be founded among the Greeks to survey and supervise the situation?</p>
   <p>Are we Greeks nomadic wandering Jews, without government, without authority, without educational centers, without socialogical, philological, and educational societies for the dissemination of Greek letters?</p>
   <p>And our ambassadors and consuls and bishops? "Stones, bricks and tiles thrown in disordered heap avail us naught."</p>
