   <p>Greek students, of Crane Junior College, Chicago, compose the Phi Sigma Epsilon Fraternity, which holds its annual dance May 27th at the Edgewater Beach Hotel.</p>
   <p>This fraternity of Greek students aims to lift the Greek name high, not only in college but everywhere. Our boys, of the new generation of the Greek race in America, are determined to become the examples of Hellenism in the United States.</p>
   <p>Greeks in the metropolitan area are requested to attend this dance and show their appreciation of what our boys are doing in lifting the Greek name. Undoubtedly the dance will be a success.</p>
