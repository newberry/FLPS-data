   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>Mr. Roosevelt has asked me to acknowledge your letter of November 11th and to thank you for your word of good will and congratulation. The article which you published in the Greek Star pleased him very much, and he appreciates your offer to cooperate in the task of restoration which lies ahead.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Louis M. H. Moure,</p>
   <p>Secretary, to Mr. Roosevelt.</p>
   
   <p>It is my desire that "my mail be answered with the greatest possible promptitude.</p>
   <p>The many thousands of letters which have been received since the election and the hundreds which come in every day have made it impossible for me personally to dictate or sign replies. I have, however asked my secretary to answer your letter and I trust that you will understand.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Fr. D. Roosevelt.</p>
