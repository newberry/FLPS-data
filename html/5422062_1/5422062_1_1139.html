   <p>It is true that our race sadly enough, has strong tendencies to worry more about the easily observed affairs of others than about its own personal business. Certain young men in Chicago are doing their best to spread malicious gossip about innocent individuals.</p>
   <p>This state of affairs might be due to a manner of living which existed in Greece, and was transported along with some other undesirable customs to America. This particular custom is that of sitting in a Kaffenion (cafe) with crossed legs all day and nearly all night, and trying to find something to talk about to help pass away the time. This custom is conducive to many social evils. If the individuals who sit in these coffee shops all day, and who live by chiseling drinks and meals from their associates--who have no foolish expectations of being repaid--were to apply themselves to doing some honest work they would be better off both morally and physically.</p>

   <p>Lies and slander have been circulating for the past few weeks concerning decent families and individuals whose lives are far above reproach. The Greek community, which is ninety per cent decent and honest, will not pay any heed to this malicious gossip. We will stand together and disregard these violators of human happiness and honor.</p>
   <p>To these gossipers we say, "Go and hide, cowards! Do not dare to slander individuals whose reputations speak far louder than any of your loud mouths could ever do."</p>
   <p>These individuals had better stop sending anonymous letters to innocent people, or the hand of justice will fall without mercy upon their spineless backs.</p>
   <p>Give up your cafe habits and go to work. When your minds are occupied with life's struggles they will not be so apt to think up vicious gossip about others.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki does not intend to allow these disseminators of evil to continue in their sinful ways.</p>
