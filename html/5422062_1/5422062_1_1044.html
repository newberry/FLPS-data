   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>Accept my thanks for your thoughtfulness in bringing to my attention the article on the first page of the Greek Star.</p>
   <p>I am doubly obligated to you, first for the article itself, which I keenly appreciated, and second for your goodness in making sure that I should see a copy of it. I wish it were possible to convey to all my friends the full measure of my gratitude for their generous support.</p>
   <p>Most sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Arthur Flynn.</p>
