   <p>pp. 1-6.- The Congress of the Greek Communities in America called by the Archdiocese has begun its work in New York.</p>
   <p>This Congress will become a milestone in the history of the Greek people here, for it is the first time after many years of partisan passion and dissension that they have come together reconciled and united, through their representatives, to discuss and outline the program of their future communal management, activity, and progress.</p>
   <p>The most vital of the matters to be taken up by the Congress is that of the educational organization of Hellenism in America. Greek-Americans, it is true, are interested in seeing all matters before the Congress solved well and definitely, but they will hear with especial joy and relief that some order has been established in our affairs, and that serious care is to be exercised in properly reorganizing our schools.</p>
   <p>The accomplishment of our schools so far, has been the result of conscientious performance of duty on the part of the teachers, who have struggled hard, bitterly aware that their efforts have not been appreciated.</p>
   <p>There has been no organization, no enlightened constructive supervision, no encouragement or support of the teachers in their heavy task.</p>
   <p>Our schools have functioned so far without a well-planned program, without sufficient personnel, without enough means of support, without the elementary methods of school organization and operation.</p>
   <p>This deplorable condition of Greek-American education the New York congress will discuss and remedy.</p>
   
   <p>We take this opportunity to record our ideas on the organization of Greek-American education, which through Mr. N. Lamprinidis we have submitted to the Right Reverend Archbishop Athenagoras.</p>
   <p>Aims</p>
   <p>The particular aims which Greek-American education must pursue along with the general intellectual and moral culture of Greek children are:</p>
   <p>(1) To teach the Greek language, the Orthodox Religion, our national ideals, and our traditions;</p>
   <p>(2) To teach the English language and the higher and purer American ideals; and</p>
   <p>(3) To harmonize in the Greek child's soul Greek and American ideals, so that in receiving such culture, he will remain Greek and Orthodox in spirit and yet be an American of high ideals, i.e., a perfect Greek- American lacking in no respect the higher education which his American fellow-citizens enjoy. To accomplish this, the Greek-American school must not be a copy of the schools of Greece but an original and special organization including all the elements necessary to achieve these aims.</p>
   <p>Forms of Schools</p>
   <p>1. The basis of Greek-American education must be the Greek-American day school, to be established in all communities where the number of prospective pupils is two hundred or more.</p>
   <p>2. Night schools must be established in all communities where the number of pupils is less than two hundred. One school may serve several small communities which are not far apart, and the teachers may teach alternately in the various districts on certain days of the week.</p>
   
   <p>3. Catechetical schools must be established in all communities, which, in co-operation with the other schools, will teach ecclesiastical music, so that church choirs may be formed for every church.</p>
   <p>4. Day schools and night schools of secondary education must be established in large communities.</p>
   <p>5. Orphanages and boarding schools for both sexes must be established in suitable localities not far from large centers in order to educate orphans and satisfy economically the educational needs of many Greeks who are located far from centers of Greek population, but who have the means to give to their children the education proper for Greeks.</p>
   <p>Personnel</p>
   <p>1. A list must be compiled of all teachers in America competent to teach in Greek schools, both employed and unemployed, with their qualifications.</p>
   
   <p>2. A proper scale of minimum salaries must be established according to the teachers' qualifications.</p>
   <p>3. Teachers must no longer be subject to the partisanship and caprices of local school committees, but a professional supervisory school board of enlightened and responsible persons must be organized.</p>
   <p>4. Teachers must be encouraged financially and otherwise to improve themselves by attending courses in the nearest universities and colleges or in centers where the educational organization of the Archdiocese may organize such courses.</p>
   <p>5. The teaching personnel must be renewed by graduates of Greek-American schools here who shall be selected on the basis of merit and sent to supplement their studies in the colleges and universities of Greece. On their return thence they may complete their courses in American colleges and other educational institutions.</p>
   
   <p>6. For remote communities priests may be trained to serve as teachers.</p>
   <p>7. The principals of day schools must be required to have certificates of attendance at one of the American universities or colleges.</p>
   <p>8. The position of teachers must be elevated by moral and material support.</p>
   <p>9. Priests who are not specifically trained as teachers must not be allowed to teach or to direct schools, a thing which on the one hand does harm to education and on the other hand lowers the dignity of the priest who is incompetent for the task.</p>
   <p>Management</p>
   <p>1. The Archdiocese must assume the supreme management and supervision of education.</p>
   <p>2. A permanent committee of education must be formed in the seat of the Archdiocese with the Archbishop himself as president and the assistant bishops and other eminent Greek-American residents as members.</p>
   
   <p>This committee must appoint, dismiss, and censure the superintendents of the schools, call the board of education to conference, and approve of the formation of local supervisory boards. It shall have supreme authority over the whole system of education, and its decisions upon all matters, especially upon differences among members of educational and supervisory councils, shall be final.</p>
   <p>3. A supreme educational board must be formed in the Archdiocese consisting of the Archbishop, the assistant bishops, the superintendents of the schools, and a number of eminent Greek-Americans, professional men or educated merchants noted for their racial and educational activities. This board shall meet periodically and regulate general education matters through by-laws.</p>
   <p>4. A supervisory board must be formed in the seat of every episcopal area, consisting of the Archbishop or his representative as president, the superintendent of the schools as counselor, and three or five eminent Greek-Americans, professional men or educated merchants. Each supervisory board shall assume the management and supervision of the schools of its area, promoting the regular functions of the schools and the efficient discharge of the teachers' duties through the superintent, who shall personally attend to these matters and submit reports of his activities to the board. This board, upon recommendation of the superintendent, shall appoint, dismiss, transfer, and promote the teachers of its district and shall see to it that its rules and also those established by the supreme educational board shall be observed.</p>
   <p>Each supervisory board shall, through the superintendent, compile a list of the teachers available and of their qualifications and shall determine their minimum salary. The local school committees shall have the right to recommend from the list of teachers available the appointments of teachers having the requisite qualifications for vacancies in their schools. In case of complaints they shall apply through the superintendent to the supervisory board, which shall consider the complaints, make decisions, and take all necessary measures.</p>
   <p>5. The superintendents shall be appointed, transferred, or dismissed by the supreme managing committee. Each superintendent must have a degree from a Greek normal school and a diploma from an American university or a certificate of attendance in higher courses for at least one year.</p>
   
   <p>6. The superintendents shall visit the schools of their districts, supervising their proper functioning as the rules provide and also as the standards of the educational profession dictate, judging the work of the teachers, constructively encouraging them, introducing new and more perfect methods, and keeping in touch with all modern innovations in pedagogy. They shall suggest to the supervisory board the appointment, promotion, transfer, dismissal, or punishment of teachers and generally every matter concerning the advancement of the schools of their districts.</p>
   <p>7. Once or twice a year the superintendents' council shall confer and prepare necessary reforms in the program and the course of education generally, and it shall submit its conclusions to the supreme educational committee, which shall call a meeting of the educational council for discussion and final decisions.</p>
   <p>8. In the seat of each district teachers' congresses shall be called periodically, presided over by the superintendent, during which special educational lectures shall be delivered to the teachers.</p>
   
   <p>9. The principals of the schools shall submit reports every six months to the superintendent on the condition of the schools with reference to needs and deficiencies and the steps to be taken for improvement of the situation.</p>
   <p>10. It is necessary that in every school a club of parents and teachers shall be instituted with the principal as chairman for closer cooperation of family and school.</p>
   <p>11. The superintendents with the cooperation of the principals of the schools and the teachers shall compile statistics about Greek families and the number of their members of school age and shall take care that the beneficent influence of proper Greek religious education shall be extended to them all.</p>
   <p>School Program</p>
   <p>Under this title are comprised multifarious and extensive activities.</p>
   
   <p>1. The Analytically Detailed Programs of the Different Types of School. (Such work is beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
   <p>The program of each school must in the beginning be organized by the superintendent of the school in cooperation with the supervisor, taking into consideration (a) the general aims of education, (b) the specific needs of the community and the environment, (c) the type of school, (d) the conditions under which the school is functioning, and (e) the provisions and limitations which each state has made for the functioning of foreign schools.</p>
   <p>The conference of superintendents and teachers shall regulate and gradually crystallize analytically detailed programs for the different types of school.</p>
   <p>It is not wise from an educational point of view to have a uniform, rigid, and strictly defined program imposed from above. It is proper to allow freedom of action to the local supervisiors, so that they in cooperation with the superintendents of the schools may formulate the program properly in all its details, following always the dictates of the constantly advancing educational profession, without losing sight of the general aims of Greek-American education.</p>
   <p>2. Text-Books of Which the Contents Are Commonly Admitted to Be Unfit for the Perusal of Greek Pupils in America.</p>
   <p>For the present it is sufficient to make a list of these books and to indicate what chapters in them will fit the psychosynthesis of the Greek-American pupil.</p>
   <p>The composition of new and suitable textbooks is the work of the near future, to be accomplished by our teachers and the rest of our educational leaders when the organization has been solidly established, and the teachers have gained self-confidence and have received from society proper material and moral recognition for their services.</p>
   <p>It is indispensable in our opinion that the living Demotiki (colloquial Greek) shall be taught in all grades of the elementary schools, and that the so-called purified language shall be taught in the fifth and sixth grades.</p>
   
   <p>Greek children here have this defect, that they do not speak their mother-tongue fluently. The Greek family, in the majority of cases, is not in a position to teach it to them. If the school does not succeed by systematic teaching in imparting to them the spoken language, it will labor in vain in bilingual confusion with no concrete result.</p>
   <p>In the higher grades pupils should translate certain passages of the New Testament from the original Greek and should likewise read and translate some of the simpler compositions in the ancient language.</p>
   <p>3- The Establishment of a Uniform and Suitable System of Grading, Censuring, Listing, and All Other Forms of Administration.</p>
   <p>4. The Establishment of a System of Mental Tests For a More Scientific Classification of Pupils and More Effective Instruction.</p>
   <p>5. The Establishment of an Accurate System of Examinations in the Various Studies to Test the Progress of Pupils and the Capabilities of the Teaching Personnel.</p>
   
   <p>6. The Application of the Most Perfect Methods of Teaching, Grading, and Promoting Pupils.</p>
   <p>7. The Program of the Catechetical Schools, Which Must Constantly Be Improved According to the Suggestions of Experts and the Needs of the Orthodox Flock.</p>
   <p>Resources</p>
   <p>The question of resources is the most difficult and the most fundamental of all.</p>
   <p>The schools heretofore have been conducted with unreliable and insufficient income, and on account of this their function and advancement have always been difficult and problematical.</p>
   <p>If dependable resources are not secured for education, this condition of uncertainty will continue, and no important educational reorganization will be possible.</p>
   
   <p>Under the conditions which have so far prevailed, comparatively few of our compatriots have carried the burden of supporting our communal institutions. The majority have remained untaxed and indifferent.</p>
   <p>Now, the dissension being over, those who wish to be called Greek Orthodox Christians and to enjoy the benefits of the organized Church and society are under obligation to contribute materially to the maintenance and advancement of our common institutions.</p>
   <p>To attain this:</p>
   <p>1. In large cities where there are many communities, these communities must organize a uniform system of government, either by merging or by defining the boundary lines of every community and establishing a central committee which shall discuss and take care of the general interests of all communities. In this manner everyone will be under obligation to become a member of his parish, and he will enjoy the benefits of the organized Church only under this condition.</p>
   
   <p>2. A common educational fund must be established, from which the salaries of the personnel shall be drawn, so that the position of the teacher will be elevated, and his social dignity will be upheld.</p>
   <p>3. Each community must contribute a proportional share of its income to the educational fund for the maintenance of its schools.</p>
   <p>The resources, therefore, of the educational fund may be enumerated as follows:</p>
   <p>(a) A community appropriation from its general income toward this fund;</p>
   <p>(b) The collection-plate in church:</p>
   <p>(c) Tuition paid by pupils, which may be reduced or even altogether abolished if other resources are sufficient;</p>
   <p>(d) Proceeds or percentages from text-books and writing materials sold;</p>
   <p>(e) Income from diplomas, fees, and other certificates;</p>
   
   <p>(f) Proceeds from festivals, fairs, plays, and other affairs;</p>
   <p>(g) Regular or special collections;</p>
   <p>(h) Donations and bequests; and</p>
   <p>(i) Contributions or allowances of societies and organizations.</p>
   <p>Limited space does not permit more analytical elaboration of our educational question.</p>
   <p>We desire that the Ecclesiastical Congress shall take this most vital question into proper consideration and by taking serious steps lay the cornerstone of our educational program upon which to base the perpetuation of our national and religious convictions and ideals in America.</p>
