   <p>A dance and a program will be given tonight by the Ladies' Association of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the benefit of the Plato School, which is located in the vicinity of this church on the Northwest Side. Undoubtedly all will accord their hearty support to this function for the sake of the school, in which our mother language is taught.</p>
