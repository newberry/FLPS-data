   <p>We have repeatedly asked Mr. J. Koteopoulos to present himself at our offices and prove that he is the rightful owner of the radio we recently raffled. Mr. Kotosopoulos has failed to do this, and has put us in an embarassing position by his action. We ask him, therefore, to stop making untruthful remarks about our Board of Directors.</p>
