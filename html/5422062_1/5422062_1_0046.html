   <p>In our childhood years we all remember that the opinion was held by many that a nation--whether Greece or America--was in need of mechanics, chemists, and skilled workers. Most countries had a overflow of lawyers and doctors. Now, even the professional fields are crowded; and the number of unemployed professional men and artisans is larger, comparatively, than that of any other group.</p>
   <p>The machine stage of our civilization created a need for machinists, architects, chemists, and naturalists, without whose help it could not progress. Despite the contentions that we are still in the infant stages of mechanized development, the last ten years prove that the machine age has already reached a static period. And, just as the services of mechanically-trained workers will no longer be in such great demand, the professional workers who improved machinery and devised new machines and chemicals will also become unemployed.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the best weapon a person can have against the many oppositions he will encounter is a good education. That is why Greek parents are making such sincere efforts to give their children higher education, even at tremendous sacrifice. They realize that without education their children will be without weapons in the modern world.</p>
