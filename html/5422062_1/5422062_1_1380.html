   <p>p. 1.- The first thing required for success in business, is accurate knowledge of business affairs in general, and of the business in which one is engaged in particular. Only recently have the schools and Universities in the United States undertaken to teach the essentials of business. Their neglect in this respect has led many corporations, industries, banks, and foreign trade concerns to establish their own schools.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the second thing required for success in business is its backbone. Without honesty no bank can exist; and the retailer depends upon the honesty of his customers as much as they depend upon his. "Honesty pays in a business sense, because honesty is a fundamental need in human relations. It pays to observe it for the same reason that it pays to observe the law of gravitation. Such laws cannot be ignored without disastrous results." Honesty, more than ever, is a business asset, whether in dealing with competitors, customers, employers, or with oneself.</p>
   <p>Service is the third element required for success in business. The introduction of the concept of service in business has given all transactions a <span class="page-break">2</span>different aspect. "The retailer no longer looks upon the customers as legitimate prey to be exploited to the limit; he now considers how he may best please his patrons so that their relations may be permanent."</p>
   <p>Character is the fourth element required in business. The introduction of the concept of service in business can no longer be measured, solely by the amount of money accumulated, but also by the mark left upon the lives of those who make contacts in the business world. Business success, therefore, in the future, more so than in the past, will be built upon character. Honesty with one's self and with others, a demand for the truth as to business facts, a sympathetic and fair attitude toward associates, a sense of responsibility for one's actions, etc., these are necessary prerequisites of success in business.</p>
