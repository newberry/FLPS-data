   <p>Mr. N. Limperis, Lawyer.... as a loyal minister of Themis, to my question about the future of Greeks in America answered as follows: "Living in a century of scientifically organized capital, with all the resources of developed mechanical speed, we Greeks must understand our environment and organize systematically so that we shall not be left behind by others in the race.</p>
   <p>"Circumstances may not be so favorable as they formerly were, yet opportunities have not altogether vanished, for the 123 millions of people of this democracy must live, and in life there is naturally progress as well as retrogression.</p>
   <p>"Let us avoid luxury and expensive habits if we would have freedom of thought and economic independence .... calm sleep and moderate happiness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Let Greek mothers teach their children, as they always try to do, the wise proverb, 'Do not squander in superfluities, or you will want for necessities.'</p>
   <p>"All those who work intellectually with the Greek-American populace should also remind them of the value of time and warn them not to waste it.... advising the youth to avoid gambling, aye, reminding them that 'good things are acquired by toil, and what is easily gained, namely, without toil, is carelessly spent!"</p>
   <p>"The Greek bears on his shoulders a very heavy obligation to history, and on account of this he ought to develop body, spirit, and soul, in order to be found equal to this overwhelming task of spreading enlightenment.... drawing new courage, strength and hope from the new struggles for civilization.</p>
   <p>"However, to make our foundations more durable for the future and the future happiness of Greeks, we ought to let our children acquire a perfect Greek-American culture, if, indeed, we are, as Greeks, interested in a <span class="page-break">\3</span>culture becoming to Greeks, a culture supreme in ethics, and in a decent career for our children.</p>
   <p>"This remarkable and everlasting task, the promotion of a career for the Greek race, we shall accomplish by establishing sound Greek-American institutions of learning. Let us get to work, then, and not neglect things, drugged by tomorrow's hope."</p>
   <p>Mr. P. N. Limperis comes from Kastri of Kynouria. Graduated from college in Greece and having attended the law course in our National University there, he decided to pursue his career in in the New World, where he received instruction in law at the University of Chicago. Here, by his zeal, vitality, and ambition, he finished his studies and received his degree two years ago.</p>
