   <p>P. S. Lambros, Esq.,</p>
   <p>The Greek Star,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>As a lover of Lincoln and a student of Pericles I was greatly interested to see in today's New York paper a brief account of your address before the Hamilton Club on the occasion of the celebration of Lincoln's birthday yesterday.</p>
   <p>I wish to congratulate you. The full text of your address was not printed, but enough appeared to indicate how you compared Lincoln's Gettysburg address with Pericles's funeral oration, and I gathered also that you made a comparison between the State of the Union at the time of Lincoln's <span class="page-break">\2</span>famous speech and conditions in Greece in the years of the Civil War among the Greek states when Pericles lived.</p>
   <p>It would have been a pleasure to me to read the address in full.</p>
   <p>With kind regards,</p>
   <p>Cordially yours,</p>
   <p>Fr. W. Jackson, attorney,</p>
   <p>111 Broadway, New York City.</p>
