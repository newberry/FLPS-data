   <p>The other day four of us were sitting at a table discussing education and its methods with a man who has made a study of the subject, and whom we all recognize as a learned man. We started to discuss the various educational methods used in Germany, Greece, and America.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the lead was taken by our pedagogical friend, who made an accurate comparison of the modern educational system of Greece and that of twenty years ago. He also outlined present German teaching methods and compared them with previous ones. His words were well chosen and his thoughts were well expressed, indicating that he knew the subject very well. I learned something of interest in that discussion: thirty years ago in German schools seventy two hours of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Greek language was required for graduation, while the requirement for German was only twenty-six hours.</p>
   <p>On only one point did I disagree with the professor, and that was regarding the study of classical Greek. His opinion was that classical education is valueless and should be eliminated. I contend that it cannot be valueless since it helped produce such minds as Goethe, Schiller, Schopenhouer, Descartes, and Spenser. They dipped deeply into the well of classical Greek philosophy and literature. They not only studied these subjects but also used them as sources of inspiration for their own creative thinking. Of course, there is a great amount of evidence in defense of my friend's statement. Many renowned poets, philosophers, and thinkers never read a line of a classic, and had no academic training, yet wrote philological masterpieces. Kipling was an obscure writer without any special education. Joseph Conrad was an uneducated sailing master. Herman Manville was a sailor, and it was he who said: "A sailing ship was my Yale and Harvard." O. Henry was a mere shepherd, and Keats was an apothecary. D. H. Lawrence was born into a family of coal diggers. Yet, everything written <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>by these men has enriched humanity and furthered knowledge. Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, from an academic standpoint, must be classified as ignorant men.</p>
   <p>What does this seeming contradiction signify, and what conclusion can we arrive at? To me, it signifies that our own mental efforts, and not the training received in schools, is the barometer of our knowledge and ability. No matter how much a student learns or is taught in school, he cannot be an intellectual if he ceases to learn when he receives his diploma. A professional man who graduated twenty years ago and has not crossed the bridge of thought since then is a dead man as far as contemporary thinking is concerned. He has been dead for twenty years. I believe that education really begins as soon as one graduates from school. I hope my opinion has not startled anyone.</p>
