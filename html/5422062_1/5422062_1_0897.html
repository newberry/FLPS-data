   <p>p. 8.- The following article is from an editorial which was published in the Masonic Chronicle of March 28, 1936. Its importance commands the attention of all the Ahepans.</p>
   <p>Hyphenated Americanism has been the target of considerable criticism during the last twenty years. The United States, for a century, has endeavored to assimilate those who came from other lands to seek a home in the United States which served as a melting pot so that those who cast their lot with us might be molded into citizens whose paramount inclination would be allegiance to the principles and ideals of a free people, to uphold and preserve American institutions and to labor for the common welfare and advancement of the United States. Hyphenated Americanism was regarded, and not unjustly, as slowing down the process of assimilation--by fostering natural love for the mother country, but creating a divided allegiance, and by deferring the time when the interests of the United States would find first place in the heart and mind of those who sought participation in its blessings and privileges.</p>
   
   <p>That this is not always true is shown by the objects set forth in the constitution of the Supreme Lodge of Ahepa (the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association), which are briefly as follows: "To emphasize loyalty to the United States; to develop appreciation of citizenship under the state and federal governments; to promote clean politics by upholding the ideal in civic and social matters; to keep before its members the evils of tyranny in all phases of human relationships; to inculcate an appreciation and understanding of Hellenic peoples, past and present; to promote moral ideas among its members by keeping before them the advantages of education, the strength and beauty of sacrifice, and deteriorating effects of selfishness; to uphold the public school system of the United States; to resist, by all lawful means and methods, any tendency toward a union between the government of the United States of America and any church or religion and to repel the interference of any religion in governmental affairs, either state or national.</p>
   <p>Ahepa was organized in 1922 by eight naturalized Greeks. Today it has 317 chapters in the United States and Canada and a membership of fifty thousand naturalized Greeks and Americans of Greek extraction.</p>
   
   <p>It declares itself free from all hyphenated implications and is regarded as one of the most patriotic and progressive American organizations.</p>
   <p>If all foreign-born citizens of the United States will follow the lead of Ahepa and earnestly strive to carry out the avowed objects of its constitution, the problem of assimilating and digesting foreign-born residents of the United States will solve itself.</p>
