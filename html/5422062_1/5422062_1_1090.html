   <p>It would be a fine thing if some way could be found to encourage the Greek youth to take advantage of America's educational facilities, for their own and for Greece's honor. It is true that most young people are anxious to pursue their studies and become worthwhile. Sometimes failure to do so is due to financial conditions, and sometimes to lack of mental ability. Nevertheless, the sincere students, having both persistence and patience, reach the point of being able to follow some profession. Not always is it easy to decide exactly what profession it should be. It is true that some individuals are naturally cut out for some fields, such as medicine and law. Man is a very imitative animal, and is carried along on a tide. Just as there are trends in fashions, so are there tides which influence people to follow certain arts, sciences, or professions.</p>
   <p>The Greeks have always been inclined toward the professions, and facts show that Greece has great numbers of professional men. There are so many that <span class="page-break">2</span>the courts are overflowing with lawyers seeking clients. This was due to the lack of national wisdom that existed until ten years ago. Just as Greece has undergone a change, due to Venizelos and the Liberals, so must those in America, because the Greeks here are not on the right path, and we see many pitfalls. In Chicago, for instance, the Greek youths who work as waiters, as streetcar conductors, and as mechanics, starve in order to study a profession at night. They do not realize the opportunities before them in the business world, such as were taken advantage of by Rockefeller, and so end up in the same situation as their countrymen across the ocean. These young men are to be praised for their zeal and ambition; but, because they have no experience, they do not know where to concentrate their abilities.</p>
   <p>Is there any vocational guidance group in Chicago for the Greek youth? Of course not. Therefore, it is not the fault of the young people when they do not know which field to follow. And so they are carried along by the tide to a future that will be unsuccessful, when they might have enjoyed the benefits of business enterprise.</p>

   <p>In order to right this wrong, there are certain things that must be done. First the press must enlighten the readers as to their true interests. The consuls, with the help of leading businessmen, should found some sort of a vocational guidance group which would open the doors of wealth and success to our youth. If this were done, it would result in many Greeks becoming millionaires in a few years.</p>
   <p>Any of my compatriots can refuse to believe me. And anyone who already has the millions is invited to become a national benefactor, such as Rockefeller who, by the way, was a businessman, and not a professional man.</p>
   <p>All this has been written because of a sincere interest in the Greek Youth.....</p>
