   <p>After ten years of hard work in America, Mr. X returned to his native land. He remained there for a year, married, and had a son.</p>
   <p>One fine spring day, Mr. X told his wife he would be back in two years, took his hat and left for America. He came to America when economic conditions were at their worst. Failing to find work, he fell deeper in despair which was not lightened when letter after letter kept coming from the lonesome bride. The money he left her was all gone, her beauty was fading,her child was starving and still there was no reply from her husband.</p>
   <p>That was when I met Mr. X. We used to eat in the same restaurant. He was thin, despondent, and had a bad cough. A few days later he disappeared....</p>
   
   <p>Six months later I met Mr. X in the same restaurant. He had changed. He was a sleek, prosperous man. When I showed an interest in him and asked about his family, he gave me a disdainful look and walked away. He dropped a newspaper as he walked away. It was titled "Race Track News". Our friend was in the horse racket. He knew the "ropes" from A to Z. He became a maniac over the races and he was getting richer and richer. His wife's letters of poverty and sickness failed to move him.</p>
   <p>Then his luck changed. Slowly but steadily he lost. Every penny he got he bet on horses. When he could no longer borrow money to place on a horse, he took the only possible course--he committed suicide.</p>
