   <p>Last Sunday was a most important day for our schools. Most of our churches had their school holidays--the holiday for Greek letters. An entire Greek child world had its day.</p>
   <p>About 100 Greek boys and girls are enrolled at the Greek school of St. Basil. Children as young as four to six years of age are taught Greek, the Bible, and Greek history. The teachers are Mr. Philip Kaskas and his wife who instill into the hearts of the Greek children the nationalist spirit.</p>
   <p>The program given in the hall of the school last Sunday was a huge success. The pupils, thoroughly couched by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kaskas, sang Greek songs, recited poems and took part in plays and dialogues. Miss P. Spiropoulos amazed everyone with her grand performance on the piano.</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the evening a few words were spoken by Mr. Philip Kaskas, the teacher and by the priest of St. Basil, most Reverend Erinaios Tsourounakis.</p>
