   <p>The board of directors of the Saint Constantine Church and Community on Chicago's South Side, elected a new supervisory committee for the complete and harmonious administration of the Coraes Greek-American Educational Institution.</p>
   <p>The new School Committee is composed of John Katsari, president; Chris Morpha, vice-president; John Counogeris, treasurer; John Karousos, secretary; and L. Malakate, adviser.
