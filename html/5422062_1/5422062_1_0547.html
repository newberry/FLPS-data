   <p>The Mothers Association of Socrates School is going to give the first annual dance for the benefit of this school on the West side.</p>
   <p>Socrates School is the largest Greek School in America and consequently bears the greatest burdens. The fact that more than five hundred Greek Children are instructed there is enough to convince anybody now great its mission is, and what great services it is rendering to the Greek populace of America.</p>
   <p>We should be proud of such an institution and devote all our efforts toward the support and improvement of it.</p>
   <p>The good ladies who initiated the Association and gave it the beautiful title "School Mothers Association", and who labor for it with such devotion and love. are worthy of warm thanks and congratulations for their noble sentiments and the hard work which they have applied to it and should be supported by all our fellow <span class="page-break">2</span>Greeks. The proceeds of the affair will go to the support of the school. The president of the Association is Mrs. Victoria Latsi; the treasurer is Mrs. Alexandra Nicolatsea. They, with the ladies of the Executive Council, are entitled to hearty congratulations.</p>
   <p>All Greeks who realize their duty, we have no doubt, will be at Plasterers' Union Hall, 332 S. Marshfield Avenue, next Sunday for the support of the Greek school Socrates.</p>
