   <p>p. 1.- The Americans have coined a well-known phrase to describe the Greeks. They say, "When Greek meets Greek, they start an argument." Naturally, that is a national and an ethical curse on us, but it must stay with us because it is the truth. The Americans are right, we must admit ourselves that when a Greek starts an argument with another Greek, the fun begins. Sometimes there is no cause for the argument but usually one of the two Greeks is wrong, but refuses to admit it.</p>
   <p>A very vivid example of this occurred at the recent community elections on December 13. The argument had to be settled in court.</p>
   <p>We are not going to say any more on the subject. Think awhile Mr. Greek. Whose fault is it?</p>
