   <p>The West Side Church wishes to inform the parents in its community that its fine Greek school will commence the regular schedule on the first day of September. The teaching staff will be complete and fully capable of teaching English and Greek.</p>
   <p>The school building itself is the best of its kind in the country. [Translator's note: In comparison with other Greek schools only.] It is well heated in winter and well ventilated at all times. It includes a special lunchroom where the pupils may eat or buy their lunches. The classrooms are clean and conducive to the general health and comfort of the pupils.</p>
   <p>We also wish to bring the school's evening classes to the attention of the Greek adults. A business school is conducted for those who, besides English, have a need for further general business knowledge. The Saloniki recommends <span class="page-break">2</span>that the grownups of the Greek community take advantage of these educational facilities.</p>
