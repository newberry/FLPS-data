   <p>Greece, confluence at South Halsted street and Blue Island avenue, April 2nd--Europe at last! We have come half around the world in two weeks to enjoy the sensation. Make the most of it. Constantinople we only glanced at from across the street, and, besides, Constantinople is not really Europe.</p>
   <p>We came through the Dardanelles on a Madison street car and transferred on Halsted street for the voyage down the beautiful Aegean Sea. We were disappointed in the Aegean. We did not, even when we reached Blue Island Avenue, find the limpid blue waters over which globe trotters rave.</p>
   
   <p>The street car was fully as picturesque as the travelogues had led us to expect. The trolley pole had exactly the same slant as the lateen sails that dot the Mediterranean in picture postcards. The steerage passengers, too, were very fine, clinging to the rear platform like a swarm of bees. No other rear platforms, I fancy, can equal those of Halsted street. Colonel Looper was so enthusiastic he did not complain even when a strange man, quite a common person, stood on his foot for two blocks.</p>

   <p>It was one bell of the first dog watch (translator's note: 4:<span class="gap">[gap]</span> P.M.) when the skipper's voice rang down from the bridge: "Stand by for Harrison street and Blue Island avenue." with our binoculars we could make out over the port bay the commanding red promontory of the Greek-American Bank rising precipitously from the waves across the confluence of Halsted street and Blue Island avenue.</p>
   
   <p>We got off and took a walk about the Greek nation. Greek art is the most famous in the world; so are its letters. Chinese is more ornate. Armenian may look like a moving picture of a measuring worm having a fit, but these lack the human interest; there are enough real letters in Greek signs to arouse the detective instinct. Coffee-house is spelled "Kafeneion." There you have it at a glance, all but two symbols resembling a futurist conception of Alderman Merriam wearing a halo. Surely Kafeneion stands for cafeen, which puts the cough in coffee. We can never be sure unless we loaf around a university for six years.</p>
