   <p>A meeting of the Greek restaurant employees took place last Thursday. The purpose of the meeting was further to clarify the demands of these unionized waiters, cooks, and managers.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Raklios, a Chicago Greek restaurateur who owns fourteen eating places, offered his help and co-operation in order that the union might become strong. Mr. Raklios spoke at this meeting and expressed his approval of the demands of the union. Although certain demands are made upon the employer, it is well to remember that the union employee has certain obligations to his employer. Mr. Raklios believes, therefore, that unionization will benefit the employee and the employer alike.</p>
   <p>The union helps unemployed members obtain positions, and it also helps them learn the English language. Members are given instruction in business management, and are also provided for by a sick benefit fund.</p>

   <p>In the future the union meetings will be held in the afternoon since so many of the men are employed in the evening. The officers and the membership committee are working very hard to win new members. We advise all restaurant employees to join this union for their own benefit and the benefit of the community.</p>
