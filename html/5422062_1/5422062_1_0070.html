   <p>Last Tuesday afternoon we were accorded the privilege of being present at the commencement exercises of the University of Chicago. We attended this event with a special feeling of pride. Among those receiving diplomas was the well-known pedagogue of our community, Mr. George Drosos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Drosos received his bachelor's degree a few years ago from the same university. After three years of study and after writing a thesis on "The Egocentrism of Children," he has received the degree of Master of Arts.</p>
   <p>We congratulate this outstanding member of our race, and urge him on to even greater achievements, of which he is no doubt capable.</p>
