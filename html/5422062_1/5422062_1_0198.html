   <p>A very interesting program will be presented at the Benefit Musicale, which the Greek Women's University Club is giving, Saturday afternoon, December 10th, at the Tower Town Club. A group of ambitious and talented young Greek musicians will present piano, vocal, and violin selections. In addition to classical selections, semi-classical Greek compositions will be given. Of singular interest is the fact that the Greek Women's University Club of Chicago is the only organized group of Greek college and university women in America.</p>
   <p>Thus the Greek community of Chicago, which has always been a leader in Greek cultural circles, has the distinction of having in its midst an organized group of Greek college and university women. The program should be of especial interest, not only because the proceeds will be used for the maintenance of the Scholarship Fund, but because this group of promising young Greek musicians should be encouraged.</p>
