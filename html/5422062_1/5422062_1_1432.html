   <p>P. 1 - Because of the activity of Dr. N. Salopoulos, Greek Consul General in Chicago and head of the committee of prominent Greeks who persuaded a third of the Greek strike-breakers to give up their jobs, the Chicago Inter Ocean and other dailies have published articles of some length criticizing the Greek diplomat as "meddling in the local affairs of the city."</p>
   <p>Dr. Salopoulos in an official letter to the above-mentioned paper has corrected the inaccuracies of the articles published by it and by other journals, calling attention to the fact that he is neither for nor against the packing-house strike but is very much interested in upholding the dignity and prestige of the nation which he represents.</p>
