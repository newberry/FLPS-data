   <p>Why do the Greeks waste their time and energy in babbling and chattering? Talk, talk, talk, and nothing but talk.</p>
   <p>Oh! you poor Greeks, you are blamed for everything in this World. If it isn't "Greek meets Greek" or the "Greeks have a word for it", it is always something else. History, religion, science, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, theology, civilization, culture, and war cannot be discussed properly without mixing the Greeks in either for good or evil, either praising the Greeks or blaming them. The world forgot that you are the sons of God, and that your gift of expression comes from above. Not from you the demi-Gods, but from the Gods above themselves.</p>
   <p>Most of us have read or have heard the words, "In the beginning was the Word, etc." Indeed, in the beginning was the Word and there is no end to it. The Word is independent of time, race, religion, age, habits, and treaties. The entity which we call man, from the crade to the grave, does nothing else but talk. He baas immediately after he is born and continues to prate until he dies. Not only when he is awake but also when he sleeps, talk is a part of his life. We can live without thinking, but we cannot live without talking. Our present day politicians live without thinking, but do they talk, talk, talk. Many personalities were praised, extolled, and deified, for being only orators. Why then do you blame the poor Greek? He wants to become great by talking and talking.</p>
   <p>The Greek, before he became the paragon of civilization of his time, conquered the known world by force. After he reached the zenith of conquest, he began his talk expeditions. But isn't that just exactly what we do today? Don't we choose our best talkers to go to the battle field of diplomacy, and fight it out with the chosen talkers of other nations?? Don't the modern priests, teachers, demagogues, the statesmen, and presidents talk, talk, and talk? Don't the various councils of relition, science, commerce, business, and the city council do nothing but talk and talk? At least no one will refute that if we follow the women's councils, in the name of Jehovah, we would be convinced that the Word has no beginning and no end.</p>
   <p>Why then, by Zeus, does everyone accuse the Greeks of gathering around the coffee houses and do nothing but talk and talk? The Greek says, "talk, talk, you pay no taxes by talking." Poor Greek, you continue to be the blame for all the talk in this world.</p>
