   <p>April 15, 1914</p>
   <p>To the Press:</p>
   <p>We have been witnessing a spectacular and circus-like advertising campaign concerning the announced incognito visit to the United States of Queen Eleonora, the Queen of the Bulgars, and it is apparent that no trick or device has been overlooked to give the widest publicity to Queen Eleonora as if she was to go on the stage or to take the platform on a Chatauqua circuit.</p>
   <p>If we are not mistaken the Queen's novelty-like undertaking has the same object in view as that of the late campaign of defamation aimed against the Hellenes. Reports and cablegrams are coming in one after another from headquarters and enterprising press agents, to the effect that the <span class="page-break">2</span>Hellenes of the United States are in a resentful mood over the coming of Eleonora and these reports would have the world think that the Hellenes are fearful, as if Eleonora was some Persian King triumphantly marching against Marathon or Salamis breathing destruction to all things Hellenic.</p>
   <p>We wish to emphasize that the Hellenes have no ill-feeling towards Queen Eleonora or her subjects, and we regret that such reports should be circulated reflecting as they do, on the Hellenes. We, however, hope that Queen Eleonora will confine her activities to studying the conditions in this country and to praising her own subjects without gratuitously assailing the character of the Hellenes and the Hellenic Army as was lately done by advertised advocates of the Bulgar cause.</p>
   <p>As of the Hellenes of the United States we beg to state that they will join with the other Americans in making Queen Eleonora's visit to the United States as pleasant personally and as successful financially as <span class="page-break">3</span>anyone could desire and in saying this we feel that we express the sentiments of all the Hellenes of the United States.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Achaian League,</p>
   <p>By J. C. Theodorou.</p>
