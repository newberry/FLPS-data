   <p>The citizenry of Chicago is up in arms against the Chicago School Board, which, in the opinion of all educators, will wreck the school system with its proposed measures. The Board of Education, like all other public bodies, has been operating for sometime with a deficit. But so has the Police Department, and no one has ever suggested that the number of policemen should be reduced.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education is not only proposing a reduction in the number of teachers; it even seeks to close down certain schools for economy's sake. It is indeed unthinkable that a city which boasts of its achievements should harbor for an instant the idea of restricting education. For, in the last analysis, the proposed measures mean nothing less than fewer opportunities for the boys and girls of the mass of the people to get an education at public expense. Politics in its most <span class="page-break">\2</span>hideous form is menacing the proud American boast of the "little red schoolhouse".</p>
