   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>I have read with great interest your splendid article on Pericles and Lincoln, published in yesterday's Herald and Examiner.</p>
   <p>The depth, the learning, and the power of analysis displayed by you merit the position which was assigned to your address by the editor of that great newspaper.</p>
   <p>With kind regards, I am,</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Morris K. Levinson.</p>
