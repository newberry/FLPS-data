   <p>Journalistic duties oftentimes take us to many Greek stores and restaurants. Each time we have made such contacts we have received certain unpleasant impressions which the American people have no doubt received to a more noticeable extent from like contacts. We are sure that the complaint we have to make has arisen in nearly everyone's mind at one time or another when in a Greek place of business.</p>
   <p>Greek businessmen do not shave every day and, because of their natural darkness, thus have the appearance of wild men or of gangsters. And, as if this were not sufficient, they make the matter worse by wearing a shirt or apron until it is fairly black. Greeks have lately entered the tavern business, and we notice that their bartenders are dressed as if they were selling grog to sailors on some dingy wharf.</p>
   <p>No matter what work the hard times may have forced one to do, he is not excusable if he is careless in regard to his personal appearance and hygienic <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>requirements. American people are supersensitive to dirty teeth, dirty aprons, and bare hairy arms. Of course, the majority of Greek businessmen are not of this description; but one such can ruin the reputation of an entire group. Another thing we notice is that Greeks usually wear a habitual scowl when in their stores. This may be caused by overwork and worry; but the customer does not realize this and thinks they are wild foreigners such as he reads about.</p>
