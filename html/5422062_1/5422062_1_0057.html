   <p>It is well known that the world is in a dilemma because of the overproduction of goods; and it would seem that the educated man is among the articles which have become too numerous. A warning of the scant room left in the professions has just been published by the French Ministry of Labor; and parents are being plainly discouraged from entering their sons in law schools.</p>
   <p>A college degree, it is pointed out, has come to be looked upon as a liability rather than as an asset. A depressing paragraph describes the official unemployment registry, where learned doctors and lawyers lengthen lines along with domestic servants. The report hints that there is an "encumbrance" of intellectual persons"; and its dispiriting phrases are, unfortunately, no less applicable to conditions in this country.</p>
   <p>A major tragedy of the depression is that thousands of young men expensively prepared for posts demanding knowledge and ability have no chance to display either talent or character. The professions, it has been said, have been overcrowded for years, but lately, hopeless trade conditions have caused them to be besieged. And when an assailant from a university does win a foothold, an older man--whose expectation of re-employment is desperately small--is added to the surplus of educated persons.</p>
   <p>The pause in world activity has taken work from classes which have no unions to assist them, no claim on the "social services" to which they have long contributed, and no "benefits" to draw from the state. Modem belief that any clerical occupation and a white collar is preferable to any kind of manual work and shirt sleeves, had already created a congestion of "black-coated workers", which the depression has intensified.</p>
   <p>Now that a point has been reached when young men are officially warned against attempting the professions, what are parents to prepare their boys for? A father....may well wish his son to carry on a family tradition, yet since that prospect is closed, must the lad be taught to work with his hand instead of with his brain? Ought a child be taught to reconcile himself to a family when his education shall have been completed? The problem is sorely difficult. If business enterprise needs no recruits, and if the professions--which in turn depend on trade and industry for sustenance--are languishing, what is the alternative for a youth who is being trained at heavy cost to become one more unwanted "intellectual"? It is noted that the report of the French Ministry of Labor suggests no substitutes, presumably because nothing satisfactory can be advanced.</p>
   <p>There is, however, one small precaution parents might use in fitting their sons for the doubtful times ahead. In the old days the counsel was to specialize, to "know something of everything and everything of something". Today, unless a boy has a compelling bent, he may be better served by a broad, general education, a training which aims to produce a versatile type which can succeed passably well in any calling. Then, after leaving school, the adventurer can seize an opportunity with a certain confidence, regardless of its nature. And in a trying period of waiting and watching, he will at least have the consolation of a well-stocked mind. Whereas the youth who has specialized for a dead end is apt to be fretted by resentful and bitter thoughts. Advocacy of an all-round education may not seem to be a great contribution to so baffling a question as "What to do with our sons"; yet, the French Ministry appears to have found it difficult to suggest anything at all. Nothing but a real revival of trade will remove the anxiety which is felt by parents and all young men about to be confronted with the world.</p>
