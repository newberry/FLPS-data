   <p>The Oak Park Ahepas Chapterdan No. 104, is giving a dance banquet at the Sherman Hotel, and invites its members to assist in the success of the dance, as they have done in the past. The proceeds will be given to the school Platon.</p>
   <p>The Ahepas should be congratulated for their initiative and their efforts to inspire National Ideals. Such deeds are not only beneficial to our pupils, who are taught to become useful citizens, but to the whole community which will be composed, in the future, of good citizens. Drive forward for the Greek name.</p>
