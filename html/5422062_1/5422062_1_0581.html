   <p>p. 5.- Due to the fact that the organizing committee of Ahepa, chapter 93, left nothing undone that should be done to insure success, the dance last Monday, at the Trianon was, as anticipated, a very successful affair.</p>
   <p>The program included recitations by Constantine Spyridacos and John H. Katsambis, pupils, and also a dramatic presentation of the immortal tragedy of Sophocles, Antigone, which was played by a group of thirtysix girl pupils.</p>
   <p>The ball was given for the benefit of the Greek schools of the South Side. Every cent of the proceeds goes to the fund for the upkeep and maintenance of Greek schools---a tremendous undertaking, and one of vital importance.</p>
