   <p>p. 1- In Athens in ancient times when the bride was entering the bride groom's house, an unmarried relative of the bridegroom offered her a ring-shaped cake called Kouloure, made of sesame, honey, and walnuts, implying the wish that they might have many children and a happy married life.</p>
   <p>In Gortynia the best man presented the married couple with a cake with the wish implied that their life might be sweet. In Sopoto the bridegroom's mother gave a spoonful of honey apiece to bride, groom, and best man for the same reason.</p>
   <p>In Avia county of Mane as soon as the newly-married couple enter the bride-groom's house, they are fed with honey and walnuts. In Andritsena the mother of the bridegroom gives them jam in a silver spoon.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In Scopelos right after the marriage ceremony a silver tray is set on the table with honey and walnuts. The married couple, the priest, and the best man then must each eat a spoonful of honey and a walnut.</p>
   <p>In Konitsa immediately after the ceremony the bridesmaid distributes to all present pieces of church bread dipped in honey, and in some other parts of Epirus the married couple, the best man, and the bridegroom's relatives consume a whole vaseful of honey.</p>
   <p>In Edessa on the day before the wedding the "nourishing act" takes place, and a small boy offers to the newly-married couple cake (peta) to be eaten of three times. In Siatista immediately after the ceremony big chunks of sugar are placed on the knees of both bridegroom and bride, which they are in duty bound to eat.</p>
   <p>In Livesy in ancient times as soon as the marriage was decided upon, the prospective bridegroom was under obligation to give to the bride's matchmaker a floure (gold coin) in token of the agreement's being closed. On the prospective bridegroom's first visit to the bride's house the so-called <span class="page-break">\3</span>"treatment" of the bride took place, and the bridegroom presented her with a gold coin, which was called "forget-all" (that is, forget the anxiety preceding the closing of the agreement).</p>
   <p>In Lakovikia of Macedonia the bridegroom used to send to the bride with the wedding-ring floria (Turkish gold coins) and other gifts for her near relatives. In other parts of Macedonia the bridegroom at the betrothal presented the bride with ten pierced coins which she hung around her neck and wore as a necklace until the wedding-day.</p>
   <p>In Lefkas immediately before the marriage ceremony the bridegroom made the sign of the cross on the bride's forehead and on her breast with a gold or silver coin, which was cherished as a keepsake.</p>
   <p>The gifts exchanged between the betrothed are called in some places tokens and in others "chares" or gifts.</p>
   <p>The betrothal in Cyorus is called "charitoma," and the two betrothed persons charitomeni (blessed by the church).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The wedding-rings are made of gold or of silver in order to show, as the famous Cosmas the Aetolian says, that the woman must be pure as gold and the man firm as silver.</p>
   <p>In Lyxoure even to-day when the betrothed couple are poor they buy only one ring, which the bride wears till her wedding-day.</p>
   <p>In many parts of Greece it is customary for the bridegroom to break the glass in which they offer him wine after the marriage ceremony, throwing it down forcibly, for this is considered a good omen.</p>
   <p>In Grammenochoria of Epirus it is the best man who breaks the glass to show that he does not wish to find himself in the difficult position of uniting the couple again, and at the same time he expresses to them his wish that this marriage of theirs may be their last.</p>
   <p>In some parts of Greece when the glass is broken,the pieces are counted because the number of pieces indicates the number of children which the newly-wedded couple will have. In addition, they conjecture from the <span class="page-break">\5</span>shapes of the pieces whether the children born to them will be wise, industrious, etc.</p>
   <p>In some parts of Peloponnesus, on the other hand, the custom prevails of breaking all the glasses, dishes, and other utensils used at the wedding dinner.</p>
   <p>In Portaria of Volos the bride anoints the door-posts with butter and then breaks a plate by forcibly throwing it backward.</p>
