   <p>This column has never subscribed to the arguments of those who oppose the recognition of Russia by the United States. All the forensic arguments of the nonrecognitionists could never convince us of the soundness of their position. For even if we admit all that can be said against the tyranny of the proletariat, we cannot see under what moral law we are justified in not recognizing a de facto government.</p>
   <p>In this paradoxical world, no one with intelligence believes or hopes that there ever will be a unanimity of opinion on all matters. But though no such hope is entertained by anyone, reasonable human beings cannot differ upon certain basic facts. In short, we yet fail to see the light of reason in the recognition by the United States of Italy or Jugoslavia, for that matter, and the nonrecognition of Soviet Russia. The difference--if any exists--is in favor of communism.</p>
