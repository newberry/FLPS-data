   <p>The great Greek community of Chicago, this year, celebrated the holidays in harmony, order, and unity, due to the fact that the division of the Church no longer exists.</p>
   <p>Note-worthy of the common harmony, was the meeting of the two populous communities, Holy Trinity and St. Basil, at Polk St. and Blue Island Ave. The crowds of the two communities, while carrying the Saviour's sepulcher around the streets, met but instead of animosity, contempt and war, as usually was the case during the division of the church, hand shaking and kissing took place.</p>
   <p>The executive boards of the two communities the priests of the two churches, and the crowd in general, were throwing kisses right and left with the traditional "Chroniapola" (many years) and the invocation, to have, with God's help, one "Epitaphion", (Good Fridays sacred processives) instead of two in the next year's celebration.</p>

   <p>It would be a divine deed if we were harmoniously united every Sunday of the year, instead of once a year. It would be a blessing if the new generation can be imbued with the idea of going to church, very often to absorb the teaching of our religious beliefs while they are in the plastic age, for anything imprinted in the youngster's mind is difficult to erase when mind and body are matured.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the present harmony and unity way be perpetuated for the benefit of our religious institutions, and the benefit of our race.</p>
