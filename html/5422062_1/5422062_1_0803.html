   <p>The City Ordinance, that is meant to protect children from any indecent and nervebreaking aspects in daily life, gave the writer the ground to ask a further enlargement of the ordinance, so that it will include the phrase "protecting the children from their parents." Who will protect the children from their parents? (at least some parents).</p>
   <p>Some Greek parents teach the youngsters discipline, to say thank you, and to believe that children are brought love in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> from heaven. This is the way some parents this and are fortented that they give the youngsters an ideal <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to begin with.</p>
   <p>The parents drag the young <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to the movies, to public gatherings, entertainments and soon, depriving <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to such places that are polluted with the germs of corruption and immorality and other destructive elements under the guise of art, drama, beauty, etc.</p>

   <p>Very recently <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Greek family devoted to the celebration of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> drinking, the boys and girls singing and dancing, with due respects to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> until the wee hours of the dawn. I also noticed upon a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the picnic prouds beer selling establishment, a youngstar of six or seven years old trying to <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Indeed it was one of the children who was taught, decipline, to any thank you, and to believe be came from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in a backet, but who was also taught, by this example, to spend the rights at public gatherings, and to sleep upon the so<span class="gap">[gap]</span> of beer dispensing establishments. No one would dare dispute that such a treatment of youngstar is not right, still however, there is no <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to protect the young terms from their parents.</p>
