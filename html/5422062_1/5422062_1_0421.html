   <p>We request the Greeks of Chicago and all those with whom we have not communicated by mail because we do not know their addresses, to take notice of the Grand Bazaar for the benefit of the Socrates Greek School at the school hall on July 2 and 3, from 2 to 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>All those who are interested in the school's progress and in the success of this benefit affair may send any article or other handmade object to be sold at the bazaar.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that this request and appeal will receive a generous response on the part of those among our people who never miss any opportunity to prove that they are ever willing and ready to assist in every noble cause.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank you in advance and remain with great respect and highest <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>consideration,</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors</p>
