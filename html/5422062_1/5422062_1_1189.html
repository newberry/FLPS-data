   <p>Every so often in Chicago the pro-Bulgars utter their philippics, calumniating Greece and the Greek name, and they go scot free. They are allowed to continue with their vituperations, defaming the Greek name, beclouding the truth, and spreading their dastardly Slavonic propaganda against Greece, the mother of civilization and Christianity, and against the Greek language, the tongue of the Gospel.</p>
   <p>This Slavonic propaganda is designed to destroy anything Greek.</p>
   <p>Some part of the American press in Chicago is the paid tool of this Slavonic propaganda, and consequently it publishes just what it is directed to publish by the Mongols.</p>
   <p>They go unchallenged. They poison the minds of the innocent and the uninformed against Greece, the Greek name, and the Greek language.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>For centuries the Popes of Rome have failed, by similar methods, to subject the Greek Church to their domination. This battle of the Popes has now been taken up by the Pan-Slavonic Russian Church, which is trying to do what the Popes have failed to do.</p>
   <p>In the present war of Greece and her allies against Bulgaria, the bearish daughter of Russia, the Slavonic progagandu is again at work to poison the minds of the American people with reports published in the bought press that the Greek army fighting the Bulgars has committed inhuman, brutal, and atrocious acts against non-combatants and others.</p>
   <p>Imagine civilized Greeks acting inhumanly against non-combatants! It is absolutely absurd to think of it. Why, the foreigners who live in Greece or follow the Greek army, the missionaries, the reporters, the photographers, the doctors, and the nurses, would have reported any incident of that <span class="page-break">3</span>kind to their respective governments and to the press of the world.</p>
   <p>The idea that only certain newspapers in Chicago get the news of the Greek brutalities, and not the rest of the world! Fabrications, calumnies, and paid propaganda!</p>
   <p>Where is our Greek intellectual group? Where is our professional men's club to draw the sword in our defense, march to the battlefield of journalistic activity, and with the sharpness of the naked truth disprove the perverted statements of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>r-herders?</p>
   <p>Why do our professional men in Chicago stand aloof and permit the Mongols to discharge lies and invective upon the Greek race? Are they inferior to the mud-slingers in knowledge, in eloquence, in journalistic ability? They are not. Or are they modest?. To hell with such modesty! Modesty is becoming when one is dealing with human beings, not when one faces anthropo- <span class="page-break">4</span>morphic beasts of the jungle.</p>
   <p>The reason, therefore, for such inertia is that we are not united in a body for the purpose of defense. We have associations and societies for other purposes, but we have not a politico-philological club or society to take up the defense of Greece and the Greek <span class="gap">[gap]</span> professional men, who are able to come to the bat and disprove these fabrications and calumnies, have no such club to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and deliberate in. It is hard indeed for any one to act individually and bring the desired results.</p>
   <p>It behooves us, therefore, to organize one or more clubs of this kind and to stand ready, prepared, and equipped to defend our race against the lies and the mud-slinging of its enemies.</p>
   <p>Let us have that club as quickly as possible and not postpone it any longer. A tough board requires <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to get results. Let us do it now.</p>
