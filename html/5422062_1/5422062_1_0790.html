   <p>Owing to the rarity of such an unusual coincidence, it is with pleasure that we publish the picture and the names of the six scions of the family, Chiagouris.</p>
   <p>They bear ancient and glorified names; Demosthenes, Aristotle, Pericles, Alexandros, Socrates, and Homer. The six young Chiagouris brothers, born here, speak both Greek and English, and are lovers of Greek history and culture. During my conversation with them,they promised to honor the glorious names they bear.</p>
   <p>The young Greek-American brothers are so enthused by their Greek ancestors, that they, if need be, would go to defend Mantineia if a new Epamenondas of Thebes, should move against her.</p>
