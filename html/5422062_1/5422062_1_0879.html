   <p>"Happy New Year!"</p>
   <p>Here's a clean slate for a relapsed world! Every one whose good resolutions of two weeks ago have already fallen into the discard has a chance to begin all over again to-day. Turn over a new leaf, and let yesterday's regrets slide back into last year's oblivion!</p>
   <p>To-day is New Year's Day according to the Julian Calendar, which is official time among Greeks, Russians, and others who worship in the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star, to-day explained the reason for the difference in calendars and for to-day's general celebration in Greek congregations.</p>
   <p>"The calendar was reformed in the year 50 B. C. by order of Julius Caesar," he said.</p>
   <p>"At that time it was known that the complete solar year comprised exactly 365 days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and forty-eight seconds. That was considered a surplus of six hours over 365 days annually, and it was decreed that every fourth year should be leap-year to provide the extra day.</p>
   <p>"The use of approximate figures made a difference of one day every 129 years.</p>
   <p>"The error was corrected in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. He decided to take three days from the calendar every 300 years. The Gregorian Calendar was advanced ten days at the time of its correction to make allowance for the time since the birth of Christ. And three days have been taken off since that time.</p>
   <p>"Neither calendar is exactly correct, but the Gregorian is more nearly so."</p>
