   <p>The bazaar for the benefit of Chicago's West Side Greek School, which took place last Sunday and Monday in the school building and which was organized by the Greek School Committee, was a great success.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Agriostathis, committee secretary, worked tirelessly and with great enthusiasm for the success of this nationalistic cause in collaboration with the other distinguished committee members. The committee deserves the highest praise for its fine work. It was composed of the Reverend Archmandrite Leon Pygeas, Messrs. D. Papantoniou, G. Tsiacouris, A. Tsikouris, A. Chronopoulos, John Venizelos, B. Doukas, and George Bitcharas. It is estimated that the net profit for the benefit of the school will amount to $2,500.</p>
   <p>The following ladies contributed to the success of the bazaar, and they deserve congratulations:</p>
