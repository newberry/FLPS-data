   <p>The school committee of the West Side parish met for the purpose of starting a campaign to raise money for the erection of a school building on the lot belonging to the church.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee donated various amounts to the fund in order to set a good example to the other members of the community. The sums donated were as follows: Consul General Salopoulos, $25; Reverend Leon Pygeas, $50; James Papantony, $50; George Sellas, $50; G. Chronopoulos, $50; Bill Doukas, $25; and John Agriostathis, $10.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the members of the committee for contributing so generously, especially since none of them are wealthy men.</p>
   <p>Our children must learn the Greek language and must be trained in the Orthodox religion.</p>
