   <p>The middle class reminds me of an old proverb which says, "The stone rolled toward the egg--God help the egg. The egg rolled over toward the stone--again pity the poor egg."</p>
   <p>The middle class is put in the position of the egg. If labor rises up in protest, the middle class suffers; if capitalism becomes angry, again the middle class suffers.....All the socialists, all the communists, social workers, all lovers of social progress--all of them fight and plead for the rights of the worker....But the middle class, which struggles to improve thought with which to aid progress and give rise to art and learning, is forgotten.</p>
   <p>The laborer organizes and forces the moneyed interests to give him what he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>asks, namely, higher wages and shorter hours. The moneyed interests, unhappy about giving up some of their profits, raise the prices of their commodities, and so get back some of the money they gave to their workers, The brunt of this added expense falls chiefly upon the shoulders of the middle class.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that the President will overlook the needs of this large group to which he himself belonged before becoming President? He will, we are sure, give consideration to this group which includes three-fourths of the population of this country. Can it be possible that the kindly and progressive Wilson will allow the middle class to be crushed by capitalists? Is it not curious that the group that gives ideas to the others should not have enough sense to organize and defend its just rights?</p>
