   <p>It is doubtful if any Hellene in Chicago does not know of the grand affair to be given next Wednesday night at the Trianon Ballroom, owned by A. Karzas. The Hellas Chapter of the Daughters of Penelope, auxiliary of Ahepa, is the original sponsor of this benefit dance which is being held for the Greek school of Chicago.....It has been widely advertised. No one can excuse his absence by saying that he did not know about it. The purpose is of exceeding worth since the schools are in dire need of funds.</p>
   <p>Greeks from all sections and parishes of Chicago will be present, since this will be a community affair and not merely a parish benefit.....Efforts for the sale of boxes have met with success; they have been sold to National Paper Napkin Company and.....</p>
   <p>Many notables of Greek organizations will be present. Music will be provided by the artists regularly employed by the Ballroom management; also, Mr. Simos <span class="page-break">2</span>will sing the latest Athenian songs. This affair should be supported by every Greek family because it is for the benefit of the entire Greek community. It is everyone's duty to do everything possible to help our schools maintain high standards so that our children may become versed in their Greek language and culture.</p>
