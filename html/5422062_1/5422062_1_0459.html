   <p>The most important problem facing the Greek people of Chicago today is the one concerning the education of their children in the Greek schools.</p>
   <p>The members of the central committee of the unified church parishes of Chicago are faced with the solution of this important problem.</p>
   <p>Statistics issued by the Board of Education of Chicago, reveal that over one thousand Greek children graduated from the grammar schools last year. Only two hundred of these graduated from the two Greek schools of the Holy Trinity Church and the St. Constantine Church. The other eight hundred attended the American public schools.</p>
   <p>These are absolute facts. Only a complete knowledge of the actual truth can help us win our fight--a fight which shall enable our children to learn our mother tongue and the glorious history of our motherland.</p>

   <p>While our various organizations and patriotic clubs compete with one another to get more members;while our parishes are continually fighting over election results or church affairs, while the Greeks of the business world are working day and night in order to get rich, while our priests--without any exception--are expending all their energy and time seeking to officiate at funerals and weddings in order to receive fees, while the Greek newspapers devote their columns to denunciations and shameless name-calling, the innocent Greek children are being raised and educated--not in the Greek customs and language, not in the undying history of our country, not in our sacred Orthodox religion--but in a strange language, strange customs, strange background and strange mores. When these students finish their educations, then goodbye to Hellenism!</p>
   <p>This phenomenon is a brutally true one. It means murder of our nationality, and we, the supposedly patriotic people, are accomplices in this murder.</p>
   <p>While the Greek Church parish of Chicago was still undivided, a large lot on Sibley Street was purchased as the site for a fine school building and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>cafeteria for Greek children. This location was chosen because it was conveniently located for the entire Greek community. However, the division of the parish into three smaller ones played havoc with the plans for the school building. Stables were erected upon this lot, and sadly enough, they are still there.</p>
   <p>The central committee of the three parishes must make it their business to see that the school is built and properly equipped, in order that next year all of the thousand Greek children may attend a Greek school.</p>
   <p>The organization of the school and the proper type of teaching staff must be the concern of every Greek in Chicago, from the priests to the humblest and most ignorant laborer. Every Greek, regardless of whether he is rich or poor, employer or employee, professional man or a common uneducated worker, must concern himself with the important problem facing the Greeks--not only in Chicago, but in the entire United States. The uneducated, in fact, should be even more interested than others who were fortunate enough to receive good educations, since they are the ones who feel the lack of a Greek education and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>who appreciate the benefits derived from learning. No one should be criticized because he is uneducated--unless he deliberately avoided going to school since this is the fault of our social system and not the fault of any individual.</p>
   <p>The entire Greek community must give serious thought and consideration to the improvement of this condition.</p>
