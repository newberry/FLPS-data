   <p>With great pleasure and delight the Greek churchgoers of Chicago, acclaim the decision of the insubordinate Priests, who after extensive study, and deliberation accepted the Encyclical order of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and recognize the authority and jurisdiction of the Chicago Diocese. The decision is of great importance from the standpoint of our religious beliefs. For a time, members of the laity took sides with the insubordinate priests, and the division of the Church was threatening.</p>
   <p>The Greek population of Chicago is united again under the Mother Church.</p>
