   <p>P. 1.- There are twenty thousand Greeks in Chicago today, ready to argue with their neighbor, ready to curse one another, ready to ruin the competitor's business instead of helping him. Why is this? Because there are twenty thousand Greeks in Chicago and each of the twenty thousand considers himself "boss." There should be 30 or 40 prominent Greek men to act as leaders for our community, not twenty thousand. Can't the Greek community of Chicago realize that it is not getting anywhere by this? Don't they see that no organization can move forward if those in its own rank do not agree? We have written on this subject many times, but to no avail. This attitude of the Greeks must be replaced by another one of friendliness and cooperation if they wish to survive as a race in Chicago and all other parts of America, as a matter of fact.</p>
   <p>There is an old saying that fits in here, "Let those who have ears, listen."</p>
