   <p>The greatest problem facing our community today is the one of marriage. We do not intend to explain the marriage vows, or the marriage section of the Bible; we are considering this problem purely from a sociological standpoint. We also desire to speak about two manifestoes issued on this subject; one by Germany and the other by American sociologists in New York.</p>
   <p>The German lawmakers have watched with great alarm the rapid decrease in the German population. In order to counteract this condition--brought about by the slaughter of thousands of men during the war--they have passed the following laws by which they hope to increase the birth rate of the nation:</p>
   <p>1. Bachelors and spinsters will be forced by law to marry immediately.</p>
   <p>2. Bounties will be offered to all mothers bearing twins or triplets; and to all women who bear children every ten months.</p>
   <p>3. Age limits will be changed so that every one between the ages of sixteen and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>seventy will be required to marry.</p>
   <p>4. Parents who have more than twelve children will be given pensions.</p>
   <p>5. Free medical aid will be given to all pregnant women; and they will also be given postnatal care.</p>
   <p>6. No one shall remain unmarried in the land dominated by the Kaiser.</p>
   <p>We all know that this manifesto has been enforced and carried out to the letter; for when the Kaiser gives an order it is usually obeyed.</p>
   <p>While this is going on in Germany, quite the opposite is happening here in America. A club has been formed in New York City, whose purpose is to forbid, by law, all people who are ill, destitute or unbalanced, to marry and bear children. The members of this organization believe that marriage should be entered into only by the fittest of individuals, in order that the coming generations might have the finest type of background.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Last week about seventy-five ragged and tattered individuals marched in a body, up and down Wall Street, bearing placards which read: "Do we destitute people look as if we are ready to marry and raise families? And, if we do marry, will not our families only become burdens to the rest of society?"</p>
   <p>Therefore, while the Germans offer bounties to encourage all their subjects to marry, regardless of whether or not they are physically or mentally unfit--the American people are trying to prevent marriage between those who are not physically and mentally fit.</p>
   <p>Here, in a nutshell, is the basic difference between the Kultur of the Germans and the Yankee ideals.</p>
   <p>We invite all of our readers to send us their opinions concerning these two widely opposite attitudes toward the subject of marriage. We hope to learn the point of view of the Greek people in America, on this subject, from the letters <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>we receive. We, are quite sure of receiving many letters because marriage is a subject that holds the attention of all Greek people; especially in the matter of proper fitness for the grave responsibilities incurred by marriage.</p>
