   <p>According to Mr. Lambros, Editor of the Greek Star of Chicago, marriage amongst Greeks must not be mixed; in other words a Greek man must marry a Greek lady. Then only will the marriage receive the blessing of the parents and the blessing of the Church. Otherwise, the National and Religious the would be minimized and the fruit of such a mixed marriage would be left to the guidance of God. However, love conquers all battles.</p>
   <p>Marriage, according to Mr. Lambros, is the blessing of God. Without marriage, there is no faith, no existence of Church, and no Nationality. Marriage is the holiest and purest tie, and the first duty of every good man.</p>
