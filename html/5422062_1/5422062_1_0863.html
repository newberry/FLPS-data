   <p>Last Sunday the Rite of the Holy Synod took place. The great crowd of people were awed by the dignity, austerity, pomp, magnificence, splendor and grandeur of The Greek Prelates officiating. The Holy Rev. Mr. Alexander from New York, Archbishop of all the Greek Churches of North and South America, in a brilliant speech, brought out the theme, "Man's Connection with God," and eulogized the deeds of the clergy and blessed the crowd.</p>
   <p>Never before have the Greeks of Chicago and vicinity witnessed such a magnificient celebration.</p>
