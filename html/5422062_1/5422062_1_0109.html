   <p>p. 4.- Greek boys, students, of the University of Illinois, who are self-supporting and living under the same roof, formed their fraternity some years ago which now functions successfully, will give their fourth annual dance on the 28th of December, at the Stevens Hotel.</p>
   <p>The aim of the students' society is to promote good will amongst its members, closer cooperation, to defend the Greek name and to mould the character of the students, so that when they begin their career they may follow that line of straightforwardness of character which will distinguish them and lift them to lofty heights.</p>
   <p>All the Greeks in the city and suburbs are invited in their determination to come to this students' dance, and are assured in advance, due to the variety of the program, that they will enjoy it very much.</p>
   
   <p>Editor's note: It is our imperative duty to support our boys who are struggling to educate themselves. They will later on honor and uplift the Greek name and will be a credit to Hellenism. Procure your tickets early thus assuring the success of the dance, which is for the benefit of our boys.</p>
