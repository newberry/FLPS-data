   <p>P. 5--The well-known Moody and Waters Pie Company has contributed $1000 to the Greek Relief Committee. This company is animated by a most philanthropic spirit, which it has manifested in a practical way not only by this contribution to the relief fund but also by other donations made in the past to our occasional dances and by contributions to various causes for which Greeks have solicited funds. The directors of an enterprise which shows such philhellenic sentiments deserve our support and our hearty congratulations. Among others who have contributed large amounts we find B. A. Railton and Company.</p>
   <p>This firm has contributed $500 for the relief of our brothers who are now suffering in consequence of the catastrophe of Asia Minor caused by the Turks.</p>
   <p>Add your contributions to these! Send your donations to the Greek Relief Committee, 127 North Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
