   <p>As a result of the economic crisis which has engulfed all nations of the world, it is believed by many that the democratic form of government is obsolete, and will be replaced by an entirely different type of ideology. For some unknown reason, all the demogogues place the blame for the financial upheaval upon democratic ideals, and criticize America, as the greatest exponent of democracy.</p>
   <p>However, all those who examine the situation with due fairness and without prejudice will find that the World War and its results are the real causes of the depression. History gives proof that a terrible economic scourge has been inflicted upon the masses after every period of war. The self-appointed critics of democracy, if they are sincere, will be forced to admit that most of the European nations were monarchies prior to 1914. It is acknowledged that a spirit of freedom had begun to pervade Europe, and that nearly all the <span class="page-break">\2</span>inhabitants of European nations had the right to vote. But it is also true that individual liberties were curtailed and expressions of public opinion likely to be punished. The government officials and the lawmaking bodies continued to believe that their only responsibility was to their king; and they felt none for the people whom they were supposed to represent.</p>
   <p>In the face of this fact it is difficult to conceive how any individual--especially an educated one--could continue to believe that the democratic ideology is the culprit. Even more inconceivable than that is the fact that individuals do exist who believe that a dictatorship is the ideal type of government. Dictatorship is nothing new to the world, nor is it a new concept of government. History is replete with dictators who were hated and feared by the people, and who, in the end, were either murdered or imprisoned. Every tyrant in the past sooner or later overstepped the bounds of the endurance of his people. If in the beginning he had some slight justification for his existence, it soon vanished, and then he attempted to survive by sheer force of <span class="page-break">\3</span>strength. Examination of the periods ruled over by dictators reveals that there was a marked retardation of the progress of civilization. The restriction of civil liberties, and the destruction of books and even their authors, were chains which forbade thought and self-expression--without which no civilization can progress.</p>
   <p>Those who are not familiar with the exact facts of history may think that dictators and tyrants have benefited the lot of the common people. The truth is that the masses have been, at all times, against the idea of dictatorships as monarchies. When such governments have existed, it has always been in spite of popular desire, and not because of it. For this reason the belief held by some persons, that the future system of government will be laid out by men such as Mussolini or Hitler, is paradoxical.</p>
   <p>The fact that the world has been engulfed in such an economic doldrum is greatly due to the capitalistic form of government which prevails. In its <span class="page-break">\4</span>efforts to increase its own profits, it has paralyzed smaller enterprise and individual endeavors. Therefore, it is self-evident that the evil lies, not at the door of democratic government, but in the roots of the capitalistic profit system. In other lands it is militarism, in ours capitalism, that has brought about economic destruction and instability. They both are systems based upon autocratic ideologies, and both are harmful to the common people.</p>
   <p>The principles of democracy and the desire for it are deeply rooted in every man's heart. It is proved by the great fight people of all nations have made for centuries to achieve it.</p>
