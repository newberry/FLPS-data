   <p>The annual exercises of the Greek school, Homer, were held last Sunday at St. Nicholas Church, on the South Side. More than a hundred and twenty-five students marched into the hall crowded with their proud parents and friends. A pleasing program of music and skits was presented by the children.....The audience was enthusiastic concerning their knowledge and use of the Greek language.</p>
   <p>The exercises were honored by the presence of many Greek notables; among them, were the Reverend M. Petrakis; the Gapan officials, Dr. G. Gavaris and John Gekas, Chicago lawyer; and Dr. K. Theodore. The latter was asked to say a few words, which he did. He spoke of the value of a knowledge of Greek, and the importance of maintaining Greek schools in America. The Reverend Petrakis also arose and urged the pupils not to forget their language, and not to allow themselves to neglect their orthodox religion.</p>
   
   <p>Finally, the chairman of the Educational committee of the school gave an address of thanks and appreciation to the school staff for their zealous work during the past school year.</p>
