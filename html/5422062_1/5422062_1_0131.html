   <p>The Delta Epsilon Pi Fraternity is the only Greek fraternity recognized by American universities. It was organized in 1925 by Mr. George D. Bolla, who is now teaching in the College of Athens, Creece. Ever since its organization the membership has increased and now there are fifteen members studying at the University of Illinois, and they reside all together in the fraternity house, united in bonds of friendship and love, and they dream of elevating the Greek name.</p>
   <p>All interested in the progress of Greeks here should support the Greek students, for they are to represent Hellenism in the near future. They are to hold a dance at the Stevens Hotel, Monday, Dec. 30.</p>
