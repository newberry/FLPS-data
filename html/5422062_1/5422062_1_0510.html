   <p>The writer of this article has, at various times, visited some of the afternoon schools that are carried on for the purpose of teaching little Greek children their mother tongue and has often been surprised to see how difficult the teacher's task seems to be. Pupils are, of course, likely to be weary and it is no doubt almost impossible to find teachers who are good enough to deserve a living wage for only two or three hours work.</p>
   <p>The boys and girls are bound to make invidious comparisons between the bright and cheerful rooms of even the poorer public schools and those in which their Greek lessons are carried on. It requires teachers of most engaging personality to overcome handicaps like this and teachers furthermore who are convinced of the utility of learning Greek.</p>
   
   <p>The question ultimately resolves itself then, into this: Is the learning of Greek worth while? If so, how shall we convince the children of the class of Greeks that preponderate among our Greek-American citizens that this is the case?</p>
   <p>Those who have any faith in the future of Hellenism will be convinced that it is distinctly worth while. As the Greek nation resumes its rightful place in the Near East, pride in their country and race will once more come into ascendency in the minds of the Greeks in this country.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile everything possible should be done to strengthen the homeland and its prestige here and in Europe.</p>
   <p>Another hopeful element in the problem is the financial and material success of so many of our Greek citizens.</p>
   
   <p>The very fact that they - Greek by blood and brains - are succeeding so well, should increase their pride in their race and should move them to more generously support all efforts to preserve their home language. I am myself of the opinion that such Greek-Americans of the second generation as have been able, in spite of difficulties, to preserve or retain a control over the modern Greek language, would make better teachers in our Greek schools than many of the technically trained graduates of Athenian normal schools. They would frequently be more sympathetic with the difficulties of their American-born compatriots and would know better how to help them.</p>
   <p>This leads to my next point that is the "letter killeth." In my opinion inaccuracy in the teaching of prosody, spelling and grammar would be more than compensated for by an enthusiastic love for the modern literature and some vital realization of the part of that the Greek has played in the world of thought and culture. Teach the children beautiful and inspiring poetry, would be my advice; talk real live Greek with them; tell them good stories and humorous anecdotes; read fine literature to them, and not necessarily in the Katharevousa; let them cultivate an ear for Greek poetry and music, an eye for Greek beauty, in art and landscape and architecture. Let them appreciate the richness and expressiveness of their language, the vivacity of the Greek mind, the adventurousness of the Greek soul.</p>
   <p>Make them love Greece and Greek. Oh, that some Dante or Shakespeare would arise in Greece itself! If we cannot have these, let us listen to the lesser poets and writers that we do have. When Greek children have once conceived a love for Greek, they will desire to write it and to write it correctly. Little attention should be paid to puristic study. Where a demotic word is in common use, why worry the child with its high-style equivalent? Let him understand that language is of use simply to express emotion and thought.</p>
   <p>It is not as though we expected to make journalists or literateurs out of them.</p>
   
   <p>We want them to realize that Greece still has a cultural, religious and industrial mission in the Near-East; that she has inherited from her intellectually mighty ancestors a flexible, poetic and vital language in which her past has been recorded and in which her future achievements are to be executed and described; that it would be a thousand pities for them so to alienate themselves from father and mother and the land of their forefathers as to lose that living touch that only language can give. "Another language makes another man," that is to say, doubles the power of the individual to enter into others' thoughts and increases his breadth of vision and sympathy.</p>
   <p>It is of course highly probable that the total number of those who study modern Greek and speak the language idiomatically will grow less from generation to generation unless our immigration laws are decidedly modified.</p>
   
   <p>But the quality of those who do keep it up should steadily rise. The children of our wealthier Greeks will, through privately endowed schools and private tutors, be kept in touch with Greece.</p>
   <p>Travel and residence in Greek-speaking lands should develop love for Hellenic lands, and seas and skies. Encouragement should be offered to Greek musical and theatrical companies to tour the country, and lecturers, scholars, and preachers should be subsidized by wealthy Greeks here and abroad to visit all the larger Greek settlements in the United States. Greek centres should be organized in all our cities that will be literally Helicons of enlightenment.</p>
   <p>In closing, let me say that I am convinced that Ancient Greek will be increasingly studied in this country in the decades to come. This will mean that appreciation of the Greek element in our language, literature and life will in the future be greatly enhanced.</p>
   
   <p>Here, too, the Greeks have a fine chance to help us "hold the fort." In our high schools and colleges let them enter upon courses that are already open or request that further Greek electives be offered. Why should the Greeks be the only students in our land who do not study Greek?</p>
   <p>One of the most distressing of my experiences with New York Greeks was my meeting a year or so ago with a Greek who had graduated from one of our high schools, and who spoke Greek with almost perfect freedom, but who had never taken the trouble to connect this spoken language with the printed page. I could have forgiven him his inability to write the language, for that is a difficult task, but a week of practice with the Greek alphabet would have opened up Greek newspapers and books for him. He had so little love for Greece and Greeks that he would not take this slight trouble for her sake. Fathers and mothers should not permit such tragedies to occur.</p>
   
   <p>Let me here repeat that I have elsewhere said that the matter of pronunciation is of such secondary importance that no one should let this stand in the way of sending his children to our American schools. Our phonetic pronunciation is a real help in spelling and writing and would have no effect in corrupting the pronunciation of the real live Greek.</p>
   <p>You who find your children ashamed of being Greeks and unwilling to take the time and trouble even to learn the Greek letters, will find that they can be taught to be proud of their land and people if they can be induced in school to study Greek history, Greek art, Greek literature and the Greek language. They will there learn what the world owes to those people whom the Greeks of today so firmly believe to be their ancestors. Prove to us who are only Hellenists that you are Hellenes through your capacity for entering into the intellectual heritage of your ancestors.</p>
