   <p>In one of his books Clarence Darrow says that there would be no need for jails if all boys were taught a trade or trained for a profession because then they would not find themselves in economic need, and, as a result of this, become thieves or gamblers. A boy seldom starts on the road to crime if he lives in a healthy, wholesome home environment, and if his mind and spirit receive proper nutrition. Such a boy soon tries to show his parents his appreciation by working or studying hard.</p>
   <p>The young men who enter the professions or learn trades with which they can earn an ample livelihood, become the future good citizens and the leaders of their country. They rear families and harvest the finest crops of the beauties of good living. Boys not given a chance to learn anything which will be of benefit to them are usually unsuccessful and unhappy all their lives. Their lot is destined to be neither a secure nor a very productive one.</p>

   <p>Do not think that your sons are fitted to enter the economic world as soon as they graduate from high school. Do not expect them to be useful at once, or to be capable of earning good salaries immediately for their high school training has not prepared them for anything in particular. In fact, in some cases it is detrimental. High school graduates dimly comprehend that they are capable of greater things; and if they are compelled to earn their living instead of being allowed to study further, often refuse to take menial jobs. Therefore, it is the duty of all parents who can possibly do so, to sacrifice for a few more years, and give their children a greater opportunity for success and happiness by sending them to college or to a trade school. Such parents will have the pleasure of seeing their children achieve security and independence. This should be sufficient return for past sacrifices.</p>
   <p>Now that the opening of schools is fast approaching, we urge all of you Greek parents to think before forbidding your children to carry on higher studies. Give them a good foundation for their future life; you will never regret it. Do not be swayed by the small salary your sons will bring home <span class="page-break">3</span>if they find jobs immediately. Working for a small salary will be their fate for the rest of their lives. The individuals who acquire wealth or greatness without education are very rare. A person who is fitted for an occupation may never acquire great wealth; but, on the other hand, he very seldom falls to great depths.</p>
   <p>As for the girls, we Greeks are still of the opinion that a woman's place is in the home, and that, therefore, she is in no need of learning. Perhaps that is the ultimate destiny of a girl, but is it not good sense to give her, too, every possible preparation for future eventualities?</p>
   <p>Give your children a chance to become independent and you will never regret it.</p>
