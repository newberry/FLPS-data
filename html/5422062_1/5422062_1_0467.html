   <p>The annual graduation exercises of the Greek school of Chicago were crowned with complete success.</p>
   <p>The consul-general of Greece, Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, stressed the great importance of establishing and supporting a Greek school in America, and he congratulated the parents for securing a sound education for their children by sending them to the Greek elementary school. He urged every Greek to send his children to our own parochial schools, which are being thoroughly organized and equipped for the benefit of our race and of our citizens of tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Mr. Salopoulos' speech was heard with great interest by both parents and students.</p>
