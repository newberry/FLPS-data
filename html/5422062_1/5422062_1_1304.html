   <p>P.3--Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere were recently offended by an article published in Collier's Weekly regarding the victory of the American participants in the Olympic games held in Greece. A Chicago Greek, Mr. Karalopoulos, has used the columns of the Daily News to correct the inaccuracies printed in the periodical.</p>
   <p>Now comes the Chicago Journal to amplify what Mr. Karalopoulos has said of the feeling of the Greek people toward Americans:</p>
   <p>"The American consul, the Honorable George Horton, writes from Athens that the Olympic games were a splendid success. The Greeks have shown sincere interest and enthusiasm in their treatment of the American victors and of Americans in general. The esteem of the people for the American athletes, is unparalleled. They are deified wherever they go. Great activities are in progress. Two Greeks from Egypt have donated $60,000 to build a gymnasium in Athens."</p>
   
   <p>If Mr. Karalopoulos's letter was not sufficiently illuminating, the writer of the article in Collier's should take notice of what the American diplomat in Athens writes of the Greek people.</p>
   <p>If there are any people in the world who really love America, those people are the Greeks. Those who believe the contrary should equip themselves with facts before they let their tongues wag.</p>
