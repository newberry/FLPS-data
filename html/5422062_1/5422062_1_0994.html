   <p>Whoever writes about Greeks in America will never fail to bring out a certain phase of Greek characteristics. Our whole life is connected with newspapers, schools, churches, and clubs. All these put on various performances which you are asked to support. Here are a few examples:</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. who passes you on the street without even a nod, calls you up one day, and the following conversation ensues.</p>
   <p>"I am sending you 20 tickets (they are only two dollars each) to build a new church."</p>
   <p>"But, Lady- -..."</p>
   <p>"Bon't mention it; it's a pleasure."</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"But, lady, I don't want to sell tickets!"</p>
   <p>"What are forty dollars, sir? You can easily sell all the tickets."</p>
   <p>"But, lady, there are plenty of churches already."</p>
   <p>"I'll send all twenty tomorrow. How is your wife and baby Fine? That's good. Regards. I'll see you all at our new church."</p>
   <p>She hangs up the receiver and begins her plans to catch another victim.</p>
   <p>Next day, Mr. B. comes to your office when you're busy and tries to sell you a book he wrote, "How You Breathe Smoke-Leaden Air." The only way to get rid of him is to buy the book for a dollar.</p>
   <p>"But, mister, I don't find time to read it," you protest.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"That's funny! I find time to write it," he says.</p>
   <p>"But why don't you try to sell it to the Salvation Army, the Chiropractic School, the Ahepa or Gapa?"</p>
   <p>"I've been there," he says as he pockets your hard earned dollar.</p>
   <p>Miss C. tells you about the theatrical performance her club is putting on for some charitable or educational benefit.</p>
   <p>"But, young lady, if you please....."</p>
   <p>"What, only two?"</p>
   <p>"No! Less than one!"</p>
   <p>"But, sir this is our first chance. You wouldn't want us to be a failure at the very beginning, now, would you?"</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>She won.</p>
   <p>I hope I live to see the day when all youngsters will be educated, when all poor people are properly taken care of, when all would-be poets and authors drown. Then I shall have peace!</p>
   <p>Jay Walker.</p>
