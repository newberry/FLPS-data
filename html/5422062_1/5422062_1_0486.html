   <p>P. 2.- The teacher at our Greek school has resigned. Our children are going to lose the learning and culture given to them by Mrs. Theodore. They will have their lessons interrupted, as it is not easy for us to find teachers for our school.</p>
   <p>Our children will be thrown on their own resources during their spare time. They will have either good or bad influences to guide them. We hope they are good, of course.</p>
