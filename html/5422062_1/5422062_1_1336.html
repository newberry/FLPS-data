   <p>In our previous article we characterized the present crisis as "Capital's Crisis", and as indicative we have remarked that Capital today is dormant and is unable to circulate.</p>
   <p>We find ourselves, today, for the first time, in a position where Capital panic striken is hiding away and the reason is simple, "it does not find any longer a safe place of investment"....Why? Did life in America cease to be? Or are there no longer any enterprises in America?</p>
   <p>Capital remains indisposable because wherever it may be invested there is no profit, and, above all, it risks the danger of being lost. And then the reasonable question arises:</p>
   <p>If the population of America remains the same, and has the same needs, and the new enterprises, improvements, and inventions are not fewer in number, why cannot Capital find a safe investment and make a profit?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Because, business, in America especially, has been laid on a new basis, and, as a result, we have in agriculture well as in industry, an overproduction.... Perfection of machinery during these last years, and new inventions which increase production every day, have changed completely the economic life of the United States, so that Capital cannot any longer perform its function and accomplish the distribution of production and find a new say to reach the consumers.</p>
   <p>These are the reasons why Capital remains dormant and we fear very much that there will be no power to make it move.</p>
