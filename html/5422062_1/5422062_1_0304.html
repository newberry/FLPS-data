   <p>P. 2.- Thousands of Greek boys and girls in the various Greek communities of America, who have been enrolled in the morning and afternoon classes, have proven to us that our children can successfully learn the tongue of our forefathers and the tongue of the country of our adoption at the same time. The progress shown at the various school holidays shows that our children have the zeal and the desire to learn our native tongue and that our language will be preserved despite assertions to the contrary.</p>
   <p>It is necessary for the Greek parents of America to provide a Greek education for their children. They should be proud to know the tongue of their fathers, the ideals and the customs of the Greek race.</p>
   <p>It not only helps preserve Hellenism in America, it makes better prepared men and women out of them. Statistics have proven that those knowing two or more languages make better students than those knowing only one.</p>

   <p>We admit that there were so many difficult problems to tackle when Greeks first came to America that Greek schools could not at first be established. Now that we have more liesure we must turn to our youngsters and do all in our power to give them the best possible Greek education. It is a necessity!</p>
