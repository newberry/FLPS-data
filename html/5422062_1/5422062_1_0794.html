   <p>One wishes the Greek parents, clergy, and children in American might profit more then they do by the experience of certain older groups of immigrants.</p>
   <p>It is trite, but none the less pertinent and vital, to remember that America is a "melting pot" for its immigrant races. For generations and for centuries Greeks in Egypt and Greeks in Southern Italy have remained Greeks, to say nothing of Greeks in Turkey and other places where minority racial groups have been able to fully maintain their identity. No such thing has been possible for white Gentile groups in America, and there are no indications that the Greeks will be an exception to the rule. Their children born in this country will grow up Americans and not Greeks. Many of them, no doubt, will retain their membership in the Orthodox Church <span class="page-break">\2</span>and more or less mutilated Greek names; but otherwise will be Americans. Though they may understand a little of the Greek language they will hand none of it to their children. These are the sober facts which parents and clergy are slow to realize.</p>
   <p>Parents who elect to pring up their children in America must not expect to force Greek etiquette upon them. It is not a question of whether Greek customs, regulating courtship and marriage are better or worse than American customs, it is a question of averting tragedy by allowing the American born child to be an American. This must by no means be understood as advocating the improprieties of the street, and the manners of chance acquaintances. There is a good and respectable American etiquette which it is the duty of every parent to uphold in the lives of his American born children. Failure to realize this has meant, and will continue to mean, tragedy.</p>

   <p>The Greek Church in America appears to be about ten years too late in the matter of introducing regular English services in all congregations. It is desirable for immigrant churches to maintain services in the foreign language for the older people, but it is imperative for them to provide regular English services for the young people and children. Congregations which do not do this simply die. I hope the Orthodox Church will quickly remove this fatal menace.</p>
   <p>As far as I have personally observed, Americans who go to college usually find their life companions there. Mixed marriages are, to say the least, grave risks. Abies' Irish Rose may present comic situations, but it is really a tragedy. Are not the happiest marriages those in which husband and wife agree most nearly in race, religion, nationality, and social status? A Greek Orthodox college for the education of Greek youth of both sexes would, in my opinion, assist very materially in the happy mating of those who attended, in the development of the Orthodox Church <span class="page-break">\4</span>in America, and in the preservation of whatever features of Hellenism it is possible and desirable to perpetuate in America.</p>
   <p>To the children I cannot help saying, if you ever go to college or university, you will be sorry you didn't learn more of the Greek language from your parents.</p>
