   <p>The recent bloody scenes and persecutions against the Greeks of Omaha, Nebraska constitute an unfortunate reflection not only against our countrymen in Omaha, but also against the Greeks throughout America.</p>
   <p>It is really disastrous to see the innocent masses of the Greek people being persecuted and violently attacked while their stores are burned to the ground.</p>
   <p>These most unfortunate happenings began when a Greek in Omaha, by the name of John Masouridis, killed a policeman. Because of this, a huge demonstration was organized by lawyers, congressmen, city officials, and other prominent citizens, in front of the City Hall. They discussed the murder, under great tension, then, advised and encouraged, the enraged mob of Omaha proceeded to avenge the blood of the slain policeman by attacking and driving out all Greeks indiscriminately.</p>
   <p>Naturally, no intelligent and cool-headed American would approve of such action, nor would he praise the barbarous acts of mob violence which were perpetrated against quiet and law-abiding Greeks. However, no sympathetic voice was raised among the Americans, with but a very few exceptions, to defend the mistreated and beaten Greeks. We doubt very much if the power of the law will be able to protect the interests of the sufferers, provide for the treatment of those who have been injured, and compensate the businessmen whose stores were ransacked and destroyed.</p>
   <p>Whatever we Greeks say or do at this time will be in vain, because what has been done cannot be undone; nor can the voice of the weak prevail over the "rights" of the strong.</p>
   <p>Only a few years ago, the Greeks of Chicago were looked down upon whenever some Greek violated the law, especially when some crime was committed. We ask: Were all the Greeks to blame for the acts of one or a few law-breakers? Much intolerance, prejudice, and contempt have been directed against the Greeks of Chicago on the part of the native, older Americans, or other immigrant groups. By and large, this spirit of hatred and intolerance was not justified.</p>
   <p>Not only the Greeks of Chicago, but those in every part of the country have protested the indiscriminate persecution of the Greeks of Omaha; first, because these attacks were unjust and brutal; and second, because this practice might spread further by arousing the American public against all the Greek immigrants in every part of the country.</p>
   <p>Dr. Chris Petroulas, the President of the Greek Community, sent a lengthy telegram to President Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. protesting the violence against the Greeks of Omaha. The following answer was received promptly:</p>
   <p>"Dr. Chris Petroulas, President Greek Community of Chicago, 266 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"The President has referred to me your telegram of February 22, which was addressed to him regarding the question of the ill-treatment of the Greeks in South Omaha.</p>
   <p>"The Greek Ambassador in Omaha has taken charge of the case. Proper investigations are being made. The Governor of Nebraska has given assurance that order has been restored and that the proper authorities are now in a position to enforce laws.</p>
   <p>"Robert Bacon</p>
   <p>"Secretary of State."</p>
   <p>We do not say that the guilty party, slayer Masouridis, should not be punished for this crime; but, should the American officials of Omaha permit the mob to beat innocent fellow countrymen of the murderer? Of course not. This would be in direct violation of the principles of a civilized society.</p>
   <p>But, evidently, on this occasion as on other similar occasions, the American public has lost all respect for the Greek immigrant; so, they hate us as a people unworthy of its mission and of the glory of its ancestors. Has the American public classified us as undesirable aliens and unworthy citizens?</p>
   <p>Our relations with the native Americans have come to a very delicate and serious pass, not only in Omaha, but in Chicago also. Therefore, we must realize that we are facing great perils. We very much fear that very soon we shall be facing more serious perils. Danger threatens us; we have noticed that, according to newspaper reports, even congressmen have begun to declare a war of extermination against us.</p>
   <p>This phenomenon is truly discouraging because the future of our people in America is menaced.</p>
   
   <p>We think it is about time that we consider our position more seriously. There is still time to save and redeem ourselves from the many dangers which are surrounding us, if we are willing to recognize our obligations to the American people which received us with gladness. We must not forget that we must prove ourselves worthy of the hospitality which the American people have extended to us. We have come here not to destroy but to build.</p>
   <p>America, which feeds us and protects our rights and liberties, is fully justified in expecting us to repay her for her hospitality. This can be accomplished by obedience to the laws of the land and by good work, exemplary behavior, honorable relationships, and mutual esteem. In other words, the Americans demand of us that which the emigrating and colonizing Greeks of ancient times contributed to the foreign peoples with whom they traded.</p>
   <p>Such was the nature of the repayments made to America by nearly all the other foreign nationalities in this country and that is exactly the reason why they have attained an equal political and social status with the native element.</p>
   
   <p>This is how the marvelous feat of quickly adopting the American way of life has been accomplished by these easily assimilated alien groups.</p>
   <p>Despite these fine examples of loyalty and willingness to comform to new ways and a new environment, unfortunately, we Greeks have not only failed to return and meet our many obligations but, on the contrary, we have overstepped all bounds by our shameful and disgraceful conduct and by a host of other shortcomings which we have not been able to shake off.</p>
   <p>There are those of us who have misunderstood the meaning of the words "free country"; because America is extremely tolerant toward and generous to all immigrant groups, it restricts the liberties which it has granted them when they are abused. There is a limit to free action and, therefore, we must know where to stop.</p>
   <p>Even the Greeks of this city and the Greeks of America generally should enjoy the same rights and privileges and should receive the same protection as other nationalities, but, unfortunately, we have broken the law and made many other mistakes. In many cases, we are unconscious of the wrongs for which we ourselves are responsible.</p>
   <p>According to the police records of Chicago, the Greeks have committed numerous crimes in some [types] of which they occupy the first place. We receive newspapers from every part of the country in which we read of the many types of crimes which have been committed by Greeks.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, we have the impertinence to complain against this country which still tolerates many of us. Little do some of us think about the laws which we violate and the crimes which we commit.</p>
   <p>The trials and suffering of our fellow countrymen in Omaha pain our hearts. Naturally, we condemn the action of the mob and other troublemakers there, but, on the other hand, when we hear that women, prominent citizens of Omaha, and congressmen have been directing a general campaign of persecution against the Greeks in general, we must admit that there must have been other reasons, too, besides the recent slaying there, for proscribing members of our nationality.</p>
   <p>Even though we might admit that everywhere, Greeks are fundamentally the same, there are many characters who disgrace the Greek name.</p>
   <p>We are indeed sorry to use harsh language in rebuking our own brothers, but since they bring disgrace to all of us, they must be branded and punished so that they will not repeat what they have done.</p>
   <p>In contrast to these events, we are proud to proclaim that there are thousands upon thousands of virtuous and honorable Greeks who are law-abiding and civilized citizens. They do honor to the Greek name, but they have not fulfilled all their obligations, because they have not co-operated for the obliteration of lawlessness and crime.</p>
   
   <p>What good are our churches and drives to build up our Fatherland's naval forces when we as a people are being humiliated and discredited. It would be much better if we would turn our attention to the deplorable state of affairs here in America. We, here in America, are the representatives of Greece, so when we are dishonored, our country too is dishonored.</p>
   <p>So, it is about time that we mend our ways. The Greek embassy, the Greek consulates, clergy, professional men, press, and the leaders of our organizations, as well as the best elements in our communities must band together and educate the Greeks of America from the Atlantic to the Pacific to the fact that we are in a civilized society, in a highly advanced country which is playing host to us. Our people must know that they are free to work, trade, and make great fortunes; but first of all, they must respond to the American spirit of hospitality, they must respect the law, and must lead a life which is in accord with the progress and principles of the twentieth century.</p>
   <p>Most of our fellow countrymen have learned how to conduct themselves and how to live like respectable citizens. All the useless and criminal characters in our community must be destroyed. Only then will we win the respect of the American people and only then will the persecutions among us cease.</p>
