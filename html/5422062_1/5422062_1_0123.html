   <p>We are always proud to make known to the public the honors our Greek boys and girls are receiving in scholastic endeavors. This time we write about Christ Chamales student of the Boston School of Technology who was first in his class. He has obtained a years' tuition from the school because of his high scholastic standing.</p>
   <p>Upon graduating he will go to Paris to study because the Design Committee in charge of the Fantainehlou Scholarship chose his work as the best. We are very, very, proud of this exceptionally talented young man and wish him the greatest success the future.</p>
