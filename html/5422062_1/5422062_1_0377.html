   <p>We announce to the public that on Sunday, December 14, at 2:00 P. M., we shall hold our annual school exercises in Stancink Hall, 205 East 115th Street, Pullman, Illinois. There you will see the progress of seventy Greek children in the Greek language. They will recite various poems in Greek. After the exercises there will be a dance, which will continue until midnight. The committee is doing its utmost to please all who attend, and preparations are being made to serve our guests well.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind the public that the Plutarch School of the Greek community of Pullman is the only Greek school in the Chicago district which depends entirely on its own resources, since there is no Greek church in Pullman. Do not forget, therefore, that we depend on the sale of tickets to keep our Greek school open. We expect a good crowd to help the Greek children to learn their language.</p>
   <p>For the school committee,</p>
   <p>H. Anastasopoulos, president</p>
   <p>P. Megaris, secretary</p>
