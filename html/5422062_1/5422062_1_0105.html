   <p>p. 3.- On Sunday, December 28, the Greek students of the University of Illinois are giving their Dance at the Stevens Hotel.</p>
   <p>These students have worked hard to gather all the Greeks and form an organization at the University. They have kept their little band together in spite of many obstacles, one of which is insufficient funds. By sponsoring their dance next week we can do our part and prove to be true Greeks in helping our younger generation succeed.</p>
