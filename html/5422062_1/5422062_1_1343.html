   <p>System is the only thing that keeps everything around us in harmony and order. The planets of the Solar System and the rest of the creations of the Governing Power of the Universe are kept in order by system. In business as well as in our private life, system is necessary for our welfare, Unfortunately the Greeks are not well up to system standards of various kinds.</p>
   <p>The United States of America, through system, became the greatest country on earth. The Greeks of this country have the opportunity to open their eyes, and be benefitted enormously by the various prevalent systems, in all branches of life, which our adopted country induces us to follow.</p>
