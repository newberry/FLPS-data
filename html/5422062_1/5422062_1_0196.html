   <p>Despite the fact that the annual dance of the Greek Women's University Club was held on the same evening as the St. Andrew's Ball, the Women's Dance was a success.</p>
   <p>The Tower Club was filled with some of the finest people in our community, who danced to the romantic music of our own Eddie Vargos, The young ladies deserve commendation for their splendid effort. They give an annual dance to raise money for scholarships; so the success of this dance is a matter of great satisfaction.....</p>
