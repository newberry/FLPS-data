   <p>My dear Peter,</p>
   <p>I have your very interesting discourse delivered before the Hamilton Club and shall read it with pleasure.</p>
   <p>Lincoln and Pericles may have been the two greatest champions of democracy, but unfortunately, they are both dead. I maintain that Peter S. Lambros is one of the greatest modern champions of democracy and good citizenship.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Edward J. Brundage.</p>
