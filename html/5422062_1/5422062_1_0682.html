   <p>Modern times demand that a woman be much more than just a good housewife and mother. Now she is given the opportunity of playing various roles. Thus her life need not be as monotonous as in former years.</p>
   <p>Today, the average woman cleans her house in the morning, plans her evening meal, and then puts on a smart afternoon dress, and goes out. Usually, it is a bridge party or a club meeting to which she goes for a few hours of relaxation and pleasure. While present at such perfectly respectable gatherings a woman feels an uplift of spirit that gives her added zest for living and caring for her home. She thinks upon a higher level than when she is continually at home with her small children. She practices and improves those social graces which are so important to pleasant living.....</p>
   <p>Woman's place is in the home, but today she cannot remain blind and deaf to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>activities going on around her. That type of woman is no longer admired or sought after. In order to acquire and retain a husband, the girl of today must be able to do more than cook.</p>
   <p>The Americans say, "The closest way to a man's heart is through his stomach". But a woman soon finds out that after a man has eaten a well-cooked dinner he still has taste for other things which do not contain calories or excite his gastric juices. A modern wife is foolish to allow her husband to think of her only as a cook. She should not force him to think to himself how much he would like to come home, just once, and find her wearing something other than that old apron.</p>
   <p>Today's woman may wear an apron, but she does not wear it constantly when her husband is at home. After all, he has been walking and riding in public places and has seen hundreds of fresh, well-dressed, attractive young women; a wife does not desire him to form any unflattering comparisons in his mind. Therefore, <span class="page-break">\3</span>each woman should prevent this, and she should understand man's weakness for the attractive, and keep herself neat, clean, and pretty.</p>
   <p>If you seek marital happiness, do not become a dull, backward person as soon as you marry. Acquire outside interests--if possible, the same ones as your husband. Read, study, acquire a hobby. Be a companion to your husband. Make yourself indispensable to him so that he will not turn elsewhere for recreation and companionship. He really prefers you to anyone else, but he cannot prove it to you unless he is given the chance.</p>
   <p>A man may be a king or a tyrant; but to the woman who understands him he is merely a grown-up boy who still wants to play.</p>
