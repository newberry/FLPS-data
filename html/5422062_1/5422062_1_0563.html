   <p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin, May 15, 1923.-- The executive committee of the church community of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary has worked energetically in preparation for the dance to be given on Saturday, June 2, 1923, at S.P.M. in Miller's Hall, Eighth and State streets, for the benefit of our school. More than 1500 tickets have been sold, and we hope to dispose of 1500 more before the date appointed for the dance. Tickets are sold for fifty cents, and each ticket entitles the purchaser to participate in the lottery of an automobile worth five hundred dollars, which will go to the holder of the lucky number at the end of the dance.</p>
   <p>Let us urge all our countrymen to sup ort this dance, which is given not only for social entertainment but also for a sacred and patriotic purpose.</p>
   <p>The Greek school in America is the only institution which can perpetuate the loyalty of Greek children to our race and our religion.</p>
