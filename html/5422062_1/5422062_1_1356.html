   <p>p. 3.- Over two hundred people were present at the opening of the new restaurant at 537 S. Wabash Avenue by Messrs. Petmezas, Wilson, Michaelidos, and Potamainos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wilson, who has been chef of the Book Cadillac and the Stratford Hotels in Detroit, was heartily congratulated for the exquisite foods he prepared.</p>
   <p>Greeks and Americans were delighted with the gracious hospitality of the proprietors and the Spanish music which played all evening. Many Americans spoke words of praise. Among the Greek speakers were lawyer Michalopoulos, A. Baxevanis, and others. We wish the best of success to the new proprietors.</p>
