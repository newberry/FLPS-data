   <p>p. 3. -- George L. Matalas, well-known and well-liked member of the Greek community in Chicago, after one year's service in the Balkan Wars as artillery lieutenant returned to Chicago with a war decoration.</p>
   <p>The handsome Greek officer, who was one of the first Chicago Greeks to respond to Mother-Greece's call to arms, had a very serious and most important reason for returning to Chicago, namely, an affair of the heart. Brothers, relatives, friends, and business as a matter of course were reasons for his return, but the reason above all others was his beautiful girl, his sweetheart, whom he left behind, and whom he married last week. The American girl who captured the heart of the Greek reserve officer is Miss Katherine Brady, a typical American beauty. Loxias wishes them the best of luck and happiness.</p>
