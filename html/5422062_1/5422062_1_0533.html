   <p>p. 1- Because we share the confidence which others repose in the executive board of Socrates School, we are compelled to request an explanation from Gapa as to the fate of the proceeds of the dance given last May at the Aragon for the benefit of the school.</p>
   <p>And we submit to Gapa the question: Why have they not handed the money over to the school board? This question has been asked by others, and Gapa is in duty bound to give a sound and satisfactory answer.</p>
   <p>The school has its executives, and the money belongs to the school. Why has Gapa withheld it so long? We are awaiting a clear and definite answer.</p>
