   <p>p. 4. -Responding to the request of Miss Addams, a committee of prominent members of the Greek community, headed by the Reverend Father Pegeas, met last Friday at Hull House and laid plans for a "come-together and know-one-another" meeting of Greeks and Americans.</p>
   <p>Beaming with joy in the presence of so many Greeks, who represented every station of life in the community, the honorable lady, who is widely known as the friend of foreigners and especially of Greeks, took the floor after calling the meeting to order and expressed her thoughts,in particular her desire to effect a closer association of the Greek and the native elements and to make known the progress of the Greeks in the city of Chicago and if possible of those in other parts of the country.</p>

   <p>The Greeks, who always stand ready for anything good, after listening to the constructive words of Miss Addams appointed a numerous organization committee, headed by the Reverend Leontios Pegeas, archimandrite of the Greek church, to complete all the details of the forthcoming Greek-American meeting, which will take place on January 3, 1906.</p>
   <p>The organization comprises all the Greek societies and organizations, the professionals, the merchants and businessmen, and the church. The Hon. Dr. N. Salapoulos, Consul General of Greece in Chicago, will also serve on the committee.</p>
   <p>This is one more step in our progress to real Americanization; the heterogeneous elements of America will mingle with the homogeneous old-American element to form the solid rock of Americanism. Sound thinking and good work! The initiator of the idea is well acquainted with the law of imitation, which has a tremendous influence upon us mortals.</p>
