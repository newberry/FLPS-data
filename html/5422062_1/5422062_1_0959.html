   <p>Fifty professors and students of both sexes from the University of Chicago were recipients of Greek hospitality last Sunday. After a religious service at the Church of St. Basil, the charmed group went to St. Constantine Church, where a short mass was held, preceding a program given by the choir and George Demopoulos, soloist who sang various hymns. Then Rev. M. Petrakis, Arch-Priest of the Church, delivered a speech in English on "The Greek-Born with his Religion and his Nationalism". The eloquent Father elucidated his topic, that the perpetuation of Greek nationalism is wholly attributed to his religion, which as an art carries him away from the influence of assimilating environment.</p>
   <p>After Father Petrakis' speech, the group went to the great reception hall of the Church, where over one hundred Greek notables cordially received them. Among the distinguished assembly noted were Demetrios Chrisos, President of the community, and his wife; Mr. and Mrs. P. Giovannis and their daughter; Panagiotis Miller and his charming daughter, Katherine, who made a brilliant speech in regard to Greek culture; Dem. Stamos and his song-bird daughter, who sang to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>delight of the assembly; Mr. Lembessis and his daughter; Mr. Tsoukalas, dancing teacher, who presented a classic exhibition danced by Greek maidens of the school, Koraes; Mr. and Mrs. S. Kotakis and daughter, teachers of the Greek-American school, Koraes, and many others.</p>
   <p>Right after the stimulating speech of the black-eyed beauty, Miss Katherine Miller, who electrified the assembly, dinner was served with a great variety of Greek dishes. Of course, the famous "pastitsio" and "dolmathes" were served as well as the roast lamb( a la Greek), the famous "Gourekia"; the "kourambiedes"; the "deples" Turkish coffee. The patronesses, under whose supervision the selected dishes were prepared, were Mrs. Phane Tzathas, Thalia Giovannis, Mrs. Cate Constandoudakis, Mrs. Olga Stergiou, Mrs. Styliani Petrakis and Miss Evangelia Metou. The dishes were served by Mrs. Amira Andronis, Mrs. Ann Georgantopoulos, Miss Styliani Floudas, Miss Maxarakis, Miss Constantopoulos and Miss Petrakis.</p>
   <p>After the dinner the well-known attorney, Andrew Vlachos, spoke on Greece and the Greeks in general, from a commercial, national, and educational standpoint.</p>

   <p>Dr. Frank Orman Beck, who, as honorary Chairman of the University group, spoke last, thanked the assembly in general and Mrs. Styliani Petrakis, in particular, for their sincere, cordial hospitality and said, "Greece, which I visited three years ago, is progressing rapidly, and it will not be long before she again becomes the center of light and civilization".</p>
   <p>Various Greek dances were performed by Greek girls with Miss Anna Savelis at the piano. All in all, the affair was marked by joviality and enthusiasm. The departing visitors left with a wish for a repetition of another Greek celebration.</p>
