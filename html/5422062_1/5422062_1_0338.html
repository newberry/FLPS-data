   <p>With much pomp and dignity, the exercises of the Greek school, Homer, took place in the community Church, St. Nicholas, at 60th and Peoria Streets.</p>
   <p>The Homer school, under the direction of the Most Reverend High Priest, Daniel Gambrilos and the teacher, Miss M. Kouklaki, has made astonishing progress. The progress which the boys and girls of the school have made left only the best impression on everyone present.</p>
   <p>The Church was filled with parents and friends. We would need several columns of our paper to give a detailed account of the event. Consequently we will record as much as possible.</p>
   <p>Louis, the small son of Mr. and Mrs. N. Nikoletseas, recited the poem "Father's Nameday" and received the greatest applause from the audience.</p>
   <p>Small Barbara Kyriakopoulos did a wonderful bit of acting in a dialogue.</p>
   
   <p>The Misses Theodora Konstantelos and Stauroula Iimperopoulos also acted very well in their dialogue. The Themela sisters, daughters of an American widow, Mrs. K. Themela made a wonderful appearance. These girls enrolled only five months ago without knowing a single Greek word. Their father died a short time ago and his American widow came to love the Greek language so much that she now takes lessons herself.</p>
   <p>Various national anthems were sung by the entire group.</p>
   <p>The High Priest (Archimandrites Daniel Gambrilis) talked to the parents and reminded them about the importance of the Greek language for their children. The Greek language and the Orthodox religion are the only means of keeping Hellenism in America. The Greek language and Church will enable us to remain Greeks instead of becoming an American entity. He ended his speech with a touching address to the students.</p>
   <p>He then asked the Governor of the G.A.P.A. organization, Mr. A. Kapsopoulos, to come to the platform and say a few words.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Kapsopoulos, with his distinguished eloquence, developed the purpose and program of the Gapa to preserve the Greek language, support Greek schools and churches, and laud the Greek name on foreign soil.</p>
   <p>After this speech, the Archreverend Daniel Gambrilis, distributed the certificates and diplomas to the students of the school and the program was ended.</p>
