   <p>We wish to announce to the parents and guardians of the Greek children, that the enrollment of students has now begun.</p>
   <p>The personnel of the school consists of two men teachers of exceptional ability, and two women: one is a young Greek lady from the Arsakeion Normal College of Athens, (famous Greek Normal College for women). An American teacher sent by the Board of Education is also a member of the faculty.</p>
   <p>The school has added a sixth grade, and it is expected that fine work will be done, since the teachers are so zealous in their efforts.</p>
   <p>Whoever is unable to attend in the daytime will be able to attend the Night School, which will be supervised by the Greek professor, Mr. K. Paraskevopoulos. He was sent here by the Greek government to study education at the University of Chicago.</p>
