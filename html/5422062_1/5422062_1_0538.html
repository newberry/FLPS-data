   <p>p. 5.- The ladies' society, St. Nicholas, last Sunday gave a benefit dance at the Masonic Temple, 64th and Green Streets. Over one thousand people took part in the dance. The proceeds which were very satisfactory will be given to the School Homer.</p>
   <p>The ladies of the society, who organized the dance for the benefit of the school, left nothing undone to make it successful. Refreshments of various kinds were sold, at the intermissions, by beautiful girls who had an eye to increasing the proceeds. Flowers were sold by alluring maidens, who collected a fee, for pinning the flower on the lapel of the buyer.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to the ladies of the society and to the young girls who offered their valuable services for the benefit of our school Homer.</p>
