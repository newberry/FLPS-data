Lambros wishes to state that the Greek parade in Chicago Sunday was not held by the Royalist or any other party, but was purely a non-partisan affair, given by the patriotic Greeks, Armenians and Syrians-all American - who paid tribute to the traditional friendship that binds America and Greece.</p>
   <p>In the same story it was stated that A. A. Pantelis was present, as commander of the Hellenic Post No. 343 of the American Legion, which is incorrect. James N. Nichols is commander of the Hellenic Post No. 343 of the American Legion.</p>
