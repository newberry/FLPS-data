   <p>Knowledge of the English language is a paramount necessity for us Greeks. To-day we are Americans in the raw, unacquainted as yet with the great fundamental principles of Americanism, unacquainted with the grandeur of the country except for what we read in Greek newspapers and periodicals, and without thorough knowledge of the language, the medium through which thought is expressed. But to-morrow it will be a different story.</p>

   <p>Knowledge of the English language will enable us to exchange views and ideas with Americans, to transact business with them, to mingle in American society, and in general to learn all about our adopted country.</p>
   <p>The Greeks who attend classes at Scammon have received special attention because of their large number.</p>
