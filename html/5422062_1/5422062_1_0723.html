   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>It was with a great deal of interest that I read an article concerning the dowry in a previous issue of the Saloniki. It is necessary that this barbarous custom, which unluckily has been brought here from Greece, be discarded. That is, if the Greeks of America wish to progress socially as well as materially.</p>
   <p>This custom was the basic reason for the immigration of the Greeks to this country. Fathers and brothers were forced to work hard, in order to provide a dowry for the daughter or sister. Despite this, even the immigrant Greeks continued to hold on to a custom which has caused grief, unhappiness, and spinsterhood among them.</p>
   <p>If a man desires to marry an American girl, he would not dare to ask for <span class="page-break">2</span>a dowry for fear of receiving a beating. But when he asks for the hand of a Greek girl, he boldly asks the amount of her dower. It is the duty of every Greek in America to help abolish this cruel and coarse practice.</p>
