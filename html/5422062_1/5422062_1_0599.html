   <p>In all sections of the United States there are night schools in which foreigners are taught to read and write English. No immigrant should overlook the opportunity to make use of these educational facilities. The American government is very anxious that the foreign inhabitants should at least learn to read and write well enough to be able to apply for citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>The Greeks especially, who are primarily business people, must master the English language in order to hold the respect of their patrons. The studies are so easily assimilated, that any one who really desires to learn will find it easy to do so. If you wish a better job, higher wages, and more suitable surroundings for your family, go to these night schools.</p>
