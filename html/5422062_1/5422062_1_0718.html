   <p>Four months ago Ernestos Kapota met a stranger who had pictures of women who were for sale as brides. Kapota looked at all the pictures and chose one whose name was Mary and whose price was $500. A few days ago he went to get his bride,but instead he was beaten and robbed by the strange salesman and his two tough assistants.</p>
   <p>Kapota said that during the time he was paying installments for the purchase of his bride and up to a few days ago, he had carried on a correspondence with this "Mary" and had sent her $300 to enable her to buy a trousseau.</p>
   <p>When Kapota was being robbed, he shot at his assailants, and it was his misfortune to be arrested and told to tell his story to the judge.</p>
   <p>So, instead of a bride, Kapota got a beating and is now waiting to tell his <span class="page-break">2</span>story in court, where it seems he will pay not only his own, but also his best man's fine. Profit by his experience!</p>
