   <p>p. 1- We dealt in yesterday's article with the problem of the gradual but noticeable abandonment of the Greek language by Greeks in America and the consequent danger to Hellenism in this country. We wrote that the educated class, especially the Greek professional men, must use its influence to avert this danger. However, we have noticed that many Greek professional men, especially those who are graduates of American colleges, have difficulty in speaking Greek. Since this is the fact, we must find the reasons for it and try to remedy the evil.</p>
   <p>We have the opinion - and we do not believe that our opinion is beyond the comprehension of the public - that it is to every Greek's advantage to know Greek, - even more so when that Greek is an educated man and practices a profession. In consequence, the phenomenon of a Greek professional man's being ignorant of the Greek language is not pleasing. But before we condemn any one, fairness demands that we seek the reasons for his ignorance of his mother-tongue; and the reasons are many and serious.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>First of all, most of these professional men came to America in childhood; it naturally follows that most of them did not know how to read or write Greek, let alone the grammatical structure of the language. They are therefore not to blame, and nobody should condemn them; they have never had a chance to learn Greek. Coming here, they went to American schools, learned English, and studied in American high schools and colleges; so it is very natural for them to be able to express themselves fluently only in the English tongue. Thus even though at first glance it appears strange and unreasonable to us, calm consideration will convince us that it is perfectly natural for these people to speak English and to avoid using Greek, feeling that they may make errors in a language on which they have a weak and imperfect hold.</p>
   <p>And again we observe here a lack of interest on the part of those professional men who were educated in our native country. They have never taken pains to instruct the Greek youth in America, and they do not even mingle with the Greek students. We have here to-day a large number of Greek students, - <span class="page-break">\3</span>the professional men of to-morrow. Have our consuls ever shown any concern for them? Have they shown even the slightest bit of interest for these Greek boys? Have they ever advised them that it is to their advantage to know Greek as well as English, or have they ever endeavored to find a way to make the learning of Greek easier? To-morrow these boys will be professional men, and we shall all wonder at their ignorance of Greek.</p>
   <p>We have deemed it absolutely necessary to consider the reasons for this state of affairs, first, because it would not be fair, although the phenomenon of Greek professional men's being unable to speak Greek is inconceivably serious as well as ludicrous and idiotic, to put all the blame on the professional men, and secondly, because if we do not find the causes, we cannot remedy the evil.</p>
   <p>While we are discussing these Greek students, it will be helpful to ponder this question seriously: In what way is it possible to facilitate the learning of Greek for them? As for the principal representatives of Greece, they should realize that they have other duties besides signing passports and contracts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>To the Greek professional men who do not speak Greek we have only one thing to say: Reflect carefully, and determine to what extent your interests require you to speak Greek.</p>
   <p>This subject, requiring as it does due deliberation, involves us too. Should we remain Greek? Let us consider our interests first; let us, in this instance, disregard idealism and patriotism.</p>
   <p>Our interests first! - and again we intend to present the Greek professional man with a sequel to this present article of ours on the use of our ancestrallanguage.</p>
