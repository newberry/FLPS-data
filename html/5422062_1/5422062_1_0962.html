   <p>Dear Mr. Pantelis:</p>
   <p>I am just in receipt of your letter of June 5 and wish to thank you for the invitation to attend the ceremonies at the Lincoln Monument on June 21, at which time the Hellenic Post of the American Legion will present the flag of the Republic of Greece.</p>
   <p>I greatly regret that it will be impossible for me to attend these ceremonies, because I will be out of State on that day.</p>
   <p>The General Assembly will probably adjourn on Sunday morning or continue working through Sunday by turning back the clock, and immediately after the adjournment Mrs. Emmerson and I are leaving for Minneapolis to attend a convention. This engagement was made some time ago and cannot be cancelled.</p>
   <p>I could attend the ceremony if it were held on June 28; otherwise late in July.</p>
   
   <p>Would be pleased to hear from you again relative to this matter.</p>
   <p>With best wishes I am,</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Louis L. Emmerson.</p>
   <p>Governor.</p>
