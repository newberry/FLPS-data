   <p>The well organized preparations of the society of Greek Students, Elikon, for their first annual major event materialized, last Sunday, in the dance given by the society at the Oriental ball room of the Knickerbocker Hotel.</p>
   <p>Throngs of the selected class began to crowd the stately hall of the hotel. The Executive Board of the society, at its entrance, received the elite of the Greek community, with the traditional cordial handshaking.</p>
   <p>The music, under the director, E. Varzos, began to hum its melody, and at the intermission everyone was paying a visit to the bar for refreshments. Merriment and enjoyment were conspicuous everywhere.</p>
   
   <p>The affair was honored by the presence of George De Pastas, Consul General of Greece; Miss Katherine Miller, President of the Greek Women's University Club; representatives of the Greek Press of Chicago and many other Greek Professionals, doctors, lawyers, and etc.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to the Greek students. The affair was brilliant, educational and successfully.</p>
