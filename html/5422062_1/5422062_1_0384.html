   <p>p.-8-.......It has been said that whenever five Englishmen meet, they form a committee to act. In the case of the Greeks this same committee acts to establish a school. This is the first thought in every community in which a movement begins for the renaissance of Greece.</p>
   <p>This is true also in our Greek community of Chicago, where our first thought is to establish schools and churches. The few Greek schools which existed at the end of the seventeenth century multiplied rapidly during the eighteenth, principally at the important centers of learning such as Bucharest, Janena, Cydonia, Odessa, Jassy, Smyrna, and Chios. In 1785 Lonerman discovered on the island of Patmos a school where Homer and the great tragedians were taught.</p>
   <p>By the end of the eighteenth century Greek schools were distributed wherever Greeks were found, and with the establishment of the Greek state the torch of learning was passed from place to place. Gordon, who took part in the war, writes, "In general the evolution of learning is a slow process, but with these people it looks like an eruption". Rizos, the Greek scholar, said, "Those who saw Greece one year would find it hard to recognize her the next".</p>

   <p>The revival of learning in Greece is forever indentified with the name of George Gennadics, who was the main force in the education of the Greek people during and after the period of the revolution, Gennadios was a scholar and a patriot who played an important part in the revolution, and who never ceased to work for what was dearest to his heart, the education of Greeks and the restoration of his country to the world of learning and culture, where once he had reigned supreme.</p>
   <p>After freedom had been won, and the Greek state had been established, Gennadics refused all the honors and opportunities offered to him in the political field and retired to the obscure and humble position of teacher. He founded and directed the central school of Aegina and in 1837 rejoiced to see his academy established in his beloved Athens.</p>
   <p>Not only was Gennadios one of the founders of the National University in Athens; he was also one of the first professors to teach there and the founder of its department of literature. He followed with great interest and affection the progress of this new institution, where his memory even today is very much revered. His death in 1854 was a great loss to Greece. In an excerpt from the funeral oration delivered by his admirer Alexander Rhagaves we get some light on this great character:</p>

   <p>Nauplium was overcrowded with refugees from Mesolongi, who were getting more desperable and more dangerous every day. None had the courage to act. None had a plan to offer. Then Gennadios rose and leaped upon the roots of a big plainetree in the center of the square and turning his brilliant eyes on the crowd spoke thus:</p>
   <p>"Our country is perishing. She needs immediate help. There is my money" (emptying his pockets and throwing all his money on the ground). "Who will do the same". After a pause he said, "This money is not enough, and I have no more. But I offer myself to the highest bidder! Who wants an instructor for his children for four years? Let him put his fee there!</p>
   <p>"These words electrified the crowd; they ignited the flame of Greek enthusiasm, usually uncontrollable in such times, and this speech of his largely influenced the outcome of the struggle for liberty".</p>
   <p>It is impossible for anybody now to recount the touching history of the revival of Greek education. The obstacles were great, but these obstacles only increased the zeal and the spirit of sacrifice, and the results were brilliant.</p>

   <p>The difficulties did not cease when Turkish rule was overthrown. The National University in Athens was established in the unfortunate period of the Bavarian dynasty. The German rulers, who received big salaries in return for their services, were cool and indifferent toward the University, and King Otto never showed any love for learning or interest in it. The palace, wrote Finley, gave up slowly and reluctantly to the pressure of public opinion, which finally triumphed, and the National University became the focus of all Hellenism because those Greeks who were still under Turkish rule and others from all over the world sent their children to this institution of learning, and more than half the students who matriculated were from the Hellenism abroad.</p>
