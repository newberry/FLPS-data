   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>It is the earnest desire of the Society to complete the portfolios of photographic portraits of our members.</p>
   <p>Your portrait is lacking and we have asked Mrs. Kellogg, who is in charge of the portofolios, to call and make such arrangements for sittings as may be most convenient for you in order that this important record may be really representative of those who have supported the Society through its struggle to uphold the standards of American history in our city.</p>
   <p>The sittinge may be given at your residence, if you so desire, at Moffatt's, or at Matzen's Drake Hotel Studio. Four portfolios have beem completed, and they form valuable human documents.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Caroline M. Mc Ilvain, libraian.</p>
