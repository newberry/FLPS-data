   <p>p. 1.. Charles Hutchinson, a well known banker, passed away last Sunday. Mr. Hutchinson was president of many philanthropic societies. At the Chicago Exposition he was appointed to represent the Greek Government and managed the Greek exhibit with great success. The Greek Government therefore decorated him with the Order of the Golden Cross and appointed him consul-general of Greece in Chicago. He was the first Greek consul in this city.</p>
   <p>The late Mr. Hutchinson was a great admirer of Greece and of everything Greek. He served as Greek consul more than two years and then asked to be relieved on account of pressing business.</p>
   <p>The older Greeks of Chicago remember with reverence the venerable and benevolent American who was always ready to befriend the Greeks as a good and ardent Philhellene.</p>
