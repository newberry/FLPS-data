   <p>In this, the last article of the series, I am tempted to include all the stray remarks which I had intended to make, but forgot, in previous numbers. However, I shall attempt to confine myself to the title indicated above. Was there ever a race to which those four words could oftener be applied than to the Greeks? To the American it seems not. The better he becomes acquainted with Hellenism, the more clearly he sees this trait as a continuous feature of its entire history. In our American school textbooks we read how Greece was divided into small, mutually inaccessible districts by the mountainous nature of the Greek mainland and by the more or less isolated communities of the archipelago; and so it was unable, in classical times, to attain any stable political unity. Today the American is amazed at the large number of mutually hostile political parties which figure in Greek elections. Factionalism, or <span class="page-break">2</span>rather disagreement, seems to be chronic. Without it perhaps Greeks would not be Greeks.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it is an element of strength, though it is usually regarded as an element of weakness. The Greek is his own best critic. Every individual Greek seems to delight in picking out all the flaws he can find in every other Greek. The first Greek who said anything to me about this series of articles remarked that he hoped that I would be unsparing in my fault-finding. I fear that I am not sufficiently well Hellenized to satisfy him. I like to see the good in people as well as the evil. In fact, I prefer to be "to their faults a little blind". Sometimes I think that it is just plain jealousy which makes them hypercritical. I certainly deplore the factionalism in the Greek Church. What place does Greek politics have in the American Church life? None that I can see, unless Greeks just must have something to quarrel about. Can it be that this self-criticism is one of the features which have preserved the racial existence of this remarkable people through three thousand years? Or have they merely survived in spite of it?</p>

   <p>On the other hand it must be noted that there is a certain decided boorishness among Greeks. Time and time again I have received the cold shoulder when approaching Greeks as an American, whereas two or three words of Greek have proved an open sesame. The same man changes in an instant from a surly, suspicious ignoramus to the most gracious and hospitable scholar and gentleman, becoming a bosom friend for life simply because I spoke a sentence or two of Greek. I may use English or any other language that he knows, from that time on, but the magic key must be applied first. Why is this? I do not like it. He has changed completely, but I have not changed. I was just as friendly and well disposed to him before I uttered the Greek as afterward. Why should the American be rebuffed and the stranger who knows a couple of words of Greek be received with open arms? The Greeks quarrel bitterly among themselves, but they are boorish just the same. I like the Greek immigrants, and personally I shall be sorry when they become Americanized.</p>
