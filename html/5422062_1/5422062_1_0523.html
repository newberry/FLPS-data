   <p>The brilliant action of the Daughters of Penelope, who about a month ago, had organized a dance for the benefit of the Greek Schools of Chicago, the proceeds of which were $2,336.66, we must highly commend.</p>
   <p>For, it must be admitted that, with the prevailing economic crisis, it is not so easy to collect, not to say, a net profit, of such a sum. Consequently, it is due to the activities of the members of the Women's Lodge of Ahepa that $2,336.66 was distributed among the Greek Schools of the Community, and for this fact we ought to give the praise where it justly belongs, to the ladies of the society, The Daughters of Penelope.</p>
   <p>The example of the Daughters of Penelope, we think, should be followed generally by all the ladies of our Community, and the directorship of our schools must be taken up by our ladies with the management of the churches, so much the more, because the raising and education of children belongs to the women, and particularly to mothers, who are better fitted than men, as they know the needs and desires of children better.</p>
