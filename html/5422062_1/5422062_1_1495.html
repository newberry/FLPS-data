   <p>No matter how much the internal political affairs of Greece seem to be tangled, they are still far less so, by comparison, than those of European nations, which are ruled by totalitarian governments. At least, the situation is more bearable because the human characteristics of the leaders have not been replaced by brute force and persecution of the weak. Although the two factions are fighting each other so bitterly, it is difficult to believe that either of them honestly desires to crush their cherished civil and social liberties.</p>
   <p>Greece, just as all other countries, has a certain percentage of citizens and leaders who are anxious to try every new experiment in the hope of curing the nation's ills. That ancient characteristic and prerogative of our race--the right of free speech and free expression--is known by all the Greek party leaders. They know they will be tolerated as long as the people have these rights, but that the people will support no group, which seeks to curtail those rights.</p>
   <p>No matter how much the Greek people are politically divided, they prefer to read the articles written by Venizelos against the government, to losing the privilege of reading and thinking as they choose. The Greeks know that should they relinquish their cherished mental and spiritual liberty, they will be but one step away from giving up their physical liberty and acquiring "slave" status. The natural instincts of our race are liberal, that is one of the causes of the early, stupendous social and mental development of our people.</p>
   <p>The seed of dictatorship will not take root in the soil of Greece. Greece will not--we in America hope--ever fall prey to her few apostles of dictatorship.</p>
