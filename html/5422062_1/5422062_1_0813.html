   <p>The depression has brought about many changes in the thoughts of many men. Along with other things it has forced governments to look after the destitute and the unemployed, establishing regular doles, as in England; and in the United States, relief--which is little different from the dole.</p>
   <p>In order that relief may be meted out as justly as possible, relief agencies exist and case workers perform the duty of ascertaining the extent of need among the unfortunates. As to this point, the duties of a case worker are a matter of routine. Through the performance of their duties these workers found that one of the chief causes of the destitution of many on relief was the large number of children which they had. As most of the case workers are women, they reached the conclusion that there should be fewer children in families.</p>
   <p>There exists an organization, looking toward the limitation of children, known <span class="page-break">\2</span>as the Illinois Birth Control League. At one of its meetings, in which the larger part of the audience was made up of relief and social workers, a resolution was passed to the effect that relief workers direct relief clients to birth control clinics.</p>
   <p>All this goes to show that soon all will know what birth control means, notwithstanding the protests of the adherents of the sanctity of life--even in its most incipient form.</p>
