   <p>p. 2- Chicagoans who prefer lamb for Sunday dinner were very much agitated last Sunday on account of the rise in the price of lamb. They generally pay $5.40 for a lamb, but last Sunday the price was $7.75.</p>
   <p>This sudden rise in price was attributed by Chicago newspapers to the Greek Easter. One of the papers in a long article, among other things concerning the Greek Easter, said: "All the Greeks in Chicago, rich and poor alike, must have their barbecued lamb for Easter Sunday; hence the high price of lamb in the market."</p>
   <p>People who previously enjoyed low-priced lamb undoubtedly anathematized the Greeks and their traditions.</p>
