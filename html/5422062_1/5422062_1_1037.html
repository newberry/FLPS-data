   <p>p.1.--It is astonishing that the rapid progress in business of our countrymen has aroused the ire and the jealousy of some other immigrants who also came to this country to live and prosper.</p>
   <p>The success of Greeks especially in the restaurant and candy business exasperates some of their competitors. This seems to be the case not only in Chicago but wherever Greeks have restaurants.</p>
   <p>This is what we read in Prometheus, a Greek newspaper of San Francisco, of what happened in the city of Santa Rosa.</p>
   <p>In a local American newspaper in Santa Rosa this advertisement appeared one day: "John's Restaurant, pure American. No rats. No Greeks."</p>
   
   <p>When this was seenby the few Greeks in Santa Rosa, they felt like going over and breaking everything in John's restaurant, but the cooler and wiser heads among them suggested patience and proper investigation of the matter.</p>
   <p>So they assigned to John Lambropoulos and V. Economou, the owners of the Classic Grill, the best restaurant in Santa Rosa, the task of getting justice for the Greeks and of causing this advertisement to be discontinued.</p>
   <p>They went to the office of the newspaper and protested against the insult and the conduct of this immigrant, showing that he had never done any good to this country and was a trouble-maker.</p>
   
   <p>After these explanations and the newspaper's apology for this unfortunate incident the good-hearted Americans in appreciation of the services of the Greeks to the communities in which they live began to patronize the Greek restaurants more liberally and thus the advertisement intended to harm Greek businessmen in Santa Rosa was converted to their profit.</p>
   <p>This and other similar incidents in the commercial life of our countrymen show that we must be organized and take care of such matters collectively. Our businessmen also must be careful in handling the public so as not to create racial and business antagonism among certain European immigrants who are still under the influence of all prejudices.</p>
   <p>The natives of this country, Americans of old stock, are kind-hearted and charitable, but the newcomers, the clever businessmen of to-day, are those who try to exploit the kindness of the American public by various methods like the one referred to in Santa Rosa; so we must be prepared to shed light, must be Prometheus (forethought) and not Epimetheus (afterthought).</p>
   <p>This is why it is necessary for our protection that national and commercial organizations shall be formed by the Greek citizens of this country on the model of those founded by native Americans, in order that we may assert ourselves and demand our rights. It is our duty to present a solid front to those who oppose us, and we can begin now by trying to help one another and by supporting Greek institutions.</p>
   <p>Now we can understand and appreciate the usefulness and the greatness of the American Association of Restaurant-Keepers and the power which it displayed at its last dance in the Trianon. But this is not enough; the organization can become national in scope.</p>
   
   <p>There are also the owners of the candy-stores. Where are their cooperation and their organization? Why such delay?</p>
   <p>Let us hope that with time and by observation of the methods employed in this country, of which the citizens are our leaders in the commerical and scientific world, we shall learn to organize as the natural result of our environment, acquiring new conceptions of life and considering ourselves as brothers, so that those who think that we are their enemies and that we are ignorant of Christian and civil sentiments, will change their attitude and be like the real Americans of the good old stock who set the example of social conduct in this country.</p>
