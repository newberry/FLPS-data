   <p>p. 4. American influence, through education that is non-political and non-sectarian, has become a coveted asset in the Near East.</p>
   <p>Evidence of this is seen in the founding of an American College in Athens, at the expressed desire of the Greeks themselves for an educational institution in their own land, comparable to the American College in Constantinople, which has been open to students of all nationalities in the Near East for half a century.</p>
   <p>Mr. Venizelos sent the following message to the Trustees of the Near East College, in the winter of 1924:</p>
   <p>"I have observed that Robert College trains men of character. Greece needs such men. Will America help us establish such an institution in Athens?"</p>
   <p>Athens College had for several years been the dream not only of prominent citizens of Greece, who wished to strengthen the bonds between their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>country and the United States, but also of many Americans who wished to express some recognition of the contribution of Greek culture to Anglo-Saxon civilization. The project was first discussed seriously in 1918, when Mr. N. G. Kyria Kides, a successful merchant and graduate of Robert College, came to the United States to propose a place for an American College in Greece to Cleveland Dodge. But the time was not ripe from a financial stand point.</p>
   <p>The demand for an American College persisted, however, and had many able supporters, among them Prof. Edward Capps of Princeton University and former United States Minister to Greece, who was one of the first to accept the idea, and Mr. Alexander McLachlan, then President of the International College of Smyrna. After the disaster of Smyrna, Mr. McLachlan passed a number of months in Athens recovering his health. During this time he organized a committee to study plans for a college in Athens. Upheld by endorsements from the Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church, and from the Mayor, as well as from influential citizens of Athens, this committee appealed to the Trustees of the Near East College, for Cooperation.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, eminent men in this country were becoming interested, and in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>June 1922 a dinner was given at the Centry Club in New York to consider the matter. President C. F. Gates of Robert College, representatives of the Rock-feller Foundation, and Trustees of the Near East College were among those who attended. A letter from Elihu Root was read, followed by a serious discussion in favor of an American College in Athens, but owing to political disturbances in Greece, delay again seemed inevitable.</p>
   <p>In 1925 the school was finally opened. It began in a very small way in rented buildings with three American teachers. Many applicants had to be refused admission owing to the very limited accommodations of the College.</p>
   <p>A generous gift from Mr. E. A. Benakis, of $100,000, and a campus of thirty acres, stimulated plans for the immediate erection of a new building.</p>
   <p>Athens College has applied to the Board of Regents of the State of New York for a charter, modeled after that of Robert College. Its Board of Trustees is to be composed of Americans, distinguished in the field of education and business, and will include some representative Greeks who have become American citizens. Both Greeks and American citizens will be employed as <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>teachers. With the support of the Greek Orthodox Church the institution would have a Christian background, but according to the policy followed in all the Near East, there will be no proselyting.</p>
   <p>The founders of Athens College are confident of its success. They hope, the college will be supported by a large constituency, both in Greece and in the United States, because only as the ideals which inspired the establishment become widely known can its full purpose be accomplished. Therefore, nationwide appeals for funds are to be made in both countries. The maximum number of people; contributions according to ability; a real desire for a well-trained leadership for Greek youth; closer relationship between two countries, comprise the goal which the founders of Athens College have set for themselves.</p>
   <p>The following men have agreed to serve on the Board of Trustees: Elihu Root, John H. Finley, Stephen S. Dungan, E. Kehayas, and Charles P. Howland. Dwight N. Morrow and Henry S. Pritchett also have been asked to serve. C. F. Gates, President of Robert College, is an ex-officio member of the Athens Committee, serving in an advisory capacity. This committee includes such men as Mr. S. Delta, a member of the Greek Refugee Commission under the league of Nations <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and a leading statesman; Mr. P. Galligas, the man responsible for planning the modern city of Athens; Mr. E. Charilaos, a banker; Mr. Kyraikides, a shipowner; Mr. S. Papadakis, a social worker; Dr. B. H. Hill of the American School of Archiology; and Mr. Harold C. Jaquith of the Near East Committee.</p>
