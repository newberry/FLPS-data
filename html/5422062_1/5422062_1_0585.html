   <p>The Greek mothers who are being taught the English language at Hull House, have formed a club of their own.</p>
   <p>For that purpose they came together in a meeting held, last Friday in Bowen Hall. After the formation of the club took place there was given a rich program of dancing, singing and recitations, prepared by Georgia Alexandrou, school teacher.</p>
   <p>The two hundred participants at this reception, including young Greek girls and mothers, were very much pleased with the affair.</p>
