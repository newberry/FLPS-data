   <p>The British continue to conduct themselves as masters of slaves on the Island of Cyprus. The civilized and liberty-loving (?) English seem to think that the people of Cyprus are of an inferior race, and so are trying to create a nation of subjugated people who will have no liberty and no voice in their government. As if all the other restrictions and indignities were not enough, this oft-injured island is the victim of still another English imposition. Recently, a law was made restricting the freedom of the Greek press.</p>
   <p>This action is, no doubt, proof that the Greek papers of that island are fighting in behalf of the rights of its inhabitants. By oppressing the people of Cyprus, and by curtailing their civil liberties, the British think they will be able to break their spirit of resistance. They are terribly mistaken. The people are not going to change their nationality just because <span class="page-break">2</span>Britain wants to imcorporate their island into her already vast empire.</p>
   <p>Do they not realize that the natural result of such oppression will be the strengthening of the sprit of revolt within the people? Their action indicates, beyond a doubt, that the British intend to burden the people of Cyprus with the heavy bands of tyranny and oppression. If this continues to be the case, the entire world will be forced to accuse the English of being social tyrants.</p>
