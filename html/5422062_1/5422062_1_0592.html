   <p>Last year innumerable foreign-born residents of Chicago studied the English language in night schools. The number was estimated to be a hundred per cent more than the previous year.</p>
   <p>The School Board provides night schools for all the sections of the city. These schools are absolutely free, and are in every neighborhood, which makes it easy to attend a school near your neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Any Greek who wishes to progress should learn to speak good English. It is unnecessary for us to enumerate the benefits of this knowledge, because you yourselves know from your daily work how much easier it would be for you if you could speak and write English.</p>

   <p>In order to gain the respect of the American community and rise to higher levels, a knowledge of the language is very imperative.</p>
   <p>The night school sessions begin about the middle of September.</p>
