   <p>Of late the Greek community of Chicago has begun to reveal a phenomenal activity. The many social affairs are ample proof of this. The interest of every Greek has been awakened, and daily a visible effort is being made by all of them to help accomplish the task of securing a position of recognition for Greeks, as a group, in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Greek professional men, now, more than at any other time, are actively participating in our social and economic life. They are continually planning various activities that will benefit the Greek people. Businessmen, perhaps for the first time, are taking a truly active interest in the welfare and progress of the Greek community. In fact, all Greeks in general, are working together as one spirit, and a Greek one, at that, to accomplish this success.</p>

   <p>Greek people pour thousands of dollars every month into the church, and to a lesser degree into our various clubs and organizations. What happens to all the money put into the treasuries of their churches has begun to be questioned by the Greek people. Of course there is no stealing going on--at least not on such a large scale--but all that money should relieve and finally remove all the financial burdens from our churches.</p>
   <p>Continued appeals for funds are made to the people who give generously and continually as well. Yet we never hear that the books of even one church balance as a result of the contributions. The answer to this is held ready by the priests and church trustees: The Greeks do not attend and support their churches regularly. Notwithstanding the fact that the churches are not attended--which if true, is purely the fault of our clergy--the fact still remains that directly or indirectly the people contribute their money to the Church.</p>
   <p>Why is it that despite contributions amounting to over one hundred thousand <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>dollars a year we have nothing to which we can point with pride, of possession? The answer to this problem can be solved only by an expert economist. We recommend that our churches acquire the services of such an expert.</p>
