   <p>"The girls were left to the exclusive care of their mother, who taught them the art of housekeeping. They learned principally to spin yarn and to breed silkworms. Every woman knew how to weave the silk and cotton fabrics which were used for clothing by both sexes.</p>
   <p>"The girls did not think about anything except their household occupations, and they were not allowed to go out except on feast-days, to church, and to dances. The dance gatherings were held in the public square and in the daytime only. The women of Mani never danced at night, and they did not know what a night dance meant," adds Napoleon's delegate.</p>

   <p>"The youth of Mani," says Stefanopoli, "are physically graceful and strong. By the age of eighteen years constant exercise has made them perfect men. They marry, however, at twenty-five. The prevailing notion is that twenty-five is the best age for bringing into the world healthy, strong children."</p>
   <p>Up to that age youth of Mani did not think of anything but how to gain distinction in battle, and the opportunities to satisfy that desire were not lacking, for there was not a single Pasha in Moreas who did not take pride in signalizing his advent by an attack on Mani. The Maniates as if at a given signal were ever alert with arms in hand. The first to run to meet the enemy were the youth of Mani, and the only reward that any of them looked forward to was a word of praise, a look of admiration from the young woman who had won his heart. There was nothing that thrilled and inspired them so much as the praises of these heroines, who, most of the time, fought side by side with them.</p>
   <p>The Maniates of the times of Turkish rule were famous for their gunpowder, which they made themselves. Every household had its powder-shop, and the main occupation of the young people was making gunpowder. They used the <span class="page-break">\3</span>following method. They would pound in wooden mortars niter, sulphur, and coal, each separately at first until it was well pulverized. Then they would mix the three substances together and pound them until first-grade gunpowder was produced.</p>
   <p>There are in Mani fields which produce niter in abundance but the Maniates did not know how to extract it. Nicholas Stefanopoli had the desire, as he confesses, to teach them how to do it, but his other activities did not allow him time.</p>
   <p>Worthy descendants of the ancient Spartans, the Maniates did not consider thievery a disgrace. It sufficed that the thief should not be caught with the goods. At that time the following curious incident took place. A young Maniati who had stolen fruit, domestic animals, and other edible goods, since these were the things which it was prohibited to steal, walked abroad the next day, head up and chest out, publicly boasting of his achievement, while his compatriots admired him for his cleverness and his dexterity.</p>

   <p>Although they were passionate by nature, the Maniates did not know what flirting meant. The manners of the country did not allow such conduct. When a young man had chosen his life-mate, he announced his decision to his parents, who went to the girl's parents and asked them for her hand. If the offer was accepted, the parents announced the young man's proposal to their daughter, who endorsed it by her silence.</p>
   <p>From the moment when the engagement was agreed upon, the man betrothed was prohibited from entering his future wife's house and from talking to her when they met in the street, and if at any time these rules were violated, the engagement was considered dissolved.</p>
