   <p>Socrates School will hold its graduation exercises tomorrow at the Carrick Theater, 64 W. Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>Over five hundred children will demonstrate to the Greeks of Chicago their progress and the national importance of the work, which they have accomplished in this unique national institution of ours in America.</p>
   <p>This school, which has recently been the target of a bitter attack, ought by all means to be supported by the Creek community of Chicago. Let us show our interest tomorrow by attending its exercises.</p>
   <p>We must by this time have realized the necessity of supporting our schools, if we wish to preserve our nationalism. It is our duty to watch them in their great work, for only thus shall we know what is going on in the school, and how well it is fulfilling its mission.</p>
   <p>For this reason we urge all to attend the graduation exercises tomorrow.</p>
