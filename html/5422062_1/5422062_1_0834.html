   <p>On another page of this issue is printed a letter sent us by a well-known Greek intellectual of our community. It refers to an incident which took place upon the death of a fellow countryman. It concerns a matter that will make an impression on all Greeks. It will arouse much dissatisfaction, and will, no doubt, be of interest to the Clergy and the Bishop.</p>
   <p>This letter discloses that for the burial of a derelict Greek man the Church demanded and received twenty-five dollars. This sum, furthermore, was accepted by the Church only after much haggling--for more had been demanded. The corpse was forced to become a member of the Church before the priest would consent to read the burial service, or allow the body to enter the church.</p>
   <p>This episode--the like of which undoubtedly has occurred many times in the past--gives a true picture of today's social order. And it does not prophesy a very bright picture for the future. This will be the result: Those members of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Church, and they are numerous, who do not abide by the decisions of our Clergy and Church will find it impossible to acquire the services of a priest to perform any religious ceremony. Some of these people will take advantage of the progressive status of other dogmas and will forsake the backward Orthodox Church. Most of them will do without the Church entirely, and will withdraw their support forever.</p>
   <p>Such measures as are being put into practice by the Greek Church in America will result in complete indifference to spiritual or religious feeling. If the Church leaders cannot see this, or do not care to do any thing about it, let them keep their peace in the future when their churches are no longer filled.</p>
   <p>The people are to be served by the Church, not the Church by the people.</p>
