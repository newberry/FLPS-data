   <p>Recently, we have been making an investigation into one phase of our amusement and recreational world. We are endeavoring to discover what influence the poolrooms or billiard parlors have on the Greek youths who frequent such places.</p>
   <p>What role do the poolrooms play in the life, not only of our own youth but in that of the youth of our own youth but in that of the youth of Chicago in general? Do they lead them to evil? Are they the workshops of crime among our youth? Do they tend to contribute to the moral, physical, intellectual, and spiritual well-being of our youth, or are they a means of corruption and social degeneration?</p>
   <p>Public officials, reformers, social workers, and police authorities attribute the crimes of most young men entirely to various gangs of young boys which arise in places such as poolrooms and cheap saloons.</p>
   <p>What is the truth of the matter? Investigation reveals that a great number of poolrooms admit minors. Among this group there are a few poolrooms which belong <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to members of our own nationality. We here give an account of what goes on in these breeding grounds of crime and moral delinquency.</p>
   <p>Last Monday, one of our reporters visited the poolroom of Michael Pappas, 1103 South Halsted Street, in order to buy a cigar. He saw seven youths watching and talking about the game. Pretty soon, a group of ten more youngsters, most of whom were less than nineteen years of age, entered the place. Some of these youths started playing, while others were wasting their time looking on, in the midst of a smoky and filthy atmosphere. On the same day the poolroom of Panos Antonopoulos and Company, 3844 Cottage Grove Avenue, was visited, and many minors were found playing pool.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday, we visited the poolroom at 450 North Clark Street, but we found no minors playing. At the Erie poolroom, which is owned by both Greeks and Americans, one sixteen-year-old boy was found playing. Last Tuesday, we also visited the billiard parlor of Constantine Katsoros, 357 West Division Street. Many young men came in, but left without having played. It was evident that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the police had just raided the place, so that the youth were frightened away.</p>
   <p>At the pool hall of Pappadopoulos and Sporten, 82 West Van Buren Street, many were arrested and several fined. The pool hall of Panos Kostakos, 612 South Wabash Avenue, is sometimes rented as a gambling house (card games). The pool hall of George Spartinos, 500 South State Street, which was once considered one of the best poolrooms, is being patronized by the youths of the lowest type. The poolroom of Constantine Kolantis, 2551 South State Street, has been visited from time to time by minors.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt whatever that most poolrooms are centers of vice, corruption, and crime. To combat this growing evil, the parents of our children must use every means at their command to prevent and restrain our young boys and our young men from being lured into these dens of degeneracy by evil companions.</p>
   <p>Vigorous law enforcement and severe punishment of pool hall operators, however, especially when minors are admitted and given the opportunity to learn the language and habits of gangsters, criminals, and gamblers, is the most effective instrument against this new social evil, the poolroom.</p>
