   <p>Two new Greek schools have recently opened in Chicago. One is on the West Side and the other on the South Side of the city. Each school has accomodations for two hundred children.</p>
   <p>It is a thrilling sensation to go to one of these schools and see two hundred heads bent over the pages of a Greek history book. Our children are being taught the glorious history of their country in this foreign land. However, there is another, less thrilling side to this matter. The school records show that five hundred Greek children are now enrolled in American schools. This makes our two hundred look insignificant.</p>
   <p>The size of this enrollment--five hundred--should shock every Greek who prides himself on this patriotism. He should realize the magnitude of our patriotic apathy. The children themselves are not responsible. How can they help it if they were born in a strange land among people who do not speak the Greek language? .... The parents are to be blamed if Greek children are forgetting the language <span class="page-break">\2</span>of our fathers and are losing their religion.</p>
   <p>This problem is a very serious one. Our priests and leaders must face facts. If we continue at the present rate, there will be no Greeks in America after two generations! These leaders must take immediate and drastic action to create schools. The clergy can make appeals from the pulpit. They can use their influence on the good people in the community. The parents must be persuaded to send their children to Greek schools instead of American schools.</p>
   <p>Our patriotic and benevolent clubs must raise funds for the benefit of the schools in order that they may be worthy of the name "school". We have been informed that the two Greek schools are not yet properly equipped with desks and materials, and for this reason some of the children have been withdrawn and placed in the public schools.</p>
   <p>The parish treasuries are not adequate to do very much more unaided. Therefore, the clubs must come to their assistance. The Greek Women's Club has always been <span class="page-break">\3</span>a faithful supporter of the Greek schools. Unfortunately, however, this club lost all of its capital in the bankrupt Greek-American Bank; therefore, the charitable acts of these ladies have been curtailed. This does not mean, however, that the mothers of Greek children should remain with folded hands.</p>
   <p>Greek mothers must help the schools in every possible manner. It is their responsibility to keep their children familiar with the Greek language.</p>
   <p>Saloniki pledges its co-operation with all groups that are making plans for the benefit of the Greek schools.</p>
