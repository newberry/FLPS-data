   <p>Every nation on earth--whether it be large or small--has its failings. As time goes on, however, it must endeavor constantly to get rid of any destructive failing. This is the only way a nation can advance itself and secure its economic, political, and social life. Let us leave aside the failings of other nations and deal with those of our own nation. There is no doubt, of course, that all failings, whether they be of a personal or collective nature, are bad, but there is no greater evil than civil strife and discord. All other evils and calamities have their origin in that deadly social disease. National disunity, social degeneration, economic disorganization, and political disorders all have their origin in civil strife, antagonism, and discord. Retrogression and backwardness are the direct result of failure to keep united and become accustomed to the great traits of tolerance, patience, mutual respect, and cooperation.</p>

   <p>If we review the long history of Greece, our Fatherland, we shall see that in a great many instances it is marred by examples of civil strife, discord, and personal hatreds. From ancient times until this very day, civil strife and discord are playing a major role in the otherwise glorious and brilliant history of our nation.</p>
   <p>Had it not been for continual and unremitting civil wars and civil strife the Greek city-states of old would never have been subjugated by the Roman conqueror in 146 B. C. The Greek nation would have been much different today were it not for these serious national defects and its inability to strengthen and preserve its internal political unity.</p>
   <p>This serious Greek defect is an ancestral and a hereditary evil, it seems. Even in their early years, our fathers witnessed the curse of discord bore into the vitals of Greek society. There were seven major Greek cities in ancient times under individual kings rivaling each other in the acquisition of more power and influence at the expense of people of the same nationality and the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>same race. Many more Greek city-states which were under democratic rule spent most of their energy in violent civil strife. Ancient Sparta was suspicious of Athens; Athens in turn was envious of Thebes, and so the story went. Thus, the Greek race was weakening and inevitably defeated and crushed by other more powerful and barbarous peoples.</p>
   <p>Indeed, no one can tell how great the Greek nation would have been if such great men as Themistocles, Miltiadis, Socrates, Pericles, and so many other eminent Greek leaders throughout the history of our people, had not been persecuted, exiled, forced to drink the hemlock, and discredited by the very people whom they sought to serve.</p>
   <p>This catastrophic national shortcoming called discord is transmitted from generation to generation. So, we too have inherited it. Instead of eradicating this evil, however, we try to perfect it, and thus improved upon, we hand it down to our descendants.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>As we said above, all peoples strive to correct their defects little by little. Daily they cleanse their souls from such corroding evils. That is why they progress while we are retrogressing. No doubt, we have noticed ourselves that while we claim to be progressive, in reality we remain far behind in the ways of progress. Unfortunately, this strange phenomenon of civil strife and discord has been widely spread among the Greek people of America. Especially do we notice this destructive spirit of discord and civil disorder in the Greek community of Chicago and particularly among the various classes of our people from the professional and businessman to the lowliest laborer.</p>
   <p>We are forced to confess--and let us keep this confession to ourselves--that in many respects we are far behind many other nationalities in America in civilized living, in social attainments. We ourselves know that we are rated very low in social prestige when compared to many other nationalities living in America. Why is this so? The answer is very simple and can be found in ourselves. Evidently, discord is responsible for our downfall. Just as the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>well-known adage says "that the Greek can tolerate no oppression" so do discord and our personal sense of superiority and importance tell us that we must not recognize anyone else as superior or abler than ourselves.</p>
   <p>That is why we see many great patriotic and national causes being condemned, not because they are bad or harmful, but because we have not been asked, because he who conceived the idea or who promoted a certain cause did not ask our "authoritative and weighty" opinion. That is why all our efforts and undertakings have failed. This can be attributed to the prevalent spirit of discord and refusal to accept any sort of discipline. Evidently without these characteristics, we can neither breathe nor live. For the thrill of discord and disobedience, we sacrifice the most precious things; we do not hesitate to forget our conscience and thus destroy or work against some cause which would benefit both our fatherland and our own personal interests.</p>
   <p>Wherever you go, you will find the Greeks quarreling with each other about <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>some trivial and insignificant matter. Every Greek differs with other Greeks about a particular subject. Every Greek tries to assert himself regardless of his extrinsic value. Put two Greeks together and on the next day they will break their partnership, because within them lives the germ of discord which, to our misfortune, is very noticeable among our businessmen; that is, among the class in whose work and activities rest the hopes of every nation for its indispensable material prosperity. It is not exaggerating to say that the businessman is one of the most important factors in any nation.</p>
   <p>We here give a vivid example of discord and destructive rivalry among our businessmen.</p>
   <p>On the day before yesterday a Greek came to our office; his appearance and gestures showed that the man was in a highly nervous state. Without delay, this businessman informed us that he wanted his partner's name to be published in the newspaper because he was cheating and stealing the business' profits. In vain did we attempt to calm him and dissuade him from attempting to force <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>us to do such a foolish thing. We told him that he was not doing the right thing in wanting to expose the dishonesty of his partner.</p>
   <p>Incidentally, we took the opportunity to expound to him the advantages which can be gained through co-operation and by working patiently and harmoniously together. On the other hand, we cited the evils that can result from discord. Our visitor was not convinced by us. He departed in anger saying that we Greeks have never wanted to help one another by exposing the worst types of criminals and frauds. He added that he was determined to take legal action against his partner and would engage an American lawyer. In addition, he threatened to bring a charge against another Greek through the American press.</p>
   <p>Naturally, it is very difficult to discontinue a practice which has become part of some of us. However, we contend that it can be done gradually. We have much to learn in this country where we live and work. Let us observe how the American does things and how he conducts himself towards his clients, his friends, his fellow citizens. By emulating him, we may be forced to adopt his <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>ways and abandon our disgusting methods of dealing with each other.</p>
   <p>No matter in what direction you turn your eye in these United States, you will see thousands of business signs in commerce, industry, and finance with the word "company" or "corporation" on them. We should be reminded then that by these companies, corporations, and accumulations of capitalistic and business interests, the Americans have been able to organize a highly efficient financial and commercial system. They have thus been able to win the world's markets in a very short time. That is why they prosper and succeed in almost everything they undertake. Besides this, let us consider the great influence of the United States trade unions and other workers' organizations on the employers and managers of industry and business in the United States. This successful organization and collective representation of labor makes for higher and more adequate wages. Consequently, the worker enjoys a higher standard of living; he works with more zeal and enthusiasm; and, finally, he becomes more interested in the union or trade organization to which he belongs. He knows that a well-organized and unified union will promote his interests.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Cannot we, the Greek workers of America, the Greek workers of Chicago, organize ourselves and form powerful labor organizations? Are our businessmen, large and small, incapable of pooling their business and financial resources to establish partnerships, large companies, and corporations? It is time the Greek businessman looked forward to something bigger and more promising. Limited businesses run on a small, individual scale can bring no great profits or expansion of capital and resources.</p>
   <p>In a new world with new business methods and different forms of financial organization, co-operation is an absolute necessity for material success.</p>
   <p>Strangely enough, in an environment with so many examples of the wonders accomplished by co-operation, our "enterprising and ambitions" businessmen and workers are floundering in disastrous strife and petty quarrels.</p>
   <p>It is not too late for us to stop playing childish games and stop the practice of flying at each other's throats in order to satisfy our personal ambitions <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>and selfish ends. Only a little patience, will power, and the desire to work for the common good are necessary.</p>
   <p>Let us see whether the Greek is willing to go forward instead of backward. Let him profit by the disastrous results of discord and strife in our national affairs as well as in our communities.</p>
