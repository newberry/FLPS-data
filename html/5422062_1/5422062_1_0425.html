   <p>"We kindly request you to print the attached letter of thanks in your distinguished newspaper.</p>
   <p>"The Board of the Coraes Greek-American School on Chicago's South Side expresses its hearty thanks to all those who so willingly honored the small Christmas tree party by their presence, offering generously their material support.</p>
   <p>"The board extends many thanks, especially to the board of directors of the St. Constantine Church for contributing twenty-five dollars toward the success of the occasion. It thanks Mr. M. Petropoulos for offering five dollars, and Mr. B. Rekas for donating the Christmas tree.</p>
   <p>"Cordial thanks are also due to Mr. Spelios Papadopoulos, who, on the next day, offered to pay twenty-five dollars, his annual school contribution for the Coraes institution. This patriotic and noble gentleman said: 'While I am living and healthy, I shall pay twenty-five dollars every year for the school, which I consider the most sacred and highest national Greek institution.'</p>
   <p>"May a great number of our people quickly follow the example of this generous man.</p>
   <p>"From the school office."</p>
