   <p>In the pages of the Year Book, I take the opportunity to publicly congratulate Rev. Constantine Glynos and the rest of the teachers of Korais School, and express my sincere gratitude to the Greek community for their vigilance as regards the maintaining of our national integrity through the church and school.</p>
   <p>As a presiding priest of the parish, I recommend and urge the Greeks of Chicago to read the Year Book, in whose pages the reader will find the beginning of our communities, the life, activities, and the progress of our educational and religious institutions in this city.</p>
   <p>Rev. Marcos E. Petrakis.</p>
