   <p>P. 5 -- Whoever believes what he reads in some of the newspapers is bound to be wrong in his calculations, to absorb inaccurate information, and to become narrow-minded and fanatical or even stupid.</p>
   <p>It is interesting and very amusing to note how some of the Chicago papers enlighten or hoodwink the public in regard to an approaching election.</p>
   <p>Two days before the election of our new mayor, Hearst's Chicago American said,</p>
   <p>"Ten thousand Greek voters are ready to cast their ballots for Mr. Dunne for mayor."</p>
   <p>On the same day, that is two days before the election, the Journal published the picture of Dr. Athanasius J. Sanitsas, an active campaigner for Fred A. Busse, and stated:</p>
   <p>"The great majority of the voters of the Chicago Greek community are solidly <span class="page-break">\2</span>behind Fred A. Busse. Dr. Sanitsas, a Greek expert in political campaigns, has predicted that Mr. Busse will be elected by an avalanche of votes."</p>
   <p>An impartial observer in comparing these two items of publicity finds a great discrepancy in the writers' predictions, and one who knows how large the Greek community is, and how many of its members are voters, will be amused by these fabrications of pseudo-journalists who, I presume, have been nurtured on the allegorical myths of ancient Greece. Anyhow, the Greeks, as a superior race, must be used as an example for the world, whether of good or of evil, for great minds are capable of both, and both are useful in man's evolution. And the press, when it is necessary to create news, makes lavish use of us Greeks.</p>
   <p>When the Chicago American says that "ten thousand Greek voters are ready to cast their ballots for Mr. Dunne," this great journal includes infants and the child unborn among Greek-American voters; for up to date the entire population of the Greek community of Chicago is slightly less than ten thousand. And according to what we have learned, the great majority of the Greek voters are supporting Fred A. Busse and not Mr. Dunne. <span class="page-break">\3</span>After all, the Chicago American as a philhellenic paper has the right to double or to triple the actual number of the members of the Greek community if such multiplication serves its purpose.</p>
