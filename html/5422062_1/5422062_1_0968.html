   <p>"It makes me happy to help little Greece win prizes today as big Greece used to do," the beautiful Aliki Diplarakou, alias "Miss Europe" said. It was in reply to our greeting in which we expressed our pleasure in having as a guest of The Stevens the choicest of Europe's pulchritude.</p>
   <p>Miss Diplarakou, who was chosen by a jury of the leading artists of twenty-two countries as the most beautiful girl in all Europe, accepted the invitation of the St. Andrew's Woman's Club of Chicago to be present at their annual charity ball at the Aragon, Monday evening, December 8.</p>
   <p>Tall and as exquisitely chiseled as a statue, Miss Diplarakou epitomizes "The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome". When we interviewed her, she was simply but strikingly gowned in an original Vionnet model of black crepe and wore a string of pearls and earrings to match. Her coiffure was superbly classic.</p>

   <p>Miss Diplarakou's entire wardrobe, according to her secretary was designed by Vionnet; and it is interesting to note that this Grecian beauty furnished the inspiration for the simplicity of line that has won for Madame Vionnet the title of "le medecin de la ligne."</p>
   <p>A reporter who seemed to be quite insistent about obtaining Miss Diplarakou's beauty secrets was amazed to learn that she uses no "make-up" with the exception of a little lipstick. "My only beauty secret is my gymnastics," she told him. She is particularly enthusiastic about tennis, swimming, water ball and rhythmic dancing.</p>
   <p>Miss Diplarakou is more interested at present in completing her education rather than in parading before people as"Miss Europe." At eighteen, she is a graduate of the University of Athens and of the Lycee Victor de Louis, Paris. Upon her return to Europe, she will continue her studies at the Sarbonne. Her pet joy is Greek mythology and she has been invited to lecture on it at Harvard, the University of Pittsburgh and a number of other great institutions.</p>

   <p>Miss Diplarakou speaks French, English, Italian and Greek fluently. She is also an accomplished pianist. She believes that a girl should go to college to learn things and not to collect fraternity pins.</p>
