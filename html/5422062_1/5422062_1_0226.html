   <p>For a large number of years we repeat these two words--church and school--as the Alpha and Omega of our national activity, and we continue to believe that these two institutions are inextricably bound together and that by the School and the Church we are to live as a nationality, specifically the scattered Hellenism.</p>
   <p>I would be bold to try to change such principles so deeply rooted, and to advocate that it is time to separate them as has been done elsewhere. However, it is time to separate the teacher from the priest, and emphasize that each should stay where he belongs, as the duties of the priest are different from those of the teacher. This should especially be the case when there are so many teachers of both sexes without work. It would be wise to have the priests confine themselves to their priestly duties, leaving the teaching of the children to the teachers.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, from an impromptu investigation of the matter we have found out that many priests share this opinion, because, after all, they know the proverb: "When a priest, be a priest, and when a ploughman, be a ploughman."</p>
