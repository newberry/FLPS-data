   <p>According to the latest statistics, four million people have been put to work on government-sponsored projects. Accustomed as we are to seeing one-third of our population unemployed for so many years, it is hard to believe that at least some of these unemployed will be placed on pay rolls. Naturally these jobs are not high-salaried ones, and they do not make the future secure; but at least they relieve the terrific situation that faces so many of our people. Only one who has been without work and without prospect of work can really appreciate what this Government plan is worth.</p>
   <p>Of course the conservative economists have raised their voices in protest against this plan for Government expenditure. They claim that such a plan will greatly increase public expenditure and create national debts which sooner or later must be paid. These shouters belong to a bygone era of economic theories.</p>

   <p>Modern problems are so different from those of the past that men and radical changes must be made in thought and government. There is no doubt on the part of anyone that we are passing through a very difficult period. That we are passing through it,and not remaining stationary in it, is due to the social awareness of the present administration. An indication of this social awakening is the fact that measures are being taken to put the unemployed to work.</p>
   <p>As to the debts which the conservatives so greatly fear--they will be paid in full, just as our Government debts have always been paid. The urgency of the need is justification enough for the immediate spending of a large sum of money. No nation can survive, even if it has a well-stocked treasury, if one-third of its population is starving and the other third is nearly crushed by economic pressure.</p>
   <p>The financial uneveness can be leveled out by time, which levels even <span class="page-break">3</span>the highest mountains.</p>
