   <p>p. 1- The Plato Club, a society of Greek students, will give its annual dinner tomorrow, Friday, June 24, at the Hyde Park Hotel, Lake Park and Hyde Park Avenues. As in the past this affair is to be given in honor of those students who are graduating and will soon embark on their careers.</p>
   <p>The well-known philhellenist and eminent American sculptor, Mr. Lorado Taft, will be present at the dinner and will deliver an address, after which honorary membership in the club will be conferred on the "soldiers' mother." There will be dancing after the dinner.</p>

   <p>These Plato Club dinner-dances have always been attended by the elite of our country, and on this occasion on account of the presence of the dignitaries above mentioned, a larger and still more distinguished array of guests is expected.</p>
