   <p>The Greek Press is very happy when it is given the opportunity to announce that honors have been conferred upon Greek boys and girls in the various American schools of the city. The latest addition to the roll of honor is the name of James Mazarakis, who graduated from the Calumet High School with high academic honors. His remarkable ability enabled him to win two scholarships: one, at Northwestern University; and the other, at the University of Chicago. He has accepted the latter, and is now enrolled in the medical school of the University.</p>
   <p>We are sure that when classes begin in the fall, our young Greek will return to his studies and start upon a path leading to still greater achievement.</p>
