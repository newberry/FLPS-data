   <p>Of the many Greek celebrations, last Sunday, the one that deserves to take first place is the celebration that was organized by the Greek school, Korais.</p>
   <p>Without exaggeration the school festival of the Korais school was a national holiday, truly representing Greek letters, and was perfect evidence that with a little more endeavor and cooperation we will preserve the Greek spirit forever for our coming generations.</p>
   <p>The hall seated, with comfort, the many people who came to hear the songs, recitations, and plays of the boys and girls. It was truly a great affair and gave much delight to those who had the pleasure of attending the graduating exercises at St. Constantine Church.</p>
   <p>Every once in a while we hear people say that our children can never love the Greek schools, because the American ones offer so much more. We have <span class="page-break">2</span>compared many American schools with that of the Korais and found in every instance that the latter was far superior. The pupils presented their offerings with such success that the audience applauded heartily every single play, recitation, or song. The truth is, if any medals were to be awarded for good deeds and self-sacrifice, the teachers of this school should be among the first to receive them. What time and patience they must have put in to turn out such a well-organized program.</p>
   <p>The performances of the boys and girls were wonderful. They even played in short dramas, and were a huge success by their perfect acting. Everyone was amazed at the obvious refinement of the children enrolled at Korais.</p>
   <p>At the end of the program all the pupils gathered on the stage for a last burst of applause and received their diplomas. The principal of the school, Miss F. Tanke, who worked hard to educate and refine the Greek children, gave a brief talk on their amazing progress.</p>

   <p>The president of the church, Mr. James Stamos, distributed the diplomas and acknowledged as superior students George Damaris and Eugenia Sotiropoulos. Speeches followed by the most Rev. Markos Petrakis and our own Paul Javaras , emphasizing our national establishments in the schools.</p>
   <p>Mr. Javaras praised Miss Tanka, and another teacher, Miss M. Nichta. Mr. Javaras praised the priest, Rev. Petrakis; the president , Mr. Stamos; and the members of the church for their wonderful work.</p>
   <p>Among those present were: Mr. Kontos, Mr. Spirrison, Mr. G. Lempesis, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Spannon, and others.</p>
