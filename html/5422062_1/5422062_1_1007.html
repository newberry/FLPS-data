   <p>For the Greek, eating is an important event which takes place, usually, twice a day. Food is not only a necessity of life; it is a joy. A good cook, in the eyes of the Greeks, is superior to a doctor or an astronomer. The discovery of a star isn't important because thousands of other stars have been discovered. A doctor is concerned with curing sick people but a cook must feed healthy people and keep them that way.</p>
   <p>A Greek eats well, and takes two hours to do it. He will sit at the table with great solemnity, even if he partakes solely of bread and cheese. Food invites conversation. At the table, whether it is a simple affair or a huge banquet, there will be discussed a thousand subjects, serious, practical or flippant. An American will hasten to work with the last bite still in his mouth. A Greek has practically digested his food before rising from the table. Half of his life is spent at the table, in eating and conversing. "What are we going to eat today" and what shall we buy for tomorrow" are every-day phrases in Greek households.</p>

   <p>A Greek wants to live! Everything else is secondary. In order to live well, he must eat and drink well. He emphasizes life. This is probably hereditary because Homer, we are told, ate and drank plentifully.</p>
   <p>Americans emphasize work--all the riches around us are the result of work. The Greeks are wiser than the Americans. Men who work hard lose the significance of their achievements. When you balance good-living and production, you will see that good-living is easier to achieve and more satisfactory. A friend once remarked to me, "You don't realize how I've learned to love Life."</p>
   <p>He forgot to mention that life as he saw it meant food and drink and plenty of both.</p>
   <p>You may work hard all your life and gather around your costly and rare objects, amusements, cherished possessions, but you will never enjoy them. You are too busy working.</p>

   <p>A Greek lives by eating and conversing. He converses most of the day, works a little, eats and drinks well and sleeps contentedly the whole night through.</p>
   <p>The laziest Greek is wiser than the hard-working American. His philosophy is, "Once I will live, thrice I will love and once I will die."</p>
