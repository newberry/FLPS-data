   <p>My dear Friend.</p>
   <p>I send my thanks for your splendid historical epic on Lincoln and Pericles. Often have I alluded to the quotations of Pericles, some of which you have clarified in your splendid article.</p>
   <p>The letters from the public men to whom you have sent your article prove the great value of your contribution,but I think that if time and circumstances permit, it should be sent to all school-teachers of the higher <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>grades that they may acquaint their students with the parallel between Pericles's oration and Lincoln's. Your contribution is wholly worth this tribute.</p>
   <p>With personal regards,</p>
   <p>Your friend,</p>
   <p>James Hamilton Lewis.</p>
