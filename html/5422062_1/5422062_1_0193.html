   <p>The main reason for the organization of the Greek Women's University Club was the encouragement of higher education among the Greek women. It was arranged to give a scholarship each year to some needy Greek girl showing exceptional ability in her studies.</p>
   <p>This year, as is customary, candidates for this scholarship are sought by the Womens' Club. Students from any school are eligible, who wish to attend the University of Chicago. Applications should be sent, first to the University, and then to the Committee of Scholarships and Fellowships, not later than June 1.</p>
