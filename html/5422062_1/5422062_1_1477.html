   <p>Most living men will remember that, Russia was once classified as a backward country among the nations of the world. In addition to the eight hundred thousand dukes, nobles, and aristocrats of the muscovite empire, there were uncounted and disregarded millions in Russia who were just about the same as serfs. As soon as the Czar was overthrown and the Bolsheviks began ruling in the Kremlin, world-wide fear gripped the minds of men.</p>
   <p>The fear was that Communism would ruin Russia and endanger the whole fabric of civilization. What the exact facts are after these seventeen years of the Communist regime is not definitely known. But there are certain outstanding accomplishments of Soviet Russia which have not been refuted.</p>
   <p>One of these, according to the latest information cabled throughout the world, is that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be second only to the United States in the output of iron. Planned production, based on an entirely new economic system, seems to have succeeded in Russia. Theoretical Communism may be wrong, but in actual application it spells wonders.</p>
