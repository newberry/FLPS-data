   <p>On last Thursday occured the first part of the exercises of the Socrates Greek School, performed by the lower classes. Sunday has been appointed as the day for the exercises of the higher classes, whose program will be presented in the magnificent Ashland Auditorium at the corner of Ashland Boulevard and Harrison Street. This hall contains four thousand seats.</p>
   <p>A splendid program has been prepared. The executive committee, the president, Mr. Angelos Tsiolis, and the teaching staff have exerted themselves to make this a notable event so that the graduating students may retain vivid and splendid memories of the Socrates School; for our schools and our Church are our two vigilant wardens, the two ties which keep us bound to our native race. Therefore the teachers, beginning with the principal, Mr. Drosos, and including the teacher of English, are bestowing great care upon the Greek boys and girls.</p>
   <p>Worthy of mention also are the industrious and progressive president, Mr. N. Kokkines, and his committee, who in co-operation with the Church are seeking to make the Socrates School more nearly complete and perfect.</p>

   <p>We hope that our countrymen of the city of Chicago will honor the exercises with their presence and so encourage our children, of whom our race expects many things in the future.</p>
   <p>Let us all be present at the exercises of the Socrates School!</p>
