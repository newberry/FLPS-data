   <p>p. 4.- At three o'clock in the morning after the Anastasis, at St. George's church, Archrev. P. Golemis, with many of his friends, celebrated Easter as Greeks do.</p>
   <p>Thirty friends were seated around the table to break eggs with one another and eat Mageritsa. The walls echoed with Xristos Anesti (Christ is Risen). The dinner lasted for over two hours with many eating and drinking a second and third time.</p>
   <p>When everyone finally left, dawn was beginning to break and the silence of the streets was shattered by the "Xristos Anesiti" which departing friends shouted to one another.</p>
