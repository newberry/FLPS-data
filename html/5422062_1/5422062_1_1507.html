   <p>Upon looking back over the last twelve months, a picture of human actions which leaves lasting impressions of a series of scenes and acts in the drama of life is unfolded to the observer. By whatever standards of comparison the passing year is measured, the things which have taken place in the last twelve months have brought about new orientations in the policies of nations.</p>
   <p>The proximity of the nations of the world, which is supposed to have been brought about by modern means of communication, is a myth and a delusion. Isolation and autocracy are the primary motives which guide both nations and individuals. He who is not one of our kind is still thought of as an alien. When the Greeks of old classified all non-Greeks as barbarians, there was just reason for it. But for people who belong to the same level of civilization to harbor such archaic notions is nothing less than treason to human intelligence.</p>

   <p>The year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three can claim no deeds nor acts that man can be proud of, either now or in the ages to come. May the year that is about to replace it witness a revival of the spirit of liberalism. Otherwise, man will revert to barbarism. The hero making of the present age is a sure harbinger of dire events.</p>
