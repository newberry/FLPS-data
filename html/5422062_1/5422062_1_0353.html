   <p>P.1.- Tomorrow, at about 3 P.M., the community of the North Side will hold the most solemn and dignified of feasts. It opens the door of its new school Solon which has been splendidly erected through the generosity and patriotism of the Greeks of this parish and the executives of the community.</p>
   <p>If we stop for a moment to think it over, we will see that of all feasts, that of a school opening is the feast of feasts and the fair of fairs, to which every Greek should hasten, in order to celebrate a great event of national importance and lofty aim.</p>
   <p>The erection of a Greek school is equal to the creation of a fort. It protests our nationalism and defends our traditions.</p>
   <p>The erection of a school is of even more importance than the erection of a church, because "God does not reside in the hand-made churches", while our little children, in order to be taught, must have a roof over their heads, benches and teachers.</p>

   <p>And of what use would the churches be if we did not prepare those of the new generation?</p>
   <p>Specifically for Hellenism of America, the establishment and perfect operation of Greek schools is an imperative necessity, because only through them we will succeed in teaching our children the Greek language and convey to them Greek tradition.</p>
   <p>Those who have a different opinion, or believe that we must abandon our national principle and eliminate our language, in order to become Americans, are not only traitors to their own nationality, but incapable of realizing American ideals. Because they are renegades and they have no national feeling, nor have they the least feeling regarding their obligation to the fatherland. He, who denies his own country and national traditions, will deny with as much ease his new country, or rather, he will never feel any sentiment for it.</p>
   <p>In regard to the Greek language, we must, all of us, feel particularly proud and endeavor by all means, to spread it, because the Greek language <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is a jewel and a characteristic of civilized and intellectual people.</p>
   <p>The whole Greek community of Chicago must be present at the inaugural ceremony of the Greek school and celebrate this beautiful national feast.</p>
