   <p>One of the most memorable occasions in the life of the American Restaurant Association of Chicago was the opening which was held on Monday, December 6, at the Hotel La Salle. The officers took pain to organize the affair and find the proper speakers for the occasion. In addition they were able to secure the services of the mandolin orchestra which, under the direction of Mr. P. Vournas, furnished music for the early part of the evening. Mr. Sotter, the president, said that Mr. Vournas was so well liked by all who knew him that if ever he chose to run for mayor he would be sure to be elected by a great majority.</p>
   <p>Before introducing the speakers Mr. Sotter, voicing the sentiment of the American Restaurant Association, extended welcome to those present and assured them that one of the most important aims of the organization was to kindle friendship with the merchants supplying the Restaurant trade and with other business associations. "There is no doubt," said the president, "that cooperation and cultivation of friendly spirit always <span class="page-break">\2</span>leads to the mutual benefit of those participating. The American Restaurant Association," he continued, "being the biggest and the strongest of all Greek Restaurant organizations in the United States, can be of benefit not only to its members, but also to the community as a whole, because a large part of the community is deriving its income from the restaurant trade in which several million dollars are invested. Notwithstanding the progress we have made within the organization," said the president, "we are always open to criticism and will welcome any suggestion that might lead to greater success. We hope that the speakers of this evening will favor us with all the possible suggestions and criticisms they have."</p>
   <p>The president then introduced the first speaker of the evening, Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos, well known lawyer, assistant city prosecuting attorney, and president of the Retail Fruits Merchants' Association. In an emphatic and explicit manner, Mr. Kyriakopoulos pointed out the necessity of cooperation among the business men and particularly within each organization, in order to avoid the disastrous results of isolation and of domination by wholesale trusts that appear whenever weaknesses in business are felt. He suggested that the restaurant men should not only <span class="page-break">\3</span>protect themselves but also band together for buying on a large scale and thereby make more profit.</p>
   <p>The following speaker, whom Mr. Sotter introduced, was Mr. George Vatsineas, president of the Mercantile Laundry and Linen Supply Company, and a member of the community of long standing. Mr. Vatsineas, with the clear sight of his long business experience, commented upon the merits of the organization and said that his greatest wish was to see a business circle which could draw the business men together and it was fulfilled in a large measure by the American Restaurant Association. Considering the fact that more than twenty-five million dollars are invested in restaurants in the city, one can realize the tremendous buying power of the restaurant men of Chicago. But strength, like health, must be safeguarded through common understanding and expansion in the membership of the association.</p>
   <p>The movement of the American Restaurant Association is so enthusiastically supported and praised by the community that its success is assured. One of the best methods to make the organization known, continued Mr. Vatsineas, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and to enable various non-members of the association as well as business and professional men to establish closer relationships is the holding of these open meetings. Open discussions and criticism inspire confidence, sincerity and trust. These elements are prerequisites to success in business. In addition, they disperse suspicion and hatred that often arise through blind competition. Furthermore, the necessity of cultivating friendship and trusting with those one deals with in business is quite important, especially in matters of service and credit. The existence of the restaurant man is so inextricably connected with that of the supply man, the professional man, and the community in general, that it pays for all to cultivate the best of relations among themselves.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sotter assured Mr. Vatsineas that the restaurant men will fail neither the business men nor the community, and that the association will always appreciate a good word in its behalf, while striving to raise the standard of the trade. The president then introduced Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Chapralis, editor of Arcadia, a newspaper which made great strides since its recent beginning. Mr. Chapralis, true to his military vigor and directness which distinguished him as an officer in the army, said that his present editorial position <span class="page-break">\5</span>was undertaken because of enthusiasm and ambition to champion and serve the needs of our community. The fact that he was given the opportunity to appear before the American Restaurant Association, he said, pleased him immensely. Falling back on his military experience, Mr. Chapralis compared the position of the restaurant man with that of an army. The task that confronts both is not only how to gain ground but also how to keep what they have gained. The territory which an army can take and cannot keep is of no value, said Mr. Capralis; and similarly opening a restaurant and not being able to keep it in a productive state is of no value to the owner nor to the community. Cooperation in business is just as necessary as in the army, provided the participants do not lose sight of the true objective. Everybody should be willing to take a subordinate part when he finds a leader, for more captains than soldiers never won a battle.</p>
   <p>The promise which Mr. Sotter made to provide quite a variety of speakers was kept and to prove it he introduced as the fourth speaker, a financier, Mr. C. Mammon of the Central Trust Co. Mr. Mammon is a well known figure in Chicago. "You are the best doctors that ever cured a patient," he <span class="page-break">\6</span>said, speaking to the members of the association. "While physicians and surgeons can cure bodily ailments in a disagreeable way, the restaurant cures ailments of the stomach in the most desirable way. But as doctors have their organizations and code of ethics, so the restaurant men need cooperation, because in cooperation is the stream that unites all phases of business today. Making success nowadays," said Mr. Mammon, "is a well defined process. One must have the means, he must always try to improve his business and use his clientele as a means of advertising his place. Tracing the rise of marine and life insurance, and the outstanding principle of distributing the loss of a particular individual to all policy holders should be operating in the organization of the restaurant men for mutual protection. The strength of an organization," he said, "often is judged by the amount of assistance and protection it offers its members."</p>
   <p>The next speaker whom Mr. Sotter introduced was Mr. A. A. Pantelis, the President of the Professional Men's Club, and a well known attorney in our community. True to the character of his profession, Mr. Pantelis pointed out very distinctly what he believed makes a successful restaurant <span class="page-break">\7</span>man. "In order that a man may succeed," he said, "he must like his work; he must undertake it because he finds interest in it and not for the sake of money that is in it. The successful man," remarked Mr. Pantelis, "is not the man that made lots of money out of business and made his life miserable. Every human activity has an interesting element in it and can be made the source of financial success and well-being, provided the choice is one that fits the make-up of the particular person. In order to grow," said Mr. Pantelis, "you must keep green, for if you ripen you rot, and like old trees, once you develop a hard bark of 'I know it all" around you, you cease to grow. The restaurant man must be on the look-out for new ideas; preparation of food, decoration of place, and arrangement of the store fixtures, must be constantly changing to meet changing needs of the day. Where personal contact is essential in business like the restaurant, the restaurateur must be polite and obliging; he must satisfy his customers by all means; a satisfied customer will bring more business; whereas, a dissatisfied one can ruin a good clientele. Another way very important in the success of a restaurant man is the prompt payment of bills, an element which is very important in creating credit and which is the standard of measure in modern business."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>After thanking Mr. Pantelis for such direct and to the point suggestions, Mr. Sotter introduced Mr. A. Vlachos, well known local attorney, an author, and an orator. Mr. Vlachos, with a brief introduction, entered his subject. "Just as the audience is the critic of a musician," he said, "so the customer of the restaurant is the critic of the restaurateur." Assuming then the role of the critical customer, Mr. Vlachos began to point out the earmarks of success and failure in business and the causes of each.</p>
   <p>"The first thing that the restaurant man must know as a business man is his place in the community, otherwise he cannot judge his importance within it. The importance of the restaurant trade collectively is quite great and the restaurateur should feel that he is an indispensable part in the business scheme of his community. Knowing that,he should try to meet the requirements of the community and serve his purpose well, else failure looms around the corner. In choosing a partner in business, like choosing a partner for life, the restaurateur must know the person he takes into his confidence very well. A bad choice cannot but drive the business to the rocks. Another element which depends on the conduct <span class="page-break">\9</span>of the restaurant man, is the discharge of his duty towards the customers, towards himself and his business. The fulfillment of that duty can be shown in the interest he takes to keep his place clean, in providing good food and pleasing service to his customers. Last but most important, and perhaps the first step which one should take before he goes into business, is to consult his lawyer; better to spend ten dollars in consultation than one thousand in litigation. Summarizing the important points considered essential as necessary to success - chose wisely those whom you deal with, consult your attorney, improve your place constantly, please your customers, pay your bills promptly, and by all means keep books in order to see where you are going."</p>
   <p>Before asking for a motion to adjourn, Mr. Sotter thanked the speakers in behalf of the organization and remarked that he hoped that this precedent of holding open meetings will be followed in the future in order to create a better understanding among the members of the organization and cultivate desirable relations with other organizations, business and professional men for the common good.</p>
