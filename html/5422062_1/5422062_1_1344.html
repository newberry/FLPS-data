It is rather plainly indicated that the steel industry, to cite only the most conspicuous of the industries which have restricted operations beyond the usual scope at the end of the year, will be obliged to step up its operations rather sharply, even on the basis of such increase in specification for January shipment as has already materialized. As a matter of fact, most steel producers are quite optimistic in their guarded comments on the current trend.</p>
