   <p>In every corner of the civilized world humanity is still trying to solve an age-old problem. The problems of society, it is true, are many, and they are forever annoying man with their existence. The worst of them is the perplexing problem of economic security. Now, more than ever before, it is a truly puzzling and disheartening maze, from which man finds it hard to free himself. This is perhaps due to the machine age, which brought the Middle Ages to a close.</p>
   <p>One of the most drastic steps ever taken to fight economic inequality, so disastrous to humanity, was made by Russia. She is trying to establish economic balance and security by means of a communistic form of government. The Fascist movement in Italy seems to be purely political, for in the ten years of its <span class="page-break">2</span>existence in Italy the economic status of the Italian people has in no way been improved.</p>
   <p>Two economic systems are now in the experimental stage; Communism in Russia, and the new plan which is being tried in this country--a plan which does not have the stamp of any other economic order. And because of this the new economic setup of President Roosevelt is the object of the world's close attention. Upon its success or failure the future economic status of the entire world depends. Humanity and government have reached the crossroads. They only wait to see which is the best road to follow.</p>
   <p>All the academic theories of the past have been resurrected and presented as living policies in one form or another. We are no longer fooled by their hollow words--the smell of death has reached us. We seek new and living programs as an assurance of economic stability. Setting the Soviet program aside, since it is understood by all to be purely communistic, let us examine the policies of our President. They seem to bear a resemblance to socialism; yet they actually <span class="page-break">3</span>have not even one thing in common with the fundamental teachings of socialism. It is an accepted fact that socialism discourages competition and advocates public ownership of all mechanical and natural facilities. In other words, socialism is based upon public ownership and elimination of profit.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Roosevelt policy seems to be a method by which the capitalistic system can be retained, and at the same time the necessities of life guaranteed for the masses who today are in continual upheaval and are floundering economically. Roosevelt's plans do not include elimination of the capitalistic classes, as has been done in the Soviet. His plans are intended merely to provide jobs and security for all the citizens of this rich country. The economic system must undergo a few changes and a few purges if the American people have the right to live. For who can live for long without bread? It is evident that the enemies of the Administration are sorely ignorant of the facts, when they accuse the President of being a socialist and of seeking to introduce socialistic seeking to introduce socialistic <span class="page-break">4</span>principles and methods in our democracy. It proves that they know nothing about the socialistic system, and are therefore in no position to judge or to compare the policies of Roosevelt with those of socialism. The measures being applied are directed entirely toward the solution of the national economic situation, and are in no way meant to change the method of government.</p>
   <p>It is acknowledged that experiments are being made. After all, whenever a thing is done for the first time it must be an experiment, since there is no past performance to judge by. The failure of this trial will result in much more despondency and a greater slump than already exists, because the people now have hope, at least. Strict measures and government supervision are imposed, especially to prevent the failure of the new measures.</p>
   <p>All indications lead us to believe that the plans will be successful. Their acceptance has been made a fact. Now it will be interesting to watch the actual application of these new social measures. Their success will insure future economic stability. Their failure will result in one catastrophe after another, and one of two extremes will probably result: the destruction of <span class="page-break">5</span>capitalism, or the subjugation--through dictatorship--of the masses.</p>
