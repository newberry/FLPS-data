   <p>The doors of the North Side Greek school, which is sponsored and maintained by the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation of Virgin Mary, have been closed since last September, when more than fifty Greek boys and girls had enrolled.</p>
   <p>As yet, we have been unable to find out why the school was shut down so suddenly at a time when the Greeks of the North Side are in such great need of a Greek school for the instruction of their children in our native language. This subject must receive the attention of our entire community.</p>
