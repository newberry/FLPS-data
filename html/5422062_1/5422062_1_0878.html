   <p>p. 4- On last Sunday at the residence of our well-known, highly-esteemed, and well-to-do compatriot, Mr. Nickolaos Stathopoulos, occurred the christening of the son of Mr. and Mrs. Stathopoulos, who received the name of John, sponsored by Mr. Constantine Antonopoulos, Mr. Stathopoulos's partner in business.</p>
   <p>After the christening, at which many friends were present, a dinner was served, and the celebration continued to midnight.</p>
