   <p>Last Sunday night in the Aristotle Greek School, situated on the Northwest Side at the corner of Irving Avenue and Laramie Street, the first monthly school festival was held with great success.</p>
   <p>Parents and others residing in that vicinity attended the meeting and were astonished at the progress which the pupils have made.</p>
   <p>This school was founded by Mr. G. Photopoulos, who is known to Greeks through the columns of newspapers. He has stirred up debates on various vital questions, and is the initiator of the discussion on the progress of Greek schools. Instead of a ceremony the audience heard a very instructive lecture by Mr. Photopoulos on how to rear children, the dangers involved in misdirected liberty, etc.</p>
   <p>Most specifically he emphasized that it is necessary to make the schools centers of instruction and moral development not only for children but also for fathers and mothers and adults generally.</p>

   <p>Mr. Photopoulos in inaugurating this series of socials has stated his determination to continue with monthly lectures serving refreshments after each lecture.</p>
   <p>In presenting this innovation Mr Photopoulos, feels that the Greek family will find under the school roof the moral atmosphere and the opportunity for instruction and recreation which the Greeks of America lack.</p>
   <p>The second school social, it is predicted, will be even more successful and attractive, since those who attended were so enthusiastic that they decided to undertake the arrangement of the next affair themselves.</p>
   <p>The girl pupils had prepared cakes and other delicious refreshments, and the mothers served them.</p>
   <p>We hope that other schools of our city will adopt the innovation sponsored by the founder of Aristotle School.</p>
