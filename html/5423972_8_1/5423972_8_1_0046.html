   <p>A. Sipman, Esq., Chairman of Jewish Relief Committee,</p>
   <p>Pittsburg, Pa.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>During the confirmation services held at our temple yesterday morning, a telegram from one of our esteemed citizens, Mr. Leopold Mayer, now so-journing at Johnstown, was received, urging our Jewish community here to the necessity of immediate action on behalf of our co-religionists, who were bereft of their all in the great calamity at Johnstown. On the spur of the moment, we started a collection, and as a result we now have the great satisfaction to send you the enclosed check, for eight hundred and seventy dollars, to be used and distributed among our suffering brethren.</p>
   <p>Our congregation have from their treasurey, voted three hundred dollars to the general fund, and all Israelites in this city are cheerfully doing their duty in contributing to the general fund.</p>
   <p>M. M. Gerstley</p>
