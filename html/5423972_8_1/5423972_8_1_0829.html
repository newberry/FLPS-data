   <p>The national origin plan, according to which plan the present immigration quota will be reduced, will be taken up in Congress during the month of December, as explained by Congressman Johnson, chairman of the Immigration Committee.</p>
   <p>The new plan will reduce the number of immigrants who can enter America from one hundred sixty-four thousand, six hundred and sixty-seven (164,667) to one hundred and fifty thousand, (150,000).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Instead of the eight thousand, eight hundred and seventy-two, (8,872), immigrants, who may enter according to the present quota, from Poland, there will be permitted only four thousand, five hundred and nine, (4,509), according to the new plan. Instead of fifty thousand, (50,000), from Germany, only twenty-two thousand, (22,000), will be permitted. On the other hand, the quota from Russia will be increased and instead of the one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-two, (1,792), immigrants from Russia to America, the new plan will permit forty thousand and two, (40,002), immigrants to enter.</p>
   <p>Senator Reed of Pennsylvania, the Father of that new plan, declared that if the new plan will be adopted he will assure the majority of immigrants to be "Nordics," or Anglo-Saxons.</p>

   <p>Jewish immigration may not gain by this new plan. The Polish immigrants will suffer most, due to the Polish quota being greatly reduced; if the new plan should be adopted.</p>
