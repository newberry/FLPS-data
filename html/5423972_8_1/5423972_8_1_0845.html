   <p>The masterly speech of Judge Hugo Pam yesterday afternoon at the City Council judiciary committee, against the Johnson anti-immigration bill, has influenced that committee to call a public hearing next Tuesday afternoon in the City Council chambers so that a mighty protest by the Chicago citizens can be heard against the attempt of those who hate immigrants to close the doors of America.</p>
   <p>Alderman Jacob M. Arvey, the Jewish representative of the Twenty-fourth Ward, had introduced a resolution in the City Council against the Johnson bill. The City Council turned the resolution over to the judiciary committee for consideration and recommendation. The resolution became a subject of great public interest, thanks to the efforts of the committee chairman, John H. Lyle. He invited representatives of all nationalities to the committee's hearings yesterday. When the Council members met, they found a crowded committee room.</p>
   
   <p>The committee wanted to hear from all the nationalities that make up Chicago's population, so that the opinion of the committee might have a solid foundation. The great number of people who came to show their interest in the bill, proved the importance of the immigration problem. Judge Pam's speech awoke many committee members to the fact that it was their duty to fight the anti-immigration bill. The motion of Alderman Lyle for an open hearing next Tuesday afternoon was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>"By this bill you are saying to the quarter of a million Italians, half a million Poles, a quarter of a million Bohemians, and three hundred thousand Jews who live in Chicago: 'You are not good enough to become Americans; you cannot become adjusted to American life and American ideas; while we cannot get rid of you, we will, at least, see to it that more of your kind do not come into this country'."</p>
   <p>This was the substance of Judge Pam's speech. The greatest surprise of the meeting came, however, when Alderman Nelson, a vice-president of the Federation of Labor, declared that while the labor organization is opposed to immigration, it has no sympathy with such discriminations against important elements of our community as the Johnson bill calls for.</p>
   <p>Alderman Lyle, after the conclusion of Judge Pem's speech, urged those present to come next Tuesday, at two o'clock in the afternoon, to the City Council's chambers, when a strong resolution of protest against the anti-immigration bill may be adopted. The stronger the representation is at next Tuesday's meeting, the greater will be the help extended by the City Council, of Chicago against the persecution of immigrants.</p>
