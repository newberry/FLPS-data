   <p>Mrs. M. Loeb, president, has decided to disband Auxiliary No. 6, Society for Home for Destitute Crippled Children, believing it has done its share toward the erection of a Home, by raising $750.00. It is the intention of the members to reorganize for the purpose of founding and maintaining a soup kitchen, principally for the Jewish poor living in the Canal Street District. A meeting to organize permanently will be held Friday afternoon, September 22nd, at 2 o'clock, at Sinai Temple.</p>
