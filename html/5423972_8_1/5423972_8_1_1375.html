   <p>The Amalgamated Clothing Workers will have a Grand May Day Celebration.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated Clothing workers will celebrate May 1st in a very practical way. At 2 o'clock all the members will assemble in the large 7th Regiment Armory, 34th St. and Wentworth Ave.</p>
   <p>A magnificent musical program with famous artists has been arranged. Seymour Stedman and V. E. Cuneo will speak regarding May 1st and the organized workers movement.</p>

   <p>everywhere is the same, viz., the socialization of economic life and especially that of production. The representatives of the old social order are naturally resorting to every means within their power to prevent a complete revolt, but unfortunately they do not employ the tactics which would make the conflict seem milder. On the contrary, the conflict grows sharper each day because the representatives of the old economic order do not understand the trend of the times. We cannot speak to the workers today in the same language that we used five years ago, because labor today realizes its power only too well and because the general living conditions compel labor to present greater demands. Of what use is it to raise the wages of labor ten per cent, when living conditions, rent, and clothing have gone up thirty per cent?</p>
   <p>But to the present-day worker it is not merely a question of higher wages in itself. He no longer wants to accept the political submission which was his lot previously. He, too, wants to have a voice in the affairs of state, government, and society [in general]. After a five-year war, he is no longer willing to accept political submission and the dictates of his superiors; whether by struggle or peaceful means, he wishes to become a decisive factor <span class="page-break">\3</span>[in the social order] because after all, production is dependent upon his labor.</p>
   <p>Despite the bitter struggle which is now being waged between capital and labor, we hope that a catastrophe can be avoided, because the more cautious elements of both factions will ultimately realize that a "fight to the finish" must mean the destruction of civilization, and, therefore, both must be willing to accept a compromise solution. If both factions do not come to an understanding soon, the result will be either dark reaction, or Bolshevism--and both would be disastrous. Mankind cannot follow extreme paths: it must follow the middle road--and the sooner it finds the middle road, the better it will be for the present and future generation.</p>
