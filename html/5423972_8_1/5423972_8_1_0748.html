   <p>Rabbi Moritz Weil has passed on. He came to this country sixteen years ago and began his work in the Chicago community as a teacher. Gradually there gathered around him a number of families, who, living in the midst of the newer immigrant community, still felt the need of a German service. They started a congregation and named it B'nai Jehoshua. After purchasing a place of worship, they selected Rabbi Weil as their leader.</p>
