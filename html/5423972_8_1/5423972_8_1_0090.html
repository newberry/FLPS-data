   <p>The commission, appointed by our State Senate to investigate the condition of the despicable white-slaves, had, at its Saturday's session, listened to information that makes the face of every respectable Jew blush with shame.</p>
   <p>Girls, who have been in disreputable houses, declared before the commission that practically all proprietors of such houses are Jews.</p>
   <p>It was imagined before the investigation that the Jews occupy a significant place - are a majority among the scoundrels, the lowest creatures on earth, and, now, this dreadful fact is being openly slapped into the faces of the Jews, in the presence of an official investigation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>When great discoveries were made in the so-called Fire Trust, it was revealed that the Jews occupy an important place among the incendiaries. In Chicago and New York there are five Jews to one non-Jew involved in arson.</p>
   <p>When America was shocked by the criminal acts of professional gamblers in the underworld, Jewish names were almost the only ones mentioned as being the leaders of the clique.</p>
   <p>No matter how much we dodge the facts in the life of American Jewry, we still can not escape from explaining this unusual phenomenon.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Various answers are given to this mournful question: how can there be such a rascally element among the Jews, who always have distinguished themselves and are still distinguishing themselves - in a large majority - by higher moral conditions than are non-Jews?</p>
   <p>The best answer to this question lies, apparently, in the higher spiritual structure of the Jewish race, which is a great asset and earns respect, but this can become under certain circumstances, a great defect.</p>
   <p>As long as a spiritually developed man is found in a good environment and under the supervision of high ideals and traditions, he will use his intellectual and spiritual faculties to beautify his life, so that he may disseminate his noble views among his fellow-men. Remove, however, <span class="page-break">\4</span>from such a man the moral basis and place him in surroundings of indecency, filth and crime, and his historically, and naturally developed spiritual fervor will be devoted to the most horrible and despicable acts.</p>
   <p>The Jew, who enters the ranks of the underworld forgets, in time, the difference between good and evil, and seeks to become an expert in crime. He assumes no social responsibility, nor does he acknowledge the hatred, with which he is looked upon.</p>
   <p>A closer alliance is necessary between Jews and a better education by the growing generation to prevent groups of the Jewish nation from becoming victims of bad morale and from occupying an honorable place in the underworld instead of playing a role in the general world.</p>
