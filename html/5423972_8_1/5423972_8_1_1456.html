   <p>The Hebraists of the city will gather next Saturday evening at the Assembly Hall of the Hebrew Institute to celebrate Purim in Hebrew. The celebration will be interesting and entertaining. The dramatic group Habimah will present a Hebrew play about the life of the Chalutzim in Palestine, with their songs and dances. A good musical program will be given. Cantor Greenber and the well-known tenor Amado will sing. Dr. Zlat will play the violin. The celebration will be opened by the pupils of the Hebrew Teachers Seminary. I believe that all Zionists who understand Hebrew and all Zionists who like to hear Hebrew spoken should come to this Hebrew celebration. The Hebrew old-timers in Chicago, who are now beginning to forget what they once knew of Hebrew, are particularly invited to this fine Hebrew celebration.</p>
