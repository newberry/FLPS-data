   <p>National and Religious Celebrations.</p>
   <p>Every national and religious holiday was properly observed and celebrated at the Institute. The arrangements for the national celebrations have of late been left to some of our organizations, especially those composed of the immigrant element. The Institute cooperates with the clubs in arranging these celebrations but for obvious reasons we prefer to have the organizations take this work under their wing. This method helps us greatly in our effort to interest our immigrants in national and civic affairs. It proved very successful and we hope to continue it.</p>
