   <p>The report of the Kehilah convention, which we are publishing in another column of the Courier, will certainly be read with great interest by all the Jews of the Middle West, who, we know, have followed the movement with the greatest attention. The report will encourage them to follow Chicago's example, and also to attempt to concentrate their strength for the preservation of historical Judaism. This alone indicates that yesterday's Kehilah convention has more than a local character. Its success in Chicago assures the movement of a similar success throughout the Middle West.</p>
   <p>Before we comment on the accomplishments of the convention, we wish to say that its success, its well-directed course [of action], and its harmonious climax were due to the activities of its skillful, energetic and capable chairman, Mr. Max Shulman, who, in stormy and critical moments, displayed calmness, equilibrium and courage. It is only reasonable that Jews, who have for decades isolated themselves and have almost forgotten what a Kehilah is, should at once unite upon those problems which intensify the immediate need of an organized community. Representatives of synagogues, although willing to help build an orthodox organization in Chicago, do not think in terms of a Kehilah, but rather in terms of synagogues and cliques. When a problem arose which exceeded the boundaries of synagogues and cliques, some individuals responded very unpleasantly, and it required all the energy, consideration and calmness of the chairman, and a brilliant address by Rabbi Ezriel Epstein to calm these excited souls. But the convention withstood the fire-ordeal, and for that, orthodox Jewry deserves congratulations.</p>
   <p>The fear that there would not be enough leaders and volunteers to carry out the wishes of the thousands of orthodox Jews, turned out to be groundless. We have always been of the opinion that the masses always find the individuals who will carry out their wishes, and if the masses will only begin to organize, then leaders will appear. The convention not only discovered personalities who are able to do the work, but it was also successful in electing a board of directors consisting of forty-three persons possessing the proper qualifications for this high and sacred office. We are sure that there will always be a sufficient number of Jews in Chicago, possessed of principle and character, to shoulder the burden of their high office, when the masses begin to exert themselves and to show their determination and enthusiasm for the great cause.</p>
   <p>Concerning the practical accomplishments of the convention, it can be said that its achievements were greater than were expected. It seldom happens that fifty different organized groups can establish, without preliminary preparation, in one day, a central body, the necessary committees, and the entire administrative machinery capable of undertaking the task immediately, just as if the organization had been in existence for a long time. In this great practical work, which was completed in two sessions, mention must be made of the fiery atmosphere and excellent spirit created by the brilliant addresses of Rabbis Simon Hirsh Album, Ezriel Epstein, Saul Silber, Fisher and A. I. Cardon. These addresses helped a great deal to soothe those individuals who were angry, and at times created the atmosphere of a great congress. The rapid work that was done by the committees is one of the reasons for the great success of the convention.</p>
   <p>All in all, Chicago's orthodox Jews had a lucky day yesterday. If the work is continued in the future with the same spirit, enthusiasm and energy, then Chicago will have a model community of which all of American Jewry can be proud. It certainly is a good omen that the old differences have been forgotten, and that even the skeptics have found enough strength within themselves to believe that the attempt to found a Kehilah will be crowned with success.</p>
   <p>The Courier will follow the movement with the same interest in the future as it has in the past. Whatever there is to be done to help the movement with proposals and suggestions, we shall certainly do. The Kehilah has in us a true friend and protector, and it is our only wish that the enthusiasm which prevailed at the convention may continue in the future, and then the young Kehilah will surely move forward toward its goal.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: Kehilah is the Hebrew term applied to the organized Jewish community of any city or town.]</p>
