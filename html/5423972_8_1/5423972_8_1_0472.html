   <p>A few days ago the Courier published a statement issued by Ben Zion Lazarowich, president of the Montefiore Talmud Torah (Hebrew school), regarding the progress made by that institution during the past few years. Mr. Lazarowich points out the fact that most of the students of the Yeshivah Etz Chaim (a branch of the Hebrew Theological College) come from the Montefiore Talmud Torah and [that] without the latter there would be no Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>We do not contest the facts presented by Mr. Lazarowich. What he says is quite true. But in Chicago there are many Talmud Torahs, and what accomplishments can they show in spite of their having been in existence for many years? And even the Montefiore Talmud Torah itself, which has exceeded other Talmud Torahs in accomplishment during the past few years, need not brag too much about its success for, after all, it is not rabbis or even scholars that a 
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Talmud Torah is expected to produce, but a generation of conscious Jews. For the past forty years during which the Montefiore Talmud Torah has been in existence, it should have produced five or six thousand Orthodox Jews, who would constitute the backbone of the Chicago Jewish Community today. This it did not do. The best it has done consists in its turning out a few score of young men who are either continuing their studies or engaged in Jewish work. What has become of the other thousands of students who received their Jewish education in Montefiore Talmud Torah? It often happens that great and world-renowned scientists graduate from a small and insignificant university. The fact that great men graduate from such a university does not necessarily mean that the latter is good. One must not judge from the exception, but rather from the rule. Mr. Lazarowich points out an exception. Of the five or six thousand Jewish children who attended the Montefiore Talmud Torah, a few hundred are conscientious Jews and a few have become scholars. Also, in the old country not all the Talmud Torah children become scholars or even rabbis. But there they all remained Jews, whereas in this country, most of them are indifferent Jews, and this fact condemns the entire system upon which the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Montefiore Talmud Torah, as well as all other old-fashioned Talmud Torahs, is built. If the Montefiore Talmud Torah is in some degree better than the other outmoded Talmud Torahs, it can be attributed to the fact that it was fortunate in the selection of its president. Mr. Lazarowich takes his work seriously and he does everything possible for the strengthening and development of the Talmud Torah. Other similar institutions, not having such devoted and energetic leaders as Mr. Lazarowich, can point to much less accomplishments.</p>
   <p>We would be the last to underestimate the work of Mr. Lazarowich and the accomplishments of the Montefiore Talmud Torah. As an outmoded institution, it does very good work. Were it a modern institution, it could do much better work. The question is, Why is the Montefiore Talmud Torah not a modern institution, and why aren't the many other institutions more modern? We know of a few Talmud Torahs here that are no less Orthodox than the Montefiore Talmud Torah and that can point to great accomplishment because their study course and curriculum are modern. Judaism cannot be taught to a child in Chicago as it was in Yanishok, Populan, and Girtigolia (small towns in Europe) <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Here living conditions are quite different, and that is why educational methods must be different. We consider it absolutely out of the question that the old-fashioned method of education can be as effective here as it was in the small Lithuanian or Polish towns, because in the latter places the center of gravity of Jewish education was not the theory but the practice. There the Jewish family and the Jewish home instilled Jewish sentiment in the Jewish child. But this factor of Jewish education does not exist here, and for that reason, in this country the dead weight must be laid on theoretical instruction--more Hebrew, more Jewish History, more Jewish literature, a more theoretical educational system than is being realized in the Montefiore Talmud Torah or in similar institutions.</p>
   <p>In Europe one can be a conscientious Jew without being a scholar, for, even if one's Jewish mind and intellect are not highly developed, one's Jewish instinct, Jewish heart and Jewish sentiments are developed and alert. But in this country, if a Jew knows little about Judaism, he is practically no longer a Jew, since the great and mighty American civilization, as well as a tumultous <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>life, dulls his Jewish instincts and his Jewish sentiments. And what sort of Jew can one be without a developed Jewish intellect and emotions?</p>
   <p>In America the education of the Jews must be placed on a new and modern basis, if it is to be productive at all and so that the majority of the students of our educational institutions may remain Jews, loyal to their God and to their people.</p>
   <p>Just as the former Hebrew Theological Seminary, an old-fashioned theological seminary, has developed into a modern institution--the Hebrew Theological College, where certain order and system has been introduced in teaching--so must the old-fashioned Talmud Torah be transformed into modern Hebrew schools. Only then will our educational work be productive. The aim of the Jewish educational institutions in America must be, above all, to bring up a generation of Jews. If the generation will be a Jewish one, there will be found Jewish scholars in it. But if the generation will grow up indifferent, a few scholars will then be of little consequence.</p>
