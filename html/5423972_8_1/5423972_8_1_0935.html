   <p>Members of representative Jewish organizations honored the memory of Dr. Theodore Herzl by holding a banquet. The banquet, where nearly two hundred were present, served to be the starting point of a national movement whose aim is to unite the American-Hungarian Jews.</p>
   <p>The banquet was held in the auditorium of the Dr. Herzl Hall. The participants were enthusiastic and interested to the end.</p>
   <p>Louis Gottlieb, attorney, outlined the purpose of the evening. He introduced Mr. Ackerman, the chairman of the committee, and Mr. Spitzer, master of ceremonies for the evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. Spitzer, after concluding his introductory speech, asked Dr. Phillip <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Langh, rabbi, to speak. Dr. Langh spoke of the great Jewish individuals, who were principally from Russia, Germany and Hungary. He explained why the founder of Zionism had to be a Hungarian Jew.....Next, the editor of the Chicago Chronicle, Mr. Matjes, showed slides of the more important events in Dr. Herzl's life. He also pointed out the injustice of reducing the Jews to second-class Hungarian citizens and said that this is one of the many reasons why the Jews should unite. Mr. Zoltan Weissburg asked the audience to think seriously about the organization. Mr. Kaufman, who knew Dr. Herzl personally, told of his experiences at the first Zionist Congress.....</p>
   <p>The chairman announced that organization in other cities is under way, and as soon as possible a national convention will be called.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew religious songs during the banquet were sung by Dr. Langh and Rev. Newman.</p>
