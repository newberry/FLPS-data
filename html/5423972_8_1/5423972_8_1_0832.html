   <p>It is not the task of the Daily World to call the attention of the Courier to the numerous mistakes it makes daily. Yet today's error about Congressman [Adolph J.] Sabath concerns every citizen of Chicago. We, therefore, want to remind the Courier that it is not true that Congressman Sabath proposed a bill in which he included the Jews as one of the smaller nationalities. Congressman Sabath did not mention the Jews in his original bill because he does not believe that the Jews are a separate nationality. He believes that they are Poles in Warsaw, Russians in Kiev, Rumanians in Jassy, etc.</p>
   <p>The Jewish newspapers, with the exception of the Courier, condemned Congressman Sabath for his hypocritical politics. Another congressman amended the bill so that it included the Jews as a nationality. The Courier is greatly mistaken by crediting the new bill to Congressman Sabath because he still believes in the old, assimilationist viewpoint that there is no Jewish nation.</p>
