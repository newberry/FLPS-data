   <p>At a meeting of the Women's Party of Cook County, held in the Hotel La Salle, a resolution was passed against the fact that Jewish employees in public service are permitted to take time off with pay on their holidays. The resolution states that this is a special privilege to Jewish employees. It takes a stand against the decision of the Board of Education which permits Jewish teachers full days on their holidays, with pay.</p>
