   <p>Ten thousand halutzim entered Palestine last year. Hundreds of thousands of other halutzim stand at the gates of Palestine, seeking admission. They implore us, American Jews, because we hold the golden key to Palestine.</p>
   <p>If we give them this golden key, swamps will be drained, forests cleared, highways constructed, wilderness transformed into fruitful land, and where formerly there were ruins, palaces will stand. For thousands of years our hands have been paralyzed. We were unable to build. We were not permitted to build, but in us has always lived the will to build--a will which has been expressed in fervent prayer and in soul-stirring hope. The energy to build, which has been stored up in us for many generations, must now find an outlet. We must build our land because the bitter need in the Diaspora is driving us to Palestine. An active and strong-willed people must either build or perish.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Now we can build, now we have the opportunity to build, and now we are forced to build; all the young and healthy constructive forces of our people are being driven to Palestine. For the first time since our land was destroyed, we again have the opportunity and the driving need to build.</p>
   <p>If our people have not followed the path of idle speculation, if our national hopes and endeavors have not been the fancies of an infirm people, but rather the sound expression of a people who are strong, and convinced of their future--then we must gird our loins and work for the rebuilding of Palestine, and we must give to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] most generously.</p>
   <p>Palestine is not our reward. [To regain] the land of our forefathers is not a capricious whim but is rather our final objective; the first and last goal in the life of the Jewish people. God Himself promised us that wonderful land with its air which sustains body and soul--a land in which a holiday spirit always <span class="page-break">3</span>prevails, and whose heaven is invariably blue; a land which is so beautiful, so magnificent that God Himself loves it.....The great Master of the Universe loves the most beautiful masterpiece that he ever created.</p>
   <p>God made the covenant that Palestine shall belong to the People of Israel. Is it your intention to go against the will of God? Do you wish to hinder the rebuilding of that land by standing aloof, and by not participating in the constructive work, in Keren Hayesod work? What is the name of the person who wishes to raise his voice against the covenant of the Almighty?</p>
   <p>He [God] promised us Palestine. He promised our ancestors that that land would be ours, and sustained by the might of this assurance and the power of this divine oath, we have endured the oceans of blood and tears; if we now fail to do our duty, what will become of God's oath, of God's promise?</p>
   <p>Every Jew who stands aloof today and does not help carry out the divine plan of <span class="page-break">4</span>Jewish history is walking the path of exile and bondage instead of the path of liberation; he is repudiating the sacrifices of the Jewish martyrs because unless Palestine becomes the final goal of Jewish history, oceans of Jewish blood have been spilled in vain, and fifty generations of Jewish martyrs have suddenly become fifty generations of simpletons and madmen. Then why did they suffer? Was it so that their descendants could come to America and forget about everything? Can't you see that this was not the ideal that inspired them to go through fire and water for their Judaism--that the only ideal that gave them the endurance to endure suffering, was the hope of liberation?</p>
   <p>A stream of halutzim is now en route to Palestine. They will enter if we do our duty, if we give them tools with which to work and tents in which to sleep, if we give them the essentials with which to begin life anew.</p>
   <p>The path is open and it is up to us to determine whether it shall be a path strewn with thorns or with roses. Which path do you wish to take? Do you <span class="page-break">5</span>want to help build Palestine? Do you want to contribute generously to the Keren Hayesod? Let your Jewish conscience and your Jewish pride be your guide and counsellor.</p>
