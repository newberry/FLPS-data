   <p>This is the month of Elul. Our cantors, singers, sextons, Shofar blowers, Torah readers, and others who make a living from the public, are becoming busy. There are many Jews in New York and Chicago who are in the "religious" business. The season for this business is now--the eve of Rosh Hashanah. The business consists of renting a hall, ordering a sign with the following words printed in big red letters: "Participate in Prayer and Song"; making a deal with a cantor, Shofar blower, and Torah reader, and selling tickets--as if the whole thing were a sort of vaudeville act.</p>
   <p>There are Jews who do not enter a synagogue during a whole year because they are afraid that it will cost them something. They think that by buying tickets for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur, they are discharging all their obligations to Judaism. Sometimes they buy tickets at the box office a minute before the praying begins. Nobody lifts a finger to make an end to this farce, which is the greatest profanation of the Holy Name that one can imagine. If a Jew feels the need of attending religious services only on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur, he ought at least to become a member of a synagogue. He should not be permitted to neglect his Jewish duties.</p>
