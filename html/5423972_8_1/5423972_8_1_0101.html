   <p>We must not forget, although we are in the midst of a Purim celebration, that there is arising now among the American Jewry an element which in the course of time may become a danger to us and which already is causing us much shame. I refer to the great number of Jews in the underworld. They arrested here, a few days ago, five gangsters who came from Philadelphia to Chicago to do their criminal work. Three of the five were Jews. Not a single day passes by during which some Jewish criminal is not arrested. Something must be rotten within the American Jewry, if such a phenomenon is possible. Let our leaders, instead of quarreling about petty affairs, appoint a committee to investigate the causes for such shameful conditions. When the causes are known, it will be possible to remove them.</p>
