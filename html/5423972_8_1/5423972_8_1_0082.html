   <p>The Chicago Tribune, "the worlds greatest newspaper," in seeking to defend one of its employes who was accused of an "attempt to kill" in the Saturday evening gun battle and held on $25,000 bond, assails the Courier for treating the news of this tragic event in a light manner, which the Tribune thinks is wrong.</p>
   <p>According to the Tribune's editorial writer, the Courier "rushed to the defense of the gamblers in the Maxwell street region" because our reporter declared that the Tribune sought to take a flashlight picture of Frank Larman's restaurant and pool room for the purpose of showing the world how Jews gamble on the West Side, and because the Courier reporter called the <span class="page-break">2</span>spot an imaginary gambling place where the stakes are, but a nickel glass of tea instead of hundreds of dollars as in the aristocratic clubs which the Tribune overlooks because in the latter can be found their own people while in the former there are only green Jews.</p>
   <p>We hereby wish to inform the Tribune that, though the Courier is no more than the largest newspaper of the Chicago Jewish world, whatever may concern opposition to gambling and support of decency on the West Side, will find the Courier, first in the fight, doing whatever is possible to teach the immigrant Jewish citizen, the highest type of citizen in the country, to be useful as a man, a Jew, and a citizen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We can pardon the Tribune for its erroneous translation of the Courier writer's statement " a sham gambling house" as "a corrupt gambling den." We excuse it because we know we are right in this matter. We, in the office of the Courier, understand the language in which the Tribune is written, and in the office of the Tribune they must rely upon some lad whenever they want to know what the Courier writes.</p>
   <p>We also pardon the Tribune for making the remark that " from the enormous profit of this trade, (gambling), corruption funds for publications can be easily spared." We accept these polluted remarks with a smile, as Jews for the past 2000 years, have been accustomed to infamy from every ignorant person who accuses us of using Christian blood for ritual purposes, and of being the main white-slave traders in the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>We cannot, however, forgive the Tribune for not taking the following into consideration:</p>
   <p>The Russian-Jewish community on the West Side of Chicago is thirty years old. Persecuted and driven from our native country we came "to the land of the Free and the Home of the Brave," to find a resting place for our weary, beaten, anguished limbs. Dwelling in a country (before coming to America) where for many generations corruption has been rampant, where licentiousness is considered a good characteristic, where drunkenness is the accepted tradition,we did not become become corrupt, our family life is clean, and we know nothing about drunkenness.</p>
   <p>We came to Chicago. Can anyone accuse us of becoming a burden upon society? Haven't we, ourselves provided for our aged and feeble, for our sick and impoverished, paying taxes to the county as does any other citizen?</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The number of Russian Jews depending upon the county relief agency can be counted on the fingers. In the thirty years that we have been in Chicago we have built our own charity temples. We have public institutions to care for the orphans, to educate our children, to heal our sick, to furnish our poor with the necessaries of life, to shelter and clothe our aged, to provide interment to those unable to pay.</p>
   <p>Thus we do our duty as men, as citizens coming from a land where there was no conception of citizenship, and where the Jew did not even have the so-called right of living. Yet our ancient greatness, as free citizens in our own democratic country, has not been obliterated. It will naturally take time before we live up to our ancient standard. The effect of thousands of years of inquisitions, and treacherous pogroms, can not change us over night. Nevertheless, we keep on marching on the path of progress.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Whenever a Jewish citizen runs for office he stands higher than his opponent, the non-Jew.</p>
   <p>For reaching this degree the Jewish community has no one to thank but its own members and its welfare leader who always received the greatest support from the Jewish Courier,</p>
   <p>And what did the great Tribune, the paper which is always seeking to rid the atmosphere of vile and corrupt politicians do to help us? Not only did it stand afar without cooperating, but actually blocked the path of progress. Being too "hifalutin" to consider our psychology, it attempted, through its columns, to place us in such light that we often wondered how low we had fallen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>We only build our houses for incendiarism, in order to collect insurance, said the Tribune. Our doctors are fakers, swindlers. Our pharmacists sell deadly poison, our lawyers are rogues, and our business people are gamblers.</p>
   <p>It is true that gambling goes on on the Jewish West Side. However, upon considering the amount of gambling in other localities we are angels. A special campaign against gambling, with flashlights and guns, is not necessary in the Jewish district. Gambling and indecency is being suppressed on the West Side through the tireless efforts of the Daily Jewish Courier through the activities of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, the Maxwell Street Settlement, the social clubs, the Joseph Medill School, and through other such organizations which are filling up the Jewish district so rapidly that soon there will be no room for these pool rooms and night restaurants.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>If the Tribune wishes to extend a helping hand in this good work, let it send out men, without guns, to help in this good work. Let the Tribune take pictures of the accomplishments of the Personal Service Bureau, the Federated Jewish Orthodox Charities and of all other institutions where children are taught to be good citizens, good men, and good Jews.</p>
