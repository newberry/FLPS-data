   <p>There was a big celebration last night at the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue but a still bigger one will take place there this evening. The Zionists of the Lawndale district, those who are really interested in the building up of Palestine, will gather there this evening for a "dress rehearsal" of the Keren Hayesod drive. The leaders of the Keren Hayesod and of the [World] Zionist Organization will all come to this "dress rehearsal," will inspect their army, and see how far it is capable of leading successfully the Keren Hayesod drive. Every visitor of tonight's celebration will not only listen to speeches and hear the beautiful singing of Cantor Giblichman but will also receive a souvenir, the most beautiful souvenir that a Jew can get and which cannot be bought for any money. Do not forget to come this evening at eight o'clock to the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue to hear what is going on in the great Jewish world and to receive your souvenir--the most <span class="page-break">\2</span>beautiful present that one can imagine. You all want to work for the Keren Hayesod and you deserve the most beautiful present which you will receive this evening at the meeting. Come on time.</p>
