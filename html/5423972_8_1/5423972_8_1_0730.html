   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>I have the honor of submitting to you the following report of the West Side Religious School.</p>
   <p>The year now closing has seen the West Side Religious School leave the hospitable roof of the Jewish Training School. It was felt that in a building farther west, the enrollment and consequent value of the school would be much increased. The old neighborhood had greatly changed.</p>
   <p>In selecting a new location for the Religious school, it seemed to choose a center near Ashland and 12th Street, when within the radius <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of a mile in the Marquette, Cregier, Gladstone, Irving and Clark Schools, there were known to be thousands of Jewish children.</p>
   <p>Through the kind co-operation of the Sinai School Committee the use of the beautiful new Administration Building (of the Associated Jewish Charities) on Wood and Sildon Streets was obtained.</p>
