   <p>Thousands of men, women, and children, during the past four days, have visited the health exhibit which opened last Monday on West Park #2, corner Jefferson Street and 14th Place.</p>
   <p>Right at the entrance you will find a department for women and young girls. In that department you have the opportunity of witnessing and of receiving the proper instructions and latest methods in diapering the baby, also how to feed the infant, and how to take care of the milk which makes up the diet during the child's infancy. The women also are told of the Chicago's infant mortality rate which is 6,800 annually and which can easily be reduced to 3,500.</p>

   <p>In some of the other departments you can see many interesting things, such as many female attendants with red badges, who act as guides offering to show the visiting public around. Most of these guides speak the Yiddish language in explaining the good of this health project.</p>
