   <p>A representative of the World succeeded yesterday in unveiling a horrible conspiracy by the local Jewish baker bosses, under the name, "Jewish Master Bakers Association," in order to extort more money from the poor working families by raising the prices on bread and filling themselves with immense profits by doing so.</p>
   <p>This trust apparently carries on criminal activities with the aid of hired gangsters, who terrorize all bakery bosses that refuse to become members of the above mentioned association and become partners in the conspiracy to rob the public by raising the price of bread.</p>
   <p>Beating, massacreing, plotting, setting fire and saturating bread with kerosene these are the methods of the trust against the owners of bakeries, who do not belong to that gang.</p>

   <p>However, the trust does not consider anything and their hired sluggers parade openly, terrorizing the entire Jewish quarter.</p>
   <p>THE HORRIBLE WORK OF THE GANG</p>
   <p>Sam Kazlosky, 2211 Potomac Avenue, is one of the many victims of that gang. Mr. Kazlosky told a representative of The World, in the presence of his wife, that he stepped out of the association, last July, because they planned to raise the prices on bread and rolls, to which he did not agree and since then a systematic inquisition was begun against him and his bakery.</p>
   <p>First of all his dough was saturated with kerosene, which was done when he was not present in the bakery. (That was on the first of July). Then two police suddenly came in and in the name of the Health Department, ordered him to close the bakery at once, due to the unsanitary order there. Mrs. Kazlowsky ran to the police station and pleaded for permission to bake the dough that was already prepared, nevertheless, this was refused and $30.00 worth of material was wasted.</p>

   <p>A few weeks later, walking across Leavitt Street with bread for a nearby grocery, Mr. Kazlowsky was suddenly attacked by a few unknown gangsters, who murderously beaten him and escaped. Afterwards on the eve of Atonement, when the Kazlowsky's were in the synagogue, they burned his bakery.</p>
   <p>SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION THREATENED</p>
   <p>After each sudden attack, a few weeks would go by, and then Mr. Blumenthal, secretary of the association, showed up and insisted that Mr. Kazlowsky must become one of their coherts. The gang had threatened him that it would become worse, and it was so.</p>
   <p>"I fear so much for the life of my husband," said Mrs. Kazlowsky, "that I already think in terms of surrendering and influencing him to become a member of the association, that they should not attempt further attacks and such murderous beatings."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The woman also mentioned the fact that she already applied for police protection and did not get it, and that the states attorney office, whom she informed of all murderous acts of the trust, ignores everything.</p>
   <p>WE ACCEPT METHODS, WARNS THE PRESIDENT.</p>
   <p>Kazlowsky, evidently, is not the only bakery owner who is being terrorized by the gangster trust. Mr. Sam Cutler, who together with A be Gross, owns the Independent Bakery at 3822 W. 12th Street, yesterday revealed, that in the course of the past few months since he stepped out of the association, because they determined to raise the price on 18¢ breads to 20¢ and from 14¢ to 15¢, he was always being persecuted by the trust. Mr. Cutler said that the bosses, Phillip Lazar, Watkowsky, Jacobs, Paul Mossberg and Sam Caplan are constantly threatening him, if he doesn't become a member of the association. And Lazar, who is the president of the association, openly warned him, that if he does not stick to that gang and sell bread according to his prices, "We shall adopt methods to do the same to you as with others," which was a warning of the inquisitions carried on against Kazlowsky.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Mr. Cutler also remarked that the warnings of the association to open a branch bakery in his district in order to drive him out of business are carried through today and a few days ago, the gang actually sold, to a few of his customers, 20¢ loaves of bread at 10¢, aiming in such manner, to get rid of him.</p>
   <p>"The baker bosses have made too much money this year," said Cutler, "and now they do not wish to part with their gigantic profits. Nevertheless, I will not fear their threats and continue to sell the two and one-half pound breads at 16¢, instead of 20¢ as they wish; the two pound breads at 13¢ in stead of 15¢; the one pound breads at 8¢, instead of 10¢."</p>
   <p>How many more Jewish bakery owners are being terrorized by the gang is not known at present, however, as it seems the two above mentioned are only a part of the victims of the trust.</p>
