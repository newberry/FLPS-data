   <p>It is with gratification that we can record the fact that Rash Hashana has been served in all sections of our City. Notable is it also that many Isrealitish sojourners have come to Chicago to celebrate the New Year. Nearly all our places of worship realized handsome encouragement in Pew rents and by reason of the beginning of the holiday on a Sunday evening with a delightful day caused the Temples and synagogues to be filled to repletion. Quite a number of private minyans ( religious quorums ) were held throughout the city, most of whom adhere to the strict Orthodox ritual. At the Sinai Temple Rev. E. G. Hirsch, late of Louisville, officiated delivering English and German Sermons, to which we may refer in our next issue.</p>
