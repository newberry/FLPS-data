   <p>The Midwester Convention of Rabbis of the United Synagogues of America, held in Chicago adopted a resolution yesterday, against the proposed law to register strangers.</p>
   <p>The resolution condemns that proposed law because it is against the American spirit of freedom. A second resolution adopted was against establishing religious education in the schools. "In accord with the American traditions we reaffirm the statement forbidding any religious teachings in the children's schools."</p>
   <p>Samuel M. Kohen, national director of the synagogues, declared that celebration for Christmas in the schools is an insult for the Jews in America.</p>
   
   <p>If religion is to be prohibited, then all Christian symbols must be abolished from the public schools, but the tendency is to Christianize everything in America from the schools up to the government.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kohen warned the Jews, that if they will not organize to combat this, the observance of Christmas would be amended to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
