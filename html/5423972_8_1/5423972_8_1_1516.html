   <p>Passover Thoughts.</p>
   <p>Passover is surely one of our greatest and noblest holidays. Our Jewish community is in a complete state of hustle and bustle. Our Jewish housewives seem to work endlessly, cleaning, scrubbing, washing, throwing out unnecessary things, buying new things, packing away dishes, unpacking dishes reserved only for Passover use, buying new clothes, new utensils, new necessities; buying Passover foods, drinks, supplementing household needs, buying, buying, and cleaning. Every corner must sparkle, the furniture must glisten, the spirit of the holiday must prevail. The spirit of happiness must prevail.</p>
   <p>I too should be happy, but I am not. I can't be. My thoughts lead me onward through this maze of activity. I realize that no matter what we do we are still in the Diasporah, the Galuth. I could be happy, but my memory has robbed me of this happiness. I remember that we are not upon our own land. We are in the Diasporah. No! we are not slaves to Egypt, but we are slaves to the Diasporah. How can we celebrate our emancipation from Egypt when we are not yet emancipated?</p>

   <p>How can we say we are free when we are in Galuth? Until such a time as we will again be in our own homeland, I will continue to hear that impoverished ringing in my ear, "Le Shovo Ha-ba Le-Jerusalem," May our next meeting take place in Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>And that is why I feel lonesome. I long for the true Passover, for the true freedom.</p>
