   <p>A report of this activity could hardly be complete without at least a brief historical sketch. In the old building, which burnt down about three years ago, there was a beautiful Synagogue. A permanent Rabbi was engaged in addition to a cantor, with a trained choir to conduct the services on Fridays at 8:00 o'clock and on Saturday mornings. The sermon was delivered in English. The attendance, we are informed, was good. After the building burned down a few years ago this activity was moved to the dance hall in our present building, the evening 8 o'clock service was changed to a service at sunset, in accordance with the orthodox custom, and the sermon was eliminated. Services were held on Saturday morning with a sermon in Yiddish. There was a cantor but no choir either on Friday or on Saturday.</p>
   <p>The audience on Friday evening was hardly enough to make up the number required, according to the orthodox rules, to recite a prayer in unison. On Saturday mornings it was somewhat larger. It was composed of people very few of whom could understand an English sermon and who, therefore, could have satisfied their religious cravings in any of the Synagogues in the vicinity of the Institute. This was the condition of the Synagogue when we assumed charge of affairs at the Institute a little over two years ago.</p>
   <p>The question that we at once put to ourselves was what justification there was for the Institute to spend a considerable sum of money to do the work that is being done (and probably done better, since we have not the physical facilities necessary), by the many synagogues in the vicinity. We seriously objected to conducting a service of the order described, especially since even this element did not respond to it, and evidently preferred to attend services in a regular Synagogue. The result was that, just about a year ago a few of the board members, who were particularly interested in this activity, organized, at our suggestion, a separate congregation.</p>
   <p>The failure of this enterprise was overwhelming, with the result that Rabbi Levine resigned and the enterprise was given up. We had hoped that the experience gained up to that period would have been sufficient to convince anyone that there is no demand for such work at the Institute unless, and even that is doubtful, it be for the purpose of reaching a younger and Americanized element for whom the orthodox Synagogue does not care. However, certain members of the board insisted, against our recommendation to the contrary, that services be continued on Friday evening with the various Rabbis of the city to address the audience and with a cantor assisted by a chorus of young boys and girls.</p>
   
   <p>The services were started. Before very long the boys of the choir went on a strike and quit, the girls dropped out one by one and only very few were left. The audience was composed both of adults and children, the former being for the most part of the immigrant element and hardly in a position to understand a sermon in English, the latter certainly not able to follow a Hebrew service and a sermon in English intended for adults. The attendance, naturally was decreasing constantly, despite the steady and insistent advertising of these services.</p>
   <p>Recently another attempt was made to organize a congregation. This was done right after the services, which were held during the Holidays and, as we expected, not a single person was able to express his opinion about the enterprise in English. The result of this enterprise we can easily imagine. Religion in the ordinary and narrow meaning of the word should be, in our opinion, left to the Rabbis and the Synagogue. If social, educational and civic centres are expected to meddle with religion then, indeed, Rabbis and not sociologists or educators in general should be looked for as heads of.</p>
   <p>We dare say that if a group of Jewish people would appeal to Hull House for accommodations to hold services it would be granted to them. Would that make Hull House a Jewish institution? The fact that Jewish services are held at Protestant or Catholic churches does not make those churches Jewish. It is the predominating spirit that counts. It is very sad indeed when an institution must have a label to denote its denominational character. If it is denominational or non-sectarian it ought to show on the face of it without necessitating any particular or special proof.</p>
   <p>Do the orthodox religious services held at the institute make our institute an orthodox institution? Would a Reform Service make it a Reform institution? Not in the least. Just as little, therefore, would the lack of a religious service, since there are so many synagogues in the vicinity make the institute less Jewish. Our task to make the institute a truly Jewish institution would be comparatively easy if our Jewishness were confined to one hour a week and to one corner of the building, even if our religious services were as successful as the average service in our synagogues. The number of people thus reached would be but very small indeed in comparison with that reached by the institute through all of its activities.</p>
   <p>However, our adult attendance, as we stated before, is very small and is of a caliber that fails to understand an English sermon and who could go to anyone of the scores of Synagogues in the neighborhood and satisfy their religious craving. The only religious service that the institute might be justified in conducting would be of a kind that would appeal to the younger American and Americanized element, not reached by the orthodox Synagogue. This means a good choir, an English and not a Hebrew service and a good English sermon. Even then, however, it would be very doubtful whether services would be a necessity since there is a Reform congregation in addition to two more conservative but modern Synagogues only a short distance from the institute, while we are compelled to hold our services in a dance hall. However, as we have mentioned above, we have found it impossible to convince some members of our community and of our board that Jewish institutions, of our institute type, need no Jewish labels. On the contrary such labels might easily become misleading and even furnish a cover for a multitude of sins and lend itself to hypocrisy. One of the principles in the work at our institute is to avoid duplication as much as possible unless there is need for it or unless we can improve upon the work done elsewhere.</p>
   <p>In the vicinity of the institute there are enough Synagogues from the very reform to the extreme orthodox with services held in houses of worship, and not in dance halls, and we repeat that it is very questionable whether we have a right to expend a considerable amount of money for the purpose of conducting another religious service, which under the present circumstances at least, cannot be as satisfactorily or as adequately done as it is in those Synagogues. At best it would mean useless and undesirable competition to the detriment of the institute and those congregations. Count was taken of attendance at a number of services which shows that 50% were children, who might have attended the special childrens service on Saturday afternoon.</p>
