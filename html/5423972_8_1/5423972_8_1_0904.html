   <p>The meeting of the newly-founded Farm in Palestine Society took place last night, at the Chicago Hebrew Institute. It was a great success. About forty members undertook to bring in an additional nine members each by the next meeting. They have also volunteered to serve as collectors for the society.</p>
   <p>The society will be divided into ten units, each unit consisting of a hundred members, which will appoint or elect its own collector. The bookkeeping system of the society is so simple that the collectors will have very little work to do. The following directors were elected for the next six months at the meeting. Aaron Heller, Israel Reizburg, B. Antanow, A. Weiner, H. Fleishman, I. Turner, Aaron Pressberg, D. Krantz, S. Hoffman, and J. Agranat.</p>
   <p>A meeting of the newly-elected directors will be held next Monday evening. Officers will then be elected for the next six months. A membership meeting will be called for May 1st. The plan of the society is now well-known and approved by the Jewish public in Chicago. It is so well liked that many unsolicited applications are being received daily from persons living in different parts of the city.</p>
