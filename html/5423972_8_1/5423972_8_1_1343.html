   <p>The Independent Order of the Western Star is a Western and especially a Chicago order. The order is worth while for the Jews in the West and the Chicago Jews especially, should take a more active interest.</p>
   <p>This order was founded on the 13th of February, 1894, with Mr. Joseph Epstein as Grand Master and Morris Eller as Grand Secretary. Mr. Wm. A. Jennese is the present Grand Master and Mr. I. Shapiro is the present Grand Secretary. Since the organization of this order, thirteen years ago, it has shown that it is a true Jewish order. The Grand and the Subordinate lodges are at any time ready with an open hand to all Jewish undertakings in Chicago. When the Society for the Aid of the Homeless appealed for help, this order very readily came across with over a thousand dollar donation, which was an amount very near as much as all other lodges in America combined.</p>
   <p>Next Saturday evening a celebration of the thirteenth anniversary of the order will take place at the Second Regiment Armory, and the Chicago Jews are expected to show their appreciation.</p>
