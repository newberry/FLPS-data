   <p>With the great war, many thoughtful minds among the Jews in America foresaw a new deal for the nations involved. It was felt that there was hope that the wrongs of the Jew, among others, might be righted at the conclusion of the war. The feeling was universal that the cause of the Jew should be represented in the peace negotiations following the war.</p>
   <p>In July, 1915, Dr. Isadore Marcus and B. J. Shapiro of Chicago, explained to J. G. Grossberg that Louis Brandeis had suggested the formation of a National Jewish Congress. The first move in the Chicago field was an organization among attorneys called The Lawyers' Jewish Congress Association. Other similar groups were formed and all were merged into the Jewish Congress Association of Chicago, which proceeded with the unification of the Jewish forces throughout the city and vicinity. A central body was thus built up which would serve as the machinery for the participation of the Middle West in the National Congress.</p>
   <p>On June 23, 1916, the first Jewish Congress Convention was held in Chicago. It was a most auspicious gathering, welding together many discordant elements of Jewry into one cohesive whole.</p>
