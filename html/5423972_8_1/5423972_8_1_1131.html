   <p>The Jewish enemies constantly cry that the Jewish immigrants are a menace to the country and they say to all the immigrants go back to Russia. A Jewish newspaper employs the very same argument when speaking about the massacre of Jews in Jaffa. In stead of demanding a punishment for the pogram inciters who have mercilessly killed innocent people as the Jewish artist, I. H. Brenner, that Jewish Newspaper demands that the immigrants go to Russia. It intentionally wrote it in English in order that the Jewish enemies may make use of it.</p>
   <p>It is under stood that this newspaper is the Jewish "Courier". In its English editorial, of yesterday, it charges the Jewish High Commissioner of Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, that he uses "too much liberalism" against the Jewish immigrants who belong to the left Poale Zion.</p>
   <p>The Courier says that the Left Poale Zion is a bolshevik agency, It figures that the number of members amount to 300. It declares that they are an "unwanted and dangerous element", affirming that most of them are not inhabitants, but new comers <span class="page-break">2</span>from Russia that cause trouble in the "Holy Land". "Sir Samuel need not tolerate the red criminals in Palestine" says the Courier. "It was his (Samuel's) duty to deport all of them from that country. He did not fulfill his obligation on account of a false interpretation of the theory of liberalism. But, now, after disaster occurred and blood was shed, we trust, that he will utilize his power in driving out the red brutes from the country. Those who come from Russia must be sent back to Russia and the others must be deported to the country from whence they come. The Jews and the Arabs of Palestines should unite to agitate the government to free the Holy Land of "red pests'".</p>
