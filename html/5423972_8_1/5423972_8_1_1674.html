   <p>During the last four years, Chicago has not been the center of Zionist activity in the Middle West; it has simply been a Zionist country town like any other country town. The district system destroyed the middle-western Zionist center in Chicago. One must admit that after four years of Zionist activity, Zionist Chicago is isolated from the [rest of the] Middle West. This isolation has not done anybody any good; it hasn't benefited Chicago Zionism nor has it done the Zionist movement in the Middle West any good.</p>
   <p>The isolation of great and influential Zionist groups--even if one believes in administrative centralization--can never do any good and must always result in some harm. It is our firm conviction that if Chicago had not been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>isolated during the last four years from the entire Middle West, but had remained a Zionist center, as it had been previously, the Zionist forces in Chicago would have been much stronger today because greater responsibility would have stimulated greater Zionist activity.</p>
   <p>Chicago Zionism lost its great momentum when Chicago was reduced to a Zionist country town. The Chicago Zionist workers, with the exception of a few veterans, began to think about Zionism in local terms; they became, so to speak, "countrified" Zionists. Zionism naturally suffered, and the central Zionist administration in New York also suffered as a result.</p>
   <p>Let us cite one concrete example. Chicago, with a Jewish population of four hundred thousand, gave to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], from June 1921 to June 1922, the sum of one hundred and forty thousand dollars. During the same period, Milwaukee, which has a Jewish population of twenty-five thousand, gave to the Keren Hayesod the sum of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>fifty thousand dollars. The per capita contribution in Milwaukee was two dollars, whereas the per capita contribution in Chicago was thirty-five cents. However, if Chicago had been the center of all Zionist activities in the Middle West, if it had been in charge of the work in Milwaukee, the Chicago Zionists, in order to maintain their leadership, would have been obliged to give more, would have had to raise more, and, in general, would have worked harder. The Chicago Zionists, as an isolated local group, did not have any stimulus or incentive to apply themselves more strenously to the work in hand.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Zionist workers have now realized the error of having their work bear a purely local character. They have now realized that the isolation of Chicago has done Zionism a great deal of harm. The Chicago Zionists, as loyal followers of the organization, do not want to, and will not provoke any dissension within the organization, nor will they strive to eliminate the district system officially. They will, however, try to put the Zionist <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>work in Chicago upon such a basis that it will be more than local in character, in its greater momentum.</p>
   <p>Today's Zionist convention is the first step in that direction. No local Zionist convention has taken place in Chicago during the last four years; there have only been annual meetings of the central committee, which consists of representatives of the four Zionist districts.</p>
   <p>Today's Zionist convention has much broader character. It is, and it should be, much more than an annual meeting of the representatives of the local Zionist districts. Today's Zionist convention consists of representatives from the districts, from Zionist clubs and societies, of representatives from the National Fund and the Keren Hayesod, and of representatives from the synagogues. If the people who lead the convention are far-sighted, they will try to make this convention a permanent institution, and, in the course of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>time, to develop, build up, and broaden it in such a way that it will become a convention of all the Zionists of the whole Middle West. This can be done without destroying officially the district system and without any dissension in the Zionist organization.</p>
   <p>The convention will be successful only if it does not become too technical or too business-like. The convention should raise the morale of the Chicago Zionists; it should give them an incentive and a stimulus for further Zionist work. All the technical work which has to be done by the convention--such as rendering reports, adopting resolutions, adopting better organizational plans, electing new officers--should be done with a new spirit--the spirit of encouragement and not of petty politics. The Chicago Zionist convention will then become a power in American Zionism.</p>
