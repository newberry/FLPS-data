   <p>Rabbi Moses Finkel of Milwaukee Ave. donated his wonderful voice by chanting the High Holiday Services at Beth Michson Orphans Home. Everyone was very much pleased with the way he chanted, according to the old Jewish tradition, he being of the old time pious Jews.</p>
   <p>In addition to donating has voice, he also bought tickets for his children, son-in-law and brother, who also were very liberal with donations to the Orphans Home. We thank all who participated in our worshipping in the old fashioned pious way.</p>
   <p>Above all, we extend thanks to Messrs. Weinshenker and his children, Mr. Laurentz, Mr. M. Stein and others for their liberal donations. We wish everyone of you and all our Jewish brothers through out the world, success.</p>
   <p>Jacob Levy, President.</p>
