   <p>Though naturalization is our chief and main work the exigencies brought on by the events of the day have caused us to widen the scope of our work during the past fiscal year and the Department has been replete with activity and diversified pursuits.</p>
   <p>After the declaration of war on April 6, 1917, a patriotic wave spread itself over the country resulting in an increased desire on the part of many to obtain their first and second citizenship papers, with the result that we show an increased attendance and registration during that month over the attendance and registration of the previous year. These conditions were little affected by the announcement of the passage of the Selective Service Act, and the same continued until shortly before the day of registration, June 5th.</p>
   <p>The week before registration found the bureau swamped with inquiries relative to the age question. A great many had no certain knowledge of <span class="page-break">2</span>their age and were confused and hampered in their efforts of determining same by conflicting statements appearing in their marriage licenses, insurance policies, school certificates, and ship records. Their trouble apparently came from the fact that many of them never know their correct birthday, and each time they were asked to state their age, they took a different guess. Consequently hundreds were induced to register who were really over the required age. The plan adopted in handling the various perplexing problems involved was to advise registration with the further suggestion that the proof of their contention be presented to the authorities when they were called in the draft.</p>
   <p>The next problem was in aiding the hundreds who came for assistance in making out claims for exemption after the first call was made for drafted men. Assistance in filling out the claims and the service of a notary public were given free of charge. Our opportunity to be of service was limited only by our capacity to handle the hundreds that came. The districts from which most of the men came were from the immediate neighborhood<span class="page-break">3</span> and the west and northwest parts of the city. But we also had numerous persons who came from distant north and south parts. A good opportunity to make observations of the life of the Jewish Young men between the ages of 21 and 31 presented itself. We noted in particular, that most of them married young and that about 30 percent had no citizenship papers, 10 percent were citizens, and about 60 percent made their declaration.</p>
