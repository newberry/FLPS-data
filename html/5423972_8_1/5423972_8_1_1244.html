   <p>Upon the initiative of Judge Harry M. Fisher, the first step was taken last evening to unite all local lodges in a central body for Jewish activities and welfare work. By the realization of this plan, it will be possible at any time to do much good work when united action is necessary. As the situation was until now, the general public suffered from the lack of such a central body. When united action became necessary, meetings first had to be called to elect a committee, and the energy was almost expended on this alone; consequently, when something had to be done it was either too late or the committee was exhausted. Under the new plan, however, it will be quite different. The central body of all the lodges will be a permanent one and will be ready at all times to undertake whatever work is to be done for the Jewish public welfare.</p>
   <p>Representatives of all fraternal orders were present at the meeting last evening, and after Judge Fisher outlined the plan to establish the central <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>body the following committee was elected to draw up a program for the realization of the plan: Dr. George Sultan of 'Independent Order Bnai Abraham'; Charles Banus of 'Order Brith Abraham'; I. Shapiro and William A. Genessey of 'Western Star'; Isador Liederman of the 'Knights of Joseph'; Jacob Goldberg and Harry Wolf of 'Progressive Order of the West' and Harry Jacobson of 'Captain Dreyfus Order'. A meeting of the presidents of all the lodges will be held on June 30, when the committee will deliver its report. Then a central body for Jewish activities only will actually be established.</p>
