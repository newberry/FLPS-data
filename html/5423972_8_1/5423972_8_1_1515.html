   <p>We wish to call the attention of all the Jewish people. When you go to the synagogues tonight and tomorrow to ask God for a happy and prosperous New Year, bear in mind, those who have as much as given up the hopes of even asking for anything good for themselves. Those are the unfortunate who depend on you, to give them whatever is left on your table, to satisfy their hunger.</p>
   <p>When asking for yourselves, think of those who have to beg as long as they live; remember our charitable institutions; open your hearts and help them like brothers, let us represent ourselves as rich wealthy men should represent themselves.</p>
