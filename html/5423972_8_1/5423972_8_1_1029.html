   <p>The Zionist movement grows, assumes form, content, and determination in its strides through the struggle that now ensues between the old vision of the ideal and the real factors of life. It is merging out of the burning controversy, the clash of ideas, its day-by-day encounter with fact, cleansed of its dross, freed and more flexible, stronger in its understanding of the enduring virtues required for success. It is giving new values to the old standards, and recasting them in a new mold.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Homeland is not to be merely a brick or a stone or concrete. It is not to be a perfect business institution, with the latest devices for a correct system of accountancy that shall show accurately, in periodical statements, the profit and loss entailed. It is not to be a mold to fit the personality of the Jewish people and the character of Palestine. We are assembling the living, creative tissues of a renascent Jewish people, that is to be placed upon its human feet in a material Palestine.</p>
   <p>It is inevitable that the creation should proceed with difficulty, with the creaking of parts, with an imperfect co-ordination, and that the various organs, unused to common action, should rebel, resist, and only under the pressure of the ideal, approximate counsels of perfection. It is inevitable that in the welding together of parts, as the tissues adjust themselves, as the organs find freedom for the exercise of their functions, as the blood of life begins to circulate automatically, there should be a wrenching, a tearing, collision, and conflict, preceding the harmony that is thus being created. Through struggle we reach adjustment and then perfection of expression.</p>
   <p>We have a double problem, and in each there are the same inherent difficulties--in the Golus [Diaspora] and in Palestine. See what we have done in the Golus. Take an inventory of Zionist achievement. There are well-trodden paths, new channels, well-used conduits and receiving forms, through which and into which Jewish life has poured sacrifices for over twenty-five years. We have organized and developed that large army of Zionist workers in the Golus, steadfast, often petulant, sullen, willing, and self-sacrificing, individualistic, the plodders, the carriers of the ideal, the ever-to-be relied upon to push forward in time of danger, to defend an assailed position; workers who had never seen the land, who sensed it only vaguely, and who were over critical even of the people that were to be saved.</p>
   <p>It was that army that liberated forces in Jewish life for a new creation. What had we learned in the wanderings of the Golus? The ability and power to endure through hardship and persecution and privation, the ability to preserve the semblance of a Jewish personality in spite of humiliation and indignities, but at no time were we able to step out into the sun and engage in the difficult task of creating a new life, free and untrammeled by fears. It was the Zionist Organization that summoned the people to creative expression, that gave the color and sanctity of martyrdom to labor and active sacrifice. It is to that army we owe the great mass of Jewish historic fact which today, facing the obligations of the Palestine mandate, we assemble under the name of the Zionist Movement. It cannot be classified. It cannot be made into a perfect picture. It represents a variety of efforts at various times. It stands for different moods, compromises, adjustments. They seem to be distinct and separate, and then they intermingle, and it is hard to tell them apart.</p>
   <p>Out of a Golus this was the best that could be produced. It is with this we proceed to the great task.</p>
   <p>It is thought that Palestine is a simple proposition. We count the number of Arabs; we count the number of Jews; and a mathematical formula is presented. But even the bare rocks of Palestine have been marked by the processes of life. We have yet to learn the trade routes with which to cross Palestine. We have to find the place of Palestine in the economics of the world, how and what is to be produced under the Palestine skies, what are to be the labor conditions and the tempo of the work. The plans made in California do not apply to Palestine. There has been a settlement left in Palestine of all the peoples that used or abused it. Every operation will have to be tested, not by the planning of outsiders, but through the direct personal experience of him who is to create the new life there. The soil and the people and their traditions and habits stand as a wall against the invasion of methods and ideas that do not fit into the kind of life that Palestine requires in order to reveal itself in all its strength. That is why from the day of the Biluists to the day of Nouris, the determining word has been spoken not by the experts on the outside, not by the counsellors of perfection, but by Palestine itself. It is as if Palestine has a personality which makes the character of its own future. It seems determined that it shall not be a mechanical reproduction of models plagiarized from the Golus, but that it shall be in reality the creation of the natural Jewish genius, stripped of its Golus attributes, finding itself in struggle with the land, whose affections must be acquired through understanding and appreciation of its historic character.</p>
   <p>It is with these problems the Zionist Organization now contends. The Zionist Organization opens up a way for a joining of effort, without prejudice, without recrimination, for all who see the Palestine lights beckoning. Let each do his part according to his ideals. Let each come forward to make Palestine reflect the dream which is in his own heart.</p>
   
   <p>The struggles of the past are not over. New factors intrude. New problems arise. The struggle in itself is a splendid exhibition of the vitality of the Jewish people, for in spite of the struggle we move forward from strength to strength, from confusion to clearness, from conflict to harmony. Believing in the enduring power of the Jewish people, we are confident that all difficulties will be overcome and that we shall prove ourselves as capable of dealing with reality as we have been in dealing with the conflict of forms and ideals.</p>
