   <p>The synagogue presidents of all Chicago synagogues will gather on Wednesday evening at a banquet in honor of Rabbi Dub-Ber Abramowich of Palestine. The banquet will be given at the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue. Every synagogue president and rabbi in Chicago, at this banquet, will become, first of all, acquainted with the conditions in Palestine from the point of view of a wise old rabbi who knows the land and knows the people, and then the work of organizing the synagogues for the Keren Hayesod Campaign will begin. I know that nearly all synagogues of the West and Northwest Sides will be represented at the banquet, but what about the synagogues of the North and South Sides? What about Rabbi Mushkin's synagogue, the biggest synagogue on the South Side? Why should not the B'nai Abraham Synagogue, in which Mr. Mushkin, Rabbi Mushkin's brother, is the big shot, be represented at the banquet? The small synagogues in all parts of the city, and they are very <span class="page-break">2</span>numerous, should not fail to send representatives on Wednesday evening to the first Orthodox Keren Hayesod banquet in this year's campaign.</p>
   <p>Remember, then, to come on time, not later than six o'clock.</p>
