   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span>of Zionist, and Mr. Isadore <span class="gap">[gap]</span>atkin in a brief talk appealed in behalf of the Hadasah.</p>
   <p>The meeting concluded under the tunes of "<span class="gap">[gap]</span>atihyah," and America."</p>
   <p>The resolution reads:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, reports were received from official sources that various governments are prone to concede official recognition to the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ation in Palestine, and that such recognition will probably be given to Jews with the full approval and assistance of the United States; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the spirit of the People's Government of which the Russian revolution is an important factor, implants hope and trusts that the Allies will very willingly recognize the justice of the Zionists;</p>
   <p>Therefore, be it resolved that we Jews, at this representative meeting, declare by this resolution our firm position to the fundamental ideal of the Zionist movement, which is that the Jewish people demand the solution of the Jewish question through a guaranteed public assured and legally recognized home in Palestine.</p>
