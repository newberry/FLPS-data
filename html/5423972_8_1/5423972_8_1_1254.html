   <p>The meeting [Zionist] in Herzel School, last evening, was the most spectacular one ever witnessed by the Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>The program was carried through as announced, with the exception that Professor Foster, of the University of Chicago, substituted for Judge Cavanaugh.</p>
   <p>Mas Shulman opened the meeting with a brief introductory speech, after which he introduced Judge Hugo Palm as the first speaker.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zolotkoff followed him in Jewish with an explanation of the significance of the resolution, and the inspiration with which the great mass meeting adopted it.</p>
   <p>Professor Foster gave a brief talk which embraced the philosophical aspects <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> of Zionism, and Mr. Isadore Natkin in a brief talk appealed in behalf of the Hadasah.</p>
   <p>The meeting concluded under the tunes of "Hatikyah," and America."</p>
   <p>The resolution reads:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, reports were received from official sources that various governments are prone to concede official recognition to the Jewish Nation in Palestine, and that such recognition will probably be given to Jews with the full approval and assistance of the United States; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the spirit of the People's Government of which the Russian revolution is an important factor, implants hope and trusts that the Allies will very willingly recognize the justice of the Zionists;</p>
   <p>Therefore, be it resolved that we Jews, at this representative meeting, declare <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>by this resolution our firm position to the fundamental ideal of the Zionist movement, which is that the Jewish people demand the solution of the Jewish question through a guaranteed public assured and legally recognized home in Palestine.</p>
