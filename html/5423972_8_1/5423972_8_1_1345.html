   <p>In answer to the call issued by the trustees of the U. H. C. to the Jewish public of Chicago, a meeting was held on March 24th in the vestry room of Temple K. A. M. The purpose was to discuss the question of Jewish immigration and decentralization. In regard to the solution of this problem, negotiations had been entered into with the N. Y. Charities.</p>
   <p>The Relief Committee of the U. H. C. recommended the adoption of the New York proposal. This plan called for the establishment of a Removal Industrial Office by the Jewish community here. The express function of this office would be the removal of immigrants coming to Chicago, to smaller cities and municipalities in the West, and South, with the understanding that one-half of the immigrants thus placed come from N. Y. and the other half from Chicago. The Baron De Hirsch Fund was to defray the expenses of the entire bureau.</p>

   <p>The Jewish citizens present at the meeting unanimously adopted the recommendation and elected the following officers to lead the organization: president, Simon W. Strauss, vice-president, Leo A. Loeb, secretary, Bertram Cahn and treasurer, Oscar G. Foreman.</p>
   <p>The Removal Industrial Office of Chicago is created primarily to prevent further congestion in the already over-populated districts by removing new immigrants, as well as old residents, of over-crowded sections to smaller communities away from Chicago. All thinking men will agree that every city should share in the responsibility of giving homes to those unfortunate people.</p>
