   <p>All those who believe that there are only a few dozen Zionists in Chicago, must have been very badly disappointed last Sunday afternoon. The gymnasium of the Hebrew Institute was crowded, though the meeting was not the result of a big publicity campaign. It was arranged at the eleventh hour.</p>
   <p>I think that with proper publicity, Chicago could have had three or four meetings like that because the Jewish middle class of Chicago--the backbone of the Jewish community--is Zionist. The meeting in the Hebrew Institute was a strong Zionist demonstration by the Chicago Jews and a credit to the Chicago Zionist workers who arranged that meeting. The administration will be able to report to the next annual conference of Chicago Zionists which will take place next Sunday, that one great, successful Zionist meeting has been held in Chicago.</p>
