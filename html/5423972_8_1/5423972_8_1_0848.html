   <p>On Tuesday, the Board of Aldermen, New York the governing body of the largest city in America, adopted a resolution against the new immigration bill that has been introduced in Congress. The Chicago City Council should do the same.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably, the resolution which the New York Board of Aldermen has adopted, will create the right impression. The Congressmen and Senators in Washington will have to stop and think a little. They won't continue to rush through the anti-immigration bill. Everyone wants to be re-elected. The present administration will not seek a quarrel with New York, which has the largest number of electoral votes.</p>

   <p>The same thing can be said of Chicago. A resolution by the Chicago City Council passed now, after New York, will make a bigger impression. Even if no other city should join these two, leaving the two largest cities in America standing alone, the impression created by the passage of a resolution by both of them will be strong enough to influence a favorable modification of this anti-immigration bill.</p>
   <p>It is now almost certain that the two largest American cities will not remain alone. Boston has already adopted a resolution against the anti-immigration bill. Furthermore, the legislature of the state of Massachusetts adopted a similar resolution. The City Councils, in a number of small American cities, have already adopted similar resolutions.</p>
   <p>Chicago is a city of immigrants, just as New York is. Seventy-two per cent of Chicago's population are immigrants or the children of immigrants.</p>

   <p>They all, as well as their relatives, are vitally interested in the defeat of the anti-immigration bill. Is it possible that this preponderant majority of the population will be unable to find a way to indicate its attitude as New York has done?</p>
   <p>Chicago should follow New York's example.</p>
