   <p>The second annual Zionist convention of the Middle West opens today at 10 A. M. at the LaSalle Hotel. The indications are that the convention will accomplish great things and will arouse new Zionist energy in the Middle West. The [news of the] successful membership drive in Chicago will spread over the whole Middle West as a result of the convention which is being attended by delegates from sixty cities. Just as the drive in Chicago quadrupled the Zionist energies of the city, so a membership drive in the Middle West will increase the Zionist activities of that area. The membership drive in other cities can be successful and the convention can supply the enthusiasm necessary for the drive.</p>
   <p>The New York leaders are astonished at the latest success of the Zionist work in Chicago. They did not credit Chicago with so much energy. They know very well that Chicago will show the way for the whole Middle West. It is not sheer <span class="page-break">\2</span>boasting on our part when we say that Chicago and the Middle West can enroll as many members in three months as all other parts of the country put together. There is no reason to assume that the success of the work in Chicago must remain an isolated instance. The Zionist avalanche that is now taking place in Chicago must take place in all Jewish communities within a radius of two hundred miles from Chicago. This means that our leaders in New York will have to consider us as the biggest factor in American Zionism and they will have either to share the leadership with us or make such strenuous efforts in New York that they will become numerically stronger than Chicago and the Middle West. Should the former be the case, Chicago will become the most important center of Zionism in America. In the latter case, New York will become four times as strong as it is now, which will give American Zionism an entirely different aspect and which will cause new forces to rise to the surface.</p>
   <p>However important the convention is for Chicago, it is still more important for the Zionist development of the Middle West. Thousands of new members were enrolled during the membership drive. A great many new districts were organized, <span class="page-break">\3</span>and in each district there was organized an executive committee of men and women who are new to the work. Many of them are not acquainted with the methods of Zionist work. Others are not even acquainted with Zionist institutions. Years may pass before these new forces will gain [the necessary] knowledge and experience in these complicated and delicate affairs. We cannot wait that long. We need a group of new workers right now who are acquainted with the work and who know what must be done. They will learn more at the convention in two days than they could learn from their routine work in two years. From this standpoint, the convention is a large and splendid school for Zionist work.</p>
   <p>The Zionist movement must be put upon such a basis that it will be able to raise money for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] without resorting to official drives. The drives tire us out and take up too much of our energy. The yearly drives will become superfluous and the Keren Hayesod will have the funds necessary to go on with its work without the aid of special campaigns, when there are twenty-five thousand well-organized Zionists in the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Middle West, who know what their duty is to Palestine. The convention can lay the foundation for an organization of twenty-five thousand Zionists in the Middle West. The convention can give an impetus to the organizational work; it can create the necessary enthusiasm for the work in all middle western states, which would help the Keren Hayesod in a definite way.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted that the convention has no cultural and social program because, after all, one must remember that although it is easy to enroll new members in the organization, it is still easier to lose them if they are not involved in some phase of the work which will sustain their interest in the movement.</p>
   <p>It is not yet too late. The convention starts today and the leaders of the convention starts today and the leaders of the convention can still make good their mistake. They should take care that new members grow up with the organization and that they are given something of a spiritual and social value. We hope that the convention will be able to create the necessary means by which we will be <span class="page-break">\5</span>able to hold on to our new achievements.</p>
   <p>This is the first time that a Zionist convention of great importance to American Zionism, has been held in Chicago. [Translator's note: The last four lines of the editorial could not be translated as they are half torn and words are missing.]</p>
