   <p>Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby visited Chicago yesterday. He spoke at a number of gatherings, including the one at the Covenant Club, where a luncheon was given in his honor. He spoke in favor of the League of Nations and the candidacy of Mr. Cox.</p>
   <p>Mr. Colby stopped at the Blackstone Hotel where he received Dr. S. M. Melamed, editor of the Courier, with whom he discussed the problem of the Jews in Poland.</p>
   <p>Mr. Colby said that the State Department has forwarded several strongly worded notes to the government of Poland, protesting against the atrocities committed against the Jews of Poland, which are violations of the terms of the treaty signed by Poland with the League of Nations. So far, Poland has ignored these <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>notes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Colby pointed out that one government alone cannot enforce this treaty upon Poland, unless it is willing to declare war. In the opinion of Mr. Colby, all the nations, through the League of Nations, can compel Poland to live up to its international treaty with regard to the Jews of Poland.</p>
