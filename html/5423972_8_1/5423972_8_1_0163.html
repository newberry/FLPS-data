   <p>There are approximately 40,000 Jewish children in the Chicago public schools. About 3,000 of them attend the Talmud Torahs (schools of religious lore) during the week; another 3,000 the Sabbath Schools, and some 1,500 attend the Cheders (Hebrew schools), and private schools. In other words, giving the number in round figures, there is only a total of nearly 8,000 children studying "religion" or "Hebrew"; i.e., four fifths of our children are being reared without any conception of our people and their spiritual treasures.</p>
   <p>The result of such ignorance is known to everyone. The children despise their parents, whose conduct and ideals are foreign to them; they are breaking away from their people, whose history is closed to them; they are turning away from their religion, which is to them no more than a name; and they violate the laws of social morals, which is interwoven in all such things. Wherever <span class="page-break">\2</span>illiteracy becomes intensified among us Jews, we find that vice is also increased. Among the 350 Jewish boys who digressed from the righteous path and were admitted to the Juvenile Detention Home, I found out,after a thorough investigation, that 98 percent of them never attended a Hebrew school. And if this is no evidence, it is nevertheless a timely insinuation.</p>
   <p>This is the destiny of the forlorn four-fifths. And, what about the remaining one-fifth in whose hands we entrust our future? What is the character of the Hebrew schools where our children spend a few hours after public school? What is the character of the teachers?</p>
   <p>The teachers who make a door-to-door canvas, or who maintain private schools, are largely no more than peddlers whose "business" consists of Sidur (prayer book) and whip. Their specialty is memorizing Hebrew. Very often the student <span class="page-break">\3</span>leaves Cheder, after a period of six or seven years, with very little knowledge. The Cheders are not worthy of their names, and under no circumstances are suited as learning institutions for children. The personality of the teachers does not call for any respect and love. If the teachers do impress the pupils, it is only in the negative sense, to drive them away and create contempt for everything that is sacred and dear to us.</p>
   <p>The Local Talmud Torahs stand a bit higher than the private Cheders, because they are under the supervision of a Board of Directors. But the members of the directorate, who have no conception of pedagogy, often take authority and introduce their politics into school. They are very particular when appointing teachers. They must be Bible Scholars, even if without any Secular education or pedagogical knowledge. The courses of study do not follow any definite system, and the old system which prevails is apt to confuse the minds <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the children. The school buildings are delapidated; their walls are damp, the rooms are poorly ventilated. Yet, it is hard to say which crime is greater, the one injuring the child physically or the one injuring him mentally.</p>
   <p>The Sabbath Schools are well constructed, but they lack entirely in Jewish studies. The teachers are cultured men and women, but they have no conception of Jewish studies and Jewish history. Their misconception of Judaism can easily be detected when they say that Channukah is the Jewish Christmas. If the teachers have such a poor conception of Judaism, what can the pupils derive from them? It is, therefore, not surprising why they have progressed so slowly.</p>
   <p>There is not one Hebrew school in Chicago that can serve as a model for others in the present or in the near future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The question of teachers is more vital than the question of schools. There are no teachers among the Jews, especially among the Jews of the United States.</p>
   <p>The American-born teachers have no conception at all of Judaism; and the foreign teacher is not adapted to American conditions. The Psychology of the American child is foreign to him and, above all, he lacks pedagogical training.</p>
   <p>In New York an attempt has been made to train Hebrew teachers, and although the situation there is not up to par, nevertheless we should envy our New York brethren, because they have recruited a small army of elementary teachers whose work is being crowned with success. They have not gone beyond the beginning, but it is a good sign because every beginning encounters hardships.</p>
   <p>We, the Jewish population of Chicago, do not even have it in our minds to educate <span class="page-break">\6</span>our sons and daughters to be Hebrew teachers. The salary that the Chicago Hebrew teachers receive is not even enough to support single men (salaries range from $30 to $40), let alone family men. The result of this is that the local teachers are either young people or tradesmen, who have taken up teaching as a stepping stone to a better profession.</p>
   <p>How shall we start to improve this condition? First of all, we are in need of a modern school to serve as a model for others in our city. The place for such an institution is on the West Side, a section densely populated by Jews. The school must major in Jewish studies, not in gymnastics and prayers. A school that is restricted to praying only, is superfluous, and whatever concerns modern conveniences, such as a playground, a gym, and auditorium, should occupy a place there, but, under condition that they should stand in service of Judaism. Such a school will not need its support from the salaries it denies its teachers. From the very beginning, qualified teachers should be accepted in order to <span class="page-break">\7</span>strengthen its foundation.</p>
   <p>But there is a grave danger, which we are apt to face in undertaking this project. If the management should become aware of the fetid condition of education, they will encounter a great obstacle; viz., that there will be a shortage of qualified teachers. In this case the remedy precedes the illness, which means that we must immediately begin to train teachers.</p>
   <p>This undertaking would mean large sums of money, but if we start intelligently, we shall succeed regardless of how small the group interested in it might be. It will be sufficient for us to open a teachers college, at the beginning on a small basis. The classes there will be divided into three categories:</p>
   <p>(A. ) Class for young foreign teachers, most of them Bible scholars, to whom <span class="page-break">\8</span>secular knowledge is not completely foreign. Their desire is to make teaching their profession but because they are not adapted to domestic conditions or able to find a suitable environment for their work, their work, therefore, does not yield the desired results, and they drop teaching as soon as they can.</p>
   <p>This evil is unnecessary and it can easily be overcome. First of all, they should be confined to a separate class, where they should learn the English language and the principle dicta of pedagogy, as it is taught and practiced in America; and when they shall complete these subjects, let us help them enter a university to complete their teaching profession.</p>
   <p>(B) Young people who are Bible scholars, born or reared in this country, on becoming independent lack the Hebraic spirit and constitute torn off organs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>We must establish a clear objective for these people, and that is, that they devote their energies to a Hebrew training. A three year course is ample for young men of 15 or 16 to gain the requisite preparation for elementary teaching. The courses will embrace, in addition to the studies on Judaism, lessons in pedagogy, theory and practice.</p>
   <p>(C) A class for girls born in Chicago. The question of preparing teachers from beginners is the most difficult one to deal with. The foreign teacher is not qualified for this position, because he is deprived of the experience of childhood, and the American young people who would want to make teaching their profession are striving to be somewhat higher than elementary teachers. This matter is already being considered in England and in America, and, therefore, the female teacher was engaged in the schools in preference to the male teachers. And also, those who are devoted to Hebraic education in these countries, are convinced <span class="page-break">\10</span>that the proper thing for the elementary schools is to engage female teachers.</p>
   <p>But we confront the question, how can we get them?</p>
   <p>Among the female teachers of the secondary schools, there are many who would like to devote their teachings in general to social problems, and particularly to their people, but lack the knowledge as to how. Let us then show them how to unite the teaching profession with the efforts of their people, and that is what is meant by a Jewish education.</p>
   <p>The training of teachers from that standpoint is of threefold benefit:</p>
   <p>1. We will, in such a manner, equip a generation of Jewish mothers who will be worthy of bearing that name.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>2. A female teacher will introduce a jovial and youthful spirit in the school.</p>
   <p>3. The female teacher will aid in transforming Hebrew teaching into a respectable profession.</p>
   <p>Such a school, as here pictured, could serve as the foundation of Jewish education among us in Chicago. We could also establish a board of examiners in such a school to give out diplomas. This school would make it possible to unite the principles of other schools with foreign teachers so that they might create a mutual understanding about things concerning the teaching profession. This would bring about many improvements in our educational system. We shall probably witness, in the near future, one Board of Education for all the Chicago Talmud Torahs, for a teachers' college, and an Educational Bureau. In the meantime, let us at least see that its beginning develops. If we should succeed in establishing at least one school to serve as an example and recruit a small army of teachers, we would feel satisfied.</p>
