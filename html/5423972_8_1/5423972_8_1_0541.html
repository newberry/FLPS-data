   <p>For the past three or four years a new spirit has been seen among Chicago Jewry. The leaders of the community understand that the Chicago Jewry now occupies a certain position in the Jewish World and that it has obligations to the Jewish World, as well as to itself. They also understand that the Jewish community in Chicago is not completely built, but rather that it has just begun to build. At first glance it might appear that Chicago Jewry already has everything that a Jewish community should have: synagogues, educational institutions, various institutions for all those whom fate persecutes bitterly, an orphan asylum, a home for the incurables, infant homes, a Jewish hospital, a home for the aged, etc. The first impression made by the Jewish Orthodoxy in Chicago is very good. There is life in the community. However, if we looked more closely, we would soon discover that there are trees, but no forest.</p>
   <p>Everything that has been done, or is being done in the Jewish community <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of Chicago can be credited to certain groups of middle-aged or elderly people. Jewish social work in Chicago is not community work, but is rather [individual] group work; there is no co-ordination of energy for the development of our community. One group, independent of every other group, works for the Jewish hospital; another group works for the Home for the Aged; a third group works for the infant home, etc. In the realm of our purely religious life, the same lack of co-ordination of energy prevails. One group is interested in the question of Kashruth (dietary food laws); another is interested in religious education, and a third is interested in burials. There is no organic connection between all these groups. Each one isolates itself from the other.</p>
   <p>Chicago possesses Jewish institutions, but there is no organized [Jewish] community life for two reasons: first, many of the social workers are individualistically inclined. Individualism clouds their perspective, so that they see only the separate parts, rather than the whole. Second, the youth is not a factor in our community life. Youth does not possess any Landsmannschaftliche <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>traditions [traditions binding them to their own people]. It knows nothing about the towns, cities and villages in the Old Country, to which the Jew in Chicago is still intellectually and spiritually bound. The Jewish youth of Chicago knows nothing beyond Chicago. If it were active in our public life, we would accomplish two things: first, the individualism of the older generation would be broken; the vogue of isolation would cease. The spirit of the small towns in Europe would disappear and would be replaced by the spirit of Chicago Jewry. Second, Jewish activity in Chicago would not proceed so slowly.</p>
   <p>Elderly people move slowly and are inclined to be conservative and dull in their thinking and acting. Youth moves quickly and thinks quickly. If the youth would participate in our public life, everything in Chicago would be accelerated. Resolutions which are passed would not remain on paper, but would be carried through. "Movements" would move--there would be life in the city, and that life would be colorful. Now that only the middle-aged and elderly people participate in public life, everything moves slowly <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and everything appears drab.</p>
   <p>Even if the elderly Jews who are active in public life would become more industrious than they are, and more devoted to the cause, the Jewish community life in Chicago would still be colorless as long as the Jewish activity in Chicago proceeded so slowly. A large community cannot be built solely by elderly people. Youth must help to build and create. But youth stands aloof. It is not interested in Judaism; it has no understanding of the needs and problems of our people, and does not concern itself with Jewish problems, whether local, national, or international.</p>
   <p>Thus, the basic question in Chicago [concerning the Jews] is: How can we bring the Jewish youth back to Judaism? The question is important not only because Chicago Jewry will perish in time unless its youth is activized, but the question is also important from the standpoint of our present work. With the aid of youth we can accomplish many things; without that aid we can do very little.</p>

   <p>Now, when Chicago has the most essential Jewish institutions, when a single part should develop into an organic unity, the aid and participation of the youth in our public life is most essential. It is not accidental that we are now beginning to hear voices saying, "Let's win back our youth."</p>
   <p>At its last membership meeting, Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel decided to consider the question of a center for the Jewish youth in order that it [youth] should have an opportunity to acquire a practical and theoretical Jewish education. The Adath Bnai Israel, an organization made up of young men and women, also decided to take up the question of a Jewish center for our youth. If other synagogues and organizations would follow the example of the Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel and the Adath Bnai Israel, the movement for centers, with which we sympathize wholeheartedly because we are convinced that it will help win back our youth, would soon take definite form. And with centers for our youth in Chicago, our public life would acquire movement and color and Jewish activity in Chicago would proceed with <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>greater speed.</p>
   <p>We must win the Jewish youth for the Jewish people, and we believe that Jewish centers for the youth are the best means of attaining this objective.</p>
