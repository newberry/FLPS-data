   <p>This year the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] campaign will begin on April twentieth and will end on May tenth. It promises to be the liveliest, and the most intensive and encouraging campaign that has ever taken place in this city. David Brown, the Napoleon of drive leaders in America, the man who led the seventeen-million-dollar relief drive, will come to Chicago either before or during Passover to see what the Chicago Jews are doing for the Keren Hayesod. David Brown is unique in his ability to raise money. It is also very likely that Louis Marshall or Samuel Untermeyer will honor the Chicago Jews with a visit this year.</p>
   <p>I am happy to know that the one hundred and ten thousand Jews who attend synagogues, and their representatives support the Keren Hayesod, and will raise twice as much money for it this year as they did last year. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>successful membership drive of the Zionist organization has done a great deal toward increasing the enthusiasm for the Keren Hayesod. Next to the United Jewish Charities, the Zionist organization is today the strongest Jewish organization in town. Morally and intellectually it is probably the strongest organization in the second largest Jewish city in the world. It is not only relatively, but absolutely, stronger than the corresponding organization in New York. Every week, Chicago receives five thousand copies of New Palestine, and more than two thousand copies of the Jewish People, the two official publications of the American Zionists. Seven thousand Jews in Chicago read about the work and progress in Palestine every week, are in close contact with Zionist work, and are informed of Zionist activity. That is why there is a different spirit in Chicago this year than last.</p>
   <p>My Zionist friends, colleagues and sympathizers are mistaken if they think that now they can rest upon their laurels. Only the first attempt has been made in Chicago this year to put Zionism and the Keren Hayesod work in Chicago upon a sound basis. The work must be continued next winter. The aim should <span class="page-break">\3</span>be: twenty-five thousand organized, dues-paying Zionists and one thousand active Zionists. After this part of the program is realized, Chicago will be a Zionist city and the Zionists will dominate Jewish life in Chicago. Zionism in Chicago can either be a small, insignificant factor, or the strongest, the dominant factor in the Jewish life of Chicago. There is no middle way. I hereby serve notice on all enemies of Zion that as long as I am one of the leaders of Zionism in Chicago, I will see to it that Zionism is the strongest driving force in the life of the city, and that all Zionists participate in all Jewish affairs.</p>
   <p>The Zionists of the Lawndale district will gather this evening in Rosenthal's Banquet Room to install the newly elected officers of their district and to have a good time. I will tell them, when I see them this evening, that they have little cause to celebrate. What is all this fuss about? There are only two thousand registered Zionists in the entire Lawndale district who have paid their dues for this year. At least eighty thousand Jews live in the Lawndale district. If the Lawndale Zionist workers were really hard workers for the <span class="page-break">\4</span>cause of Zionism, they would not have been content until they had increased the membership to at least five thousand. The Lawndale fortress is still being stormed, but it has not yet been taken. The Lawndale Zionists may celebrate the beginning of their work, but not its completion.</p>
