   <p>I wish to call the attention of the Milwaukee Zionists to the fact that the next time they invite speakers from Chicago, they should see to it that the meeting which the Chicago Zionists is to address, is attended by more than three people, besides the janitor. In the future, the Milwaukee Zionists should also speak in a plain, simple language to the Chicago Zionists and not prate about rubrication, classification, capitalization, enumeration, and other words ending in "ation" because we speak Yiddish in Chicago, and not the "ation" language, which only the Poale Zionists [labor group within Zionist movement] can understand.</p>
   <p>Two Chicago policemen shot a saloonkeeper because of a little liquor. This is no credit to the Chicago police department and even less credit to the Volstead <span class="page-break">\2</span>Act. The friends of prohibition claimed that when we eliminated the manufacture and sale of liquor, crime would disappear. The truth is, however, that since prohibition has been introduced, the number of criminals and crimes have increased. If old Lombroso were alive, he would start writing a book on prohibition as the sole cause of crime.</p>
