   <p>The directors of the Peoples Soup Kitchen, find themselves compelled to appeal to the public for further support. The two kitchens at 615 Canal and 3831 S. Halsted have, during the last three months, relieved much suffering. On Canal St. from 1,000 to 1,500 persons daily were provided with one hot meal. From 3831 S. Halsted, more families than individuals have been provided with food, their number averaging from 100 to 300 daily. In all probability, it will be necessary to keep these kitchens open two months longer. It will require about $500 more to continue the work to the close of the winter.</p>
