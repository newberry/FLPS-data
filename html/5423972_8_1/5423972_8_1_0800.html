   <p>The twentieth ward in Chicago begins at the northwest corner of Washington boulevard and Western avenue. It runs south, and takes in parts of the following streets and avenues: 12th, Safer, Taylor, Loomis, Van Buren Center and Madison streets; Ashland and Washington boulevards and Western avenue. The whole south half of this ward is thickly settled with Jews and in the last voting registration, it showed very nearly as many Jewish votes as in the near-by ninth ward.</p>
   <p>The Jews in the twentieth ward were not recognized much, politically, and they were not as active, politically, as in the ninth ward, so these Jews in the twentieth ward are getting busy in the formulating of plans whereby they will receive political recognition from now on.</p>
   <p>There will soon be an election for mayor and aldermen. We want to hear from our Jewish voters of the twentieth ward.</p>
