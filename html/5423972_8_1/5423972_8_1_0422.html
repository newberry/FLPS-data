   <p>disappoints those who might be his followers, by his shrinking.</p>
   <p>He may have come to the conclusion, that he now publicly proclaimed, last year, when the storm broke out over Palestine, and any thinking man could have seen that what had been hopefully possible was no longer tenable, and that the very excited speeches that were being made, in which exaggerations reigned supreme, were damaging the whole cause of settlement in Palestine. It was then clear that the continuance of the policy that the eloquent stated so easily and fluently, not only wrecked nationalism, but jeopardized plain ordinary settlement in Palestine as well.</p>
   <p>Even now we do not know whether Weizman's statement will be acceptable to the rank and file of the Zionists, who had but one idea and never changed it or adjusted it, or to the speakers who find it difficult to change the speeches that they have so often made. As far as we are concerned, we regard the speech of Weizman's as the beginning of the foundation on which can be laid an understanding between Zionists and non-Zionists for the upbuilding of a Jewish community in Palestine.</p>
   
   <p>But that depends very largely on how the Zionists, themselves will take to the address that Dr. Weizman has delivered. There are still differences between the Zionists and the non-Zionists that have to be ironed out. The non-Zionists irked by the hyperbole and the exaggeration of the Zionists may have denied the settlement in Palestine any power or meaning at all. They may be able to say when all the exaggerations are removed that Zionism has played a very worthy part in modern Jewish life, and has in some cases strengthened and straightened the backbone of fearful Jews, without involving themselves by this word of gentlemanly praise in a whole philosophy of Jewish life and history that they could not possibly accept. And on the other hand, the Zionists seeing their problem as a real problem and not as a matter of elocution, may be willing to drop all their cloudland dreams. They may be willing to forget all the harsh things they have said about the future of the Jewry in the diaspora, they may even regret that they condemned all of it to an ignoble oblivion as the days go by. They may be able to see the problems of Palestine and the Jews settling in it as they would the settlement of immigrants in any other land, involving very necessarily a harmonious adjustment between the newcomers and those already there.</p>
   <p>On this last detail, Weizman may have seen the truth many years ago; he has just uttered it now. Zangwill, however, saw it many years ago and stated it. It was Zangwill who painted out that the real problem of Zionism is not the Jew outside of Palestine, who refuses to be a Zionist. The Jew outside of Palestine will survive with or without Palestine. Nor is it the arrangement that men make outside of Palestine that tell what Palestine can do. He said it long ago, and was of course blamed for it, that the problem of the settlement in Palestine is the Arab, who has been for centuries planted on Palestinian soil, who has his graves in Palestine, and who will not vanish at the breath of the fiery speeches made at Zionistic conventions. He has a right to his land that he holds. And any settlement in Palestine must count on the fact that settlers are not moving into uninhabited territory. There must be peace between the Arab and the Jews. Magnes said something like this last year, immediately after the massacres, and he was called a traitor to the cause, as were all people who tried to see what the real situation was in Palestine. We are glad to see that Weizman now publicly recognizes the situation. He says "Palestine could become a Jewish state if it were an unhabited country. But it is not an unhabited country. And I maintain that the finest and noblest forces in Jewry will be roused by our ideal none the less, and that they will devote themselves fully to our great creative cause even though existing conditions may limit the field of activity, It is my profound conviction that much political harm can be done by the dissemination of ideas which, while they are confessions of faith, render more difficult our work in Palestine. A number of Zionists have been guilty of doing this last year."</p>
   <p>And we like Weizman's open dealing with the Balfour declaration. He confesses that the Balfour declaration has not been operating in a vacuum, that it has, on the contrary been subjected to the influences which changed conditions have brought to it. He is not quoting it as an immutable law, self-operative and enforcing. It is a human document with many details and Weizman has not settled on the one item that has changed most to declare it immutable. The one item that the Zionists Have forgotten so far, and which really is immutable, is that there are Arabs and Jews and Christians in Palestine and that there always will be, and that bloodshed will be avoided only if there is equal justice for all of them. The mandate guarantees that. It guarantees the Arabs in the possession of their property and it limits the extent of immigration.</p>
   <p>The Jewish state in Palestine vanishes. A Palestinian state or colony under the British mandate, there may be - but a Jewish state, no. In other words, Palestine is not to be an ethnic nationality. That was one particular thing that some of us as Zionists dreaded most. It was the idea of the ethnic nationality that made for the persecutions in the lands of the old world. It is the recurrence of the idea of the ethnic nationality that has brought about the rise of Hitler and Hitlerism in Germany. To that we Jews have been protesting. But the advocacy of the Jewish state in Palestine was a surrender of the right to protest. We argue against ethnic nationalism when we are the sufferers, and when we are given a land, we join the ranks of the ethnic nationalists.</p>
   
   <p>Personally, we always felt that the gain was too small for the price that we would have to pay for it, And we are on principle opposed to the whole theory of ethnic nationalism. Palestine, if anything happens to it to change its present condition, should be a land like Switzerland. It is not a German national homeland nor a French national homeland, nor an Italian national homeland. It is Switzerland, in which many different peoples live in harmony.</p>
   <p>And therefore, while we praise Weizman for his abandonment of the idea of the Jewish state in Palestine, we still must say we disagree with him in the retention of the word "national." He himself, in his speech, avoids the use of "the national homeland." The difference between "the" and "a" is important, but the use of the word "national" we do not like. One can speak of the bi-national as does Weizman. But then it can become tri-national. If the division will not be Jewish, Arabic, and Christian, it will be something else. There are rights of many sorts of people to be guaranteed and protected in Palestine. It seems to us that the use of the word "national" is bad. What the settlement of human beings in Palestine might teach the world is that it is forgetful, governmentally, or origins. It is mindful of present usefulness and loyalty and honesty. There is point in confessing that there is an Arabic Zionism, which Weizman confesses has grown up very rapidly in the face of the Jewish Zionism. Or that if there is a Jewish national homeland, it provokes an Arabic national homeland in Palestine. It is a homeland for peoples that will treat it as a home.</p>
   <p>What we want the Zionists to do is to talk about Palestine exactly as they would talk of Switzerland or of America or of any country in which different elements, different by virtue of a tradition, live together in peace, and recognize that in their ability to live together amicably, they are justifying the claims of human brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Anything less, endangers the future of the Jewish settlement in Palestine, which is yet to be achieved, but, what is more, endangers the Jews in the diaspora, which is indeed a serious matter for it concerns the largest section of Jewry, and, whether Zionists in the past have conceded it or not, a very worthy and heroic section of the sons of Israel. It is on some such basis that Zionists and non-Zionists can work together.</p>
   
   <p>It means an abandonment of Zionist dreaming. It means facing the hard realities of an already inhabited land in Palestine. It means the careful reckoning with the future of the Jews the world over. To take such a step must be a wrench for old time Zionists. At least Weizman has shown the way and has taken a few steps into the way, himself. It depends on the Zionists whether Weizman will have a following in the new way or whether he will be compelled to retrace these steps that he has already made. With the present situation clearly defined, the non-Zionists can let the future take care of itself. What settlement of Jews in Palestine will do under freedom with their opportunities in the very land of some of the finest Jewish tradition, is for the future to decide. In those settlements the traditions of Israel will have to be taught as elsewhere. There will be varying opinions as to the validity of an old law or an old statement of religion. There may be influences, and there undoubtedly will be something that will blow into Palestine that will render the task of maintaining a Jewish tradition difficult in Palestine as in other lands.</p>
   
   <p>The settlers may talk Hebrew and the world be none the worse for it. If they are wise they will also learn Arabic and if they want to reach a learned world they will have a curriculum in their schools and in their university that will give them the means of handling the matters of learning the other languages as well. All of that the future will take care of. What we need at present is to have sense. We like Weizman's address because it is sensible. If the Zionists disagree with it and condemn it, we shall know that the road of the Zionists and the road of the non-Zionists cannot be the same for some time yet.</p>
