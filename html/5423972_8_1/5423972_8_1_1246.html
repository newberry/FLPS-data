   <p>The Ladies Auxiliary of the society to comfort the incurable Jewish patients in Oak Forest has prepared for the unfortunates an enjoyable holiday with dairy dishes for the first day, and meat dishes for the second day of Shavuoth (Feast of Weeks). All these delicacies will be delivered today. As on all holidays, the superintendent, Mr. Bailey, has furnished separate rooms where the Jewish patients will gather to dine together.</p>
   <p>The Jewish patients of Oak Forest regret exceedingly that Dr. Hirshman has left the institution. He was the only Jewish doctor there who made his rounds and attended the sick as a friend. He is now affiliated with the Lincoln State Hospital.</p>
