   <p>Chicago Zionists will open today a drive to increase their membership. Every effort will be made, including visits to all synagogues, lodges, and institutions where Jews congregate, to reach all Jews and interest them in the movement.</p>
   <p>A great deal of pressure to influence the Jews will be exerted today as a result of the election of delegates to the convention that will convene in Chicago on September 14.</p>
   <p>Today district officers will be elected in the four Chicago Districts. In Lawndale the election will take place at 8 P.M. at the Herzel School; in the West Side, it will be held in Assembly Hall of the Hebrew Institute and in three precincts; and in the South Side, it will take place in three precincts.</p>
