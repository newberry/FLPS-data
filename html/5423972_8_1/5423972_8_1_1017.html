   <p>The Zionists of the Middle West will, I have no doubt, manifest their loyalty to the Zionist cause by making the presence of Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, in their section of the country a decided moral and financial success. Dr. Weizmann has come to us this year at a time which requires as the supreme virtue the expression in concrete acts of the spirit of loyalty and devotion. A cause such as ours, depending upon its moral influence, cannot expect to succeed if it has not the power to elicit from its supporters, at a time when action is essential, a complete disregard of personal opinion and views and an absolute acceptance of the obligations that arise out of their affiliation with it. Every Zionist should know that we are on the verge of a reformation of our organized forces, a reconstruction of the forms of our activities, a readjustment of the methods <span class="page-break">2</span>of administration. The old machine must be remodeled to meet the requirements of the new situation. We have to think of the construction of the Jewish Agency; the winning of new forces to enter into it. We have to think of establishing the Karen Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] as that fund which will win the support of all who believe in establishing the national home in Palestine through the collective will of the Jewish people. We have to think of the relation of the Zionist Organization to the new Jewish Agency. We have to think of removing those obstructions that are in the way of clear definite administrative action.</p>
   <p>We have passed through the period of doubt and uncertainty as to the quality of the task we have assumed. Palestine lies there, in the distance. The Jews are here, in the Golus [Diaspora]. Between the two there must be created a bridge capable of carrying us over into the Land of Promise. It is to be a bridge, simple, not too complicated; a bridge based not on a variety <span class="page-break">3</span>of engineering plans, but upon one plan; a bridge that will not involve us in a wasteful expenditure of energy, but shall economize every ounce of our resources; a bridge that shall also have beauty of form and be imbued with the spirit of the determined builders of a new future for the Jewish people. It is for that work we should now be preparing ourselves, and the first duty in that work is patience, devotion, and sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weizmann is the outstanding personality of the Zionist Organization. He is clothed with all its authority. He has carried the burdens of his responsibility with dignity. He has endured much. He has been patient to the extreme. Through the troublous days since the beginning of the war (before he was officially responsible), he undertook the great responsibility, which after years of effort, has brought us success. He created the political atmosphere in Europe antecedent to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration. He carried the Balfour Declaration, in spite of tremendous opposition, to the consummation of the Mandate. Since the London Zionist Conference, when he was elected president of the Zionist Organization, he has maintained <span class="page-break">4</span>the Zionist Organization intact, with infinite patience and endurance. He has held the shreds of our organized Zionist life together. He has adjusted internal differences with consummate skill, seeking always to maintain and establish unity. He stood, at times, greatly resistant, and again, in action, self-sacrificingly pliant and conciliatory. He has maintained the majesty of his authority. Through arrogance and willfulness, it is not difficult to make the mark of the strong man. But it is infinitely harder for the sake of the cause which one serves, to bend one's own opinion to the opinion of others, and to sacrifice it in order that harmony shall ensue. Dr. Weizmann, as a leader, has been strong enough to put the interests of the whole organization higher than his interest in the vindication of his own personal views. There is martyrdom in this. There is excruciating pain. But there is great spiritual compensation. The Zionists of America hail Dr. Weizmann, the first Zionist president, the proud and attention-compelling representative of the great cause of his people before the governments of the world, the true leader who by his tact, patience, and capacity for <span class="page-break">5</span>unselfish endurance, is entitled to our allegiance, respect, and affection.</p>
   <p>I have no doubt that the Zionists of the Middle West will do their duty. They will enable Dr. Weizmann to return to Europe and to prepare for the Zionist Congress with a knowledge that the Jews of America are prepared to make the sacrifices necessary for the establishment of a national home in Palestine, that shall be worthy of our traditions and expressive of our faith and convictions.</p>
