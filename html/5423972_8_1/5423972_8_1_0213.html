   <p>Something must be done about the series of incidents that have occured in various parts of the city. We Jews have tolerated it enough. The recent brutal beating and killing of Mr. Abraham Hauptman, a respected business man and member of our community, should bring forth some remedy. The murderer should be punished. We do not, however, believe that hanging will be the solution to this Jewish question. This problem has deep social roots and must be tackled there. It is a problem that should be earnestly taken up by conscientious civic and community leaders. Such incidents have no place in America.</p>
