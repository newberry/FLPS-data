   <p>Jacob De Haas, the clever general-secretary of the American Zionist Organization, who witnessed the great Zionist conference in London and Paris and participated to a great extent in Zionist diplomatic activities in Washington, London, and Paris, arrived this morning here to bring personally to Chicago Jews great Zionist tidings, the immediate redemption quintessence.</p>
   <p>Today, Mr. Jacob De Haas is one of the strong pillars of American Zionism. He has but recently returned from Paris and London. To Paris he went in the capacity of a delegate to the Peace Conference for the Jewish Congress and for the Zionist Organization. In London he participated in the Zionist Conference.</p>
   
   <p>Now he is sailing for Palestine as escort to Justice Brandeis, who will spend the summer there.</p>
