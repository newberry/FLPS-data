   <p>The Jewish community of Chicago, like all large communities which have rapidly developed and which have no historical background, has only the skeleton of an effective communal organization. It has the few necessary institutions which it could not get along without; it has its charities, a few Talmud Torahs (Hebrew schools), and of late a Hebrew Theological College, but not the institutions which should cement the four hundred thousand Jews in Chicago to one large community, having one purpose and one goal. That such institutions are lacking in the Jewish community of Chicago all will admit, the pious and the freethinkers, the young and the old, and we are not in accord as to the character of these very desirable and very necessary institutions.</p>
   <p>In the old country such institutions were not so necessary to the extent that they are here. In the old country Jewish traditions formed the cementing power <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the community and the Jewish character was moulded in the home. This, however, is not the case here. We do not have, as yet, any Jewish traditions here. They must first be created. The Jewish home in Chicago, or in any other American Jewish community, is not that which it had been in the old country. It has little influence upon the moral, religious, and general spiritual refinement of the Jewish child. Due to the absence of proper home training and Jewish traditions, the establishment of a special institution, which should supply both missing factors, is an absolute necessity.</p>
   <p>Upon this venture rests more than that--there rests the establishment of an organically united community, instead of the existence of cliques, countrymen societies, congregations, alliances, and so forth. This is only possible if the present growing generation receives the opportunity to function in an atmosphere which, on the one hand, is strictly Jewish, and on the other, strictly American, and not Landsmanschaftlich (in terms of countrymen societies)--Polish Russian, Ukranian, Hungarian, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Such an atmosphere can only be created in a large and modern Jewish center in a large Jewish district of Chicago. In this Jewish center, the character of the Jewish child and of the Jewish young man or girl must be shaped. In such a center, the traditions of a united [Jewish community of] Chicago must be created, and for this reason alone, the center must be strictly Jewish in spirit and management, in its program and methods.</p>
   <p>The great needs of the Jewish community of Chicago do not consist so much in the development of philanthropic work as in the development of social and educational work. And the Chicago Jewish community will never become an organically united group until it will seriously consider the establishment of such an institution, which should give the Jewish youth an opportunity to grow up as Chicago Jews.</p>
   <p>We haven't enough Hebrew schools in the city at present. At least, twenty additional schools are needed to give the majority of the Jewish children in Chicago <span class="page-break">\4</span>a Hebrew education. A Jewish center must, above all else, have a well-equipped and modern Hebrew school to accommodate from five to six hundred children. Chicago is in need of not one but three Jewish centers, and when these centers will be established the problem of Jewish education in this city will be partly solved. A Hebrew school in the Jewish center, in the center of all sorts of Jewish activities, will be of greater value and more productive than a Hebrew school that is isolated from Jewish activity, because it will not only give the child a practical education but will also serve as a substitute for home training.</p>
   <p>The center must have a place for all Jewish activities, social, spiritual, cultural, and artistic. The center must be a sort of Jewish people's university for the adults and a general Jewish school for the youth; and it therefore stands to reason that, in such a center, there must be all sorts of adults, classes in Hebrew, in Jewish history, in Jewish literature, etc. Then there are the different categories of the youth and adults--literary, social, and popular science--controlled by a Board of Directors having a profound knowledge of such matters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>When this work is first laid on a solid foundation, then they can proceed with other work,such as welfare and recreational.</p>
   <p>The establishment of such centers in every large [Jewish] district of Chicago will accomplish one great thing. In the course of twenty years, we will have a sound and glorious generation of Jews in Chicago, and without such institutions we will have, in twenty years hence, spiritual and moral disrupters in the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The needs of the Jewish community in Chicago are many, because Chicago grew up rapidly materially, and very slowly spiritually, and if we shall not concentrate on spiritual work now, we will lose the third generation as we have already lost the second generation of the immigrant Jews.</p>
   <p>We must reconstruct the entire spiritual and educational work of the Jewish community in Chicago and that means that we must establish Jewish centers here.</p>
