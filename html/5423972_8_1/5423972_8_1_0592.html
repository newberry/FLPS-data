   <p>The first duty of the Workmen's Circle to its members is to open a naturalization bureau, an office to help them to become citizens. Those seeking information or legal advice regarding citizenship papers will be accommodated.</p>
   <p>The Young American Branch of the W.C. took it upon themselves to provide everything necessary in order to have an effective bureau which would help everyone desiring to become a citizen.</p>
   <p>Every evening, except Saturday and Sunday, at the office of the Labor Lyceum there will be attorneys who will make out the first and second papers, and will give all the necessary information to those who apply.</p>
   <p>They are also planning to open classes on citizenship and other questions that will be of interest to the workers.</p>
