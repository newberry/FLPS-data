   <p>There was a gala holiday spirit in the Jewish districts of Chicago, particularly near the synagogues. However, it was not a Rosh Hashanah spirit. A merry, boisterous mood prevailed instead of a reflective one. The synagogues were crowded but the lobbies and the streets near the synagogues were also crowded--with young people. The old people remained inside the synagogues and prayed; the young stayed outside and enjoyed themselves immensely. Their faces showed no trace of religious feeling but did express unmistakable signs of merriment.</p>
   <p>I wonder how Rosh Hashanah will be observed in the future in the Jewish districts of Chicago when the present older generation is no longer here, and its place is taken by the young generation which now stands on the stairways and in the corridors during the services and enjoys itself.</p>

   <p>Rosh Hashanah offers the best opportunity to observe how the Chicago Orthodoxy has brought up its youth. If I were an Orthodox rabbi in Chicago and if it were permissible to tear one's clothes on Rosh Hashanah as a sign of mourning, I would tear my clothes and cover my head with ashes when I observe the behavior of the young Orthodox generation on Rosh Hashanah.</p>
   <p>Nearly all the rabbis preached from their pulpits on Rosh Hashanah. One rabbi reproached the Jews for carrying packages on Saturday; another complained that the Jewish girls are dressed immodestly; a third rabbi rebuked the men for sending flowers to their women while the latter were in the synagogue. But how many rabbis had the courage and the understanding to ask these questions of their congregations: Why are you raising a generation of non-Jews? How many of the twenty thousand Jewish boys and girls who stood in the corridors or near the entrance of the synagogues during the services have any Jewish feeling? How many of them know anything about Judaism? How many of them are interested in Judaism?</p>

   <p>How many of them know or sympathize with the destruction of our people [which is going on] across the seas? How many of them know of our work in Palestine? How many of them are interested in our national work?</p>
   <p>I assure you that I myself am no saint, but my blood began to boil when I observed the Orthodox youth of Chicago during the Rosh Hashanah, when I saw by their faces how uninterested they were in Judaism and how ignorant they were of Judaism; they behaved during the services as though they were at a vaudeville show. I asked myself: Why am I struggling? A feeling of sadness, dejection, and revulsion came over me.</p>
   <p>What kind of a future has Judaism in America?</p>
