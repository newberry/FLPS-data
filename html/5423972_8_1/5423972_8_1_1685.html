   <p>New York is not the whole of American Jewry, New York is not the leader of American Jewry, New York is not the boss of American Jewry, but nevertheless, New York considers itself the spokesman for American Jewry and wishes to get the credit for the Jewish work that is being done all over the country; for the Jewish work that is being done in Chicago and in all the cities and small towns outside of New York. The outstanding thing about the New York Jews is that there are great numbers of them. However, there are more Jews outside of New York than in New York, but New York prefers to ignore that fact. New York makes statements in the name of all the Jews of America as if Chicago did not exist at all.</p>
   <p>What is New York? First, however, let us see what Chicago is. Many Jewish undertakings originated in Chicago and were first set into motion here. The first Hebrew newspaper-the Hapsogoh-was issued in Chicago, and Chicago was the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>first place to begin organizing the Jews in behalf of Zionism.Chicago was the first to raise help for the pogrom sufferers in Kishinev (Russia); it was Chicago which first aroused American public opinion against the Bailis trial. In Chicago there is a public school to perpetuate the name of the great Jewish leader, Theodore Herzl. In Chicago, the foundation for the Central Relief Committee was laid, as well as the American Jewish Relief Committee, and the Joint Distribution Committee. We might also mention that the greatest Jewish philanthropist, Julius Rosenwald, lives in Chicago. He has given huge sums of money to help the relief drives fulfill their quotas. Chicago has never monopolized any Jewish undertaking but has always called upon New York for consultation and has given it more representation than it was entitled to.</p>
   <p>How about New York? New York has, of course, accomplished some great community undertakings, but almost all of the public work there is monoplized by a self-appointed group of leaders.</p>
   <p>Every Shlemiel in New York subscribes to the silly idea that anybody who lives <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>outside of New York is a provincial Jew. Every tavern hero there thinks that without him the American Jews would have done nothing for their communities: They would not have built their institutions, they would not have given anything for charity, and would, in short, have looked as cheap as a penny. Every owner of a two-by-four coffee house there, who sells sixteen glasses of tea a day, five cigarettes at a penny each, and a package of chewing gum for a nickel, gives speeches on the subject of commerce and industry: the association of commerce, the chamber of commerce, the Board of Trade, Wall Street, La Salle Street, are less than dust as compared to his business knowledge, important transactions, and tremendous turnover of merchandise. Every ham actor there, who does not even know how to follow the prompter, considers the New York masses as simpletons from the country, as cattle who should be given straw to eat instead of artistic plays, as though he had any talent for art. Every scribbler there wants to have a decisive voice or questions about which he knows nothing. Every insignificant clergyman there claims that he sustains Judaism, and were it not for him, every Jew in this country would have become assimilated or converted. Every critic there speaks <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>about literature. Every greenhorn who knows no English and does not want to know English, who would not think of leaving the cafeteria, talks about America. Every politician there boasts about his influence in Congress and at the White House; he will be able to fix everything, depend upon him. Confused minds preach patriotism and, during the war, informed Washington that the Jewish press did not support the government. Men whose motto is "gimme", idlers who like to take a snooze during the day, have offices there, which are neither more nor less than chess headquarters, from which they issue statements in the name of the American Jews. Every important document of a public character becomes as insignificant as a private affair, if it does not have their approval. Every important letter has no value at all, unless it is written on their stationery.</p>
   <p>These people say that they represent New York, that they represent America, that they are the Jews of the New World. They want us to accept them as such. Often we have to do so because the other New Yorkers are silent.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>turns to them for money and the provincial Jews give. They have paid for many of the New York synagogues. They were urged to do so by the New York publicity men who, at same time, laughed at them.</p>
   <p>They arrange a Jewish Congress in New York. That is fine. The Jewish Congress should be held not in behalf of the Jews of America, but of the Jews of Europe. The writer of these lines, taking this position, supported the Congress and used his influence to have Chicago represented there. The New York Jews however, at the first opportunity they had, indicated what they thought of the country Jews. The critics of the Congress, headed by Dr. S. M. Melamed, were not entirely out of order when they pointed out that the New York Jews only wanted to remain in the saddle; they wanted to show that every city was with them and for them, that they were elected by a democratic process, by the grace of the people--to get a free hand to issue statements in the name of American Jews, by which they mean New York.</p>
   <p>Why do we say all this? We do so because of the audacity of the New Yorkers who <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>now seek to monopolize and pass as their own, somebody else's idea and achievement. The whole story revolves around the proposal made by the Mexican government to Attorney Paul Rothenberg of Chicago to grant a stretch of fertile land for Jewish colonization. You have read something about this in the Courier. Now, let me tell you the story briefly:</p>
   <p>A [state] senator from Arizona, J. Shleimer, who is a personal friend of President Obregon of Mexico, paid a visit to Chicago about a year ago. The Senator has friends here who are in the commission business on South Water Street. Mr. Shleimer met a certain Mr. S. Feier at their office. Mr. Feier is a Jew, a scholar, and a nationalist, and Mr. Shleimer told him about the injustice being done by the United States to Mexico by the refusal of the United States to recognize the Mexican government. Mr. Shleimer also said that the various state legislatures could force the recognition of Mexico if they would pass resolutions in favor of it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feier knew Attorney Paul Rothenberg. He knew that Mr. Rothenberg was a <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>personal friend of Governor Small and had some influence in Springfield. Mr. Feier introduced Senator Shleimer to Mr. Rothenberg, and, a few weeks later, the Illinois legislature adopted a resolution calling upon Congress to recognize the Mexican government.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rothenberg was sincerely thanked by President Obregon and was invited to be a guest at the National Palace in Mexico City. Mr. Rothenberg went there. Various rewards were offered to him as well as to Mr. Feier of Chicago. Both of them refused all proposals involving a personal reward. However, since both were nationalistically inclined Jews, they thought of asking the Mexican government to allot some fertile land for colonization by Eastern European Jews, who wander around in various lands and have no place to settle.</p>
   <p>It is well known that the proposal of President Obregon, came as a result of this request. The Courier reported the negotiations. The Jewish press in New York wrote detailed stories about the plan.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rothenberg waited patiently for a long time for an organization to be formed <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>which would interest itself in this case. In Chicago such an organization was formed, but nowhere else. The name of the Chicago organization is The Jewish-Mexican Colonization Association. At the present time, this Association is sending a delegation with an engineer and a surveyor to investigate the territory and bring in a report. Who knows, perhaps the soil is not good; maybe the climate is not good; maybe settling there would not be a good idea. The delegation will have to investigate these and many other problems.</p>
   <p>The whole affair has created a stir in America and Europe. Everybody is anxious to know about the territory in Mexico for Jews. They will hear the news soon.</p>
   <p>The New Yorkers who putter in and around the Jewish Congress, appointed a committee of five to investigate the proposed concession. They advise everybody to wait for their report. They act as if only their decision counts. What right do they have to act that way? How about Chicago? The affair originated in Chicago and, therefore, Chicago should be consulted. They should, at least, have consulted <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Dr. George Sultan, honorary president of the Jewish Congress. Decency and fairness demanded this. Decency and fairness demanded that the Jewish Congress appoint Paul Rothenberg a member of the investigating committee, or at least write to him requesting information about the Mexican proposal. But why talk about decency and fairness? The New Yorkers claim to represent the Jews of America and what can you do about it?</p>
   <p>We are now, as we were before, for a Jewish Congress, for a permanent Jewish Congress. We will support such a Congress, but we won't support the cafeteria politicians who buzz aroung the Jewish Congress. Their actions in regard to the Mexican proposal show that they do not deserve anybody's support. Those people who criticized the Congress when it was scheduled to assemble were not, as I have said before, entirely out of order. We took issue with those critics because the, sought to belittle the idea of a Congress in general, and because their criticism involved such personalities as Nathan Strauss, Rabbi Wise, Judge Levy, and others. These personalities should not be identified with the small cafeteria politicans just because they are for a Jewish Congress. However, it is very likely that those who criticized the Congress did not have these distinguished <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>personalities in mind.</p>
   <p>What can the Congress committee do other than bring in a report of what they saw and heard in Mexico? Paul Rothenberg has a far better entree and he can bring in a better report than the New York people. How are they better than he? What have they against him? Is it that his picture or a marble statue of him is not to be found in the Actors' Club? Is it that he does not make a living out of the Hias? Is it that he does not advise anybody to send money through the Red Shield of David? Is it that he is not a New Yorker?</p>
   <p>Paul Rothenberg deserves, in every way, to be the head of a delegation to Mexico. A special delegation from New York is not needed. Chicago and the Jews of the rest of the country will not let themselves be bluffed by a small group of cafeteria politicians who have arranged a Jewish Congress while hiding behind the shadow of Nathan Strauss and the others.</p>
