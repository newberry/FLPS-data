   <p>The Jewish National radical family of Chicago will give a reception next Monday in honor of Miss Hannah Tcizick, noted representative of the organized women workers of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Every country and nation has its heroes and martyrs, in some cases whole families and in other individuals, who are eulogized and admired.</p>
   <p>The last forty years of Jewish construction work in Palestine has produced a number of heroes and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the ideal of rebuilding Palestine into a Jewish Home Land on the basis of work and justice.</p>
   <p>The Tcizick family are great idealists, not afraid of anybody or anything, bold and heroic, whose aim is to work and succeed, not to give up before their work is completed.</p>
   
   <p>This famous family came from Russia to Palestine twenty-five years ago. Being among the first settlers to select farming as their profession, in order to make a way for the future generation and for other Jewish workers coming to Palestine. The Tcizick family was confronted with all sorts of troubles and handicaps when they first began work.</p>
   <p>Hannah was the instructor and leader of her younger sisters and brothers, in addition to which she acted as a guide for the new comers.</p>
   <p>During the World War, when the Turkish government had driven the Jews out into Syria and Golil, Hannah Tcizick was the first one to organize in Golil experimental schools for girls, with the help of friends and civic workers. After they noticed that experimental farms were a great success, they immediately organized many of them, for girls, all over the country.</p>
   
   <p>Those farms proved to be very profitable for the youth of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Women and girls coming to Palestine have now the same opportunity to learn the basic principles of farming and cattle raising as there is for learning academic subjects. Girls and women do all the work on the farms.</p>
   <p>Hannah Tcizick was the founder and organizer of these farms and even to the present day she is still devoted to them, working with them hand in hand.</p>
   <p>The Tcizick family is the most prominent family in Palestine. They dug and fertilized the soil not only with the sweat of their brow, but with their blood as well. One sister, Rebecca, died from blood poisoning received from a snake bite while at work. She refused to see a doctor in order not to lose a few hours work. Another sister, Sarah, died as a heroine for her country and flag together with the famous hero, Joseph Trumpfeldor, at Tel Chai. A brother, Ephraim, died while defending the colony Chulla during the uprisings of 1929.</p>
   
   <p>Hannah Tcizick, in spite of the many deaths in her family, did not abandon her work, but kept on struggling. Her slogan is, "Let Us Not Give Up This Holy Work, Let us Continue to build our Homeland."</p>
   <p>Miss Tcizick comes to Chicago upon the invitation of the Chicago Women Pioneers organization. They are arranging for her a very elaborate reception at the Temple Judea.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewry, who understand the value of such an idealistic person, will surely come to the reception to express their admiration for and recognition of our great heroine, Hannah Tcizick.</p>
