   <p>The field for survey included the whole of the 19th ward, bounded by the Chicago river on the East, and Hermitage avenue on the West, and from Van Buren street to Taylor; from Hermitage to Loomis street, then 12th street as far east as Halsted, the boundary then following Taylor street to Desplaines street, going south to Dekoven and Bunker streets, and the river on the eastern boundary.</p>
   <p>The district east of Halsted is now largely given over to factories and places of industry. Very few Jews are found in this square mile. The Italians, Greeks and Poles have been crowding the Jews out for years, and only isolated families are still to be found in their own homes. The School Census record shows that in the Dante School, fifteen years ago there were 95% of Jewish pupils. In this survey, we found that in very same school, 95% are Italians. The majority of the Jewish families are engaged in business on Halsted Street. These families live in back or over their stores. The more prosperous among them moved into the Lawndale District, and have gone as far as 40th avenue.</p>
   <p>The very heart of the district, bounded by Blue Island, Taylor street and Racine avenue and extending almost to Van Buren street is now inhabited by other nationalities. The Jackson School, on Polk and Sholto streets, formerly almost exclusively Jewish is now largely attended by Italians. Six years ago the first Italian child was graduated from the eighth grade. These facts are of great significance not only to the Institute, but to other social agencies, and to the public school itself. From Taylor street to 12th street, and from Loomis to May, is the most densely populated area and has the largest population of Jews.</p>
   <p>Here, too, we found the greatest number of aliens. This is in the immediate neighborhood of the Institute, and no doubt similar facts will be ascertained, when a survey is made of the adjoining 10th and 20th wards. The most important grouping of Jews, as shown on the spot map, is that surrounding Ashland Boulevard. This neighborhood is bounded by Laflin, Halsted, Hermitage and Taylor streets. Ashland Boulevard, formerly one of the most beautiful and fashionable streets on the West Side, in the last few years has become the happy hunting ground for cheap rooming houses, boarding homes, and college fraternities, housing hundreds of students from the local musical and dental colleges.</p>
