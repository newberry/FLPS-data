   <p>The committee appointed to work out plans for reorganizing Zionist work in Chicago recommends the following:</p>
   <p>1) That a Central City Organization, composed of representatives from each of the existing districts in Chicago, shall be created for the purpose of effecting the reorganization as hereby recommended and contemplated.</p>
   <p>2) That the said Central City Organization shall publish a prospectus outlining the plan and purpose of the reorganization program so that the whole registered membership of all the districts may be informed of the necessity of increasing the annual dues beginning January 1, 1921, in accordance with this program, and [the necessity of] securing the registration of all the members for the coming year upon the new basis.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>3) That the annual dues for every registered Zionist in each district shall be six dollars a year, to be apportioned as follows:</p>
   <p>a) Shekel [for Jewish National Fund]--one dollar;</p>
   <p>b) Zionist Organization of America--one dollar (or as much as the National Organization shall fix per capita);</p>
   <p>c) Balance to the Central City Organization for division among the districts and subsidiary units hereinafter provided for in accordance with a budget of their respective needs, to be worked out carefully by the Central City Organization.</p>
   <p>4) Each of the existing districts in Chicago shall continue to function until the new plan of reorganization is put into effect.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>5) The Central City Organization shall compile a list of members registered in all the districts....and when six thousand bona fide members shall have been enrolled and shall have paid their dues for the year 1921, there shall be established a Zionist Center in each of the present districts, to be maintained from funds allotted by the Central City Organization. These Centers are to serve as meeting halls, educational, recreational, and social centers, and thereafter, additional Centers of like kind shall be established from time to time in different parts of the city as occasion may require and membership and means justify. Each of the Centers shall be provided with a competent director in charge, at a salary of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars per month, and a stenographer at not more than twenty-five dollars per week and shall function for all Zionist purposes that may be required.</p>
   <p>6) When six thousand bona fide members shall have been enrolled in the city, a movement shall be launched for the organization of subsidiary units <span class="page-break">4</span>throughout the city within the respective districts, as well as in territory not covered by the existing districts. These units are to comprise memberships of not less than fifty or more than three hundred and are to be subordinate to the districts in which they are located, if within existing districts, or to the Central City Organization, if outside of any district.</p>
   <p>7) Membership in the units shall be the same as herein above provided for, and apportioned in like manner. The units are to use the Zionist Centers as meeting places, and the management of the Centers is to furnish the units with all necessary clerical help, stationery, postage, etc. This will eliminate the need of a working fund by the unit, and all expenses can be controlled by the Central City Organization.</p>
   <p>8) If the Zionist requirements will permit of any Center being used for other purposes, such as meeting places for other organizations, the revenue <span class="page-break">5</span>thus derived may be applied toward the maintenance of the Center.</p>
   <p>9) When six thousand members shall have been enrolled and the establishment of these Centers inaugurated, the districts shall consolidate into one Chicago district with one executive committee functioning for the entire city.</p>
   <p>The committee considers that it is essential that these Zionist Centers shall consist of not less than three rooms: one large enough for a meeting place for 150 or 200 people, the other a reading room, and the third an office or administrative room. These Centers can be secured at reasonable rentals and can be neatly decorated and furnished so as to make them inviting to the public. Thus they can serve as social gathering places for all local Jewish purposes. With a number of units organized in the neighborhood, one or more units will be able to meet on the premises every evening during the week (exclusive of Friday evening); other activities such as lectures, <span class="page-break">6</span>social functions, study classes for children or adults, etc., could also be arranged.</p>
   <p>The estimated minimum cost for the maintenance of one such Center is about seven thousand dollars a year; this amount includes rental, director's and stenographer's salaries, light, stationery, postage, and incidentals. With a minimum membership of six thousand to start with, there will be available for this undertaking, twenty-four thousand dollars, if the National Organization's per capita remains at one dollar; twenty-one thousand dollars, if it is increased to one dollar and fifty cents, or eighteen thousand dollars if it should be increased to two dollars.</p>
   <p>If the installation of these Centers is undertaken when six thousand members have been enrolled and their dues have been paid, the committee feels that the endeavor to organize the units, and a persistent effort to enlarge the <span class="page-break">7</span>membership will bring in sufficient additional revenue to cover the necessary requirements for the year.</p>
   <p>10) Simultaneously with the development of the plan herein outlined, the Central City Organization shall place itself in communication with certain Zionist districts outside of Chicago within the middle western states. This shall be done for the purpose of establishing a regional affiliation of districts to be united through the medium of a Regional Executive Board, which shall meet from time to time for the purpose of strengthening Zionist work within the regional territory. There shall be maintained an office in the Loop district of Chicago with a director in charge and such clerical assistance as may be necessary for the purpose of functioning on behalf of the</p>
   <p>a) Regional District;</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>b) The Central City Organization, including the direction and coordination of the local Centers and unit work and</p>
   <p>c) The National Organization, including work for Palestine, and such other Zionist work as may be necessary.</p>
   <p>All districts affiliating with the Regional District shall be required to fix the annual dues of its members at six dollars a year and to pay out of the dues a per capita of one dollar a year toward the maintenance of the central office, and the expense of conducting the Regional District. The expense of the office shall be covered by pro rating the services that it will be called upon to perform between the National Organization or work for Palestine, the Regional District, and the Central City Organization of Chicago. Each of these departments is to bear its share of the expenses in proportion to the service it requires.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>The committee believes that with Zionist Centers functioning in the city through their respective directors, the volume of work that the regional office will have to devote to work for Palestine and regional work will be so large that the City Organization's portion of the expense of maintaining the regional office will be relatively small.</p>
   <p>The committee is of the opinion that activity of that kind will so stimulate interest and disseminate Zionist information among the Jewish public as to result in a growth of membership and the strengthening of our organization, both in influence and achievement. With the enrollment of an active membership, the problems of raising money for the Restoration Fund or for any other Palestinian purpose will be greatly eased.</p>
