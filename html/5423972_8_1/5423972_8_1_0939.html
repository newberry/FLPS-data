   <p>Some years ago a Jewish press club was organized in Chicago. Though the organization was short-lived, owing to personal antagonisms peculiar to the time.</p>
   <p>Now comes the suggestion (from the Chronicle, be it said) for another Jewish club of the same kind. The time is over-ripe for such a project. The Jewish population of the city is several times greater than it was at the time of the first attempt. The number of Jewish writers and those interested in the written word is incomparably greater. But as yet we have no center, no organized facilities for fostering interest in literature and art in general.</p>
   
   <p>We need such a center, such a group, to encourage writers, to bring out the talent that often is stifled for lack of a little moral assistance, to speak and act coherently for the community. When a great son of our people comes to this city, someone who has done something worth while in any field of knowledge, such a group could "do the honors" efficiently, economically and enjoyably; whereas, now, there is no one to take the lead in such matters.</p>
   <p>But with a Jewish press club, arts club, the situation would be marvelously changed for the better. True, there is the Peretz Schreiberverein, but this is merely a union of Yiddish scribes, for professional purposes. What we have in mind is an organization of literati, professional and amateur, and of those interested in other arts, whether as workers or as patrons; an organization operated on a broad scale for the benefit of the community as a whole.</p>
