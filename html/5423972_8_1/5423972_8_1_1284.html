   <p>Jewish workers, join the Jewish National Workers Alliance of America! What is the Jewish National Workers Alliance? This question can best be answered by the following excerpt from our declaration of principles:</p>
   <p>"Recognizing the need for assistance in case of death, want or sickness, and conscious also of the discrimination and injustice which Jews face in our present society, we Jewish workers have found it necessary to create an organization which has set itself to:</p>
   <p>"1. Give its members sick and death benefits.</p>
   <p>"2. Strengthen through education the national and social consciousness of the Jewish masses in order to fight against assimilation; participate in the revival of an international Jewish movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"3. Function actively in the labor movement which seeks to improve the condition of the working class and to bring about a new and better social order."</p>
   <p>OUR MATERIAL BENEFITS</p>
   <p>The Alliance gives in benefits to its members: Insurance policies ranging from $100 to $2,000, the premiums of which are paid according to age.</p>
   <p>It also gives ten dollars a week consumptive and sick benefit. Special benefits are provided for accident insurance and "paid up" policies. The Alliance offers the most modern type of insurance policies.</p>
   <p>Men and women of 18 and over are accepted.</p>

   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>As a Jewish radical, you should recognize your obligation and join the organized Jewish workers who are struggling for national and social emancipation. You should join with those who are fighting against discrimination, and for the recognition of Jewish rights--with those who seek Jewish emancipation.</p>
   <p>Jewish workers, do not remain aloof! Through an organization of all nationally conscious Jewish workers, let us build a powerful Jewish workers' order which may act as a model to others.</p>
