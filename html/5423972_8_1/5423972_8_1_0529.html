   <p>Are we the grandchildren of our grandfathers? Are we Semites and does pure blood run in our veins? Are we a homogeneous race? Ronald Dixon answers these three questions in the negative in an article appearing in the Nation. He does not furnish us with the source of his information. When a person makes such statements, he sould not make them wildly, but should supply ample evidence [to substantiate his position]. Mr. Ronald [Dixon] wishes to do us a favor by asserting that we are not the grandchildren of our ancestors, that we have no pure blood in our veins, and that we are a heterogeneous race. He believes that if the world shared his opinion of the Jews, anti-Semitism would disappear. However, doesn't Mr. Dixon know that the greatest theorist of modern anti-Semitism, Chamberlain, says exactly the same thing about the Jews, viz., that we are not the grandchildren of our ancestors and that we are a heterogeneous race. Chamberlain does not furnish any proof for his claims either. He <span class="page-break">2</span>simply talks through his hat.</p>
   <p>If we are not the descendants of our forefathers, what has become of those grandchildren? If we are not a pure race, with whom have we intermarried? Have we intermarried with the Romans, the Greeks, the barbarians who destroyed Rome, or with the Germans, the Slavs, or the people of the romance languages? It seems as though everyone realizes that we Jews have always lived our own lives and have not intermingled with those people. Why, therefore, deny something that everybody knows? They do it because they hate us and want to deprive and rob us of our genealogy.</p>
   <p>After proclaiming his disbelief in the devine origin of the Ten Commandments and pleading that he be excommunicated, Dr. Stephen Wise has raised his voice against the Reform rabbis who are opposed to Yiddish as a [national] language, declaring that those who oppose Yiddish and despise Yiddish are the true heretics who will be punished in the next world. It cannot be said that the <span class="page-break">3</span>high bishop of the New York Free Synagogue is a person of little consequence. On the contrary, he is a person of considerable consequence, particularly when it comes to getting publicity. He received plenty of publicity for his statement in which he denied the divine origin of the Ten Commandments and for his second statement that he was pro-Yiddish as a [national] language. I must say that I marvel at the tolerance of the American Jews. If the same Dr. Stephen Wise would try to pull such stuff in Europe, he would by now have entered the insurance business, or, at least, have retired. But to the Jews of America, nothing is overly important.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow evening,at the meeting of synagogue presidents, rabbis, and civic leaders, our representatives will hear things that they have never heard before because they did not want to hear them. Tomorrow evening they will learn how many M'shulochim [agents representing charitable institutions and theological seminaries] solicit contributions in Chicago, how much of this money reaches the institutions they represent, and how much is pocketed by the M'shulochim.</p>

   <p>I can assure you that this matter will come to a showdown tomorrow. Nothing will be hidden; everything will be revealed. The chaos existing in the field of foreign charities, which leads to theft and fraud on the part of a few parasites, must stop, once and for all. Anyone who opposes the establishment of some degree of order in this field will brand himself as a supporter of vile corruption.</p>
   <p>One central committee must control the whole M'shulochim business. The private trustees must go; otherwise, a central committee cannot function. Only M'shulochim who are endorsed by a responsible committee and who are under the control of that committee, shall be permitted to collect money in Chicago for foreign institutions of charity. This is the only way we can establish order and put an end to the present chaotic system.</p>
