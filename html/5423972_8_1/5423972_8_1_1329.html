   <p>The Fight against Immigration.</p>
   <p>The enemies of immigration were recently defeated in their attempt to obtain passage of immigration restriction legislations through Congress. The House Immigration Committee decided to with-hold any legislative recommendations until the Immigration Commission shall have completed its report. This action, as you know, was a compromise. The activity of the enemies of immigration during this last year, has been so great that it brought on a corresponding activity on the part of those who are against immigration restrictions. As a result, Congressmen have been flooded with messages and deputations demanding that they vote such and such a way on the proposed legislation. Due to this pressure on both sides, the House Committee with-held restriction recommendations to such a time, as they will have the commission's complete report.</p>
   <p>Judging from that part of the report that has already been made public, we cannot expect a very favorable report when it is completed.</p>

   <p>We, who oppose immigration restriction as an inhumanitarian movement designed to deny oppressed people from finding a place of haven, are backing to the limit the newly organized society, "The Liberty Immigration Society," whose avowed purpose is to educate the populace through other language newspapers of the hardships and suffering of their fellowmen in the world, and the necessity of finding for them a place of refuge. Enemies of immigration are many and powerful. They seek at all times to present immigration and immigrants in the most unfavorable light and resort to many fallacies in presenting this problem to the public. We can combat this movement only through a strong organization and an educational campaign, thus creating an intelligent public opinion.</p>
   <p>Immigration restriction recommendations are sure to be introduced to the next Congress, this coming December and our forces must be awake so as to be able to combat these restrictions in the most effective manner. The Liberty Immigration Society is now soliciting funds and members. One dollar per year makes you a member and a valued contributor. Send in your dollar and enjoy the blessings of those who seek entrance to this friendly land.</p>
