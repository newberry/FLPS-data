   <p>Two years ago, there were some eight thousand registered Zionists in the city of Chicago, today there are only a thousand. If all goes well, another 2,000 will be enrolled. At best 5,000 members will be enrolled within the next year, but there are in Chicago 300,000 Jews or 70,000 Jewish families. It is true that not every Jew in Chicago is a Zionist, and it is also true that not every Jew in Chicago is conscious of his Judaism, but it is also a fact that there are at least 25,000 Jews in Chicago, mostly heads of families who are proud of their Judaism, who contribute to Jewish funds, and who try to lead a Jewish life. Out of the 300,000 Jews in the city of Chicago, 30,000 may be spoken of as Reformed Jews. Of course, not all Reformed Jews are deserving of this name, because most of them have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>adopted reform only, because they think that it is something better and socially higher than the Orthodox synagogue. They are social climbers, and upstarts, and they are not to be taken seriously as Jews. But still, they are dominated by their own Reformed Rabbis and are therefore an unproductive force from a Jewish point of view. Only a few of them can be expected to take an interest in Zionism, because most of the Reformed Rabbis in the city of Chicago are anti-Zionists, and the Reformed layman apes the Reformed Rabbi.</p>
   <p>Another 70,000 Jews in the city of Chicago, consisting mostly of working men, or small store keepers, do not take an interest in Jewish matters, especially in matters Zionistic. They are partly radicals, or partly would-be radicals, and are controlled and guided by questionable leaders.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>A great many of them are devoted Jews and take their profession very seriously, but the spirit prevailing in the Jewish labor movement in Chicago is not of such a nature as to make the Jewish working men in Chicago devoted Jews. The so-called, "Genossen," professional labor fakers, forming a junta of unscrupulous men, are in control of the situation, and would not stand for any deviation from party politics.</p>
   <p>One can thus say without exaggeration that out of the 300,000 Jews in the city of Chicago, one-third, belonging to the extreme factions, constitutes a non-productive force in Jewish life, and one cannot very well expect them to come to the aid of the Zionist movement. But still, there are 200,000 Jews in Chicago who are neither reformed nor radical. They may not all be Orthodox in the old meaning of the term, and they may not all be conscious nationalists, but they are all Jewishly inclined, and if properly guided, would constitute a great productive force in Jewish life.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>These 200,000 Jews can be made Zionists, because they are in full sympathy with the Zionist cause, and whenever approached to contribute to Zionist funds, they always respond nobly. This being the case, it is surprising that there should not be more than one or two thousand organized Zionists in Chicago. Potentially there are twenty or thirty thousand Zionists in Chicago, but actually there are only 1,000 at present, and there may be a few thousand more if an effort is made to win them over to the organization.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, the difficulties of the Zionist organization in the city of Chicago can be traced to one cause only, to the failure to win over the youth to the Zionist cause. A clever Frenchman once said that the Zionist movement testifies to the fact that the old Jewish people is still a people with young aspirations. It is our candid belief that youth will be more <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in sympathy with Zionism than the older generation, if approached in the right spirit. The energies of the Jewish youth in Chicago have never been utilized for the Zionist organization. The Zionist leaders in the city have always appealed to the elderly Jews in the synagogue and to the middle-aged men in the lodges, but they have never made an effective appeal to the youth, and that is the reason the Zionist organization in the city of Chicago is so small and is not productive. Zionism is to a certain extent a revolutionary idea, because it means to revolutionized Jewish life, and has already revolutionized Jewish life. It is a progressive and aggressive force, and it goes without saying that youth can be more in sympathy with such a cause than the elderly Jews in the synagogue or in the lodges.</p>
   <p>The new administration of the Zionist organization in Chicago will make an attempt to win over the Jewish youth to the cause of Zionism, and, if successful in its efforts, there will be not 1,000 but 10,000 organized Zionists in this city.</p>
