   <p>The North Side, the aristocratic district of Chicago, is becoming a great Jewish center. A conservative account states that about 3000 Jewish families, both foreign and native, live there already. "If it were not for the scarcity of flats," a North Sider said to this correspondent, "we would have 100,000 Jews here." He believes that that number of Jews will live there yet because the Christians are moving to Evanston.</p>
   <p>Jews on the North Side are quite scattered--from Nontrose Boulevard to Juneway Terrace, and from the lake to Clark Street. There is a North Side street called Margate Terrace. It is predominantly Jewish. If it were not for Mr. William Lorimer who but recently moved there, it could have been said that upon this street there were no non-Jews. Lorimer is a friendly person and is very welcome to the neighborhood, for he <span class="page-break">2</span>has lived among Jews on Fourteenth Street and later on Douglas Boulevard, so that now he is also entitled to live in the new "ghetto". If it is desired to know where the new Jewish ghetto of Chicago is, one has only to ask, "Where does William Lorimer live?"</p>
   <p>But back to the subject. The North Side is becoming a great Jewish center, possessing a Jewish youth which observes Jewish traditions. As proof, we point to the synagogues erected and those yet in the process of construction.</p>
   <p>Details regarding the new "ghetto" will appear shortly in the Courier.</p>
