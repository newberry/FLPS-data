   <p>The problem of the Jew who lives in the country was discussed at the Zionist convention. The representatives of the small towns complained that Chicago doesn't do much for them and demanded that in the future Chicago should do more for them. "Chicago only wants money from us," a delegate from a small town cried out in a melancholy voice, "and that is all. Chicago doesn't care whether we are in a position to raise the money. Chicago doesn't care whether we progress or not."</p>
   <p>We do not know what the administration of the midwestern region replied to this criticism, but we do know that we Chicagoans are in the same position with regard to New York, that the New Yorkers are in the same position with regard to London, and that the Londoners are in exactly the same position <span class="page-break">\2</span>with regard to Palestine. We are all equal because we have equal duties.</p>
   <p>Palestine must be built. There is an urge and a will to build in Palestine--and this will cries out: Give! Give! Palestine does not ask whether London is making progress, whether London is becoming more [conscious of its] Zionist and Jewish duties, whether London is happy and content--Palestine demands money from London, money to buy land, money to build the country, money for houses, money of settling the Halutzim, and so on, London does not give a great deal of money to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], London does not give much money to other Jewish causes because the English Jews still think in terms of the sixpence and shilling. London cannot telegraph to Warsaw, Wilno, Odessa, Minsk, Pinsk, Berlin, or Vienna and demand money because those Jewish centers of earlier days are now destroyed. Moscow and St. Petersburg are forbidden to give money, and, therefore, London has to telegraph to New York for money, and, as New York gives <span class="page-break">\3</span>comparatively less than any other city in America, New York has to appeal to Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh, and so on. Those Jewish centers must appeal to the so-called country Jew. This the country Jew should understand. He ought to know that he is not the victim of a Jewish [pressure] group, that he is not being victimized or exploited, but that he is in approximately the same position as the city Zionist. Palestine demands money from the Jewish people, and it is of no consequence who gives the money, whether it be the urban or the rural Jew. The Jew from the small town gives proportionately more because it is easier to reach him than it is to reach the Jew in a big city. This arouses in the country Jew a feeling that he is being victimized.</p>
   <p>The rural Jew gives proportionately more than the urban Jew, but he has fewer worries and fewer problems to solve than the Jew in New York, Philadelphia, or Chicago. Jewish life in a small town is simple and natural. A slaughterer and a canter who can deliver a sermon occasionally, solve all the problems of religious, educational, and cultural life. By contrast, Jewish life in a big <span class="page-break">\4</span>city is very complicated. The group of Jews who are active in Jewish community life are always worried, always occupied, always trying to solve certain organizational problems which would make it possible for a Jew to enjoy his Judaism.</p>
   <p>Chicago, for instance, has a large and complicated educational problem. The small town doesn't have that problem. Chicago has various organizational problems which the small town doesn't have. Even if the urban Jew gave proportionately less money than the rural Jew, the urban Jew's contribution would still be adequate because he gives his time, energy, talent, and knowledge to create a certain type of Jewish life.</p>
   <p>The rural Jew should not think that he is being victimized. Taking everything into consideration, rural and urban Jews are equal as far as their work for the Jewish people is concerned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The country Jew is in a position to give more because his life is simpler, because it is easier for him to maintain a Jewish atmosphere in his home than it is for the city Jew who is besieged by innumerable temptations which life in a big city presents, and which he is not always able to withstand. It is quite a problem and a difficult task for the city Jew to remain a Jew and to keep up his Jewish life. It is no problem at all for the country Jew. The country Jew may give more of his money, but the city Jew gives more of his time, energy, and spirit, and, in the final analysis, both contributions are equal.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, neither wise nor just on the part of the country Jew to believe that he is a victim of city Jews. He is not. Both live under different circumstances and both give and act in accordance with their circumstances.</p>
   <p>We all have equal duties to our God, our people, and our country. [Translator's note: The last three lines of this editorial could not be translated as they are partly torn out.]</p>
