   <p>It is a known fact that since stringent measures were taken against different "red light districts," the vice racketeers have found residential districts in which to resume their infamy.</p>
   <p>Some of these racketeers have selected the West Side, and still worse - the Jewish district.</p>
   <p>Let us give credit to whom it is due. It is a fact that the police of the Maxwell Street Station do everything that is possible to eradicate this plague which is infectious and when it becomes implanted into a district is like a cancer that keeps on growing after several operations.</p>
   
   <p>Hardly a week goes by without the police raiding a suspected immoral house and capturing those accused of disorderly conduct. Unfortunately, the police cannot accomplish very much.</p>
   <p>The police can only cooperate when they procure strong evidence against a disorderly house. Only then can the police arrest the criminals and turn them over to justice. But in order to get strong evidence the police must resort to men whose reputations are not the very best. Decent men do not visit such houses. When such evidence is brought into court, especially before the judge, the accused engaged lawyers who distort all facts of the case and the verdict is "not guilty." Then they resume their "business" and the police do not take the trouble to make any further arrests.</p>
   
   <p>In order to root out this plague from the Jewish district, the Jewish residents of each neighborhood should cooperate. Let every man and woman get acquainted with the neighbors who reside in his block and when he learns that a new family, having a few unemployed "daughters" and "cousins" who indulge in hilarities at night, has suddenly moved in, that keeps aloof from the "immediate neighbors," the police station should be informed about it. Perhaps the police will be unable to get true information which could be used in arraigning this "family" before justice, but nevertheless it can station a detective to be on the lookout and thereby "spoil their business" which will ultimately cause the family to move out of that district.</p>
   <p>The discovery of such a house of illrepute at 1312 Newberry Ave., in the heart of the Jewish neighborhood where there are many Jewish families having grownup daughters, is a disgrace for the Jewish people and Jewish neighborhood. It is a neighborhood composed of Jews, synagogues, and especially Jewish business, and from early morning until late at night, especially now, due to the intense heat, the sidewalks and porches are transformed into homes, and it has been practically an impossibility to conceal the existence of this ill-reputed house.</p>
   <p>Help eradicate this shame from the Jewish district. Do it for your children's sake so that they might not become victims of this plague.</p>
