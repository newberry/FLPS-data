   <p>A Hanukah feast was served in the banquet hall of Kehilath Anshe Mayriv, the oldest Jewish Reform congregation in Chicago, last Thursday evening. The chief guests were the Catholic and Protestant representatives. It was a feast of "brotherhood" among the Jews and the Christians, and many compliments were exchanged.</p>
   <p>The Hanukah feast was arranged by the congregation of Kehilath Anshe Mayriv. Seventy Jewish guests were invited. Each guest was to bring a Christian friend who was introduced as "my best Christian friend". At the head of the table were seated both rabbis of the congregation, Tobias Schanfarber and Solomon [B.] Freehof; the Catholic priest, Father Joseph Reiner, dean of Loyola University; and the Reverend Ralph Davis, pastor of the Hyde Park Presbyterian Church. The feast lasted three hours. The clergymen praised the Jews in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their speeches, and the rabbis, in return, complimented the Christians.</p>
   <p>Reverend Ralph Davis, who was introduced by the president of Kehilath Anshe Mayriv as "our good friend and neighbor", gave a lengthy talk in which he said that we should no longer think in terms of the intolerant concepts of the Middle Ages. We should now live peacefully like brothers, respecting each other's convictions and working together in a mutually sympathetic and friendly manner. Then Father Reiner, dean of Loyola University, was introduced. He said that he preached intolerance, but that he was intolerant only toward the criminal, the immoral, and the home breaker. Rabbi Freehof ended his speech, the last of the evening, with these words: "How unimportant are the things that divide us, and how great are the things we have in common!"</p>
