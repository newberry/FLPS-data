   <p>The case of Mr. H. Cohen and son versus Casimer Lota and other Poles in South Chicago for inciting a pogrom has been set for July 24. The plaintiffs claim that Mr. Cohen enticed a Polish youth into his store and put him to death for the purpose of using his blood for Jewish Matzos.</p>
   <p>The Cohens appeared in court before Judge Gemill with Mr. A. Cohen, from the law firm of Biden, Cohen, and Murphy. He asked the judge to set the trial for a later date because he had no witnesses present. Casimer Lota and the other defendants came to court with their lawyers who agreed to have the trial postponed. The judge then ruled that the trial be set for July 24.</p>
   <p>It was quiet in South Chicago yesterday--quiet to the extent that there were no gangs parading along Buffalo Avenue as there were on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Poles merely raged in their saloons and in some of their grocery stores.</p>
   
   <p>Thanks to the steps taken by Chief of Police Garrity, at the request of the Courier, yesterday passed without any trouble because one hundred extra policemen had been sent out.</p>
   <p>Also because of the police, the Poles did not strike yesterday for Tom Mooney, an opportunity which would have permitted them to start a pogrom against the Jews just as Poles in Rumania strike against their overlords, and thereby vent their wrath upon the Jews, accusing them of exploitation.</p>
   <p>The boycott against Jewish stores in South Chicago is growing. Poles are still whispering about a "murdered Polish youth", and thus the boycott propaganda advocated in the local Polish newspapers has spread.</p>
