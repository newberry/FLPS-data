   <p>One of the pressing problems facing American Jewry, and calling for an early solution, is that of the country Jew. Throughout the length and breadth of the United States, in villages, hamlets and townlets, there are scattered many thousands of Jewish families who, in so far as their Jewish life is concerned, are completely isolated from the rest of their people. There may be only two or three such families in a village. They, as a rule, are prosperous owners of the leading shops and occupants of the finest homes of the place. Spiritually, however, they are strangers among strangers. They have not even the semblance of an organized Jewish life to remind them that they are Jews; yet they know they are people. They know that "man doth not live by bread alone," that their growing children should and must have a Jewish education. But this they can in no wise obtain. The result is a growing estrangement from Jews and the Jewish faith. Judaism can thrive only through knowledge, but these country Jews are doomed to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>ignorance, and where the parents have at least the memories of their childhood days in the religious atmosphere of the old world to bind them to their people, their children are without even such safeguards against their submergence and utter assimilation with the non-Jewish population.</p>
   <p>The menace to the religious life of the country Jew has long been recognized by the leaders of American Jewry. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations some twenty years ago organized its Synagogue and School Extension Department for the special purpose of aiding these isolated country Jews in their struggle against submersion and assimilation. Agents were sent out to visit as many of the towns and villages as could be reached, Sunday schools were organized and placed in charge of local young men and young women, and an attempt was even made to have weekly or bi-weekly services held for such country people by rabbis from neighboring communities. The problem, however, has not been solved, and has even grown more acute. The Synagogue and School Extension Department could only reach a few of such isolated communities, and the system of having rabbis of nearby places visit <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>them could not be successful for the reason that such rabbis have their own work to do and cannot always be spared by their congregations. A sporadic effort to have religious services is almost as bad as no effort at all, and Sunday Schools that are in charge of young men and women who in most cases are themselves ignorant of Hebrew, the Bible and the tenets of Judaism, are at best but a makeshift for Jewish education, however much praise and credit the Union of American Hebrew Congregations deserves for its willingness and anxiety to save the country Jew from the spiritual death that awaits him.</p>
   <p>In the last twenty years the Jewish population in the United States has about doubled, and while the majority of the newcomers settled in the East, and helped to swell the already large Jewish centers of the great Eastern cities, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of country Jews, thus adding to the severity of the problem. Moreover, a new phase has developed meriting consideration. The American country Jew often presents a problem within a problem. There are some country towns and villages where a Reform <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>congregation and a Temple exist, but where the Orthodox Jews are too few to have their own Synagogue and Talmud Torah [Hebrew School]. Their boys and girls go to the Sunday School of the Reform Temple where no discrimination is made and where all Jewish children are welcome. Their parents, however, are not very happy over this fact. They would prefer to have their children brought up in a more traditional atmosphere, and to have them receive a more thorough grounding in the Hebrew language and [in] the Jewish ceremonials and observances than what the average Reform Sunday School offers. Yet they are too few and too poor to have a Talmud Torah or even a special teacher for the education they would give to their young. For them the problem remains unsolved even with the Temple and the Sunday School which are not to them expressive of the religious life they have known from their childhood days.</p>
   <p>Such isolated Orthodox Jews hold on to their Judaism "by the skin of their teeth". Without sacrificing any of their business interests which are paramount with them as with the others, they nevertheless do what they can by way of religious observance. The Yiddish newspaper is a daily or weekly visitor to remind them of the bonds that connect them with their people.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>They will pray as often as an opportunity is offered, and when a Yahrzeit [anniversary of the death of a loved one] occurs they will even go to the nearby town to say Kaddish [a prayer for the dead] at the Synagogue. But they feel the futility of their Jewish existence in the midst of their alien environment and are unhappy over it, sometimes even to the extent of deciding to sacrifice their business and property and to remove to one of the larger Jewish centers where the spectre of their children's intermarriage will not stare them daily in the face.</p>
   <p>It is not easy to offer a solution to this vexatious problem. American Jewry, now nearly four million strong, is still in the need of organization. There is ample wealth among us to provide the necessary means for the re-Judaization of the country Jew, to have paid itinerant rabbis and teachers in sufficient numbers to cover the entire country, to have a well-planned-out system of visiting all of the rural settlements, and of combining two or more of them for the purpose of teaching religion, of holding services, or of even building Synagogues. A special large fund <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>is needed, and one that shall be used for religious needs of the Orthodox as of Reform Jew. But such a fund will not be forthcoming until the various religious factions in our midst, having recognized the seriousness of the existing situations in rural Jewry, will have united to combat the evil and to reorganize American Jewish life in a manner to afford a Jewish education for the few as for the many.</p>
