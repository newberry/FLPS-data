   <p>The immigration committee of the Order "B'nai B'rith" decides to demand of the government that it maintain an open door policy for immigrant Jews from stricken countries.</p>
   <p>The above was decided at the "B'nai B'rith" convention after Mr. Harry Cutler, chairman of the immigration committee of the order, gave a report of his conversation with President Taft, on this question. The convention is now entertaining the idea of protesting to the Congress of the United States regarding a proposed policy of restricting immigration of Jews into this country.</p>
   <p>The convention was officially opened yesterday morning, with Mr. Marcus of Cleveland, duly elected as the new Grand Master. The outgoing Grand Master is, Mr. Adolph Krause of Chicago.</p>
