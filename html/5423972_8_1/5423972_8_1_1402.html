   <p>Last night at the meeting of the Jewish Fourth of July Committee in the Lawndale Club, plans were formulated with reference to the way all Chicago Jews should celebrate this great holiday on a large scale.</p>
   <p>The program of the day will begin with a great parade, the first Jewish parade since America entered the war, and will end with a tremendous open-air mass meeting in Douglas Park.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. Harris, who has had experience in organizing and leading parades, was chosen as captain of the parade. The committee, therefore, asks all synagogues, lodges, unions, societies, and organizations, to communicate with the captain of the parade, whose address is 838 West Twelfth Street. In this celebration all factions of Jewry will participate, conservative as well as liberal.</p>
   
   <p>The meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Mr. Emil N. Zola, chairman of the Fourth of July celebration committee.</p>
