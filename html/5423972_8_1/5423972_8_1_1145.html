   <p>The Federated Orthodox Charities and The Associated Charities of Chicago have decided to respond to the appeal of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and will do their duty to help make the $50,000 campaign for the Sheltering Home a success.</p>
   <p>The Associated Charities in accordance with its constitution are not permitted to give any money, in a case like this, but the members of the board, agreed to guarantee a collection of $5,000.</p>
   <p>The Federated Orthodox Charities accepted a similar proposal. They are not allowed to give any money directly from their fund, but have promised to submit one tenth of the total income of their next "drive" approximately $5,000, to the Immigrant Aid Society. The labor organisations of Chicago, together with the United Trades, will take an active part and have already started a fund. Comrade, S. P. Kramer, managing editor of the Forward, was appointed treasurer.</p>
