   <p>Shortly after the World's Fair of 1893, the Western Star was organized by a group of Chicago men and women.</p>
   <p>William A. Jonesi, a lawyer, was the leader of the group and was made Grand Master and was reelected on numerous occasions. The most prominent men who worked with him were: Joseph Epstein, Adolph Bonde, H. M. Barnett, Nathan T. Brenner, Dr. George Sultan, Morris Eller, Isaac Shapiro, and Julius Jaffe. Most of these men served at one time or another as Grand Master of the order.</p>
   <p>Morris Eller and Isaac Shapiro have both served as secretary. Ever since the organization was founded, that office was divided between these two men, and to them is due the credit that the order is still in existence.</p>
   <p>Although the World War crippled most of the fraternal societies, and restrictive immigration wrought havoc among Jewish fraternal orders, the Western Star is still functioning. It has many lodges, scattered all over the country, and in case of the death of a member, it pays a $500 insurance claim.</p>
