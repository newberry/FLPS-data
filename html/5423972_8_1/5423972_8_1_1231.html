   <p>The local Zionist organization asks all Jews, who during this holiday season have pledged donations for the Redemption Fund, to pay their promised shares as soon as possible. Palestine cannot be built on promises. Payments must be made in the synagogues, or at the Zionist office.</p>
   <p>The following sums were received yesterday by the Zionist Bureau, Ashland Block Building:</p>
   <p>Rodti Zadec (an organization), in answer to an appeal made by Judge Hugo Pam, gave $1500; Ohavee Sholom, in appeal made by Rabbi Silver, $1000; Rabbi Shochet's appeal at the Beth Orin, $120.</p>
   <p>The United States lodge, Progressive Order of the West, responded, as every year, with a $50 donation to the appeal of Max Schulman and Harry Wolf.</p>
