   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>I have the honor to submit to you the following report of the West Side Religious School.</p>
   <p>In September, 1912, we resumed our regular work at the Jewish Training School Building. Owing to commercial and industrial changes in the immediate neighborhood, we noticed some changes in our membership. A few of our pupils had moved farther west and were unable to come back to us, as they had religious scruples about riding on the Sabbath. In spite of the peculiar conditions of the neighborhood, we have an enrollment of four hundred pupils.</p>
