   <p>Memorial meetings will be held tonight at seven-thirty in many synagogues of the city to honor the memory of the late ex-President Woodrow Wilson, whose body will be laid in eternal rest today. Chicago Jews will thus have the opportunity to express openly their sorrow at the death of one of the best friends they ever had in the non-Jewish world. It is expected that every synagogue will be crowded and that many people, as Americans and as Jews, will attend the memorial meetings.</p>

   <p>The more Jews there are present at the memorial meetings in the synagogues, the more credit will be reflected on the local Jewish community--the greater will be the respect expressed for the friend of the Jews.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson has done us many favors. He has shown us true friendship, in behalf not only of the American Jews, but of the Jews of the entire world. Let us, therefore, crowd the synagogues, and take part in the holy memorial meetings.</p>
   <p>These are the important things which the ex-President Wilson did for the Jews: The first time ex-President Wilson showed his friendly feeling toward Jews was when he appointed Louis D. Brandeis as justice of the Supreme Court, in spite of the great opposition that arose against that appointment.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson vetoed anti-immigration bills three times because they were <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>aimed against the Jews. Woodrow Wilson wrote a letter to Dr. Stephen S. Wise, in which he declared himself in favor of Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people. This letter later made it possible for the English government to issue the well-known Balfour declaration.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson appointed Morgenthau and then Elkus as ambassador to Turkey, Felix Warburg as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Bernard Baruch, Julius Rosenwald, and other great Jews to posts of honor, which appointments helped win the great war. During the war, Woodrow Wilson prevented a pogrom by the Russian Army.</p>
   <p>Before he left for France, Wilson had a conference with Stephen S. Wise, Louis Marshall, and Judge Julian W. Mack. He discussed the Jewish problem with them. Woodrow Wilson did a great deal to help the Jewish delegates at the Paris conference win [recognition of the] rights of minorities. Keep all these things in your mind; remember them!</p>

   <p>The public is asked to come on time to the above-mentioned synagogues because the services will begin promptly at seven-thirty. Jews are expected to behave with dignity at these meetings. It is expected that the memorial meetings will be conducted in a respectful, and impressive manner.</p>
