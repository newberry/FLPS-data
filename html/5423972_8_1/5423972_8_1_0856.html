   <p>The thousands of Jewish organized workers of Chicago, who are citizens, are urged by the United Hebrew Trades to vote against the new proposed constitution (for Illinois), December 12. This decision, to agitate against the constitution, was accepted yesterday, at a special meeting of the executive board, by the United Hebrew Trades, after thoroughly discussing the issue. A resolution was read, which was unanimously adopted at the convention of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, urging all trades unions to conduct a campaign against the new constitution.</p>
   <p>The executive board, of the United Hebrew Trades, has decided to invite all central labor bodies to a conference, where they shall appoint three delegates, who will attend the meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, Sunday morning, November 5, in the Workmen's Circle Lyceum, to elaborate plants as how to carry on a written and oral campaign against the constitution, which deprives many privileges from citizens of Illinois and especially from Chicago.</p>
