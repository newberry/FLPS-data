   <p>At the annual meeting of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, held last July in Baltimore, a committee of eleven was appointed to prepare a uniform ritual for the United States. The committee met last week in New Orleans. Dr. I. S. Moses of Chicago, the secretary of the committee, was present.</p>
   <p>The committee considered the Friday evening and Saturday morning services, and also the morning and evening services for the festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. Dr. Moses, some time ago prepared a book of services, based upon the rituals in use in the various congregations and this was adopted as the ground work. The compilation was so satisfactory that, with a few changes, it was approved and referred to the editorial committee and to the committee on liturgy and Hebrew translation.</p>
