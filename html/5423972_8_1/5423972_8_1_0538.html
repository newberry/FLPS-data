   <p>At their conference in New York, the Reform Jews declared that one of the troubles from which the American Jews suffer, but which is not responsible for the growing anti-Semitism, is the Yiddish language.....Should the American Jews cease speaking Yiddish, their salvation would immediately be at hand. On the other hand, the Yiddishists claim that as soon as all the American Jews speak Yiddish only, salvation will definitely come. The truth is that salvation will come as soon as we rid ourselves of both the Reform Jews and the Yiddishists because each is a group that constantly isolates itself and establishes its own Shulhan Aruch [Orthodox legal code governing all phases of Jewish religious life]. A people can exist and have a future only when it follows one Shulhan Aruch.</p>
