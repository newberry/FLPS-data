   <p>A group of young men and women held a conference last Sunday evening at the La Salle Hotel, and discussed what they would do to aid the Zionist membership campaign and the "open-air meetings". They finally accepted the motion to "buckle down" to work. We can expect to see many more Zionists registered in Chicago very soon.</p>
   <p>These young men and women will have the assistance of Leon Zolotkoff, Meyer Goldberg, M. Abrahams, Charles Gefen, B. Jenkin, D. Hirsch, M. Gordon, Charles Mishkin, William Weinstein, Yitsicksohn, Max Cohen, and H. Melovski.</p>
