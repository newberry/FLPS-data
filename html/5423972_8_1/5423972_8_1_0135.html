   <p>Last Friday in the Desplaines Street Police Station in Chicago, there appeared for trial two Jewish peddlers who bought junk, amounting to a few pennies, from boys under fourteen years of age. The judge fined them $15.00 each. Neither of the two peddlers was in a position to pay the fine, and the judge had enough consideration to release them on their own bonds until after Passover. From all outward appearances, it would seem that the peddlers really did not know that it is against the law to buy junk from minors. The law assumes that when one buys lead pipe, or junk from a small boy, one probably knows that it is not honestly acquired merchandise, and one can be charged with buying stolen goods and face imprisonment. Whether or not the peddlers knew this is not the concern of the judge. The latter declared that if the boys are decoyed into offering such things for sale, they will seek places where they can find these articles. And in due time they become thieves and criminals, tearing out pipes and hydrants in vacant houses.</p>

   <p>We have quite a number of Jews who earn their livelihood by peddling junk, and for their sake, we find it necessary to admonish them. We know that these Jews have a tough struggle, that most of them are not familiar with the rigidity of the law, and others, who are familiar with the law, cannot deny the temptation of buying in order to earn a few pennies. We have seen enough Jewish troubles arising from such "temptations" to know that it is always very costly. The boys are brought into the Juvenile Court where they identify the one to whom they sold the junk. Apart from the trouble caused the peddler, such an incident also tends to injure his reputation. Consequently, from time to time, voices are heard in favor of suppressing the whole business, or of fixing the cost of a license so high that it will not pay to be a peddler.</p>
   <p>The peddlers who recite their morning prayers should bear in mind that when they say "lead me not into temptation," this also goes for pipes and scrap iron and other such articles bought from minors. Those who do not worship, should remember this fact in dealing with such customers; they will eventually be caught, and they should realize that this "temptation" is not profitable.</p>
