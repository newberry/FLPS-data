   <p>Since the formation of the Ghetto on the West Side, Jefferson Street, has been the market-place for the Jews, it became one of the sights of Chicago and visitors often came to see the Jewish market on their way to New Orleans to visit the French-market.</p>
   <p>This thoroughfare is now destined to be entirely closed up and the Ghetto-market will have to find other quarters. The Pennsylvania Railroad intends to build a new station in the vicinity and is laying up property on Jefferson Street for the purpose of laying tracks there. The West Side Jews are loudly protesting the destruction of their old landmark.</p>
