   <p>During last year only twenty-eight lynchings took place in the United States. Although this number of lynchings in one year is more than what could be desired, yet it is the smallest ever recorded, and the fact that only twenty-eight negroes were brutally destroyed by the "civilized" white Americans, shows that things are getting better instead of worse. But the question is whether this small number of lynchings is due to a changed attitude or it is just accidental. Could it be possible that the hearts of the "civilized" whites are softening towards their persecuted colored brothers? Have the white lynchers been convinced at last that these brutal and cruel lynchings should be eradicated? Is this the reason why only twenty-eight negroes were lynched last year, or is it because they had no opportunity to lynch more of them ?</p>

   <p>It is true that in the South the movement against lynchings has gained ground. There are many reasons why this movement should gain strength, as not all the whites in the South are lynchers. There have been whites in the South opposed to lynchings, and their influence has gained strength since lately, partly due to the fact that this practice was liable to become a Federal offense, and partly as a result of the migration of negroes from the Southern to the Northern states. The law proposed in Congress making lynching a Federal offense has scared the aristocrats of the Southern states out of their wits. Such a law would give the Federal Government the right to interfere in the affairs of the Southern States, the same states that once rebelled against the Federal Government for the latter's interference in their interior activities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>These States are opposed to any move the Federal Government may contemplate to strengthen its power over them, and not only did the Democratic leaders of the South out up an energetic struggle against the lynching law proposed in Congress, but also the law-abiding element began to organize themselves to combat lynching, in the hope that they would be able to suppress it before the Federal Government had a chance to interfere.</p>
   <p>Then again, the white aristocrats of the South were afraid to see so many negroes leaving the States, as with this migration went their supply of free slaves. In some regions the exodus became so acute that there were not enough men left to supply the demand for help in the plantations. The new problem brought about a change of attitude, that is, the aristocrats became friendlier towards the negroes, lest they all <span class="page-break">4</span>would flee away from the South. This is the reason why the movement against lynching gained strength. There is no question that the fear of Federal interference and the shortage of labor are the factors that brought about this drop in the number of lynchings.</p>
   <p>In the South it is common to see judges and juries treating with respect the lynchers who are brought before them. In nearly all cases they turn them free. To this day, lynching negroes in the South is not a law violation whereby one can be penalized. One cannot find today there a jury that will return a verdict of guilty against the lynchers. This being the case, there is nothing to feel merry about in the fact that cruel bloodthirsty lynchings in the South are decreasing, unless the attitude of the Southern white population towards lynchers start to change for the better. If there is no penalty for a lyncher, if every-one <span class="page-break">5</span>who lynches a negro is set free, then one will always find enough beasts among the Southern whites that will at the least provocation, quench their thirst for blood with the lynching of a negro.</p>
   <p>Not until the white aristocrats in the South are brought to justice and penalized for lynching negroes, their lynchings to be considered as just plain murder, can one say that they now respect the negroes or have changed their attitude towards them. Under the circumstances, the diminished number of lynchings in the South during last year can be considered as accidental, or as the result of temporary politics-economic motives that have forced the States to apply more energy in avoiding so many lynchings, not as a change of the general attitude of the whites towards the negroes in the South.</p>
