   <p>The Zionists of Chicago have at last realized that Judaism is the best propaganda for Zionism. The Zionist organization, in order to keep its new members and to enroll additional members, should participate in all Jewish undertakings, and particularly in Jewish educational and cultural work. The Zionists now have sufficient numbers and ample means to do something worth while. The success of the new policy will depend upon two things: the skill of the Zionists workers who will participate in all Jewish undertakings, and the way in which the masses respond to their work. The Zionist organization, for instance, can conduct classes in Hebrew, but the undertaking will be a failure if only a few people take advantage of those classes. Chicago, however, is a large Jewish city, and I hope that a sufficient number of people will always be found in Chicago who will respond willingly to every appeal made by the Zionists to participate in every educational and cultural activity.</p>
