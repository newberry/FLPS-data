   <p>The first registration day this year falls on Yom Kippur and all efforts of Election Commissioner Bernard Horwich to have this date changed were in vain because this is a matter which has to do with state law. Mr. Horwich will try to influence County Judge Scully to excuse all Jewish [election] judges and clerks from service on this day and it is believed that he will be successful. The Jewish population will be able to register on the second registration day, which will occur ten days later.</p>
   <p>The many polling places in Jewish barber shops and stores will seek to obtain the privilege of opening the polls only after sundown on Yom Kippur.</p>
