   <p>A few Poale Zion workers have organized a society in Chicago, last week, whose object is to build a small garden city in Palestine on a cooperative basis. The garden city will be established on an industrial cooperative plan, together with the tilling of the soil. Every member will be engaged at work in the cooperative factory and also as a colonist on the land. The first committee consists of M. Schuchter, A. Kaplan, David Rosenfield, F. Ganz, B. Wick. The next meeting will be held at the National Socialist Institute 3322 Douglas Blvd, Wednesday.</p>
