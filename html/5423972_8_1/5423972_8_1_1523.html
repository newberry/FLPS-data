   <p>Thanks from First Rumanian Synagogue.</p>
   <p>Many thanks to the visitors on our Hanukah Festival and particularly the many donors who cooperated with us in making this Chanukah celebration a success. We especially thank Miss Canal who presented us with a new silk curtain for the holy Ark. Two candelabra, each with six candles, were lighted with impressive ceremony in honor of the sixth day of Chanukah.</p>
   <p>We also thank our Sabbath school teacher, Miss Anna Goldberg, who in honor of the Chanukah Festival, presented us with a Bible. She and her pupils sang the national songs. Every visitor had a most enjoyable time. We also thank our worthy president, Jos. Cohen, who made all the preparations for the Festival, at his own expense. We wish him good luck and hope that he will live to see many more Chanukah Festivals.</p>
