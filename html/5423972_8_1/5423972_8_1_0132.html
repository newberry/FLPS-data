   <p>A committee of Jewish peddlers approached the mayor's office yesterday requesting that they be protected from attacks by Poles and hoodlums who waylay them in the alleys and streets of Chicago. Upon hearing their demands, the mayor's secretary immediately dictated a letter to the Board of Education. It instructed school principals to warn boys against molesting the peddlers. And what is more, the mayor's secretary went with the committee to Chief of Police Garrity instructing him to give orders to policemen to protect the peddlers.</p>
   <p>The committee which took this action consisted of Mr. Joseph Abelson, business agent of the "Citizens Peddlers Association," Messrs. Leibovitch, Wolf, Gilbert and Sobel.</p>
