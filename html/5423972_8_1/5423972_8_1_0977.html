   <p>All the Keren Hayesod workers of Chicago will gather on Monday evening at the Congress hotel to open the city Keren Hayesod campaign under the guidance of David Brown of Detroit. Every Keren Hayesod worker will be present on Monday evening at the Congress Hotel to receive instructions from the city chairman, Max Shulman, and from Mr. Brown. All the workers will be asked to begin to work immediately. They will have to see many people, and if they do not wear heavy-soled shoes, they should get tourists' shoes. The work which will begin on Tuesday morning must be finished on May 14, which means that it must be done speedily.</p>
   <p>We will not see in this year's Keren Hayesod drive a person that took a prominent part in all former drives. Our beloved grandfather, Mr. H. M. Barnett, suffers now from ill health. Mr. Barnett was an active Keren Hayesod worker and has <span class="page-break">\2</span>done much for it in the synagogues, where he is very influential. All the Keren Hayesod workers of Chicago regret very much that their beloved grandfather will not participate in this year's drive. They all wish him a speedy and complete recovery.</p>
