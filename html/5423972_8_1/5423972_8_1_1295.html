   <p>The Jewish National Workers Alliance, organized only a few years ago, took out its charter Jan. 6, 1913.</p>
   <p>Its charter is the best of any order in the country, fully in accord with the latest insurance demands and government laws. Its insurance system, being the same as that of an insurance company, is one of the best in America.</p>
   <p>The organization releases policies of from $100 to $2,000. It also carries sick benefits of $10.</p>
   <p>The order is a body of Jewish workers, nationalistically inclined. The Alliance is national radical in its mission, progressive in its conduct, modern in its insurance system, and has much in its activities for the Jewish masses.</p>
   
   <p>The order is comparatively a young one, not having had the opportunity to become known everywhere. Yet, it has nearly 80 branches in 13 cities of America, and main offices in New York.</p>
   <p>Every Jew nationalistically inclined should belong to this organization; everyone opposed to the destruction of the Jewish people, who wishes to fight against assimilation, and every worker should become a member.</p>
   <p>The Alliance will set aside the week beginning Nov. 27th, throughout the entire country, for mass meetings, lectures, literary, and agitation meetings for the purpose of acquainting the Jewish masses with the ideas, aims and practical activities of the Alliance, and this is bound to bring success.</p>
   <p>The Alliance has every opportunity to develop and grow during this agitation week, if everyone will do his duty and bring a prospect for membership.</p>
