   <p>A very enthusiastic meeting of delegates and members of the Zionist convention committee was held last night in Judge [Hugo] Pam's courtrooms.</p>
   <p>From the many reports one could tell that the twenty-second Zionist Convention, to be held in Chicago from the 12th to the 18th of September, will be an historic gathering. It is a meeting of Jewish representatives at a time when the doors to Palestine, as a permanent home for the Jews, will soon be opened.</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Shulman, Nathan D. Kaplan and Major [Julian] Mack told the audience of all the plans by which they hope to make the convention a great success.</p>
   <p>Judge Pam, chairman of the convention [committee], appealed to everyone to help in this great task. He also left last night for New York to confer with Zionists there about the convention.</p>

   <p>Mr. S. B. Komaiko was appointed by Judge Pam a member of the publicity committee.</p>
