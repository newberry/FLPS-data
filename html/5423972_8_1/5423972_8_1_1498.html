   <p>Chanucah is already at our door. The holiday of great Jewish heroism, of our one-time powerful battling courage, of victory for self-independence, is once more come in its yearly visit as a reminder of our present weakness, discouragement, and submissive dependence. Every Jew who has not uprooted from his heart the hope of a new national re-birth, must at this time give it thought and ascertain the advancement of this folk dream in the blooming flowers of the erstwhile ruined fields in that land where, thousands of years ago, battles for our rights were fought by the greatest heroes world history every produced, the Macabees.</p>
   <p>If every Jew will stop to think, he will realize that we are now passing through a very important epoch of national history. He will feel that we stand nearer our realization; even more, he will feel that before his very eyes, in our own generation, for our own brothers and sisters, the initial step has already been made. The plow is already at work in those ruined fields, while the hand with the hammer has constructed the first house. The pioneers are now a part of the land, while yet even larger groups are in preparedness to leave their homes and cast themselves <span class="page-break">2</span>wholeheartedly into this great historical work.</p>
   <p>May we remind you of your debt in this problem. In the name of the above-mentioned pioneers and those hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Jewish workers, ready at any moment to come and build a national foundation, we apply for aid in a work you must participate in if there is the least spark of hope in your heart for our folks' redemption.</p>
   <p>The majority of those in Palestine, and the even greater number planning to settle there, are being hindered by various circumstances: the low, hard life of the Arabs, which permits them to work very cheaply, the non-organization of the working crafts, the deep-rooted fear for invasion of charity donors, existing largely in urban Palestine; all are obstacles to be overcome in order to make it possible for Jewish workers to strengthen their position there. These and many other hindrances, too numerous to be mentioned, restrain many, many Jewish workers from settling in Palestine. All these difficulties can be overcome and must be annihilated.</p>
   <p>The International Band of the Poala-Zion has for this purpose established the Palestine Worker's Fund, which has already become known everywhere among Jews, <span class="page-break">3</span>and to increase this fund is of necessity your debt in these days of our national holiday.</p>
   <p>Please remember that the freedom of our people is primarily dependent upon those working forces that are capable of adjusting themselves in Palestine. Remember, too, that without large numbers of workers there can be but little progress.</p>
   <p>Therefore in these days of Chanucah, when you recall the heroes of the "Chashminoyim," renew your hope in the present struggles of our people; the hope of regaining our own freedom. You owe this to yourself for the truth of the statement is: "If not I, who then?"</p>
   <p>This is no donation, but a debt you must pay. If circumstances do not permit you to partake in personally, this work, you can still do much to aid its advancement. Acquaint yourself respectfully with our committees during this week of Chanucah; greet them with joy and prove that you are one in whose heart there still lives the hope of that day when Jews will live and prosper in a Jewish homeland.</p>
