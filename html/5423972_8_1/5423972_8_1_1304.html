   <p>Mr. A. detected a grave crime committed by us Zionists. We have sinned by inviting a Gentile to a Jewish national holiday affair and ignored entirely our Chicago rabbinate and great men. You are startled about the aesthetics of our committee and accuse us of corrupt and personal motives.</p>
   <p>We wish to inform you, Mr. A., that if the invitation of a judge to our national holiday was, in your opinion, not the right thing to do, it was perhaps an error, but no crime. We did not invite the judge to attract a crowd, if you please; nor did we invite him because we are short of Jewish orators! We, Zionists, believe too ardently in the greatness and strength of our own "ego" to resort to foreigners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>If we invited a Gentile to our national celebration, it was not in order that he should speak to us, but, to the Gentiles.</p>
   <p>What was the object of this celebration? Do you not know, Mr. A., the literal significance of a Zionist congress? Do you not know that the Actions Committee worked so hard, in order that this congress should not be a congress by us and for us, but actually to let the entire world know that a Jewish congress is being held, that the Zionist congress is our parliament in the Diaspora? They have, therefore, urged us to stage a gigantic demonstrations, at the same time, in all dwelling places of Israel and this echo shall ring from, one part of the world to another. The voices of the Jewish people shall be heard protesting against their oppressors, and oppression. And the committee <span class="page-break">\3</span>thought that by inviting a great figure from the Gentile nations, it would draw their attention, as well as the attention of the English (printed) press.</p>
   <p>This was our object, if it was not attained and if, in your opinion, we have committee a fallacy in the personality, it was merely a mistake, but under no circumstances, a crime.</p>
   <p>And now concerning the second crime which you have detected, viz., that we have offended the rabbis and other prominent men by excluding them from the program. No, Mr. A., not for the sake of offending them, did we exclude them, not because we underestimated the honor of our Buelzinsky's, Epstein's, Silber's, Cardon's, Levidson's, etc., but on the contrary, we did it because their honor is too beloved by us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>What would you say, Mr. A., if we would have a rabbi speak, and in an open field where tennis was being played on one side and baseball on the other?</p>
