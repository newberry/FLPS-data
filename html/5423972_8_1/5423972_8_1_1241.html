   <p>Today is the memorial of Dr. Theodore Herzl, the father and founder of political Zionism, which, at the present time, is in the process of being realized. Throughout the world, wherever Jews are found, this memorial is observed by holding large mass meetings.</p>
   <p>Such a memorial mass meeting will be held tonight at the Herzl School, Ridgeway, [Douglas] and Lawndale. Federal Judge Julian V. Mack, president of all the affiliated Zionist organizations in America, will be chief speaker.</p>
   <p>As president of the National Zionist organization, Judge Mack has a very important message to deliver to the Jews of Chicago. This is particularly true when the whole Jewish nation is gathering to commemorate the death of the greatest Jewish political leader since the beginning of this protracted Diaspora.</p>

Udelson, all very well-known speakers. The chairman of this memorial meeting, which will begin promptly at eight o'clock, will be Mr. Samuel Cooper, of the Zion League.</p>
