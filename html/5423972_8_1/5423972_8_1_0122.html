   <p>The districts into which our former neighbors have removed are approximately three and a half and five miles respectively from the Institute. One is the great Lawndale district with an approximate Jewish population of 100,000; the other is the Northwest Side, with approximately 75,000 Jews. These districts have grown, particularly the Lawndale district, in so rapid a fashion that it has been most difficult to keep up with their growth.</p>
   <p>In the Lawndale district practically no facility exists for the self-expression of the Jewish people who live there. There is no institution to meet the perfectly natural demand of the residents for an outlet along social, recreational, and intellectual lines. There are some Talmud Torahs which have been established to meet the purely religious needs of the community, but the children have no avenues of self-expression sufficient for their purposes. The young men and the young women are likewise placed in an embarrassing position and have to find means of recreation and social contacts which very often lead into dangerous channels.</p>
   <p>These are no theories. The statements which I have made are based upon facts, facts that stare us in the face and make us ashamed of our neglect.</p>
   <p>In the Juvenile Court, the Boys' Court, and other socialized courts in our city of which formerly it was the Jew's pride to be able to state that so far as he was concerned, they need not exist, he now has to bow his head in shame when he visits them, for in their daily dockets he hears the names of the Goldsteins and the Bernsteins called much oftener than is necessary. This, in my opinion, is because the community was near-sighted and negligent and did not provide the social machinery necessary to give to these boys who today are 18, 20, and 25 years of age the chance, ten years ago, to function as normal children. They consequently found their own methods of social contact, with these results.</p>
