   <p>The proposed peace in the Jewish Congress movement is on the verge of collapse. In response to the referendum, submitted by the Congress organization to all branches, the overwhelming majority of all nationalist organizations answered with an emphatic "no"! This means that they are not satisfied with the peace agreement between the Congress organization and the American Jewish Committee.</p>
   <p>The average Jewish newspaper reader, whose interest in Jewish movements is superficial and apathetic, does not understand why so many societies protested against the peace agreement. Resentment against those who are dissatisfied is now heard. Imagine, Peace! Think of it, Peace! And the nationalists come along and want to prevent it.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>For the benefit of such readers, we wish to make a brief explanation of the whole matter. No one should imagine that the voices against the peace agreement were raised out of caprice or spite. This is a matter concerning two principles which are almost of equal importance, and each must be carefully weighed in order to determine which of the two is more important. And for one who is impartial, it is really hard to decide.</p>
   <p>One principle is the principle of true democratic representation. The Congress will abolish the system of Shetadlanuth [a system whereby the self-appointed few interceded for the many; used here in a derogatory sense]. This is a very good thing. The intercessor is a "self-appointed ruler". He asks no one's opinion. He does things for the people, which he believes should be done and in a way which personally suits him best. If these things prove successful, he demands credit for them; if they fail, he says nothing about them, and, therefore, no one knows anything about his failures. He is not obliged to render an account of his work. Should it be established, the Jewish Congress will, once and for all, put an end to Jewish representation <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>through intercessors. The individuals who will be permitted to speak in behalf of the Jewish people, will be only those representatives who will be elected by the Congress, and they will be obliged to give an account of themselves to their electors.</p>
   <p>This is a splendid principle, and there seems to be no reason why we should vote against a peace which can lead to the establishment of such a Congress.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, however, there is another principle which has, for its supporters, an even greater significance than the Congress. This is a principle which has to do with Jewish nationalism--with the concept of the Jews as a nation. The peace agreement, upon which the referendum was based, has erred greatly with respect to this principle.</p>
   <p>The peace committee, sent by the American Jewish Committee, insisted vigorously that the question of a Jewish nation should not be brought before the Congress. Yes, we can refer to Palestine as a country in which Jews <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>live because Palestine is one of the belligerents; but we must not refer to Palestine as a home for the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>Then there appeared those Jews who consider themselves the children of the Jewish people [that is, Jewish nationalists], and who hope that Zion will be comforted [by the Lord, through redemption]. Such persons ask, Do we need a Congress which denies the power of God?</p>
   <p>How can those elected by the Congress, who do not believe in the existence of a Jewish nation, who do not believe in the hopes and aims of the Jewish people, speak in the name of the Jews? Then we must not forget that the representatives whom the American Jewry will select, will have to speak for the Jews all over the world. And to speak for them, as Jews, and not in the name of the Jewish nation, will be a spurious representation even in the eves of the Gentiles who consider the Jews a nation.</p>
   <p>Beside this, the American Jewish Committee was in favor of having the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Congress convene only once, instead of becoming a permanent institution. If that happened, what sort of a Congress would it be? If, immediately after it convened, the Congress accomplished nothing then to whom would the elected delegates report their activities later on, and from whom would they seek advice?</p>
   <p>Thus, we can see how difficult this question is to decide, regardless of one's eagerness to do the right thing. Every principle has its strong, as well as weak, points. Since it is difficult to reach a decision based on reason, the personality, temperament and natural inclinations of the persons who must vote will enter in. Those who are nationalistically inclined cannot, under any circumstances, decide to vote for a Congress which denies the principle of nationalism. Others who lay more weight on the principle of democratic representation, are ready to sacrifice other principles. In the meantime, it is a difficult question.</p>
