   <p>Many of the most prominent Jews of Chicago and the United States were assembled yesterday in the Jewish temple on 23rd Street and Indiana Avenue. It was assumed at first that this meeting was for the purpose of paying a tribute of honor to Rabbi Wise of Cincinnati. Last Sunday, Rabbi Wise, who already is honored as a patriarch of the representative of Judaism, received a number of visitors in the auditorium, and at this opportunity the meeting, held yesterday, was arranged. Besides the many tokens of esteem extended to the guest of honor, another very important matter came up for discussion; namely, the participation of the Jews at the Congress of Religion at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the secretary, Dr. Joseph Stolz, and B. Bettmann, of Cincinnati, was appointed chairman. The following officiated as vice presidents: J. H. Schiff, A. Moses, J. Freiberg, I. Busch, S. Hirsch. Others present were the United Rabbis, and the Secular Committees of the Central Conference of United Rabbis, and the Union of American Jewish Congregations.</p>

   <p>After Rabbi Wise and Dr. E. G. Hirsch explained the purpose of the Congress of Religion at the World's Fair, Dr. Stolz delivered a powerful speech outlining the plan which is to be sent to all rabbis and eminent Jews of the world. The plan includes a survey on the extent to which the Jews will participate in the Congress of Religion, which will take place from the 11th till the 28th of September. To this Congress the prophets of Judaism are likewise invited, for there should be no missing link in the chain of historic religions.</p>
   <p>There is yet another reason for the participation of the Jews. Although the Jewish religion is over three thousand years old, yet there has never been another religion so misunderstood and misinterpreted. Even today, these misconceptions are expressed through fanatical persecutions by nations marching in the front of civilization. Never before has a better opportunity been offered to the Jews for their own defense than the one at the coming World's Fair in Chicago. To neglect the opportunity for the expounding of our teachings and our aims by our most capable men would be criminal carelessness.</p>

   <p>We must prove that Judaism is indispensable to the highest religion, therefore, the support for and participation in the Congress to represent Judaism, is imperative. It is also intended to give every variation of Judaism a chance to express their opinion freely. We are also requested to attend the conferences of other religions, which will begin on August 28th.</p>
   <p>Following this, Rabbi Wise proposed that the different committees arrange a plan for the regulation and listing of the subjects for discussion. And also to register all theologians and men of learning who will lead the discussions. The final arrangements of the material he proposed to submit to the preliminary conference of the Jews, which will be held on August 28th.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch then presented the resolution that all speakers at the Congress have to submit to the following three rules:</p>
   <p>1. To enter into no discussions of differences of opinions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>2. No controversies against other religions.</p>
   <p>3. No illogical defending of the divine origin of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
   <p>The principal ideas must consist in contributions to the subject of religion, and to the ethical laws of humanity. The hopes and ideals of Judaism, its unique accomplishments, and the historical development of Judaism must be presented.</p>
   <p>This resolution of Dr. Hirsch was accepted. The chairman, Mr. Bettmann, then appointed Rabbi Wise to preside over the Nomination Committee, which is to elect the speakers for the Congress of Religions....The other members of the committee are the following: Dr. A. Moses, Ch. Levy, Dr. I. M. Wise, Dr. Hirsch, and Dr. Stolz.</p>
   <p>The Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon.</p>
