   <p>Statistics regarding languages spoken by the white races in the United States, which have been officially taken on December 2, 1913, show the interesting fact that Jewish and Hebrew are commonly used not only by foreign Jews, but also by those born in this country.</p>
   <p>The census report shows 1,676,762 Jews speak Jewish and Hebrew. Of this number 1,051,767 are foreign-born and 624,695 are native-born.</p>
   <p>The report also shows that these figures are far from being correct, since many Jews have given their mother tongue as being German, English, Polish, etc., and were therefore listed as belonging to those countries. Thus, it is difficult to determine the exact number of Jews in this country. Of the Jewish-speaking people, 838,193 are from Russia; 144, 484 from Austria-Hungary; 41,343 from Roumania; 14,400 from England; 7,910 from Germany.</p>
   <p>Of the Roumanian Jews, 62,7% speak Jewish and Hebrew. In the Russian, 52.3%. All Hebrew-and-Jewish-speaking Jews comprise 5.2% of all other spoken language groups in this country.</p>
