   <p>.....Mr. Rosenthal moved that the Committee on Public Worship be authorized to make arrangements with Mr. Kaufman, our Sabbath School teacher, to perform the duties of reader on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Mr. Loeb offered an amendment to the effect that the reading by members on Yom Kippur, as formerly practiced, be dispensed with. Both motion and amendment were unanimously adopted.</p>
