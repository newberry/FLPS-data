   <p>In order to protect women and girls from brutal murder, John Helpin, detective chief, has issued this warning:</p>
   <p>"Do not make any rendezvous with strangers on the telephone.</p>
   <p>"Do not meet men in any out of the way places if such an agreement has been made on the telephone. It makes no difference who he is, since he may be impersonating someone else.</p>
   <p>"Do not ride in automobiles with strangers.</p>
   <p>"Do not believe every man who tells you he knows your girl friend."</p>
   
   <p>All these "don'ts" are founded on the methods used by Spenser to lure his victims and which led to Miss Ligson's murder.</p>
   <p>George Hopkins, of the Morals Court says: "To do away with such deeds, women and girls must be warned. Twenty-five per cent of the population are subnormal, and therefore, girls should know well their companions and acquaintances and be especially careful of telephone calls from strangers."</p>
   <p>Judge Sabath believes mothers should be educated to rear their daughters properly. This would be the best possible protection.</p>
