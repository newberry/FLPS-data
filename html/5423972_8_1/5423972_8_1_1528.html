   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>In making up our lists of the contributions called for on the eve of Yom Kippur, we find that owing to your absence from the services at the Temple you evidently overlooked making a contribution at that time to the United Hebrew Charities.</p>
   <p>We again enclose a card to you, to call your attention thereto, and only do so by reason of the urgent necessity of calling on all the friends of charity to make their regular annual contributions.....</p>
