   <p>For the past few years an extensive campaign has been in progress in Chicago against noxious moving pictures which are shown to our children. Small children have a strong tendency to ape everything they see, and if killing, robbing, and other such corrupt scenes are placed before them, it affects their fantasy to the extent that they attempt to reproduce everything when at play in their homes.</p>
   <p>Small tots are given the opportunity to witness the greatest human crimes, and many of them have actually become totally corrupt as a result of what they have seen in pictures.</p>
   <p>This condition spurred Child Welfare Organizations to demand that moving pictures be censored before they are given a public showing.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In fact, censorship has been introduced by people who understand the nature of this problem. M. R. Bloch has recently announced, in behalf of the Censors Bureau, that the Bureau will only approve of such pictures as will, above all, be edifying for children. To judge by their activities, it can be readily seen that the censors are in earnest. Last week, all scenes of opium smoking, theft, shootings, etc., werecut out of the pictures.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that the Censors Bureau's action would provoke the theatre owners, and the result was that the latter have organized into a group to combat its work which, it is claimed, will give rise to the danger that moving pictures might cease pleasing the public. This would simply have a disastrous effect upon their business. Whenever there is profit to be made, the future of small children, who are driven to the abyss of corruption and crime by certain moving pictures, is of little concern to the theater owners.</p>
   <p>They have gone so far as to bring the matter before the City Council, purporting <span class="page-break">\3</span>to halt the work of the Censors Bureau. They even threatened those aldermen who refused to support them with retaliation during campaign time by not giving them any publicity in their picture houses.</p>
   <p>To the public at large, it is, however, not a question of profit but a question of preserving our youth, the future citizens of our country. To us the matter should then be of more importance than to anyone else, because the victims of noxious pictures are in reality our own children. Everybody knows how detrimental it is when our youth learn something which we consider a crime. It is our duty to see that our children intermingle with good people in a good environment, so that they may acquire fine habits and conduct themselves accordingly. To condone pictures with criminal scenes means that we ourselves are training our children for criminals.</p>
   <p>The fact that many children neglect their studies is one reason why we should support with all our might the good work of the Censors Bureau. After all, <span class="page-break">\4</span>no one has more to say about this than the people themselves. And if the people will let the theatre owners know that they want the pictures censored by experts, who are competent to decide whether or not the picture is fit to be seen, then no indecent or unfit pictures will be shown to our children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bloch also answered the question whether the Bureau will allow character roles depicting a Jew, an Irishman, or a German. He answered in the affirmative, but added that it will not be permitted, under any circumstances, to ridicule them. We are familiar with the role that characterizes the Jew, a role which only foments hatred and prejudices against the race.</p>
   <p>Not long ago there was featured in Chicago a picture of Jesus in which a Jew conspired against him. In certain scenes a priest poured out his bitter wrath upon the Jews, thereby sowing kernels of anti-Semitism. Such pictures, unquestionably should have been prohibited.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>That is why the Censors Bureau is doubly important to us Jews. Apart from protecting our children, such pictures will no longer serve as a tool for anti-Semitism.</p>
   <p>For us Jews, as for all progressive elements of the city, it is important not only to protect our children from corrupt moving pictures, but also to be interested in having pictures that are wholesome and interesting and which may serve our children in an educational way.</p>
   <p>There are pictures that can acquaint our children with historical events of Biblical times, and with good moral habits. Of course, the showing of such pictures should not be entrusted to private enterprise. These things should be shown to children in large and beautiful places. To get the full moral value of these pictures, the City Hall should build in all parts of Chicago adequate and beautiful theaters, where only special pictures, purported to inspire the children to higher things and to help them in their studies, should be shown. This does not mean, however, that the Censors Bureau should <span class="page-break">\6</span>be done away with. Even adults should be given the best and most effective literary pictures.</p>
