   <p>Passover has always been considered by the Jews as the most popular of the Hebrew holidays. There are two reasons for this.</p>
   <p>The first is that Passover occurs in the Spring, the most picturesque and romantic time of the year. The second reason is that it celebrates the emancipation of the Hebrews from exile and from the "House of Bondage" in Egypt, thousands of years ago.</p>
   <p>It is true that this freedom did not last very long, serving only as a time of passage from one exile into another; yet, the Jews are happy and commemorate this period of freedom all over the world. They are like the prisoner who is happy in prison because he was free last year at this time.</p>
   <p>The Passover is so beloved and admired by the Hebrews that it is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>immaterial to them where they celebrate it. They can be happy regardless of their long lost freedom.</p>
   <p>The Passover has always been celebrated in the small towns in Europe with glamour and pomp. After the holiday of the "Candle Lights" passed, the Jewish housewives would busy themselves in the preparation for Passover. The Jewish bakers started to bake matzos, and everybody was busy in the homes, cleaning and scrubbing and preparing for the great holiday.</p>
   <p>As Passover neared, the Jewish homes were immaculately clean; everything reflected God's glory.</p>
   <p>Celebration of the Passover is not so elaborately observed in America. In this country housewives do not work so laboriously half a year before the coming of Passover. Matzos are bought ready-made and other foodstuffs can be secured within a few hours time.</p>

   <p>On the eve of the Passover, the Jewish Ghettos, in the City of Chicago, reflect the atmosphere of the European small towns. One sees downhearted and impoverished people hunting around for bargains in honor of Passover. One can also see rich women busily shopping.</p>
   <p>On Kedzie Avenue, not far from 12th Street, a woman was seen standing near a fish store making horse radish with a grinding machine. She was bundled up in discolored, filthy, and tattered sweaters despite the warm and glorious Spring morning. She looked sick and exhausted. If it were not for the approaching holiday she would probably have been confined to bed, but being a poor woman she had to take advantage of this chance to make some extra money. Tears were rolling from her feverish eyes; it was a pitiful picture.</p>
   <p>When she had finished grinding the horse radish, a rather large woman came out of the fish store and looked sympathetically at her.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"What is the matter with you?" she asked, and then answered her own question. "You must have a bad cold. I can see it." She added: "Excuse me, but I think you ought to take a steaming bath and drink a lot of hot tea with plenty of lemons."</p>
   <p>The old woman finished her sneezing and declared in an angry voice: "I have no cold, what are you talking about Madam? It is my bitter business, my bitter trade that brings tears into my eyes."</p>
   <p>On West Division Street near Humboldt Park, two Jewish women, one of middle age, and the other younger, were heard discussing meat prices. The middle-aged woman was telling her friend that she had already bought meat and poultry for the Passover. The younger woman asked if there were still some good pieces of meat left in the shop. They both cursed the butcher for the high prices he was charging. They said they wished that he would lose his buildings as they had lost theirs. Meanwhile, another woman came out of the butcher shop; her face was dry and wrinkled and her eyes were burning with anger. She also cursed the butcher, and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>opened her bundle to show the meat she had just bought. The other two women sympathized with her. This newcomer stood silently for a moment and finally said very piously: "Almighty God, I wish that the Messiah would come and put an end to the butcher, and to the world in general."</p>
   <p>On Lawrence Avenue, not far from a closed bank, two Jews, who were former depositors of the bank, were standing. Every morning they visit the burial place of their fortunes. They were sitting there sighing and discussing their needs for Passover. One related his life story to the other, telling how he had formerly donated huge sums of money for the benefit of the poor, in order to buy foodstuffs for the holiday, and now, he himself was reduced to poverty and forced to depend on charity. One society, he said, sent him some money to purchase food for Passover, but instead he bought shoes, to replace his worn out pair.</p>
   <p>"You are like Hershel Ostropoler, the famous Jewish humorist, who lived in Russia 200 years ago," said his companion.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"It is told that one time Hershel received three rubles from the charities to buy matzos for Passover, but instead he bought a big fat turkey. When he was asked why he bought a turkey when he should have bought matzos, he answered: 'If I were to ask money to buy a turkey I surely would have been refused, but since the three rubles were supposed to be for matzos and I bought a turkey it is all right." However, who will let a Jew be without matzos and let him eat bread? God forbid this on the Passover.</p>
