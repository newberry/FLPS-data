   <p>The visa business, the requirement of a passport at the exit and entrance to every country, which was a purely European business before the war, has, as is well known, become an American business as well. Originally aimed at immigrants applying for passage to these shores, it has become a veritable nuisance to every American citizen as well who goes abroad. For according to the passport laws, a separate and distinct visa is required at the crossing of every frontier. Since Europe has been Balkanized by the late war and the frontiers are legion in number, the problem of raising the necessary funds to pay for consular visits is almost as great as that for paying the expenses of the trip itself. The visa business has been reduced to its logical absurdity and perhaps some lesson of good sense may now animate our national legislators in the making of the new laws pertaining to visas. Perhaps the revised sense of justice to protect the name of American liberty may extend to the immigrant as well. If under the present restriction <span class="page-break">\2</span>laws, he is worthy to be admitted, he is also worthy not to be unduly handicapped by conditions which do not aid America in any way, and which, if revised, may aid him on his admission to this country and America as well, in some little measure. A little measure of good done is sometimes as powerful an influence for a greater good to be accomplished as a large measure of good done.</p>
