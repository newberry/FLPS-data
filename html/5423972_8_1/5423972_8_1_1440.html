   <p>Members of the Third Unitarian Church and Zion Congregation joined in a union service to celebrate Thanksgiving at Zion Temple. The invitation was given by the congregation and was accepted in as cordial a spirit by the Unitarians.</p>
   <p>Rev. James V. Blake conducted the service. Rabbi Joseph Stolz lectured on "The Immigration Problem". Rev. Blake made a few brief remarks on "The Oneness of the Human Race." Ministers and congregations were highly pleased at the success of the union service, and expect to repeat it on other occasions.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Stolz mentioned "It is an indication of what will come all over the world."</p>
