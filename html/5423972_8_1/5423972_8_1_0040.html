   <p>Several hundred people attended a meeting held Wednesday evening in Kallis Hall, 511 Jefferson Street, in aid of the unemployed Russian and Polish Jews in this city. Alexander Koppel, the Canal Street banker presided, and exhibited a list containing names of 213 adults and 336 children, who were actually suffering for food.</p>
   <p>Alexander Koppel, who is noted for his many charitable deeds in Chicago, urged the meeting to take immediate action. As a result in a short time, several hundred dollars were raised, and hundreds of pounds of bread and other foodstuffs promised. Supplementary to these subscriptions, was $1,000 raised by Mr. Koppel personally.</p>
   <p>The money is being expended in food under the direction of Messrs. Koppel and Kallis. Tickets are issued to the hungry people. Those able to pay are charged ten cents for a meal, but these without means are fed without cost.</p>
