   <p>Elsewhere in today's issue of the Jewish Courier is published a news item about the arrival of the special Russian Commission in America. They are the envoys of the new, great Russian Republic to the older Republic of the United States, bringing with them a salutation from a sister-Republic seeking counsel and means to fortify her present exigencies and to confer about the near future. Our American Commission has been already in Petrograd for the last two weeks. Thus are both ends collaborating to bring the two Republics to a closer relationship,which must in the near future yield many advantages to both - not only material advantages, but also spiritual gains and a multiplication of peoples' freedom throughout the world.</p>

   <p>The Chicago City Council last Monday adopted a resolution which extends an invitation to the Russian Commission, in the name of the city of Chicago, requesting their presence here as Chicago guests of honor for a day or two following their departure from Washington, where they have been conferring with President Wilson and the Secretary of State. It is expected that the Commission will accept the invitation, and a committee of prominent citizens of Chicago will strenuously endeavor to entertain the venerable guests with all "comforts" and with assurance of sincere friendship towards Russia, etc., as is the rule at such occasions. The city of Chicago will thereby show its share of friendliness by expressing its good-will toward the Russian people and towards its new-born Republic.</p>

   <p>Will the Entertainment Committee of Chicago also include us, former Russian subjects of the ex-Czar, and the Chicago Jewry in general.</p>
   <p>Apparently not. We are so indebted to the Russian Commission that it would not be sufficient that we only share with the friendliness of the general public of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We think that the proper thing to do would be for the Chicago Jewry to have an exclusive opportunity to greet their former countrymen, in order to show them how happy they are over the new Republic, our sympathy toward the Russian people, and that the true Republic of Russia can count on the Jewish people as their upright friends.</p>

   <p>It would be especially befitting because in the Russian Committee, under the chairmanship of the noted Professor Borris Bachmetiev, there are also some very prominent Russian Jews under the Jewish scholar Baron David Ginsburg.</p>
   <p>We would like to see that a special invitation be sent to the Commission as guests of the Chicago Jewry; that a thundering reception be given to them in one of the most magnificent halls or theaters; that a banquet be given in their honor sponsored by the most prominent Jews, to extol the guests; and that the sentiments of the Jews concerning the new-born Russia be expressed in both Russian and English in such an effective manner that the words resound in all cities and villages of Russia, so that they be widely known to millions of Russians.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>By such action not only would we obtain the gratitude of Russia, but we would also do the six million Jews living there a great favor.</p>
   <p>We believe that this can be easily achieved with the cooperation of prominent Jews.</p>
