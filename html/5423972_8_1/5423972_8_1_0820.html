   <p>The above is the caption of an article in the Chicago Staats-Zeitung of last Friday the 24th inst, which we translate nearly verbatim. The writer refers to the twelfth annual report of the United Hebrew Benevolent Societies of New York City, from which he collates the following significant facts, to wit, that from October 1, 1885, till the 30th of September 1886, there landed in New York 27,348 Jews, being 8,813 more than in the twelve months previous.</p>
   <p>They were classified as follows:- 7,056 Austrians, 17,396 Russians, 1,554 Roumanians, 857 Germans, 59 English, 8 French 5 Danish, and so forth. In other words of the entire number, more than 26,000 were what are recognized in Western Germany as Polish Jews. Twenty-six thousand Polish Jews in a single year! That is certainly an overdose for our American national economy! And now, why should we be deceived? These Polish Jews are indigestible for the American stomach as are the Chinese.</p>
   
   <p>The 857 Jews from Germany, the 59 from England, the 8 from Denmark, are simply Germans, English, French, and Danes; and according to their race, are Semites (they were idiots if they denied that fact, or if they were to pretend that they were Germans or Roumanians), who believe in one God only. But with the 26,000 Polish Jews, the subject is entirely different, they represent a singular nationality, because in their homes they were ever recognized as such on account of their language, customs and traditions, forming as it were a separate and distinct sect, in the country and under the government where they were born.</p>
   <p>The Galician Jew is no less an Austrian, the Roumanian is no less a Roumanian, the Russo or Polish is no less a Russian or Pole than he is a Jew. The German Jew in the front rank is a (Jewish) German, but the Polish and Russian Jew is not such in the first instance, but he is a Jew.</p>
   <p>Now to come to a conclusion, much might be said in behalf of these Polish, Russian, and Roumanian Jews; as also much could be said in favor of the Chinese.</p>
   
   <p>Without doubt, they possess spiritual qualifications and characteristics, which might in an economic sense, be made profitable to our land and country. Yes, it may be said in regard to these qualifications, that in comparison to such christian canaille as for instance, Jay Gould, they are Polish Jews. But that will not set aside the fact that so many of these East European Jews as reared in their native land, are not desirable in our American communities, however, much of these may be mixed.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch however, as they are here, they must be put to some use. On the other hand, it is to be assumed that at least the first, if not the second generation, may become sufficiently Americanized to be tolerable, which in the case of the intelligent German Jewish immigrant, has accomplished within a few years of his arrival. But take it all in all, what must be done for unsere Leute (our people,) will prove a very difficult task in culture labor; and it would indeed be desirable if they would stay away altogether. We have enough and sufficient Polish Jews in the United States and will thank the powers that be in Europe, to not send us any more.</p>
