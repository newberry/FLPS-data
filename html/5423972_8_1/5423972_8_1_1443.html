   <p>The celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of the well-known Jewish philanthropist was held yesterday at the Central Musical Hall. A portrait of the famous man occupied the center of the stage. Mr. Philipp presided. Mrs. Louis Falk and Mr. Charles Knorr took part in the musical entertainment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stein opened the meeting with an address, saying: "Moses Montefiore is a hero, although not a war hero; instead of destroying life, he tried to preserve it; instead of sowing unhappiness and misery, he brought happiness everywhere. The pages of the world's history cannot disclose the name of a personality whose humanitarianism could be compared to that of Moses Montefiore. The teachings and fundamental truth of the Order of B'nai B'rith was Montefiore's lifelong guidance."</p>
   <p>The main address was delivered by Dr. Hirsch. He said: "On this day the Jews of the world form a single community filled with gratitude. Moses <span class="page-break">\2</span>Montefiore whose fame is known the world over, is the incarnation of the Jewish spirit of charity, and the hundred years of his life will be remembered as a life full of noble and generous deeds. Montefiore was born when America was still in its infancy, and had just begun to establish a good foundation of freedom in this country." Mr. Hirsch spoke then of revolutionary changes which have taken place in all of the civilized world since the birth of Montefiore, saying that men like him show, that charity and noble acts are not touched by the changes of time. Montefiore demonstrated also, that wealth, contrary to the belief of many, can be a source of happiness; this message he has sent out into the world; wealth is a blessing; through it, hunger can be appeased and misery can be made lighter! Dr. Hirsch spoke then of the persecution of Jews in Europe and their hard battle for their rights as citizens, and of the still raging race war, even in "enlightened" Germany.</p>
