   <p>Last night a meeting was held of all the delegates to the State [Executive] Board of the local lodges of the Progressive Order Of The West. The decision was made to ask all the members to fulfill their patriotic duty and participate in the Jewish Fourth Of July parade.</p>
   <p>Since every organization will have its own marshall, Mr. Harry Wolf was chosen to be the marshall of all P.O.W. lodges; Morris Klein was picked as assistant marshall; and the following were picked to assist the marshall: Louis Rosenberg, Samuel Macon, Joseph H. Edelson, A. A. Schwartzbach, S. Kabak, and Sam Handleman.</p>
