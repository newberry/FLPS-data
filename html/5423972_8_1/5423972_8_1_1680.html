A Naturalization Aid League has been in existence in Chicago for the last few months and that is the league organized by Comrades of the Forward, the Jewish Socialist Alliance and the Young American Branch of the Workmens Circle. This League has two branches, and has done excellent work. It is the work of this conference to put the League on a sound foundation <span class="page-break">\3</span>and place all the work on a wide and more systematic basis. A plan was finally effected for a League, to be kept up by all Jewish organizations, without disturbance due to scarcity of money. An executive board of fifteen was elected, consisting of representatives of the large central body. The names of the executive board will be announced later in the Forward.</p>
