   <p>The holidays are over and the days of work and activity have begun. All Jewish organizations, local, national, and international are preparing themselves for the great tasks, and the coming season promises to be a very fruitful and productive one. Even the average Jew, who never before concerned himself with public affairs, understands very well that he has certain duties to perform, and is willing to perform them. Almost every Jew is interested today in relief work and great masses of our people are interested in work on behalf of Palestine; furthermore, all conscious Jews are interested in the question of Jewish education, as well as in the civic problems of the community. There is a certain group of philanthropists who are interested in philanthropic institutions; these local philanthropists will soon begin the task of enlarging and beautifying the institutions in which they are interested.</p>
   <p>The Jewish community of Chicago looks forward to the new season and also faces <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>great problems. It is one of the largest Jewish communities in the world, so far as its numerical strength is concerned, but not so far as its political, moral, and cultural forces are concerned. A Jewish community as large as Chicago's must accomplish something for itself and for the Jewish people if it wishes to occupy a certain position in the life of the Jewish people, if it wishes to be respected, and if its voice is to be heard.</p>
   <p>It is true that in the Jewish community of Chicago, the wheels do not stand still. Everything is in motion, everything vibrates and moves; but the motion of Jewish public life in Chicago is not rhythmic nor is it harmonious. One can see the trees, but there is no forest. There are many beautiful Jewish institutions in Chicago, of which any other Jewish community might be proud. This is especially true in regards to the philanthropic institutions, like the Home for the Aged, the Marks Nathan Orphan Home, the Jewish Center for Incurables in Oak Forest, the three Jewish day and night nurseries which our brave women founded; furthermore, the Mount Sinai Hospital looks as though it would become a well-established institution.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Yet our educational and cultural institutions, like our local religious organizations, are not such as we can be proud of. There are rabbis in Chicago, but no Beth Din (Jewish religious court). There are Jews in Chicago who are authorized to determine religious questions, but there is no unified Kashruth organization. There are Talmud Torahs and a Yeshiva in Chicago, but no Jewish board of education. There is not a single intellectual center in Chicago where scholars, savants, authors, and artists can assemble and spend a few hours in a cultural atmosphere. Jewish intellectual life is particularly lacking in Chicago, notwithstanding the fact that Chicago is one of the largest Jewish communities in the world.</p>
   <p>Actually, the Jewish community of Chicago has only one great task, namely, the task of uniting all its forces, and all its institutions, of establishing a central authority to control the whole Jewish community life. True, the synagogues do not include the large masses of people. Of the three hundred thousand Jews in Chicago, only six or seven thousand of them are organized in synagogues. Nevertheless, if the synagogues made an effort, if the presidents of synagogues understood the importance of the task, much could be accomplished <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>despite the tacit opposition of certain elements that are hindering the work of unity because their interests are basically different from the interests of the majority. Chicago Jewry is certainly responsible for the shameful conditions that prevail in our community life, and for the chaos and anarchy that prevail in Jewish life. But history will hold the synagogues, i.e., the organized Orthodox Jewry, responsible for the prevailing conditions. The synagogues could not only have laid the foundation for unity, but they could have strengthened their own forces, if they had not remained isolated but were united into one organization.</p>
   <p>An attempt was made in Chicago to unite all the congregations into one Kehilah [Hebrew name given to organized Orthodox community]. The Kehilah, on the other hand, should strengthen the congregations. This, naturally, is only a beginning. The aim of the Kehilah is to organize all the Jews in Chicago, who are neither Reform nor radical. But there are parasitic forces in Chicago which hinder this movement for unity, and as long as our institutions remain disunited, Jewish life in Chicago will remain sick and indolent.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Even though Jewish community life in Chicago may develop intellectually--as long as there is no united force in the form of a powerful Kehilah, as long as there is no rabbinate in Chicago in the form of a Beth Din--the Jewish community of Chicago will remain a desert, and the perpetuation of Judaism will depend upon immigration. Every Chicago Jew should bear this in mind at the beginning of the new season.</p>
