   <p>Last Sunday the Jewish Council held its yearly conference in New York.</p>
   <p>Several hundred guests and delegates assembled, and gave the impression, that Jews are persecuted all over the World, even in this country.</p>
   <p>The principal issues concerned the discrimination against Jewish students in universities, and of Jewish employees in many industries.</p>
   <p>No doubt there is much truth in these statements. They discussed the limitations of Jewish people in various professions, and cited many <span class="page-break">2</span>living facts from Professor Feldman's book on the discrimination against Jews in American colleges.</p>
   <p>At this congress another very important issue was discussed, the discrimination against Jews by Jews. This situation is also mentioned in Professor Feldman's book.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Council has agreed to fight against racial discrimination, branding the discriminator , as barbaric and uncivilized.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We now have in the United States, a perpetual sensation about Chain Solomon, the Polish Jew who helped to finance the American Revolution. There have been numerous sensations about Mr. Solomon especially in the Jewish World.</p>
   <p>American Gentiles have finally decided that Mr. Solomon deserves a monument in memory of his patriotic deeds. Among those who gave their consent were high government officials, educators and well-known historians who have analyzed Mr. Solomon's services to the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Some time ago there was a rumor that the Jewish Council was seeking to profit at the government's expense in promoting a Chaim Solomon, Monument fund.</p>
   <p>Mr. Solomon, according to historical documents was a prominent financier during the American Revolution. His heirs claimed the government borrowed money from Mr. Solomon. This claim was finally settled by the government.</p>
   <p>The Alliance of Polish Jews, of the United States, has launched the Chaim Solomon Monument movement and has finally secured an appropriate site for the monument in New York City.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It had been decided to start digging the foundation when new opposition was instigated by a Jew, Mr. Max Kohler. He is a lawyer and a historian. Mr. Kohler is very well-known in Jewish-American circles.</p>
   <p>He has just published a pamphlet concerning Chaim Solomon, declaring that he was an overrated personality and does not deserve the honor of having a monument erected to his memory.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kohler admits Mr. Solomon helped to finance the American Revolution and that he was a good citizen, and devout patriot, but he insists there were thousands of such patriots and that they also <span class="page-break">6</span>would, therefore deserve monuments.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edward D. Russell, noted American writer and critic, has an entirely different opinion about Chaim Solomon. Mr. Russell recently published a book about Solomon. It is based on research and authorized historical documents taken from the records collected by Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, of Harvard University.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kohler claims that the Alliance of Polish Jews in America have bribed Mr. Russell to write this book.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>This sensation has all the elements of a big scandal.</p>
   <p>A Jew is accusing Jews of having bribed an American writer to make a Polish Jew an important figure in American History.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kohler is ordinarily a very calm person, and is given great credit for his research work on American Jewish life.</p>
   <p>The Jews as well as the Gentiles are amazed and wondering what has happened to Mr. Kohler.</p>
   <p>The pamphlet is in the form of a letter written to a congressman who questioned Kohler on Mr. Solomon's place in American history.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Mr. Kohler states, that Mr. Solomon's historical reputation is based on manufactured news, false facts and misrepresentations which the patriots' son or agents assembled in 1827 to obtain a huge sum of money in settlement from the American Government: This scandal is delaying the erection of the monument.</p>
