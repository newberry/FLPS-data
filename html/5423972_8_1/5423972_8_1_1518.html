   <p>Holiday services conducted at the Institute by a congregation of oriental Jews, using the Sephordic ritual, were an interesting event in the religious life at the Institute during the Holiday season. Worshippers were present from Bokhara, Syria, Arabia, Morocco, Palestine.</p>
   <p>These services were especially impressive and the worshippers exhibited a devoutness even greater than is usually shown at the services held at this time of the year.</p>
