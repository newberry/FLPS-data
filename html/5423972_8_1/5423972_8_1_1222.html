   <p>Elsewhere on this page we print the speech given by Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, president of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, on Sunday, at the annual meeting of the Institute's members.</p>
   <p>If the worthy president of the Institute happened to be just an ordinary Jew we would not consider it necessary to comment on his speech, but, Mr. Loeb is a strong Jewish personality. He takes a strong personal interest in all Jewish activities, and desires to interest others also in Jewish civic work. Besides, he is a Zionist. All in all, it is expected of such a man that he speak a Jewish word at a Jewish gathering, which is interested in this large Jewish Institution.</p>
   <p>What Mr. Loeb says in his speech, every American Jew will indorse. Without a doubt, an Institution like the Chicago Hebrew Institute must expound questions on Americanism, must strive to build Jewish muscles, strong <span class="page-break">2</span>and healthy Jews for the good of the community, with a clear understanding pertaining to their duties of the country that gives them freedom and the possibilities to develop their abilities. We would be the first to protest against a sole, cultural program for the Institute because we know its activities must cover physical education and general Americanization. The fact that the Institute renders extensive services on these subjects is very satisfying. The leaders of the Institute and its many friends may be proud of its accomplishments, and point proudly to its curriculum of physical education and Americanization.</p>
   <p>Thus, in Mr. Loeb's speech we have nothing to eliminate, neither can any discreet Jews say anything against it, but, we have much to say concerning what Mr. Loeb omitted.</p>
   <p>After all, the Institution does not sponsor only physical and American education. It is a Jewish institution, as indicated by its name - Chicago Hebrew Institute. We believe that in such an institution, the physical education should be parallel to the Jewish, and that its leaders have the <span class="page-break">3</span>same distinct program for Jewish education and cultural work as they have for the physical and Americanizational work.</p>
   <p>We can see from Mr. Loeb's speech that he has a clear idea of what the Institute must offer as an American and physical educational institute, but it seems that he pays little attention to the special Jewish tasks. It is possible that he knows all this, but, simply failed to mention it in his speech. That is a pity because we know that Mr. Loeb wishes to educate the young generation to be good and faithful Jews, as well as good and faithful Americans.</p>
   <p>Ignoring the purely Jewish aspects is still bearable, when one knows that the leaders of the Institute are not really such fools as one may appear to think at a first glance, for in the Institute, Jewish educational work is in progress. Hebrew is taught to 250 pupils. Reading of Jewish history and culture also exists, besides the classes held in Jewish music and other subjects. Among the directors of the institute are prominent Zionists who <span class="page-break">4</span>certainly ascertain the special Jewish studies.</p>
   <p>How much further the Institute could delve into Jewish studies, we will not discuss here. The fact is that it accomplishes good and fruitful Jewish work, and that it is, so to say, the intellectual gathering center of the Jewish streets. The leaders of the Institute who carry on this Jewish work have no reason to be silent or belittle it.</p>
   <p>It surprises us, therefore, that Mr. Loeb had entirely omitted the Jewish aspects of the Institute. On the contrary, from a man like Mr. Loeb, we expect to see formulated and stressed the Jewish program, since, he is not just another Jew, but, a Jewish leader.</p>
   <p>We agree with Mr. Loeb that the Institute stands for the highest general attainments, but we wish also to emphasize that it stands for great Jewish accomplishments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>If immigration from eastern lands were to stop completely, then America in this case must furnish its own Jewish forces. Every Jewish organization would then be compelled to exert its efforts to produce this Jewish energy. The Chicago Hebrew Institute, a powerful and rich organization, is especially dedicated to this task, therefore, this work must not be kept in silence or belittled, but, on the contrary, must be strongly stressed to make it popularly known among all parts of the Jewish population.</p>
   <p>It is possible, of course, that it may simply have been an oversight on the part of Mr. Loeb when he failed to mention Jewish activities of the Institute, or he may have taken for granted the fact that everyone knew of it. If this is so, we must inform Mr. Loeb that he is too optimistic, and too far advanced for the present Jewish times in Chicago. Many members of the Institute know very little of the program given in Jewish studies, and of what they consist.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loeb, will do the Institute a favor if he will do at his next opportunity, <span class="page-break">6</span>what he failed to do this time - explain the Jewish courses of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, and lend weight to the Jewish atmosphere which he creates and should continue to create. Jews of Chicago, will be very thankful to him for it.</p>
