   <p>In a grave crisis, when it is a question of life and death, neither a disguise nor a mask will prove successful; then the truth, in all its horror, is often proclaimed from the depths of the soul. Since the most progressive nations of the world have begun to treat Jews more humanely, we imagine that they have finally recognized our demands as a people, and our right to enjoy freedom and security equally with all other peoples. In peacetime, when we are allowed to breathe freely, we begin to believe that the moral conscience of the world is growing, and that the redemption of Jews must come only in this way: by the nations acquiring a higher degree of civilization. The nations of Western Europe have sought to liberate themselves from the rule of the church, and have been compelled, due to the principle of self-emancipation, to recognize the equality of citizenship of all the inhabitants of their countries. With the optimistic inclination toward self-deceit that resides in us, we fancy that they [the nations] had in view our benefit only. And thus we have hastened to meet them more than halfway. We have immediately become French, German, Russian, English, etc. We say we are Jews only in the religious sense, and this does not concern the State.</p>
   <p>The nations, however, do not look upon Jews in this light. There isn't a single nation in the world, even among the most civilized, that would consider the Jewish Question a political and economic question. It is even difficult to find one Christian, in whatever country he may be, who considers the difference between himself and the Jew to be no more than a religious difference. We seek to convince the Christians that when they say "Jew", it should mean nothing but the religious aspect, the same as "Catholic" and "Protestant". But the Gentiles do not allow themselves to believe something that is not true. They see us in a different light from the one we wish. But the power of autosuggestion is so strong that one begins to believe one's own phantoms. A world full of people laugh, nations care little about the Jewish vagary and still we hold firmly to our own [idea]; we are French, German, Bohemian, Polish, Russian, etc.</p>
   <p>However, when a grave crisis arises and the Jew is put to the test, then the effects of his autosuggestion will most likely wear off, and he will act like a Jew. If he continues to be obstinate, and pursues his old course, the dry facts will arise from the crisis, will rap him over the knuckles and cry out, "Jew! Jew!"</p>
   <p>France and England are democratic countries. They recognize the rights of a foreigner by granting him freedom and the right to live in their midst. For this reason, they must also open their doors to Jews who escape Russian persecution. But now that war has broken out, a crisis has arisen and to the aforementioned privileges is added the condition: Yes, you are permitted to live here, but for this privilege, you must sacrifice your lives for us, otherwise you are not welcome.</p>
   <p>During such a crisis a bitter truth is proclaimed. "We are not Russians," cry out the Russian Jews in England. "We have fled from Russia, not because we wished to avoid military service, but because Russia has made it her political policy to oppress us. Neither are we English," they continue, "and we have no intention of becoming English. We are Jews; people without a country who enjoy the right of asylum in England in accordance with the English Constitution." England's reply is: "Either you go with us on the battlefield or you leave England." The constitutional right of asylum does not hold good when applied to Jews.</p>
   <p>England cannot force Americans who enjoy her right of asylum to shed their blood for her. She cannot force Swedes, Spaniards, Swiss, or even citizens of the Allies who live there, to do so, but she can force Jews because they are a people without a home.</p>
   <p>At first a millionaire of Chicago refused to send money to aid the Jews in Poland. "They are people like any others," he claimed. He contributed a huge sum to the Polish Committee for distribution without discriminating in favor of any religion. Later he was informed that from his money not a penny had reached the Jews. Since then he donates solely to Jews. The crisis taught him a lesson in "ethnography".</p>
   <p>The Jews in America believe that the money they give to the millions of war-stricken Jews is naught but charity, philanthropy. Slowly, however, they are gaining the realization that it is a national inclination of self-preservation. Instinct is stronger than theory. If they were to follow out their theory, they ought to help the Belgians, Poles and Russians. But in a grave crisis truth emerges.</p>
   <p>It is said that an aristocratic Jewess, before giving birth to a child, cried out, "Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu". The attending physician ignored her cries and continued smoking his cigar. Then suddenly she burst out, "Gotineu Helf Mir!" [Yiddish: Oh God, help me!] Then the doctor got busy. In a real crisis, there is no disguise.</p>
