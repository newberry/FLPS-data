   <p>Ozreth Olleem Viyunkeem (Aid for Nursing Babies). Under this title the two large women's organizations in Chicago have united, the former Boneth Zion Jewish Day Nursery and Infant Home and The Motherless Infants Club. Both have the same purpose; the care of infants, [orphans as well as] those who for certain reasons cannot be reared by their parents.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the new organization is to support day nurseries in all parts of the city kindergartens and homes for Jewish infants.</p>
   <p>The president of the Boneth Zion is Mrs. Riegel. The chairwoman of the Motherless Infants Club is Mrs. Berry. Now both organizations will elect a common committee to take over all the work.</p>
   <p>Monday June 16, both organizations, now united, will have a tag day. Part of the <span class="page-break">2</span>money collected will be put aside for a home that they plan to build.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silver and Dr. S. M. Melomed, editor of the Courier, were responsible for this amalgamation.</p>
