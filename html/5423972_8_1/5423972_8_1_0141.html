   <p>Judge Joseph Sabbath in Bridewell.</p>
   <p>Our most popular Judge Sabbath, conducted Yom Kippur services for the unfortunate Jewish prisoners in the Bridewell prison. The Judge happened to think that among the poor Jewish prisoners there were perhaps some whom he had sentenced and who would very likely, like to take part in the Yom Kippur services. He called up the jailer, Mr. Whitman, inquiring as to what the Jewish prisoners were doing on that holy day. The jailer replied that Yom Kippur day is just like any other day in Bridewell prison. Judge Sabbath immediately got in touch with Rabbi A. H. Levy and together they went to Bridewell, gathered all the thirty-six Jewish prisoners and conducted the holy Yom Kippur services for them.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Levy and Judge Sabbath chanted with the prisoners and together they cried and repented for their sins. After the services, the prisoners thanked Judge Sabbath and Rabbi Levy for their kindness and thoughtfulness in remembering them on this holy day.</p>
