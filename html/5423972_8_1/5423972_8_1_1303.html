   <p>Miss Henrietta Zold was the guest yesterday at a reception given in her honor by the local Zionists of Chicago at the Hebrew Institute. In her speech she pictured Jewish life in Palestine, constantly stressing the activities of the Hadassah Society. The Society is at present establishing branches everywhere with very good results.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, too, we now have a Hadassah Society which will be known as the Clara Daw Hirsch Chapter. It already has a membership of fifty. Mrs. E. Natkin has been elected as the acting chairman and Mrs. A. Levinson as acting treasurer.</p>
