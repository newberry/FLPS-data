   <p>London. Four hundred Rabbis from Poland and Galicia have proclaimed June 17 a fast day for Jews all over the world. In their call they state that this day should be hallowed by all Jews. It should be spent in prayer and deeds of charity. Jews should notify one another, communities should do likewise to inform everyone of the bloody fate that befell our brothers in Poland and Galicia. Furthermore, money should be collected for the victims of the pogroms.</p>
