   <p>It is now only three weeks until the annual convention of the American Zionist Organization opens in Chicago on September 14. This convention is in many respects more significant and momentous, than a national Zionist congress, because this convention must lay the foundation for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Thus far, we do not know what the Zionist leaders are contemplating; what plans they will formulate before the convention, nor the amount of money they will ask for.</p>
   <p>Every few days we are assured that in a couple of weeks or months, Palestine will become a Jewish homeland. How this miracle is to take place when there are over half a million Arabs in Palestine now, and only 100,000 Jews, who  <span class="page-break">2</span>were ruined during the war, we do not know. We are asked to believe that a great miracle will occur.</p>
   <p>Every sensible person understands that as long as the immigration of Jews into Palestine is prohibited, no Jewish homeland in Palestine can be established. The first stipulation for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine is the free immigration of Jews.</p>
   <p>When will Jews be allowed to emigrate to Palestine? Why are they kept back? The war seems to be at an end. The fear of a new declaration of war by Turkey is groundless, because Turkey has ceased to exist. In diplomatic circles, there is even a doubt whether any treaty will be concluded with Turkey, whom they simply want to place under the protectorate of the League of Nations. And even if a treaty should be concluded with Turkey, the latter will not get back her lost territories. It is the tradition of European diplomacy, for the past five centuries, not to return lost territories to a Mohammedan kingdom. There has never been a case in history <span class="page-break">3</span>when a conquered province of Turkey was returned to her. Statesmen in London have often declared that England does not contemplate the return of Palestine to Turkey. England is also now the sovereign ruler of Palestine and her domination is absolutely secure. She can conduct Palestinian affairs now in the same manner as she does in other crown-colonies which are administered directly from London. Now, if England is absolutely so secure with its domination over Palestine, then why does she prohibit Jewish immigration into Palestine?</p>
   <p>Since the breakdown of Turkey, 100,000 Jews could have immigrated to Palestine; living conditions there could have been organized, more or less; the foundation for a Jewish homeland already could have been laid--but until now nothing has been done. On the other hand, the Arabs, our competitors, have accomplished much during the last eight months. They have rapidly set up their new country and established diplomatic relations with all the great powers. If England does not want to settle formally the Palestinian problem in the spirit of the English Declaration, because, as yet, she has <span class="page-break">4</span>no treaty with Turkey, then why has she settled the Arabian problem without consulting the Turkish government? Why are the Jews being treated worse than the Arabs?</p>
   <p>Our leaders are secretive! At the first session of the League of Nations in Washington which is to be held in October, the Palestinian problem will be solved. This is true only, provided that there will be a League of Nations and that the League will soon hold its first session. But who can guarantee that the League of Nations will really function? To judge from the politics of the American Senate there is a great question whether the League will function at all. There is no two-thirds majority in the American Senate for the League of Nations, as it was founded in Paris.</p>
   <p>And the American Senate is determined to co-administer, amend, and revise the League of Nations. Whether the other great powers then will be willing to accept the League of Nations in the revised form of the American Senate, remains to be seen. And even should they be willing to do it, then many <span class="page-break">5</span>months will elapse before an understanding will be reached. Then, the League's first session cannot be held within six weeks, as originally planned. Until then the world may turn topsy-turvy. France and Italy are on the threshold of great upheavals. In England itself the situation is far from being secure. Only a few days ago Lloyd George remarked in Parliament that England is on the verge of collapse--and the British prime minister is certainly a good authority on English affairs.</p>
   <p>By no means do we accuse England of trying to break her promise to us--because a promise is broken only to an adversary, whom you fear, and England, certainly, does not have to fear us. Although in 1885 England officially declared that she will withdraw her armies from Egypt, as quickly as the borders of the Sudan will be established, yet English troops are still stationed there. On August 6, 1914 Asquith in the British Parliament declared, that in case of a victory, England will not seize an inch of territory, nor take a cent, from her enemy--and yet she seized all of her enemy's colonies, is demanding billions of dollars, and, in addition, is desirous of obtaining a part of German territory in Germany proper. But <span class="page-break">6</span>England does not have to fool us, for she has no reason to fear us.</p>
   <p>And so, why does she place obstacles to Jewish immigration into Palestine? Why do our diplomats not press the question of Jewish immigration to Palestine? Will they be able to give an answer to this question at the convention?</p>
