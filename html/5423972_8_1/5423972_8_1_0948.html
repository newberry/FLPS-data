   <p>Dr. Chaim Weitzman, president of the World's Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency, Mrs. Weitzman, and their secretary, Miss Liberman, arrived in Chicago yesterday at nine thirty in the morning. They were met at the depot by the executive committee of the Keren Hayesod and the Chicago Zionist Organization. They all left at once for the Drake Hotel, where Dr. Weitzman began immediately to confer with the leaders of the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weitzman, before listening to reports about the Keren Hayesod work in Chicago, reported about the success of his trip to the West. He visited New Orleans, Texas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Big sums of money have been raised everywhere for the Keren Hayesod--Texas gave sixty thousand dollars; Los Angeles, sixty thousand; San Francisco, one hundred thousand; and New Orleans, seventy-five thousand. Every city mentioned could have doubled easily the sum <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it raised if it had made better preparation for the drive, but, as it was, the Zionist leader was very satisfied with the result of his trip.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman, chairman of the Keren Hayesod, gave Dr. Weitzman a cheerful report about the big progress the Keren Hayesod has made during this year's drive in Chicago. He laid particular stress upon the serious and productive work of the synagogues and their leaders, rabbis, and presidents. Dr. Abramowich, director of the Keren Hayesod, gave in his report details regarding the drive and enumerated the synagogues which have doubled their quota this year. He also reported about the new forces which have been won over to the Keren Hayesod. Dr. [S. M.] Melamed, as chairman of the Zionist Organization, reported about the progress of Zionist work in Chicago and the influence it has upon the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>The Zionist leader was very much pleased with these reports and expressed the hope that Chicago will set this year a good example for the entire country <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to follow, and that the American Orthodoxy will learn from the wonderful work which the leaders of Chicago's Orthodoxy are doing for the upbuilding of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weitzman then introduced Mrs. Weitzman, who is a physician by profession. Mrs. Weitzman, a person of a very winning personality, has practiced medicine for many years in Manchester, [England], where Dr. Weitzman was a professor of chemistry. Since Dr. Weitzman devotes now his entire time to the Keren Hayesod and has withdrawn from the professorship, she also gave up her medical practice to help her husband in the Keren Hayesod work. She accompanies him on his long trips and she gets the Jewish women everywhere interested in the Keren Hayesod work. A reporter of the Courier asked her what she thought of California, where she had spent a month. She replied not only that California is not more beautiful than Palestine, as far as beauties of nature are concerned, but that Palestine is, in many ways, much more beautiful and wonderful, and that, if as many millions were invested in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Palestine as in California, Palestine would be a thousand times more beautiful than California.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Weitzman will be the guest of honor of the Hadassah Chicago Chapter [Women's Zionist Organization] on Tuesday. The reception will take place at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>This afternoon Dr. Weitzman will be a guest of the National Executive [Committee] of the B'nai B'rith, which meets once a year. The meeting will be at the Standard Club. Mr. Davis, Secretary of Labor, will also be present at the meeting. Dr. Weitzman will speak about the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>All Keren Hayesod volunteers will gather on Tuesday evening at the Club Room of the Sherman Hotel to hear a confidential message from Dr. Weitzman.</p>

   <p>The latest reports about the appeals in the synagogues are very cheerful. About four thousand dollars was raised at the North Shore Congregation, where Dr. Sonderling and Mr. Isidor Lieberman made the appeal. Two thousand dollars was raised at the Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol [Synagogue], where Rabbi Ezriel Epstein and Mr. Max Shulman made the appeal. A thousand dollars was raised at the Liebawitch Synagogue, where the appeal was made by Dr. Abramowich and Mr. [N. H.] Bolotin. This synagogue is expected to give more than this. A thousand dollars was raised at the Rodfei Zedek Synagogue, where Rabbi [B. A.] Daskal made the appeal. Eight hundred dollars was raised at the Dorshe Tov Synagogue, where Rabbi Grobart and Mr. [I.] Lurie made the appeal. Three thousand dollars was raised at the Tiphereth Zion Synagogue, where Chief Rabbi [J. L.] Gordon and Mr. Marok made the appeal. Rabbi Gordon's appeal was so strong and effective that everybody present responded. About a thousand dollars was raised at the Kovno Synagogue, where Rabbi Kaplan and Mr. Sam Ginsburg made an appeal. Rabbi [L.] Kaplan undertook to collect all the pledges before Tuesday <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>night. All those who made a pledge at the Kovno Synagogue are urged to turn over the money to Rabbi Kaplan.</p>
   <p>All synagogue presidents and leaders must collect during the next forty-eight hours all the pledges made in their synagogues, so that at the banquet on Tuesday night we can turn over to the great Zionist leader a check from the synagogues. It is now known that the Russian Synagogue and the Kehilath Jacob Synagogue will have more than their quota in cash on Tuesday night. A special effort is being made by the Tiphereth Zion Synagogue and the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue to raise their quota in cash by Tuesday night. We will know tomorrow morning whether they have been successful in their efforts.</p>
   <p>No Keren Hayesod volunteer should fail to be present tonight at the conference at the Sherman Hotel. Dr. Weitzman has an important message to deliver and every volunteer must come to hear the message of the great Zionist leader.</p>

   <p>There is a rumor going on among the Keren Hayesod workers that Mr. J. Weil, president of the Anshe Sholom Synagogue, has been working quietly and will have a big surprise for Dr. Weitzman on Tuesday evening. Mr. John Rissman, who together with Alderman [Jacob] Arvey made the appeal at the Anshe Emet Synagogue, has also a surprise for Dr. Weitzman. Chicago must do more for the Keren Hayesod during the next two days than it usually does in half a year. That is why the drive is so intensive.</p>
   <p>The Courier was informed yesterday afternoon that one volunteer team, Mr. Alex Eisenstein and Mr. Sam Ginsburg, has collected fifteen hundred dollars in one afternoon. The Anshe Kneseth Israel Synagogue, the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue, and the Kehilath Jacob Synagogue are, so far, in the lead in the Keren Hayesod work, but the Tiphereth Zion and Anshe Emet Synagogues want to catch up with them.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Reservations by synagogues for tomorrow's grand banquet will be taken till this afternoon. Every synagogue will have a separate table. The Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue has alone made fifty reservations.</p>
