   <p>Synagogue presidents, rabbis, and prominent citizens of the West Side held a big meeting Sunday evening at Congregation Agudath Jacob Anshe Kroz to consider ways of fighting the missionary plague on the West Side. The meeting appointed a committee of thirteen to lead the fight against the latest plague, which has sneaked into the heart of the Jewish district and which threatens to catch many Jewish children in its net.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee of thirteen are: Gerson Gottlieb, K. Brody, Samuel Lazansky, Sam Shuchhalter, M. Statler, S. Goldstein, L. Schoenberg, I. Arker, Sam Silverman, M. Brodsky, I. Goldberg, M. Kershman, and J. Brener. Joseph M. Hirsch is the secretary. This executive board of thirteen will have the co-operation of the following synagogue presidents who were present at the meeting last Sunday: B. Hirsch, Congregation Agudath Jacob; Zelig Rosman, Congregation Anshe Odessa; M. Lewis, Congregation Biker Cholim Anshe Rusish Polen; A. Kaplan, Congregation Ezrath Israel Anshe Motele; M. Tunik and Mitlik, Congregation Kehilath Yeshurin; A. Guaholtz, Sam Weinew, and M. Wiskowsky, Congregation Agudath Israel; I. Goldberg, Congregation Kehilath Jacob.</p>
   <p>This large committee will soon begin a campaign among Jewish parents to prohibit their children from going to the missionary schools. They will go from house to house and see to it that the missionary plague does not spread.</p>
