   <p>It would be a crime against the truth, it would be childish to maintain that the banquet for Mr. Sokolow and his associates of the second Zionist delegation was a success. It was not successful, neither financially nor morally. Many of the people at the banquet, perhaps the majority, were persons who had already given their contribution to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. From such a gathering, no money could be expected. The small sum that was collected at the banquet was really a surprise.</p>
   <p>At the banquet there were present Zionist workers, or the kind of people who believe that it is their duty to attend such affairs. Only a few of the leaders of the city were present, and those few had already contributed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their share to the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>We ask: Where were those hundreds of prominent citizens who were present at the Weizmann banquet? Where were the leaders and the representatives of institutions and organizations? Where were the representatives of the well-to-do class who always respond so generously to an appeal for Palestine?</p>
   <p>The fact the representatives of Chicago Orthodoxy had decided to give a banquet of their own for the Zionist delegation, independent of the general Zionist organization, is no reason for last Tuesday's failure. There could have been a larger and more select gathering at the La Salle Hotel Tuesday night, and the financial result could have been better. When the representatives of a local charity organization get together to raise a fund, they collect on the spot more money than was collected Tuesday night for the Keren Hayesod.</p>

   <p>We maintain that the Chicago Jews are generous and that they give for public Jewish purposes much more money than the Jews of any other city in the U. S. Chicago gave more than New York, more than Philadelphia, not only for relief work but also for the Registration Fund. Chicago Jews have not become any poorer nor less good-natured since the last Registration Fund drive.</p>
   <p>We know from past experience that the Chicago Jews are willing to give for the Keren Hayesod. A few resolute public workers such as Mr. Sam Ginsburg, Mr. Thomas Piser, Rabbi Lessin, Mr. Paul Rattenber, and others who have undertaken to raise a certain quota have done brilliant work. Mr. Thomas Piser reports that he alone has collected, within a few days, the sum of sixteen hundred dollars, and Rabbi Lessin has collected eight hundred dollars within two days. This proves that money can be collected in Chicago if there are workers.</p>

   <p>If anybody, any person or group of persons, is to blame for the small success (or let us call the child by its right name and say, the big failure) of the banquet last Tuesday night at the La Salle Hotel, it is nobody but the Zionist workers themselves. The number of Zionists who have undertaken to raise a certain quota is very small. We believe that there are more volunteers in small towns with a Jewish population of a few thousand than there are in Chicago. Is it not a crying shame that in a great Jewish city like Chicago we should not be able to organize two hundred volunteers for the Keren Hayesod? One swallow or even three swallows do not make a summer and a few volunteers cannot assure the success of the Keren Hayesod in Chicago, even if they should all be the most influential people in town.</p>
   <p>Not the Chicago Jews but the Chicago Zionists, and especially, the active Chicago Zionists, are to blame for the present sad and disgraceful situation. Out of the several thousand organized Zionists of Chicago, at least three or four hundred should have volunteered for the Keren Hayesod. Actually the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>work was done by only ten or fifteen people, and you cannot have anything if you do not work for it.</p>
   <p>We do not have to play politics and we do not have to cover up the facts. We must be honest with ourselves. We must and we should confess that the first shot in the Keren Hayesod drive missed its aim. Luckily we are at the beginning of the drive and we can still correct certain faults. There is still time to organize volunteers; there is still time to really exert ourselves.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Chicago Orthodoxy have undertaken to do some Keren Hayesod work of their own. They will give an official reception, in the form of a banquet, to the second Zionist delegation. The leaders of Orthodoxy should learn from the mistakes of the Zionists. If they do not properly prepare the banquet, then it will be a failure and the great Sokolow and his <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>associates will go away brokenhearted, spiritually depressed. This must not happen. The honor of Chicago Jewry is at stake. The success of the entire Keren Hayesod movement in America is at stake. It is high time for Chicago Jewry to awake to a realization of its duty.</p>
