   <p>Chicago without Jews! Who can imagine such a thing? And yet, it is, among our venerable non-Jewish neighbors, a fact. Take, for instance, the official report, submitted to the Board of Education, by the superintendent of compulsory education, Mr. William L. Bedeana, and you will readily see that, in Chicago there is not a Jew to be had.</p>
   <p>It is true, that when one of us (Jews) commits the slightest crime, our world famous newspapers accredit it to our nationality and race. If, however, a census is taken in order to determine the elements that influence the lives of the millions of people in the city, we suddenly drop out of the picture. We become Russian pogromists, Polish rebels, Rumanian anti-Semites, etc., everything but Jews.</p>
   
   <p>According to the above mentioned report of the school census, the Chicago population consists of 2,437,527 people. From this, less than one-third - 806,668 were born of American parents, whereas 1,630,859 were born of immigrant parents, or came from some foreign country. The Germans constitute the greatest number of these immigrant children by a total of 399,977. The Poles come next, by 231,346; then the Russians by 166,134, and so on through the list of all nationalities, except those of very small number.</p>
   <p>Only one nationality is missing, and that is the Jewish one. The Jews are only counted at Ellis Island...They are treated worse than any other nationality on the ships and their examinations upon their arrival are more severe. However, as soon as they come to America, they vanish, and are counted as Poles, Rumanians, etc.</p>
   
   <p>There are five Jews to one Russian in Chicago, and yet the Russians are credited with the progress and virtuous deeds of the Chicago Jewry. When including Jews among civilized nationalities, it is unjust to exclude them for their merits. The fact that a Jew is born in Russia, does not make him a Russian - or in France a Frenchman. And just as he goes under a separate heading when entering this country, so should he be distinguished at each census, and therefore be given the credit due him.</p>
   <p>And the crime is still greater when it comes from the office of the superintendent of compulsory education, which should have known that there is a greater difference between Jews and Russians than between the Jews and all other nationalities with whom they dwell. Calling a Jew by the name of another nation is very unjust, if not criminal.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Bedeana should have known that Jewish children study in the public grade and high schools, in the colleges and universities, in largernumbers (according to percentage) than several other nationalities. And such a nationality cannot be overlooked by mistake.</p>
   <p>It was also wrong of the Chicago (English printed) press, which published this false report, not to make the slightest remark that an injustice had occurred. The same newspapers, that often publish extras for the Jews, have suddenly forgotten that such a race as the Jews, exist on the face of the globe, and have helped to spread the criminal lie of "Chicago without Jews."</p>
