   <p>The early fathers of the Church, when asked by the learned pagans why it was that Christians call themselves brothers and children of God, and yet make war on one another, answered that Christian solidarity existed only in the church. Outside of the church everyone could go his own way. This ruling of the fathers of the early Church still holds good.</p>
   <p>In direct contradistinction to those theological conceptions, stands the Jewish conception of religious, national, political and racial solidarity. The fathers of the synagogue ruled, "Kol Israel Araivim Ze Lo Ze," every Jew is responsible for his fellow Jew.</p>
   <p>This concept of Jewish solidarity still holds good with the majority of our people, and only a certain number of Reformed rabbis seek to reform Judaism in this <span class="page-break">2</span>respect also. "Jewish solidarity exists and can exist nowhere but in the synagogue and in the aims for which the synagogue stands." This typically Christian concept of solidarity is taught by a rabbi in Israel, who thus attempts to bring to Judaism a doctrine which is essentially Christian.</p>
   <p>From the point of view of Jewish traditions, his idea of solidarity is, to use a mild expression, untrue. It is so even from the point of view of Reformed Judaism, because out of every one hundred Jews, not even ten go to the synagogue, and if Jewish solidarity exists only in the synagogue, then it doesn't exist at all. The appeal of the leading congregations of Cincinnati to the local Jewish businessmen to be present in the synagogue at least on Yom Kippur,indicates that the Reformed synagogue is not overcrowded. If Dr. Rosenau and his kind would consider the realities of life as they exist, they would necessarily be compelled to see that there is no such thing as Jewish solidarity if such solidarity exists only in the synagogue.</p>
   <p>The question of Jewish solidarity is not to be considered merely from the <span class="page-break">3</span>viewpoint of Jewish traditions and Jewish reality. It must also be considered from the point of view of our environment. It is easy to say that Jewish solidarity exists and should exist only in the synagogue, but if a Jewish person commits a crime, it is usually laid at the door of the Jewish people. The non-Jewish world regards us, probably to the regret of Dr. Rosenau, as a national unit, and holds us accountable for the deeds and misdeeds of the Jewish individual. This alone imposes on us a Jewish solidarity outside of the synagogue.</p>
   <p>Every sane Jew and every sane non-Jew must wonder at the assertion of the learned rabbi of Baltimore that Jewish solidarity exists only in the synagogue.</p>
