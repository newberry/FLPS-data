   <p>Dr. Stoltz in his address at Isiah Temple urged the people of Chicago to take part in the agitation for abrogating the treaty with Russia. Dr. Stoltz related to the audience that eighty years ago at the time when Andrew Jackson was president, the United States made a treaty with Russia in which both countries agreed to allow freedom of trade for the citizens of their countries. During the first forty years Russia stuck to its agreement pretty well, but for the last forty years the Russian government made a rocky road for the Jewish citizens of the United States, without paying any attention to any of our presidents, Secretarys of State and Ambassadors who protested against the treatment of our United States Jewish citizens. These protests brought few results. Now the time is ripe for Chicago to wake up and raise a united voice for justice, so that our senator Shelby M. Cullom who is chairman of foreign relations will hear of this protest and will submit it to both houses of congress with the recommendation that plans be formulated to give Russia one year's time to comply with the agreement or else abrogate the treaty.</p>
