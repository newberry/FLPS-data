   <p>When, after a lapse of twenty years, District Grand Lodge No #6 of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith again holds its annual convention in Chicago, it is indeed very much like the return of the prodigal, for it cannot be gainsaid that the original and spiritual home of the Grand Lodge is in Chicago. It does seem rather an innuendo against our Fair City, however, that it has to run off both a World's Fair and a massive Jewish Day in order to entice the Grand Lodge here - for they had no intention of coming here, preferring Omaha.</p>
   <p>We know that it will be many years before Chicago can hope to offer such powerful inducements to the Grand Lodge - but we sincerely hope that they will come more often in the years to come.</p>

   <p>During the past years, B'Nai B'Rith has consistently expanded the scope of its work, and its A. Z. A. work and Hillel Foundation program are of supreme importance in the American Jewish sphere. Like all organizations its budget is a terrific headache, yet the work is so important that it must not be even curtailed. A way simply must be found. And so we greet the Grand Lodge. And we repeat, you are so welcome, come a little more often.</p>
