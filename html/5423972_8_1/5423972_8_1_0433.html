   <p>The South Side and the West Side Ghettos were settled mainly by Jews who had come from Lithuania and Poland. A new Ghetto was growing up in the Northwest portion of the city. This settlement was composed almost entirely of Jews who came from the heart of Russia. We find here a group of the intelligentsia who tried to force a Russian culture on their new environment. They even insisted upon the continual use of the Russian language in their new home.</p>
