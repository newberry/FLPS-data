   <p>A Beautiful Contribution to the Jewish Holiday Spirit in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the mid-week of Succoth, the Jews of Chicago will have an opportunity to enjoy themselves at the Hebrew Institute, where a grand feast has been arranged.</p>
   <p>An Enormous Succoh.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute of Chicago will gain a name for itself in the Jewish community, through the "Succoth Festival" or holiday parade, which is being arranged on the grounds of the Institution. This will be the first time in the life of the Jewish community of Chicago, that a large number of Jewish people will be able to get together, in pleasant surroundings and enjoy themselves as Jews.</p>
   <p>We want to point out that the festival will bear a strictly Jewish character. An enormous Succoh, appropriately decorated, will be erected on a six acre lawn, surrounding the buildings. Music and entertainment will be provided, and those present will enjoy themselves in a real Jewish fashion.</p>
   <p>At this time the public will also have an opportunity to become acquainted with this great Institution, which is destined to become the center of Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is located at Taylor, Lyttle and Sybley Sts. All surface lines lead you there. The festival will begin Sunday and will continue until the following Thursday.</p>
