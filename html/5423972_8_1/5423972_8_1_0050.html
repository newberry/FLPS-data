   <p>This Board and its predecessors have repeatedly tried to wean the friends of the Association from the antiquated custom of collecting money by personal solicitation. Soliciting for the poor on Yom Kippur Eve was first adopted by Sinai and Zion Congregations in 1881. Sinai Congregation in that year realized $3,500, and Zion Congregation nearly $700. Last Yom Kippur Eve, Sinai Congregation again obtained subscriptions amounting to about $5,000. We urge this plan upon every congregation.</p>
