   <p>Our editorial of yesterday about our guest from Russia has already become effective. A meeting was called by Mr. Adolph Krauss, president of the B'nai B'rith, for the purpose of organizing a committee of prominent Jews to extend an invitation to the Russian Commission, requesting its presence as guest of the Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>We are pleased that our opinion has borne weight immediately, and still more pleased that the undertaking lies in proper hands. We are sure that with Mr. Krauss as chairman of the committee, the reception will be carried through properly and in a stately manner.</p>
