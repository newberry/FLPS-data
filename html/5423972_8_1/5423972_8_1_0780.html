   <p>The Civic Committee, which was established by the Lawndale Club, is accomplishing very splendid work. The committee takes a great interest in the social conditions in the district which was so rapidly inhabited by Jews. They have, recently, taken up the question of schools, police protection, and transportation facilities with which the district is inadequately supplied. We are now informed that the Civic Committee has become interested in protecting the Jewish populace of that district (Lawndale) against the attacks made by the non-Jewish hoodlums.</p>
   <p>When the Lawndale Club organized, it was no more than natural that it would attract those people seeking entertainment. The principal task of the leaders of the club was to furnish its members with physical and emotional entertainment. But slowly, the founders and leaders of the club begam to feel a dislike for personal entertainment.</p>
   
   <p>The better elements began developing; lectures were featured, and as natural among intellectual people, the lectures were the best available. This led to the awakening of the dormant instinct that is embodied in every intellectual Jew and finally resulted in creating great interest in matters that concern the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>It would be a great asset if such clubs were established in every Jewish district, regardless of what the first finders and members have in view. And whenever we assemble in a Jewish environment, where only Jews can be found, we shall then discard non-Jewish nonsense, i. e. cards and other games, and become interested in spiritual things, or in general and Jewish social matters. The Lawndale Club has many good assets. It has distinguished itself on the social, charitable, and political field, and a great future faces it. Similar clubs in other Jewish neighborhoods are welcome.</p>
