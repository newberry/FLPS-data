   <p>In an editorial entitled "For Our American Heritage," the Chicago Tribune lays stress on the fact that the American Jewry does not constitute an organic unit; that it is divided into two parts, one part, genuinely American and completely assimilated, and another of Eastern European origin, unassimilated and unassimilative, because it succumbs to un-American influences in the Ghetto.</p>
   <p>According to the Tribune's editorial, there is a minority of truly American Jews and a majority of un-American Jews in this country and that the later so-called un-American Jews, mostly of Eastern European origin, are radicals, reds, and opposed to everything American. Instead of arguing with the Tribune, we beg to submit the following facts and figures:</p>
   
   <p>There are in America about three and a half million Jews. No more than three million hail from Eastern and Central Europe and a few hundred thousand from Western Europe. The bulk of American Jewry, nay, its vast majority, is of Eastern and Central European origin, and to maintain that Jews of Eastern European origin are openly defiant and hostile to American institutions is a charge against the majority of American Jews that they are disloyal to America. What are the real facts? 1. There are in this country eight Yiddish dailies with a total circulation exceeding six to seven hundred thousand. Six of these eight dailies are conservative in all matters of policy, both Jewish and American. Of the other two, one described as malevolent, the Forward, is malevolent mainly because it is an imitation of the yellowest hue of American journalism. The last of these Yiddish dailies, incidentally also the one with the least influenced circulation, is a publication preaching radical policies, but so do many American publications printed in the English language. Each and everyone of the two score or more of Jewish weeklies, with the exception of two, published by zealots for their own gratification, are conservative.</p>
   
   <p>As to the religious and social organizations of the American Jewry, we beg to submit the following facts:</p>
   <p>2. There are in this country fifty-five hundred Orthodox Jewish Congregations, members of the United Orthodox Congregations of America, the membership of which is opposed to radicalism, political, religious, social or otherwise. There are also three hundred synagogues affiliated with the United Synagogues, Orthodox and conservative in spirit and in practice. There are also about four hundred Reform Jewish Temples, and their membership consists of Jews of Western European origin, whom the Tribune praises for their good Americanism.</p>
   <p>3. There are in this country some half million Jewish working men and working women. Most, if not all, of them are, of course, unionized, but the fact that they belong to labor unions does not mean that they are radicals.</p>
   <p>Resent conservative editorial utterances expressed the opinion that labor organizations like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, strictly Jewish in membership and leadership, an organization which Jew-baiters always wave as a specter of "dictatorship of the proletariat", has exhibited sagacity, tact, and a sense of justice in dealing with the employers. They have emphasized employee's duties as well as rights, have sought to promote efficiency and steady stabilization of the clothing industry. Recognition of the principles of conciliation and arbitration has been a never-wavering policy of this or other Jewish labor organizations. Surely nothing more American then this display of fairness in industry can be expected from any labor organization.</p>
   <p>4. There are in this country a score of Jewish fraternal organizations with a total membership of six hundred thousand. Only one of these fraternal organizations, with a membership of fifty thousand, is half-way radical. We say deliberately half-way radical, because it is divided in its own house, one group of the rank and file inclining to radicalism and the other group inclining to conservatism. All other fraternal organizations are outspokenly pro-American, outspokenly patriotic, and outspokenly conservative.</p>
   
   <p>5. You mention the name of Hilquitt and Cahan as representatives of Jewish radicalism. In the first place no intelligent radical takes Cahan or Hilquitt seriously as radicals. They have vague socialist conceptions and their socialism is not acceptable to the real socialist in this country. Hilquitt has even been charged in his own party with being a reactionary.</p>
   <p>6. We do not deny that there are Jewish radicals in this country, but in comparison to the number of Jews in America, their number is ridiculously small and their influence is nil. To say that they are a factor in American Jewish life is to utter the greatest nonsense. They are actually outside of the pale of Jewish activities and have no standing in Jewish circles. For the most part they are a group of Russified Jews, men and women who have been brought up on the traditions of Russian revolutionism and are more Russian than Jews. They are not only anti-religious Jews, but they are also against everything that is Jewish culturally, educationally, spiritually, etc.</p>
   <p>7. Polish or Russian Jews in America are neither Poles nor Russians, but Americans, live American lives, and raise their children as Americans. These Polish and Russian Jews send their sons and daughters to American colleges and other institutions of learning in such numbers that college authorities surreptitiously attempt to limit their numbers in a thoroughly un-American manner. Out of the seventeen thousand Jewish college boys and college girls in this country, fifteen thousand are sons and daughters of these same Polish and Russian Jews and the only grudge a Gentile can bear against these college boys and college girls is that they carry away most of the scholastic and academic honors.</p>
   <p>These Polish and Russian Jews whom the Tribune seems to consider as outcasts have enriched American life in many respects. They have made noble contributions to American culture and civilization, they have distinguished themselves as scientists and artists, as men of letters, as poets, organizers, social workers, and, of course, in business and in philanthropy. Most of these Russian and Polish Jews spend from ten to twenty per cent of their income on local, general Jewish and Palestine Jewish charities and on helping their distressed friends and relatives in Europe. You complain that these Polish and Russian Jews are not assimilated and are not assimilative at all. The fact of the matter is that they assimilate too quickly, and it is this fast process of their assimilation that makes them often lose their Jewish equilibrium for a while.</p>
   <p>Among the outstanding leaders in American thought, art, commerce, industry, etc., are Jews of these same European lands or their children. How can anyone suspect such people of being raised in a non-American atmosphere? But still the Tribune asserts that they are poor Americans.</p>
