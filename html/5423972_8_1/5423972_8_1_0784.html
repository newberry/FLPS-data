   <p>Comes the dawn and all is quiet. For the past few years our little Jewish community was virtually stormed with cultural activity. Meetings, lectures, prominent guests, protest meetings, and so on were the order of the day.</p>
   <p>There was a hubbub of activity, but then comes the Dawn. Life itself began to take on a more normal and quieter aspect. Jews have come to realize that God helps only those who help themselves. We realize that we must create our own Messiah, and that secular forces cannot bring the Messiah to us.</p>
   <p>Many new organizations, and old ones, too, have come to back the Zionist Program. Of late two new Chicago organizations have joined the Zionist Movement. They are the "Zionist Lodge" of the "Western Star" and the "Beaconsfield Lodge" of the "Order B'nai Abraham".</p>
   
   <p>Many new Jewish organizations have sprung up in Chicago of late. Until now Jews have been primarily concerned with the need of education. As these problems are rapidly nearing solution, our forces seem to be diverted to new fields, that of organization, social, labor, fraternal, etc.</p>
   <p>We feel that Chicago should follow the examples of other large cities, with Jewish communities. Hebrew Teachers in our own schools should band together for the purpose of solving our own educational needs.</p>
   <p>The City of Toudor, England, has shown what can be done by a unified Jewish Educational System. Chicago would do well to follow suit.</p>
