   <p>The Mayor of Chicago, Mr. William E. Dever, gave two hundred and fifty dollars for the Keren Hayesod. The Mayor, who is not a Jew, can see the absolute necessity of rebuilding Palestine for the Jewish people. He gives two hundred and fifty dollars to the Keren Hayesod to express his sympathy with the great undertaking.</p>
   <p>How much do you give? If you have any sense of honor, you will give not as much as you like to, but as much as you can.</p>
   <p>You have surely read the proclamation by Mayor Dever to all citizens of Chicago in behalf of the Keren Hayesod. It is true that the Mayor appeals <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to all citizens of this great and progressive city that they should help the Keren Hayesod, but he really means you, because he has the right to assume that we Jews are interested more than anybody else in Palestine. Will you respond to the noble appeal of the Mayor of Chicago for Palestine? You will surely respond to the Mayor's appeal if you are a Jew who has a sense of duty and honesty.</p>
   <p>We will have to report to our beloved Mayor about the effect of his appeal. I am one of the committee which has to report to him. I want you not to embarrass me and the committee which has to see him. We cannot come to the Mayor of Chicago and tell him that the Jews of Chicago are not interested in Palestine, that they do not care whether Palestine is rebuilt or not. We want, and you want it, too, that Mayor Dever should think of us that we are responsible Jews and not bums. He will have a very bad opinion of his Jewish fellow citizens if the committee should come to him to report that the Jews in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Chicago are not interested in the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Chicago has set us a very good example. You must and you should follow his example.</p>
   <p>When the Keren Hayesod committee will come to you for a contribution that you do not want to make because you are a Jew with a soul of iron, do not give the committee any idle excuses that you have not the money, that your expenses are too big, that you are not interested, and so on. Have the courage to say that you do not want to give because you believe in the saying: "Let us eat and drink because tomorrow we may die." All debauchees, all egoists, all cruel people believe in this saying. If you are not interested in Palestine, then nothing Jewish interests you, even your own children do not interest you. What interests you in life is only what you call having a good time. May the enemies of Israel have your conception of a good time.</p>

   <p>A Jew told me yesterday morning that he could not give to the Keren Hayesod because, only a few days ago, he had bought a car for which he had paid thirty-eight hundred dollars in cash. I told him that if a Jew can afford to pay thirty-eight hundred dollars for a car, he can give a thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod. The Jew looked at me with stabbing eyes, became very angry, and wanted to go away, but I did not let him. I reminded him that when he came to this country, sixteen years ago, the Shelter Society of New York helped him, the charities and various aid societies helped him, and that, therefore, he owes something to the Jewish people. If the Jewish people had not pitied him, he would not be able today to buy a car for [almost] four thousand dollars. The Jew, still a little angry, offered me twenty-five dollars for the Keren Hayesod, but I did not want to do him that favor. Palestine is not as cheap as that.</p>
