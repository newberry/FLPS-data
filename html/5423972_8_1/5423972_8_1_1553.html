   <p>Five thousand Zionists are expected in Chicago the first week in July to attend the thirty-fifth annual convention of the Zionist Organization of America at the Palmer House.</p>
   <p>Dr. Chaim Weitzman, world chief of the Zionists, is coming here, both to attend the convention and to participate in the Jewish Day. Chicago was selected by the Zionist Organization especially because of Jewish Day at the Century of Progress Exposition.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman will be the chairman of the committee on arrangements for the convention. Sessions will be held on July 1, 2, 3, and 4. In addition to Dr. Weitzman, Morris Rothenberg, national president, and Louis Lipsky, will attend the convention. A committee of Chicago Zionists will be designated next week by Jacob M.
