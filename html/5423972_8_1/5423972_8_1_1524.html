   <p>Passover.</p>
   <p>Year in and year out, we Jewish people prepare to celebrate our traditional holiday, Passover. We read the same "Ha-Gadah," eat the traditional matzohs and go through the old established ritual.</p>
   <p>Yet, it seems, that each year there looms before us in an even greater role, that great Jewish leader, Moses. He seems to appear again in that esthetic appearance and with those powerful arms, with which he effected the freedom of his people. He seems to call out again to his people, "Free Thyself."</p>
   <p>The chains of the Diaspora have eaten into our flesh. Where can we today find a Moses who will again lead us to freedom as of old. When we again open the door to welcome our honored guest, Elijah the Prophet, let us not <span class="page-break">\2</span>be satisfied with his mere partaking of our wine. Let us cling to this spirit of the prophet, the spirit of Moses, our teacher, let us feel the spirit of this noble being in our hearts, in our homes, not only for his brief presence, but for ever. Perhaps with this spirit permeating our hearts and our homes, we can produce within one, who although not a Moses or an Elijah, will nevertheless lead us to true and eternal freedom, forever free of persecution.</p>
