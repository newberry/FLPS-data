   <p>In the Jewish Neighborhood of Chicago. by B. Ballvinik.</p>
   <p>Beautiful streets, beautiful trees, blooming boulevards, fountains, and it feels like a true Sabbath in spring, in the Douglas Park Jewish district. On a Friday evening, I took a stroll through Douglas Park and the Jewish Neighborhood, and I was more than happy to see that the Jewish people of Chicago had selected the West Side as their home. Finest decorated streets with grass growing in the center; fine houses with lawns in the front and gardens growing between the buildings. It is beautiful, quiet - one seldom passes anyone. I recognize this is a Jewish neighborhood only because of the butcher shops, synagogues, and the Jewish music one hears.</p>
   <p>I met Jewish workers in their working clothes, and I was happy to see that the Jewish laborer lives in this beautiful Douglas Park Neighborhood. Douglas Park is very beautiful in itself, and under the branches of its trees, betrothals are arranged and Jewish heroes promise true love to their brides.</p>

   <p>It is a large Jewish ward covered by a beautiful blue sky and containing many fountains. By the way, it appears as though the Italian and Greek immigrants are trying to enter the neighborhood. Personally, I hope that the League of Nations will recognize Jewish rights and that Douglas Park will become a permanent Jewish territory. It is fitting that Kedzie Ave. should out through the middle of the Jewish Quarter. This street is very popular with the Jews of Chicago. Kedzie Ave. reminds one of the Jewish Bronzeville where nanny-goats dance (a nanny-goat is a Jewish milk animal).</p>
   <p>The 12th Street car is also a Jewish institution in Chicago. It is that car line which connects the two major Jewish districts, Douglas Park and Halsted and Maxwell St. The 12th Street car line is like the New York Ralph Ave. car, which connects Essex St. and Bronzeville. In the 12th Street car one sees Jews reading detective stories as well as the works of Tolstoy and Chekhov. Workers with intelligent faces are carrying on discussions among themselves on world affairs. I saw also a tragedy on a 12th Street car. A young well dressed lady with a child was riding with her father-in-law. She evidently wants to speak English, but the old man is slightly deaf and understands no English, and she was obliged therefore, to speak to him in Yiddish, and in a loud voice.</p>
