   <p>The annual meeting of the Society for the Education of Jewish Orphans was held at 2229 Calumet avenue on Sunday, May 15. The president, Mr. Henry L. Frank, gave the following report: The past year came nearer exhausting our income than any previous one in the history of the Society for Education of Jewish Orphans. What, with the requirements for clothing, shoes, etc., our accumulated capital may, in the near future, be drawn upon. The demands of sixteen orphans explain this more satisfactorily than anything else. Yet, as a whole, we have every reason to be satisfied with results obtained.</p>
   <p>The young ones who are under the beneficent influences of a family life, must as a rule, become better than those who are herded together by the hundreds under the supervision of a superintendent. Thus far we have not made any efforts to interest the public-at-large in our society. To extend its usefulness, a larger fund is of primary necessity. Could we not enlist friends to our cause who will see that substantial aid be given by those <span class="page-break">\2</span>who are amply able to do so? Instead of caring for sixteen orphans we might care for a good many more. During the past year, two children were taken off the list of our wards, while eight were added thereto. Owing to the different dates of adoption, an average cost per child for the year, cannot be safely arrived at. The total amount for maintenance of our wards for the past year is $2,301.49.</p>
