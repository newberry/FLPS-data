   <p>The foreign population in America will be put to the test this coming Fourth of July. The government wants them to show their "true colors", wants them to reveal what they think and how they feel about America. The government wants to see the greatest and most enthusiastic display of patriotism possible, on this day. And in order to know the loyalty of each and every national group, it stipulates that alongside of the American flag, the group must unfurl its own flag, the flag of the native land. Germans and Austrians will of course be unable to do this. The Jews will unfurl their own flag, the white and blue banner.</p>
   <p>All kinds of demonstrations, mass meetings, and parades should be arranged for this day. The various national groups already have committees working.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Jews also have a committee, and every effort is being made so that this year's Fourth of July will be as impressive as possible.</p>
   <p>The main feature of the day will be the parade. We want to see as many Jews as possible in this parade. Jewish congregations, Jewish lodges, Jewish organizations, and Jewish unions--all of them should participate in this parade. The more Jews there are marching [in the parade], the better it will be for our community, and the more it will indicate Jewish loyalty.</p>
   <p>You, leaders of the aforementioned organizations, don't delay because time is short. Call meetings immediately and appoint committees. The committees should get in touch with the Central Jewish Committee, which in turn will meet with the City Committee to complete the plans for the celebration.</p>
   <p>Don't be indifferent and don't joke [about the matter]. This is not an ordinary parade, nor is it a big "racket" hatched for the benefit of a few individuals, or for the benefit of one organization. It's a community affair, so <span class="page-break">3</span>don't take it lightly because we don't want the Chicago Jews to go on record as not being in sympathy with America. Hanging American flags from your homes and stores will mean nothing; nor will the packing of Douglas Park where a great Jewish mass meeting has been arranged, mean much. The purchase of Liberty Bonds and war stamps will have very little significance.</p>
   <p>This day is a most welcome opportunity for the Jews to display their patriotism for America by having a parade. Therefore, Jews, prepare for the parade! We must celebrate this occasion as Jews. In Chicago, seventy-five nationalities will participate, each under its own native flag, each a parade by itself. All classes of people will march on that day, to make it as historic a one as the first Fourth of July--that historic day when the Liberty Bell proclaimed this country to be a Democracy, and heralded the rise of a mighty nation which was to become the guardian angel of all oppressed nations.</p>
   <p>A Good Proposition For Idlers</p>
   <p>"Work or fight" is the government's order to all men between the ages of twenty-one <span class="page-break">4</span>and thirty-one. Soon such an order will also be given to all those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. All able-bodied individuals will either have to work or fight; they must do something to help us win the war.</p>
   <p>In wartime, the population is usually divided into two parts; one part fights at the front, and the other part works at home and thus helps those who are fighting at the front.</p>
   <p>The youth is already doing its share. But among the adult population, there are quite a number of idlers; and they will have to obtain work or else they will be drafted. They'll have guns placed upon their shoulders and they'll be set to guard armories or to wash dishes or scrub floors.</p>
   <p>Among those who are considered to be doing useful work, the farmers rank first, together with the munition manufacturers and the soldiers because soldiers can <span class="page-break">5</span>accomplish nothing without ammunition and food.</p>
   <p>The government issued an appeal requesting all able-bodied persons to help out on farms, so that the farmer may produce more crops.</p>
   <p>Jewish youths and older Jewish men are answering the call. They are applying to the local office of the Jewish Agricultural Society and are asking to be sent to work on farms. But there is one drawback; they don't know the work and yet they demand high wages. They cannot get from the farmer more pay than they deserve. And they should therefore accept the current rate offered them--at least, at first. They should bear in mind that in addition to the opportunity offered them to learn a useful trade, they are also helping our government to win the war.</p>
   <p>We have a class of older Jews whose occupations are not recognized by our government as "useful work"; we refer to peddling, tending bar, and other similar <span class="page-break">6</span>occupations. These people should now take up farming.</p>
   <p>And to prevent [the possibility of] their being misled, we suggest that these Jews go to the office of the above-mentioned organization. Mr. George V. Simon, the manager, will not only give them information, but will also provide them with jobs. At the same time, we wish to say to the Jews who want to buy farms, that they should also see Mr. Simon, so that they will not have to pay any commissions, and will not be swindled. He himself, and his assistants, are qualified agriculturists and are good appraisers of farms. At their own expense, they will go with the buyer to the farm and will give their estimate of its value.</p>
   <p>Focus your attention upon farms. It will be healthy for you, yourself, as well as for Jewry as a whole; and it will be helpful to our government. More and more Jews should take up farming!</p>
   <p>Quarrel In St. Louis Over Possession Of Courier</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In St. Louis the Courier is the most widely circulated Jewish newspaper. At half-past two in the morning many bundles [of newspapers] are delivered at the Union Depot here in Chicago; and at two o'clock in the afternoon, they enter St. Louis via the Wabash railroad. In one hour, the Courier is in every Jewish store where newspapers are sold, on every newsstand and is also delivered to private homes by the carriers.</p>
   <p>In St. Louis they await the Courier impatiently, first, because it costs only one cent (whereas the others cost two), and second, because it appears there on the same day that it is published in Chicago. Through the Courier, the readers in St. Louis know the news on the same day that you do in Chicago, except that you receive your paper early in the morning, whereas they don't get it until the afternoon. We expect the reorganization of our various departments to be completed in the near future. Then an earlier edition of the Courier will probably be printed, enabling the St. Louis readers to receive <span class="page-break">8</span>it at eight o'clock in the morning. In the meantime, they impatiently await its arrival.</p>
   <p>Our St. Louis correspondent told of a fight over a Courier that took place between two elderly inmates of the local [Jewish] home for the aged. There was only one Courier and both wanted to read it at the same time. An argument arose which finally led to blows, and the result was that one of them was laid up in bed.</p>
   <p>The superintendent found no other alternative then to punish these two as well as the rest of the inmates, by stopping the delivery of the Courier. No more Courier!</p>
   <p>His decision, however, resulted in an actual revolt on the part of the old men. Even the old fellow who took the beating couldn't lie still in bed. The idea of stopping the Courier! They were on the verge of a hunger strike as well as <span class="page-break">9</span>a strike against his ruling.</p>
   <p>The superintendent was compelled to yield. He rescinded the order cancelling the Courier. Instead he increased the number of copies so that there would be no more arguments over a copy of the Courier.</p>
   <p>Jewish Organizations Will Be Forced To Adopt New Insurance Rates</p>
   <p>The Jewish organizations which still maintain the old system [of insurance rates] will not be able to hold out much longer. They will have to change their insurance system. For not only do no new members come in, but the old ones are dropping out. These organizations do not appeal to young people either from a business standpoint, or from a social standpoint. The old members are gradually dying. And as there is little possibility, under the circumstances, of recruiting new members, the decrease in membership caused by <span class="page-break">10</span>deaths cannot be made up.</p>
   <p>The burden upon the older members in that organization [with no young membership to alleviate it] becomes heavier and heavier. Eventually there is no insurance to pay, and--busto!</p>
   <p>The organizations must accept higher rates; therein lies their only salvation. Every sensible member and loyal officer should think about this matter. The courts will support them in it. The New York State Supreme Court recently decided in favor of the Royal Arcanum and against one of its members who fought the new rates of that organization.</p>
   <p>Delegates at a convention of an organization who succeed in voting down every motion to adopt the proper insurance rates are shortening the life of that organization, and are hastening its death.</p>

   <p>An Ardent Zionist</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Levinson is one of the Zionists who went to the Pittsburgh Convention at their own expense. This is the selfsame Mr. Levinson who, together with Mr. D. P. Pollack, went to Jerusalem four years ago to establish a clothing industry there based on American standards. But because of the war, he had to leave the country and return to America. Mr. Levinson, however, did not give up his plan. As soon as peace is again established, he will go there once more; and then not only will the young men and women of the Holy City learn a new trade as a means of livelihood, but Palestine will no longer have to import clothes from Austria and Germany.</p>
   <p>This is a splendid plan and a noble dream of a true Zionist.</p>
