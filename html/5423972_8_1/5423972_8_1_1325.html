   <p>If anyone doubts the present revitalization of the Jewish Flag of the Jewish People, he should see the spirit and work of our Youth in the Zionist Movement. They, the Youth of Free America, are not motivated because of persecution, but because of an inherited desire to aid their people.</p>
   <p>The beautiful Zionist Flag we had was burned in the Institute fire. But already it has been replaced by an even more beautiful flag, with much finer ornamentations.</p>
   <p>The coming Lag Ba-Omer Programs promise to be very interesting. The Junior Gates of the Knights of Zion will sing Hebrew Songs and the Boys' Gymnasium has prepared a flag. Drill speakers will be Leon Zolotkoff, Max Schulman, D. Aberson, and Rabbi Morris Levin. Admission is free, and everybody is invited.-- -- Rumanian Jewish Chicago Organization for Zion.</p>
   <p>Dr. Rosenzweig has informed us that two-hundred members will work in uniform at the Decoration-Day Parade.</p>
