   <p>The debate between the Young People's Socialist League, and the Young Maccabean (Radical Zionist Youth), in the West Side Auditorium, Sunday, ended in a divided decision among the judges.</p>
   <p>The judges were unable to agree. The two Zionists, Dr. M. Dolnick, a Poale Zion; and William Nathanson, a Zionist Anarchist, agreed with the young Zionist, and the Socialist, the writer of this article, agreed with the young Socialist.</p>
   <p>The debate was conducted very respectably from the speakers' side. I wish the audience had been as polite, and would have refrained from applauding and from creating disturbances.</p>

   <p>The first speaker, M. Kosh, of the Young People's Socialist League, began speaking as a Zionist:</p>
   <p>"We are already two thousand years in exile," but he immediately transferred his argument to the standpoint of the Young People's Socialist League concerning the Jewish question. He showed that the national cultural autonomy, a thing that Jews already have had to a certain degree, in Spain and in Poland, will solve the Jewish problem throughout the world. Jews will then have free democratic communities, schools, universities, court houses, and so forth, where the Yiddish language will be spoken. The Russian Revolution, for which we had shed our blood, the blood of the Bundists (Jewish Socialists in Russia) and other Jewish revolutionaries, will bring final victory.</p>

   <p>Our position in Russia will effect us so as to also procure national cultural autonomy in other countries and that will answer the Jewish question, more than would a government in Palestine.</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Simon Berman, of the Young Maccabees, showed that our own culture is requisite to a national cultural autonomy, and our own culture can not exist with out our own economics, our own land and our own environs. He brought evidence from Ancient Greece and Rome, from the Middle Ages, from the Arabian States, and from the present civilized countries, England, Russia, and America. Jews do not have their own economics and their culture is influenced by strangers. They are a minority all over, even when Russia held them in a secluded district.</p>

   <p>What can be done for national cultural autonomy in the rural districts and what will become of it when Jews will wonder from one country to another? But Jews will always remain in Palestine. There, the Jewish masses can defend their culture, through passive measures, while an active struggle, of which not everyone is capable, is required in other countries. The graduates from Jewish universities, in other countries, will be unable to earn a livelihood because they do not live in their own country. We are not in a condition to compete with the surrounding cultures and must therefore, have our own Jewish land.</p>
   <p>Pessoch Bakahl, of the Young People's Socialist League, was the third speaker. He showed why the Jewish problem can, practically, not be solved, in Palestine...the country is too small, insufficient water supply, and should the hills become valley, it could not populate more than three million. Consequently, Palestine will be unable to take in all the Jews from other countries and thus be unable to solve the Jewish question.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The great majority of Jews will remain living where they are now. Palestine will be unable to protect the other Jews from pogroms and as a Hebrew speaking country, it will not have cultural effect upon other Jews. Under no circumstances, will the majority of Jews of Palestine become greater than a majority in other countries, the majority of Jews, therefore, will be in need of a national cultural autonomy and those principles must also be accepted in Palestine, where the Arabians, as well as the Jewish laboring masses, will demand from the Hebrew speaking government that it should grant them a national cultural autonomy.</p>
   <p>Reuben Hurwitz, of the Young Maccabees, was the fourth speaker. He showed that national cultural autonomy will not answer the Jewish question, because of the abnormal Jewish economy and its resultant anti-Semitism.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We have no farming class because we were forbidden to till the soil in the Middle Ages, and we had to occupy ourselves with business. That condition effected us that even today we remain foreign to modern industry. Our tradesmen were driven away from the factories.</p>
   <p>The Forward states that anti-Semitism will disappear through the destruction of capitalism, if so, then that national cultural autonomy is no cure for anti-Semitism.</p>
   <p>CONTINUED ON JANUARY 24, 1918</p>
   <p>The debate between the Young Socialists and Young Zionists, concluded with resumes and remarks by both sides. Simon Berman, of the Young Maccabees, had stressed the facts that national cultural autonomy alone will not solve the Jewish problem.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Roumania promised Jewish rights and did not grant them. It will not help, under any circumstances, to spread Jewish minorities. National cultural autonomy is, certainly, required in Palestine and only there, in our own land will it be substantial. Pessach Bakahl, emphasized the point that the Jews did not lose anything by being engaged in business. Spain does not invite them with out any reason.</p>
   <p>America is an example proving that we can penetrate into all industries and still remain in the same catergory as we were. He also showed that, the Jewish culture is created in a Jewish spirit and that the national cultural autonomy is ours not as charity, as the Zionists demand Palestine, but as our full right.</p>
   <p>Then Reuben Hurwitz, of the Young Maccabees, declared again that the national cultural autonomy will not solve the Jewish question in other countries, that Palestine can accomodate the settlement of 14 million Jews.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Mandel Carson (his name was submitted as Kosh in yesterday's number by mistake), the last speaker, of the Young People's Socialist League, denied that Palestine is that which was pictured by the previous speakers and showed anew that national cultural autonomy can solve the Jewish problem, for the majority of Jews.</p>
   <p>The debate ended with this. The speakers of both sides have erred. The Young Maccabees more so than the Young People's Socialist League. The Young People's Socialist League granted too many concessions to Zionism settlement of 10 million new Jews in Palestine with in a period of ten years.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Pessach Bakahl has spoken brilliantly, but his statement that Palestine is 500 square miles was unpardonable. He forget that there are approximately 70,000 Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and that there are 1,400 persons per quadrate mile, more than three times as many as in industrial England. However, he was fortunate that his opponent, Reuben Hurwitz, was as far from the truth, when he asserted that Palestine can accommodate 14 million people, whereas in accordance with its area of 9,000 square miles (refer to Encyclopedia Briticania under Palestine Exploration Fund) cannot, under any circumstance, accommodate one third of 14 million, unless Jews will disperse in the countries of Syria and Mesopotamia, where there is sufficient place for millions of Jews.</p>
   <p>The greatest mistakes of the Young Maccabees, were on the strata of history and economics, from which they have gathered their convictions.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>It is important to mention that both sides did not stick to the subject: ("Will the Jewish Problem be Solved Through National Cultural Autonomy.") and instead of this, they swung to the question, "Palestine or other countries"?</p>
   <p>Above all, both sides evince a great deal of intimacy with Jewish and social problems, which showed that the new generation, who will replace us, will be closer to us than we were to our parents.</p>
