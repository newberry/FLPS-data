   <p>At a meeting of the administrative and executive committee of the Midwestern Zionist Division, which was held yesterday in the offices of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], the question of organizing Keren Hayesod work in twenty-three states west of Illinois was taken up. In these states there are one-half million Jews who are very charitable and can be attracted to the work of the Keren Hayesod. It is very important that the Jews of those states be encouraged to contribute to the Keren Hayesod. It was, therefore, decided to call a Keren Hayesod Convention in Denver, Colorado, on March 1, in order to give the Jews of all the western states an opportunity to participate in it. It was estimated that the convention would be attended by five hundred delegates and would raise a sum of one-half million dollars for the Keren Hayesod. It is also certain that many Senators from the Middle West will attend and will address the <span class="page-break">\2</span>convention. The Chicago Keren Hayesod workers are the ones under whose supervision and leadership the convention will be called and organized.</p>
