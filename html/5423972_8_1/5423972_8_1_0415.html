   <p>A true holiday spirit prevailed among the men and women who came to witness the ceremony of laying the cornerstone for the new synagogue to be erected at 1918 Humboldt Boulevard by the Hungarian Congregation, Bnai Duvid Auhavi Tzaduk.</p>
   <p>This congregation, with Rabbi Elfenbein at its head, not only intends to build a synagogue, but intends also to set up, on the Northwest Side a great community center for all classes of Jews of all ages. There will be a Talmud Torah (school) for children, as well as a social center for young folks and a synagogue. That is why Jews of the Humboldt Park District joyfully witnessed, yesterday noon, the ceremony of laying the cornerstone of this large building.</p>

   <p>Mr. Simon Seltzer presided with enthusiasm. The Marks Nathan Home Band played. Many prominent Chicago speakers addressed the crowd. In an appeal which called for aid, that the congregation might continue its work, many of those present responded generously. Thus a goodly sum was collected.</p>
   <p>For laying the cornerstone, Mrs. Philip Klofter and Mrs. H. Rusnak paid $100. All in all, $4,350 were raised.</p>
   <p>The architect of this building is Mr. David Saul Klofter.</p>
