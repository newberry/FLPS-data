   <p>Of late much has been written in our American press about "foreign nationalism" and its danger to America because some "foreigners" do not become American chauvinists overnight. Having diverse interests, the foreigners refuse to follow the new prophets of the A. P.'ers, who entered this country at an earlier period and gained better vantage points from where to shout America for Americans.</p>
   <p>In the Jewish camps it was Dr. Emil G. Hirsch who struck out this new phrase "foreign nationalism." He no longer thinks that Zionists are conspirators, and consequently he aids many Jewish nationalists in realizing their dream of building a Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Not being a Jew who can exclaim "justice" when shown evidence of his guilt, he compromises. To him Zionism is a beneficence which should be limited to Jews living in Palestine, but in America, every Jew should, as soon as he passes Ellis Island, become a fiery American patriot.</p>
   <p>Everybody, however, is not so elastic as Dr. Hirsch. It is perhaps very easy to compromise in theory. But in practice we see that whatever concerns patriotism, - be it true love for the place where one is born or sincere devotion to the country in which the bodies of one's most beloved people lie buried, or the yearning for a certain country, - is a thing with which we cannot compromise. Facts show us that the genuine patriots of a country are not those upon whom the country bestows honor, or imparts wealth and luxury, <span class="page-break">3</span>but the "foreigners" who are likened to stepchildren, and who are the first to endure affliction and the last to reap benefits.</p>
   <p>Latest cablegrams from London report the following: --"As a protest against the new income tax statute, two Americans have already carried out their threats of becoming English citizens. They are Isaac Zeligman, of the banking firm Zeligman Bros. and Frank A. Bliss, erstwhile Standard Oil magnate and ex-president of the American Society in London."</p>
   <p>Mr. Zeligman was born in America, and can be considered a graduate of Dr. Hirsch's school. No one can accuse him of foreign nationalism. He, a multi-millionaire, shared the very best of everything in America. If in anyone's heart the spark of true Americanism ever ignited, it <span class="page-break">4</span>should have been in Mr. Zeligman's. America had given everything to this man and had taken nothing in return. The feeling of gratitude toward this country should have chained this man to America. Not only should he have always been willing to immolate his money to the country, in which he was born and which made it possible for him to become what he is today, but also sacrifice, if necessary, his life and limb for it.</p>
   <p>But to this American nationalist a price is attached even to patriotism. To him, the love for his fatherland is like his love for stocks and bonds. If he has to pay a high price for it (in the form of income tax), he says that it isn't worth it, and therefore becomes a fiery English patriot overnight. And if, on the next day, he discovers that English patriotism is too costly, we can then expect him to become a <span class="page-break">5</span>Jewish nationalist, which is very cheap, -- the price is only one shekel. [A shekel costs ten cents and entitles one to vote for a Zionist delegate. Tr.]</p>
   <p>His friend Frank A. Bliss, although he is not a Jew and certainly does not carry the microbes of foreign nationalism, shares also the view that nationalism and patriotism have their price. As with Benedict Arnold in time of the American Revolution, the question of love for America is for these men a question of dollars and sterling. Neither Zeligman nor Bliss has fortresses for sale. They sold their citizen rights.</p>
   <p>This is practically the so-called "American nationalism," which means, I love my country because it gives me glory, money and comfort. The Dr. Hirsch's and the American newspaper writers, who have firmly <span class="page-break">6</span>gripped the new phrase "foreign socialism," are great American patriots because they are well paid for their services. If Dr. Hirsch would have accidentally become a rabbi in Germany, instead of the rabbi of Sinai Temple, we would now hear him extolling Kaiser Wilhelm rather than praising the American Constitution. If the editors and writers of Chicago's "World Greatest Newspaper" could procure better jobs with the London Times, they would humbly bow before King George, and assail America at each opportunity.</p>
   <p>It is the foreign nationalist that can be the bona fide patriot. True, he can not, immediately after applying for his first papers, make a rumpus by yelling "hurrah for America." But within him lie the seeds of true love for one's fatherland.</p>
   <p>The Irishman who sacrifices his life for home rule in Ireland; the Pole who agitates for the reconstruction of the Polish Reich; the Jew whose <span class="page-break">7</span>heart throbs upon hearing Palestine mentioned, or who enjoys a conversation in Russian, Rumanian or any language which he heard in his childhood, all these foreign nationalities are the true American patriots on whom America can count when in need of help.</p>
   <p>Patriotism is not a means of gratitude to a country or a people. A Jew likes Palestine even though it has given him nothing. A Russian Jew longs for Russia, where he was persecuted, maimed, and robbed.</p>
   <p>Patriotism and nationalism are not prices of secular and spiritual values. The Italian who was born at the foot of Mt. Vesuvius, where he is daily exposed to the danger of being buried alive, will not exchange his homeland for the greatest fortunes. The inhabitants of the wilderness of Siberia, where there is neither plant-life nor <span class="page-break">8</span>sunshine, would rather freeze to death than share the blessings of the tropical regions.</p>
   <p>The poorer the country is, the more love the citizens have for it, as with faithful children who are devoted to infirm and feeble parents. What do the Zeligmans, the Bliss's, even the Hirsch's and McCormicks know about patriotism? Let them take a lesson in patriotism from the Russian or even Spanish Jews. These Jews earnestly believe that the sun and moon shine quite differently on the mountains of Tavir and Carmel. Carobs is to them the tastiest fruit and, Palestinian citrons the most beautiful. When the Spanish Jew was driven from Spain, he took with him Spanish soil which was drenched with Jewish blood, and for the past four hundred years he has been speaking the very same Spanish language in which he was sentenced during autos de fe to all the tribulations of the Inquisition, and, finally, when the Jew settled in Salonika, he shed his blood and gave his life for the defense of <span class="page-break">9</span>the Turkish Government, whenever the latter was attacked by an enemy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch cannot understand such patriotism. He doesn't know that there exists no foreign and American patriotism. There is, however, a natural patriotism. The foreign nationalities are the natural patriots.</p>
