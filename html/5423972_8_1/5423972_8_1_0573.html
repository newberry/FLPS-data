   <p>We are in the habit of naming our weeks after certain activities. We have a relief week, a Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] Week, a [Jewish] Federation [of Orthodox Charities] Week, and so on. Why shouldn't we also have a Hebrew Week, during which we would propagandize in favor of Hebrew? We would explain to the public the importance of Hebrew for the continuation of our people.</p>
   <p>The lovers of Hebrew culture in New York have chosen this week as a week to be devoted to Hebrew. Every Jew who understands Hebrew, who understands the importance of Hebrew to our national future, should [sometime] during this week visit a Hebrew meeting, think about the Hebrew literature, and resolve to support Hebrew education and all constructive Hebrew undertakings, from founding Hebrew schools to supporting Hebrew newspapers and supporting, materially and <span class="page-break">2</span>morally, all the lovers of Hebrew culture.</p>
   <p>There are thousands of Jews in Chicago who understand Hebrew and hundreds of Jews who love Hebrew. If each one of them will do his duty, we will be able to have a fine Hebrew press in America, fine Hebrew publishing concerns, and a rich Hebrew life.</p>
   <p>There will be a great Hebrew mass meeting tonight at the Anshe Sholom Center. The purpose of this meeting is not only to give the Hebraists of Chicago an opportunity to attend a Hebrew meeting and hear Hebrew spoken, but also to consider what we in Chicago can and must do now to strengthen the Hebrew movement in America. Something is being done in every city in America, and something should be done here. The Hebrew-loving Jews of Chicago have only to desire it.</p>
   <p>I hope to meet all my Hebrew friends tonight. Maybe we will be able to accomplish <span class="page-break">3</span>something in Chicago. Maybe we will be able to awaken our sleeping Hebraists and persuade them to do some constructive work.</p>
   <p>Remember! Tonight at the Anshe Sholom Center!</p>
