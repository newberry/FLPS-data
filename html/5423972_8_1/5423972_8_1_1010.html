   <p>Alexander B. Seelenfreund, world leader of the Independent Order of the B'nai B'rith, of which for many years he has been secretary of the International Constitution Grand Lodge, died suddenly Monday morning at 7:30 A.M. in Memphis, Tennessee, while attending a Golden Jubilee meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Order.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seelenfreund has been in the public eye of late as secretary of the Grand Jury investigating the School Board and the City Hall scandals. As a leader of this body he worked untiringly and his friends attribute his unexpected and sudden death to the strain resulting from overwork and which the extraordinary duties of the Grand Jury imposed upon him.</p>

   <p>In commenting upon the passing of Mr. Seelenfreund, Judge Michael L. McKinley, Chief Justice of the Criminal Court, gave out the following statement:</p>
   <p>"No member of any Grand Jury within my recollection was more devoted and conscientious in his public service. No grand juror was ever so courageous and so unceasing in public interest. Never personally complaining, Mr. Seelenfreund expressed considerable solicitude just a day or two before his death, calling my attention to the fact that other members of the Grand Jury were suffering under the nervous strain of overwork of evening sessions shouldered upon them".</p>
   <p>Mr. Seelenfreund was born in Austria in 1868, emigrated to America in 1883, and was a resident of Chicago since 1891. He married Miss Ethel Hollander in 1893. He was elected Secretary of District Grand Lodge No. 6, and Secretary of the International Grand Lodge of the Order.</p>
   <p>The consuming passion of Mr. Seelenfreund's life was his devotion to Ramah Lodge <span class="page-break">3</span>No. 33, Independent Order B'nai B'rith, his mother lodge, of which for over twenty-five years he was secretary.</p>
   <p>Two years ago Mr. Seelenfreund made a tour of Europe that attracted worldwide attention; while on behalf of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith, he pledged one million dollars for the adoption of war orphans and urged upon the American public a drive that resulted in millions more being contributed to this cause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seelenfreund was a member of Isaiah Temple, of which Dr. Joseph Stolz is the Rabbi. For years he has served this synagogue as its Secretary.</p>
   <p>He was one of the founders of the Covenant Club and a member of its Board of Directors and the first President of the B'nai B'rith Council of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Interested also in other fraternal orders, Mr. Seelenfreund was a member of <span class="page-break">4</span>the Emblem Lodge No. 894, A.F. and A.M., and a member of the Shrine.</p>
   <p>A special escort of honor, headed by Adolph Kraus, International President of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith, accompanied the body to Chicago, arriving at the Illinois Central Depot.</p>
   <p>"The Jewish people of America and the world have lost in the passing of Alexander B. Seelenfreund an indefatigable laborer in humanity's cause, one whose place can never be filled," said Mr. Kraus, International President of the Order, in a wire appraising the Chicago office of the Order of the passing of Mr. Seelenfreund.</p>
   <p>A special cortege of co-workers awaited the arrival of the body at the depot and accompanied the remains to Sinai Temple, 46th and Grand Boulevard, where the funeral will be held at 10:30 this morning. A.M. Krensky, President of Romah Lodge, of which Mr. Seelenfreund was for so long the Secretary, and Gustavus Loevinger, President of District Grand Lodge No. 6, head the honorary <span class="page-break">5</span>escort of the Chicago members of the Order, which took the body from the train on its arrival today.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seelenfreund is survived by his widow, Mrs. Ethel Hollander Seelenfreund; his daughter, Mrs. Hugo Friedstein, and his son, Louis M. Seelenfreund.</p>
