   <p>The last executive meeting of the American Zionist organization was unique in its kind, and it is not exaggerated to say that it was the first great executive meeting in years. The main business of the first meeting of the newly elected executive was to appoint secretaries, and since the secretaries of the organization are running the whole show, or at least the best part of it, it is not immaterial to the Zionists in America and their duly elected representatives whether or not the old secretaries will be reappointed or whether new ones will be elected.</p>
   <p>The two chief secretaries of the organization, Mr. Jacob De Haas and Mr. Louis Lipsky both men of extraordinary ability, but of different temperament and disposition of mind, have rendered yeomen services to the cause during their long tenure of office, but they have made a great many enemies too. By various commissions and omissions they have aroused the enmity and the ire of a certain <span class="page-break">\2</span>group of New York Zionist workers who fortunately, or unfortunately, are the middlemen between the organization and the press. The opposition to the above-named gentlemen is not of recent date, but is rather ancient history. However, in days gone by, the opposition was powerless to speak its mind and to express its sentiments. The secretaries were elected by the convention and the executive could say nothing when displeased with their actions. But now since the secretaries and the entire staff is appointed by the executive and not by the convention, the opposition has been given a chance to express its sentiments and to formulate its own plans. And if we are not mistaken, it is for the first time in the history of American Zionism that the discontented element had an opportunity to "get even" with the leaders.</p>
   <p>When the question of appointing the chief secretaries was taken up by the last meeting of the executive, the leaders of the opposition were given the floor and they made good use of this opportunity. In long-drawn speeches they enumerated all the shortcomings, all the mistakes, all the "bad qualities", and all the <span class="page-break">\3</span>failures of those who have been running the Zionist show for years. The severe criticism they levelled at Mr. Jacob De Haas was actually refreshing, even if one does not agree with all that the opposition leaders had to say about him. The silent "leader" of the movement in America, who looks upon Mr. De Haas as upon his Zionist teacher, because it was Mr. De Haas who won Justice Brandeis for the Zionist cause, was present at the meeting, and listened patiently to all that the embittered opposition had to say about his intimate friend. Justice Brandeis did not indicate, even with a facial expression, what he thought of the people making this criticism, but listened patiently to the long-drawn speeches as he would listen to a lawyer's plea in the Supreme Court. Of course, after the opposition had used up all its ammunition, the friends of Mr. De Haas, men like Judge Julian W. Mack, Felix Frankfurter, and others, came out in strong defence for the Zionist dignitary,and got even with his enemies, but the entire affair was refreshing, because of its frankness and sincerity. It was a heart-to-heart talk between the Zionist leaders. It was a real purgatory. Now the air is clear. The opposition of course, will remain opposition, and Mr. De Haas will not be its favorite in the future either, but it will always have a chance to <span class="page-break">\4</span>come out in the open and to make the Zionist leaders listen to it. To our mind, this will have a rather healthy effect on the organization.</p>
   <p>The main hue and cry of the opposition was that until now the "silent leader" would not listen to it, and that Mr. De Haas, being responsible to the convention only, does not give a rap for what the opposition thinks of his actions. There was a great deal of truth to this criticism and these charges. Now, however, everything has undergone a radical change. Mr. De Haas and Mr. Lipsky, being responsible to the executive and not to the convention, can be called to accountability whenever the opposition deems it advisable to call them to account--and they will surely do it as often as possible. And the charges raised by them that the American Zionism is run by men irresponsible to the masses and irresponsible to their representatives, will not be heard again. Now we have a responsible Zionist organization in America, and a responsible business administration. As to the specific charges made against Mr. De Haas by leaders of the opposition, we wish to state that while many of them are justified, most of them--and we would <span class="page-break">\5</span>say the majority of the charges--has no basis in reality. Mr. De Haas has made many mistakes and is responsible for many false steps made by the Zionist organization, but to maintain, as the opposition does, that he is a man without personality and without intelligence or without ability, is too childish for words, and only an expression of the power of impotency.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Haas, for whom we hold no brief, is no doubt a man of vast intelligence, a man of great ability. He is often too hasty in his judgment, and often acts on the spur of the moment, but he has a sharp and good mind, and what is most important, a cultivated mind too. He is a highly educated man, a man of vast experience in life, and is in addition a man of executive ability. After all, it was Mr. De Haas who brought some order out of the chaos prevailing for years in American Zionism, and if there is today any sort of Zionist administration in America it is Mr. De Haas' work. Of course, this administrative machinery is by no means perfect and can be much improved upon, but after all it is a good nucleus to start with. Mr. Jacob De Haas is well acquainted with European Jewish conditions everywhere, and has a good judgment not only on American Zionist affairs, but on <span class="page-break">\6</span>general Jewish affairs, and if assisted by an able and industrious chairman of the organization and by other able men, he will certainly render great services to the organization. We understand that the chairman of the organization, Judge Julian Mack, is quite determined to be active and to be the actual head of the organization and not only the nominal leader.</p>
   <p>Judge Julian W. Mack is a man of superior intelligence, and of a judicial and calm mind, and a very conscientious worker, and he will certainly control the work of Mr. De Haas. Judge Mack is the type of a man who can not be ordered to do things, and if he should not agree with Justice Louis D. Brandeis on certain Zionist subjects, he will certainly not be ashamed of telling him so. The American Zionist organization was leaderless up until now. It is not so now. We may venerate and admire Justice Louis D. Brandeis as the silent chief of the movement in America, but Judge Julian W. Mack is the responsible leader and being a responsible man, he will see to it that the Zionist affairs are conducted in an orderly, dignified manner. If Mr. De Haas is likely to make mistakes when left alone, he will not make them now, for he will be controlled by both the chairman of the organization and the executive committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>While we would not like to see Mr. Jacob De Haas acting autocratically and arbitrarily because he is often too hasty in his judgment, we consider him the best man for the job, if guided and assisted by the executive and the chairman of the organization.</p>
   <p>What holds good of Mr. Jacob De Haas also holds true of Mr. Louis Lipsky. Like Mr. De Haas, Mr. Lipsky also is a man of great qualities of mind. He is a man of culture, and highly developed intelligence, and is, in addition, a literator in the best meaning of the term. He probably knows more about American Zionism than any of his colleagues, because he actually grew up with the movement and made many sacrifices for it. If he has the co-operation of an intelligent executive and of a conscientious and industrious chairman, he will certainly make an ideal chief secretary, because he is a man of administrative ability, and as a whole, a man who knows his business. Like Mr. De Haas he is a man of rare qualities, but also like Mr. De Haas he cannot be the main chief of the organization and cannot be its sole guide. He certainly is a useful adviser because of his vast Zionist experience, but he is not strong enough to take Justice Brandeis or Judge Mack's place.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Both Mr. Lipsky and Mr. De Haas are known by this time that they cannot only run the organization on their own lines, but while they can advise the executive what to do and what not to do, they have to adapt themselves to the new conditions. The conditions are a new, active executive, a responsible executive, a new and active chairman and a responsible chairman of the organization. If they will let both factors be their guide, as we hope they will, then they will certainly prove to be the best men in their places, and they will greatly contribute to the rejuvenation of Zionism in America.</p>
