   <p>At last light has begun to dawn on the North Side of Chicago. Zionism moves in tomorrow. A Zionist district will be organized tomorrow on the North Side.</p>
   <p>As there are still a few Jews on the North Side who have not heard the glad tidings, I hereby inform them that tomorrow, at eight o'clock in the evening, the first session of the North Side Zionist district will take place in the vestry rooms of the Congregation B'nai Zion. All the old Zionists will be there and the new ones will be cordially welcomed.</p>
