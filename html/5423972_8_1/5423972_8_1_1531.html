   <p>The speculation in Yomin Noroim (high holidays) piety is at high par. Would be pious men who have not the will to work in unison with any religious organization, who have not the ability to act as leaders, nor the necessary social qualifications to comply with the rules and regulations of an established Congregation, put themselves forward as organizers by this time of the year (High Holidays). They rent halls, make minyanim for the ensuing feasts, and find fools enough to follow them - noncomformists like themselves.</p>
   <p>One is ambitious to play the president; another one is satisfied with an office of minor importance. Thus a clique is formed, a hall rented, religious devotion made a trade of to the detriment of the established congregations on whom the whole burden of our religious affairs lies the whole year 'round, and on whom the blame falls for everything that is wrong.</p>
