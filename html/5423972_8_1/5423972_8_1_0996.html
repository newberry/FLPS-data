   <p>The work of the Zionist organization in Albany Park is going full steam ahead. Albany Park has ceased to be a village since the Zionists there began to work seriously. Congregation Beth Itzchok of Albany Park, of which Dr. Milner is the rabbi, is the center of many Jewish and Zionist activities. The synagogue is always crowded whenever a meeting is called. The Zionist workers of Albany Park, Mr. Kriloff, Dr. Agronat, Dr. Milner, Mr. Sweet, and the young Antonow have created a district which is very active. The Zionist district of Albany Park intends to establish Hebrew classes for adults. The Jews of Albany Park who want to attend the Hebrew classes can register with the secretary or chairman of the district, or with Dr. Milner. The classes will be opened soon, and will offer excellent <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>instruction. When will the other Zionist districts do the same?</p>
