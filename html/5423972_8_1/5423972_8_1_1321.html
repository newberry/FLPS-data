   <p>At a meeting held in the library of Molner Hall, an organization was formed by a small number of Jews on the Northwest Side, to be known as the Young Men's Hebrew Association. Its purposes are the social-uplift of the Jews of the neighborhood, and the building of a Center where all activities, social, educational, and charitable, may be concentrated.</p>
   <p>Mainly, it is intended to give the younger generation a place where they can meet in healthy, moral surroundings, and in a Jewish atmosphere.</p>
   <p>About $500 was subscribed immediately, and a committee appointed to raise the additional necessary funds.</p>
   <p>The officers of Y.M.H.A. are: A.S. Ree, President; S. Seltzer, Vice-President; S. Arkin, Treasurer; S. Keenigsberg and Dr. Sahud, Secretaries.</p>
