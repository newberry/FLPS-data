   <p>The West Side of Chicago where almost all Russo-Polish Jews are settled, presents often a curious spectacle. One who does not know where he is, might forget that he is in Chicago. When walking through the streets of that settlement, the numerous signs in Hebrew characters make one believe that it is a city in Russia; but when one hears the use of the mixed jargon with English, one does not know where he is. It would be much better to appoint some missionary for that purpose to settle within these quarters and civilize those people by some methods whereby they may make this to be a city within the United States of America, and not make of it a Wilna or Kovno.</p>
   <p>This is a branch of work that the young man ought to take up. For that purpose the Jewish young man ought to organize, not to call those poor wretches "dirty Polacks," but teach them by example cleanliness, and better habits than they have been accustomed to.</p>
