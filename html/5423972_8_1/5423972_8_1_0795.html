   <p>Once in four years, every citizen of the United States is expected to take an interest in the government of his country, the country which offers an opportunity to all citizens to enjoy the fruits and reap the harvest of all that is produced. Every citizen must come to cast his vote today, and elect into office persons who can be relied upon to do their utmost for the interests of the nation.</p>
   <p>Then who of us will be a traitor and neglect his sacred duty? We as immigrants, as Jews of the United States, which is the only country where we can live and enjoy freedom, where we enjoy equal rights, - we must be the first ones to pay our debts to the country and the American people.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, at six o'clock in the morning, it should be our duty to go to our respective precincts and vote for the best candidates as our conscience dictates us. And when we give up our vote, we must remember the <span class="page-break">2</span>two things, which form the foundation upon which a free, successful government is built. First, remember your own good and second the good and welfare of your country. Remember that if you do not vote for the right candidates, it will mean a blow not only to the country, but to yourself and your children who are becoming Americanized.</p>
   <p>Political parties are composed of individuals who have the same interests. You are a Democrat because you are convinced that a government with democratic principles will serve your interests best. You are a Republican because you believe that this party is best for you. You will, however, forsake your party should you discover that this party is injurious to the country.</p>
   <p>In the present campaign for governorship, it is not a Democratic or Republican issue alone, it is a question for the great and progressive State of Illinois, of whether or not it will elect a young, good, honest and fitting governor. It is a question of whether or not we should have the best reforms which were begun by Governor Deneen during the four years of his administration, or should we permit everything to become null and void, as <span class="page-break">3</span>it will surely be done should General Stevenson be elected. Your children who are becoming Americanized might like to get into politics. They will, however, not have a chance with the wrong people in office. It is now a question of whether or not the sick and unfortunate in the state institutions shall be healed and aided under the able leadership of Dr. Frank Billings and Dr. Hirsch, or should they be handed over into political hands, who will permit them to suffer and rot. It is a question of whether railroad fare should be two cents per mile, as it was proposed by Governor Deneen, or the payment of three cents per mile, as during the period when politicians were in power. Briefly, it is a question of whether or not you will have any rights, of whether your children should enjoy all that the State of Illinois has to offer its citizens, or should the politicians be allowed to dig in with their paws, should they have the power to become parasites.</p>
   <p>If you want your capable son to be able to accept a political job, either by appointment or nomination, then vote for Charles S. Deneen, regardless of whether you are a Democrat or Republican. Should you be in for having <span class="page-break">4</span>your talented child bow to every political nincompoop, and every leader who controls politics; then vote for old Stevenson.</p>
   <p>We are Chicagoans, the City of Chicago is dear to us. Governor Deneen is also a Chicagoan. He has lived in Chicago all his life. When he became governor, his first job was to improve the parks. He has made the parks of Chicago the most wonderful and best known everywhere. Should the senile Mr. Stevenson be elected, we might as well say good-bye to all progress. Vote today for our Chicagoan, Charles S. Deneen.</p>
