   <p>The Illinois Russian Colonization Society has been incorporated at Springfield, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Among the incorporators are Senator John M. Palmer, Rabbi Rubenstein, Chas. E. Hay and Albert Salzenstein. The intention is to purchase land in Illinois or Missouri and establish colonies of refugees.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Rubenstein stated "We should get nothing but reasonably good land. Experience has shown that colonies of this kind cannot be successfully established on the cheapest land. A society in Cincinnati spent $65,000 in the establishment of a colony in Kansas. That was several years ago, and the grasshoppers and drouth took the crops of the colonists, and what they did raise, they could not get a profitable market for. That colony was a failure, simply because cheap lands were utilized. Colonies established on good land have succeeded."</p>

   <p>It is probable that the first colony will be established in Southern Illinois near the Ohio River. There the richest land can be bought for $20.00 an acre. A proposition from a landowner in that section is already in the hands of the society. A good market is within easy reach, and it is thought a colony established there would be a success.</p>
