   <p>Julius Rosenwald and Moses E. Greenebaum last December called a meeting of the young men of the various congregations. A committee was appointed to investigate the advisability and possibility of forming an active organization. This committee held several meetings and finally reported its plan.</p>
   <p>Irrespective of affiliation with any congregation, an association, to be known as the Sinai Social Center Association, is to be formed with headquarters at Sinai Social Center. This organization will be managed entirely by the young men and women interested in its activity.</p>
