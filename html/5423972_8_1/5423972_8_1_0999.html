   <p>The Zionist drive for ten thousand new members has been going on for six weeks. I have the facts and figures as to what has been accomplished. Chicago has already enrolled five thousand of the ten thousand new members it is seeking. The drive, however, has just begun because the synagogues are only now organizing their districts. When they have completed their work, Chicago will have ten thousand Zionist members in good standing. The Zionist organization will become the strongest Jewish organization in the city, stronger than the [Chicago Jewish] Charities, which has eight thousand members, stronger than the B'nai Brith, which has six thousand members in Chicago, and stronger than all the synagogues put together.</p>
