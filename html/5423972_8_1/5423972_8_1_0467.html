   <p>Local 195 Retail Clerks Union, at a well-attended meeting Monday evening, unanimously determined to rejoin the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>The organization committee of Local 195 and President Cooper recommended that the Union re-enter the central body of the Jewish Trades, because they want to be connected with the Jewish labor movement and with the activities, which are concentrated in the Jewish districts, where most of their members are working.</p>
   <p>Their recommendation was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>S.D. Cooper, president, and William Dash, a member of the executive board, Local 195, were the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
