   <p>A bill now pending before Congress to create a national radio commission, a sort of censorship, is being strenuously opposed by Alderman Jacob Avery, chairman of the radio commission appointed by Mayor Dever.</p>
   <p>This proposed bill will vest in Congress the power to control and regulate radio transmission and broadcasting throughout the country. The Judiciary Committee contemplated a thorough story of the subject and have public hearings on the so-called White bill.</p>
   <p>The Council's action is the result of a resolution introduced yesterday by Alderman Avery (24th Ward), chairman of the mayor's radio commission. The resolution, which was referred to the Judiciary Committee, provided for the submission of a memorial to Congress urging defeat of the White bill and enactment of laws creating a national radio commission similar to those governing the interstate commerce commission.</p>
