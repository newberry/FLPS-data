   <p>Chicago Delegates Declare Their Position at the Peoples Relief Convention (in Philadelphia).</p>
   <p>The Chicago delegation could not accept the demands submitted to the convention, even if it were to cause a split with the Joint Board, because the instructions which they were given stood for more independent work. Inclined to observe the instructions, the delegation declared at the convention, the following:</p>
   <p>Declaration of the Chicago Delegation.</p>
   <p>"Comrade chairman, and comrades - 1. "We recognize the resolution by the majority, together with the addition of Comrade Maden, that clarifies it, as a gain in the direction which Chicago desires, that the relief work should be adopted.</p>
   
   <p>2. "Though, we find that the resolution is limited, we cannot vote against the resolution; neither can we vote for it if it is proposed as a substitute to the plan that Chicago proposes." 3. "We declare, then, that in the matter concerning the resolution, we refrain from voting (with the exception of Maden's supplementation, for which we will vote) and we declare that our eight votes are filed for more and thorough independence of the Peoples Relief on European matters."</p>
