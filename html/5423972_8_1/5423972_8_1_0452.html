   <p>It is indeed regrettable that, despite the herculean labors of the venerable President Emeritus of Harvard University on behalf of American higher education and innumerable civic causes, radicals should know next to nothing about him, and never mention the name of Charles W. Eliot without sneering at him for having once spoken disparagingly of the organized labor movement. On the contrary, his statement that "the scab is the national hero of America" is the only blot on his escutcheon. Everything else that he has said and done during many decades has been characterized by liberality of mind and heart. American college curriculums owe more to Eliot than to any other single individual. It was he who liberalized and humanized Harvard. He has rarely failed to speak up in defense of everything that forms the creed of a liberal.</p>
   <p>Eliot is perhaps the last of the Brahmins. He typifies the best of the New <span class="page-break">\2</span>England tradition. The scion of an old Yankee family, Eliot has given small comfort to "one-hundred-per-cents". He sees America not as the paradise of the Nordics but as the land of the oppressed of every clime. His sympathies have always been with the stranger knocking at our gates. Eliot is no "restrictionist," no Ku Kluxer, and no believer in the Anglo-Saxon myth of superiority; and he always has shown a peculiar understanding of the Jewish problem.</p>
   <p>Recently Dr. Eliot took occasion to address a group of Jewish students at Harvard. What he said was so sensible and penetrating, so kind and shrewd, that we need not take alarm because Rabbi Samuel Schulman and several Irish politicians of Boston have taken issue with Dr. Eliot. With admirable frankness and forthrightness Eliot told his listeners:</p>
   <p>"I have noticed with regret the increasing tendency of Jews to marry Christians. I have had an opportunity to observe intermarriages between people who are not kindred and I have never known them to turn out well. I hope that you Jews will consider that."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>No truer words have ever been uttered on the subject of intermarriage. Coming from a man ripe in years and in wisdom, a gentleman and a scholar in the best sense of the term, this advice should be pondered upon and taken to heart by everyone who feels concerned over the future of the Jews in America. Dr. Eliot spoke as a friend of the Jewish race who frankly admits and admires the contribution which the Hebrews, ancient and modern, have made to the world. He does not blink at the truth. He recognizes that intermarriage is but another and less ugly name for apostasy; for intermarriage, if generally practiced, would result the total disappearance of the Jewish race. Dr. Eliot raises his voice in warning. Rabbi Schulman, the spiritual guide of the fashionable members of Congregation Beth-El, hastened to assure his wealthy listeners that the advice of Dr. Eliot need not be heeded.</p>
   <p>In considering the problem of intermarriage, there are, I suppose, three questions that should be answered: First, does intermarriage make for the happiness of the young people? Second, will the offspring be happy? And third, what will be the <span class="page-break">\4</span>effect on the Jewish race? I do not want to lay down the law. It is fatuous to say that in every case intermarriage turns out badly. There is no scientific data on the subject. I doubt if there could be. Even the records of the divorce courts would not be conclusive proof. Not every marriage that lands on the rocks winds up in the divorce court. Marital happiness or unhappiness is too subtle and subjective and is hardly a subject for the statistician. Rather it is material for the pyschologist. It would be futile to deny that some mixed marriages are anything but successful. But I think that it is safe to say that in the case of a mixed marriage, all things considered, there is greater likelihood of a calamitous climax. The odds are against it, so to speak. The differences in habit and upbringing, the distinct racial backgrounds, the ties of family and religion, the manners and mannerisms, and the hundred other things that come up every day and every week bring ugly shocks--and still uglier words.</p>
   <p>Judaism is in our blood. Even the least religious among us is Jewish to the core. Even so, ninety-nine out of every hundred Gentiles are filled with peculiar <span class="page-break">\5</span>prejudices and mistaken notions concerning Jews. Likes and dislikes and habits of thought and action that are the accumulation of countless centuries cannot be sloughed off. Marriages, as every one knows, are made or marred by little things--by trifles. Seemingly insignificant habits of speech or food have a way of becoming tremendously important later on.</p>
   <p>Moreover, one must never forget the parents and relatives of the young couple. Is the Jewish young man who marries a Christian girl prepared to break definitely and permanently with his Orthodox parents and relatives? Does he expect his Gentile in-laws to receive his bearded father or his foreign-sounding aunt on terms of equality? Can he expect his wife's aunts and uncles, not to speak of the neighbors and friends, to show him the cordiality for which he hungers? Can he promise himself never to bristle when his wife or her relatives speak contemptuously or patronizingly of any member of his race? In trying to run away from his Jewish surroundings he will discover himself to be more Jewish than he had ever suspected. He will be more race conscious--more "touchy" than ever. He will imagine insults and gibes where none were intended. This is likely to happen in <span class="page-break">\6</span>many cases.</p>
   <p>Now we come to the children. How are they to be brought up? Will it be a Sunday school or a Sabbath school? Will the male child be circumcized or not? Will it be Christmas and Easter or Hanukah and Purim? In case the child dies will the father allow its body to be buried in a Christian cemetery, or will he insist upon a Jewish burial? If you think these questions are far fetched you are mistaken. If space permitted I could tell you many true stories that would make you sad. I do not say that the offspring of a mixed marriage is less virile or less brilliant than other children; but when the offspring is not one-hundred-per-cent Christian he will suffer mental and spiritual anguish. The child is torn between two worlds--between two allegiances. In many instances the child despises one of its parents when it becomes older--usually the Jewish parent. The child usually wishes to become a Christian completely but his Jewish physiognomy stands in the way. I venture to say that even a free-thinking Jew would be greatly hurt to discover that his child worships in a Christian church. A Bar Mizvah [ceremony of confirmation when a Jewish boy is thirteen years old] may prove <span class="page-break">\7</span>unpalatable to some radical Jews, but they would find a Christian confirmation infinitely less desirable. And it may be questioned whether all of these things would tend to increase the happiness of the mixed marriage.</p>
   <p>It remains to be pointed out that intermarriage inevitably leads to the disintergration of the minority group. Of course those that are indifferent to the fate of the Jewish race need not trouble themselves with what Dr. Eliot has said. Judaism is a very real burden and I do not quarrel with the weak and timid souls that yearn to snuggle in the arms of the church. Let them go their way. But let it be understood that intermarriage is the less heroic method of abandoning the Jewish nation for the flesh pots of Egypt. There have been Jewish apostates in every age, and no tears have been shed over them. I believe that apostasy in any form is furthest from the thought or wish of American Jewry. If American Jewry is to continue to live and have its own existence intermarriage must be frowned upon. To condone mixed marriages, as Reverend Schulman has seen fit to do, is to invite disaster for the Jewish race. Dr. Eliot deserves the commendation of every right-thinking Jew for his brave and necessary counsel.</p>
