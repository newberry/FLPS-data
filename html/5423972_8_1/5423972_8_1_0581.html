   <p>The editor of the Forward, often receives letters complaining of the activities of the missionaries among Chicago Jewry. Orthodox and radical Jews resent the fact that these missionaries spread a net to lure the innocent, naive people into their centers and wean them away from Judaism. The Orthodox Jews say that their neighborhoods are surrounded by hired, Jewish "preachers" who preach about a "Messiah" that came two thousand years ago and brought "salvation and peace". The radicals claim that the missionaries are poisoning the minds of many Jews with their sermons and are spreading darkness--especially at a time when light, education, and progress are necessary.</p>
   <p>With great effort on my part I visited the mission homes in our city and I came to the conclusion that the missionaries are a menace to Judaism and to free progressive ideas. I had many arguments prepared for them regarding their <span class="page-break">\2</span>declaration that Christianity is the true religion and that Judaism is "old". I was prepared to argue with them that Judaism is a religion that is close to the nature of men; that it does proclaim love for the supernatural; and that in the Old Testament there is no command that a person should hate and persecute people of other creeds and those who are one's political opponents. Moreover, I was ready to point out that Christianity adores the dead body. This idea originated among the ancient nations who believed that their dead parents become saints. Judaism, on the other hand, is a simple, natural historical phenomenon. Christianity humiliated the human being by inventing a fantasy that a person is born of God; whereas Judaism designated every hero as a "son of man". When Judaism appeared on the world scene human sacrifices were abolished. And Abraham heard a voice telling him to offer a lamb instead of his son. Christianity, on the other hand, several thousand years later declared: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in Him should have everlasting life".</p>
   <p>Equipped with such arguments I came to the first mission house during the hour <span class="page-break">\3</span>of worship. First I looked around to see if I was noticed by any of my friends. If they would see me they would think that I go to the missionaries because I have no better place to go to. Seeing no one I ran in quickly. What I saw and heard I shall attempt to describe so that the people may have an idea about the great danger lurking among Jewry which menaces the existence of Orthodox Judaism in particular, and of free, progressive thought in general.</p>
   <p>The missionary was talking to a middle-aged Jew, who was very attentive to him. An elderly lady greeted me with the following words: "Peace be with you". She gave me a chair and presented me with a New Testament in the Yiddish language and then tried to discover the impression the New Testament made upon me. The audience in the mission consisted of that middle-aged Jew, a few elderly Gentile ladies, and myself. The missionary started to speak in a loud voice. He declared that Christianity began with the birth of Jesus. He then remarked: "With the help of God we shall see what the Scriptures have to say about the birth of Jesus of Nazareth." Isaiah said: Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. Properly interpreted this means that Jesus must have been born <span class="page-break">\4</span>of a virgin; His mother must have been a virgin at the time He was born."</p>
   <p>"Excuse me," said the middle-aged Jew, "I would like to tell you something. You know I am a friend of yours, and I have been coming to the mission for the past ten years. My wife and I are very thankful for your kindness, and especially for the good news you have brought us in time of need." I looked at the Jew, and saw that he had fallen into the net which the missionary had spread out for him. I wanted to start my argument and to show the Jew that evangelism is far from good Jews for humanity but the Jew continued to speak to the missionary and I did not have a chance to say a word. The Jew told the following story to the missionary. "My wife is in bed," he said. "A new baby boy was born to us. You know that he must be circumcised. I know that you are an expert circumciser. Would you please be so kind and come tomorrow and circumcise my baby?"</p>
   <p>From there I went to another mission. The prayer meeting was going on and there was not a single Jew except the missionary, who was standing at a small altar, and myself. There were also about fifteen elderly and middle-aged women. The <span class="page-break">\5</span>missionary was very happy to see me. I could see that on his face. I sat down, closing my eyes as though I were praying. As a matter of fact I was thinking about an old atheist who did not believe in prayer. I opened my eyes and saw, a woman standing near me with eyes closed, probably praying. I thought: "Maybe her thoughts are also sinful, as mine are. Who knows?" The playing of the organ was too loud for my ears to stand and I became nervous. I wanted to leave the mission but I couldn't. The women surrounded me and began to talk very nicely to me and to give me all kinds of gifts. One lady gave me a prayer book; another showed me the prayer; a third pointed out the page with her finger; and a fourth smiled at me. Then they started to sing hymns--one after another. I wanted to leave the mission and go out. The words of the Psalmist came to me: "From whence shall come my help," and helped me get out of that atmosphere. But I could not leave the place on account of the good ladies who sincerely believed that the world would not be happy until the Jews were converted to Christianity. All the time I wished that another Jew would come and take my place. Then it would be easy for me to leave. But to my astonishment nobody came in. And I could not leave.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>After they stopped singing the missionary started his sermon--in a broken Yiddish. He quoted verses from the Old Testament and compared them with the New Testament proving that Jesus of Nazareth was the True Son of the Living God and not an impostor, and said that all Jewry should believe in the Word of God and study the true history of Christ and accept Him as their own Redeemer and Savior.</p>
   <p>I could not stand it any longer. I reminded myself of the words of the great prophet Isaiah: "To make the blind to see, to free the prisoners from bondage". I quickly opened the door and went out into the street leaving the missionary in the midst of his sermon. While walking out of the mission I considered the type of arguments it is necessary to use against the missionaries in order to weaken the danger. Should the argument be theological or practical? What have mine eyes seen?</p>
