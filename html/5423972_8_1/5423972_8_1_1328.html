   <p>Chicago welcomes leader of Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Navalo, leader of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society of New York, is now in Chicago on his way to San Francisco. Thousands of immigrants have this Society to thank for being allowed to land in this country when they were held up because of minor irregularities, or because they were unable to locate members of their families or because of immediate financial embarrassment. It was to aid these people that the Immigrant Aid Society was formed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Navolo has conferred with Judge Julian Mack and will speak with other prominent and influential Jews of this city with the idea of creating a United Hebrew Charities Association whose budget will include a yearly sum for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. This is a very advanced thought and should be carried out.</p>
