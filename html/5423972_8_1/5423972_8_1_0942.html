   <p>In 1916, Mr. A.B.Seelenfreund, secretary of the B'nai B'rith, called a general meeting of the members of the B'nai B'rith Lodges of Chicago, for the purpose of organizing a downtown club.</p>
   <p>The first meeting was held in a lodge hall in the Capitol Building. Each member present was asked to pay $25.00 as the initiation fee, and $25.00 dues per year. At that time there were not more than 60 members. At the present time the initiation fee for resident members is $275 and a By-Law is about to be adopted increasing it to $550.</p>
   <p>The first club rooms of the Covenant Club were the two top floors of a building known as No. 10-14 North Dearborn Street. The original committee in charge of the organization of the club included Alfred Decker, Dr. Julius H. Meyer, Judge Philip Stein, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Adolph Kraus, Jacob Schnadig, Gustav Freund, Benjamin Samuels, A.S.Roe, Milton Hart, Theodore Geissmann and Henry Blum.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that only members of the I.O.B.B. were eligible for membership. In 1920, the by-laws were changed so that the club has no longer any connection with the B'nai B'rith and it is not necessary to be a member of the Order to become a member of the club.</p>
   <p>The first officers of the club were;- Morton A. Mergentheim, President; Henry Blum, 1st Vice-President; Theodore Geissmann, 2nd Vice-President; Mark D. Goodman, Secretary; and Maurice Taussig, Treasurer. The club has 600 members at the present time.</p>
