   <p>Rabbi Magnes of Hamburg, field secretary of the Mizrachi Organization, is now in Chicago. Rabbi Magnes is a fine Jew, a good speaker, who wants to conquer Chicago for the Mizrachi [the Orthodox group of the Zionist movement]. He cannot be blamed for his intention, but the Mizrachi in Chicago is not a living organization. I have been asking for the last five years what the Mizrachi in Chicago is doing and why it is not doing anything at all, but nobody could answer my question. The Zionists in Chicago expected the Mizrachi to organize the synagogues for Zionism, but the Mizrachi did not do it, and because the Mizrachi did not do it, the Zionists themselves have done it and now nearly all synagogues are organized for Zionism. The Mizrachi leaders of New York know this, and it was, therefore, wrong of them to send Rabbi Magnes here to begin Mizrachi work in Chicago. The synagogue Jew who is already a member of the Zionist Organization will not pay again dues to the Mizrachi. We cannot justly expect him to do so. The Jew who is not a member of the Zionist Organization, who is not a Zionist, cannot, of course, be expected to pay dues to the Mizrachi. I therefore cannot see what Rabbi Magnes, who personally is a fine and capable Jew, can now accomplish in Chicago.</p>
   <p>There is now going on in Chicago a membership drive for the Jewish Theological College. The synagogue Jews who have only recently paid their Zionist dues are being requested now to pay their membership dues in the Jewish Theological College. A Mizrachi membership drive, under these conditions, is simply wasted labor. The Mizrachi leaders of New York should have sent Rabbi Magnes to Chicago when the synagogues were not as yet organized for Zionism. Now it is too late. The leader of the Mizrachi in Chicago, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, helped me, himself, to enroll members for the Zionist Organization in his synagogue. The same Rabbi Epstein cannot now very well come to the same people and ask them to pay dues to the Mizrachi.</p>
