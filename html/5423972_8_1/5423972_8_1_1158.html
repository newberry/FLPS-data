   <p>More than five hundred persons, men and women from all parts of the city and suburbs, attended the banquet last night at the La Salle Hotel, which was given in honor of the president of the B'nai Brith, Mr. Adolph Kraus, on his seventieth birthday. The speaker of the evening was ex-President William Howard Taft, and the toastmaster was Mr. Simon Wolf, "the unofficial Jewish ambassador" in Washington.</p>
   <p>After complimenting Mr. A. B. Zellenfriend, secretary of the B'nai Brith, for his activity in the Order and for arranging the lavish affair, and after beseeching the guest of honor to believe everything that would be said about him, Mr. Wolf called upon the ex-President, presenting him as "one of the best friends that Jews have ever had within the Christian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>world".</p>
   <p>Mr. Taft congratulated Mr. Kraus on his seventieth birthday, and wished him a long life; at the same time, he congratulated the audience for their attendance at the banquet, as well as those who had thought of inviting him to the grand affair.</p>
   <p>Speaking of the B'nai Brith, "with which activities," he said, "I am well acquainted, I want to emphasize the fact that this organization is an example of Jewish justice, philanthropy and humanitarianism.</p>
   <p>"The lot of the Jews in the world", he continued, "has, for centuries, been one of suffering, misery and want. The Jew has suffered, through restrictions, intolerance, humilation and pogroms, more than any other National group; the Jew has been the victim of man's inhumanity to man. You can count on your fingers the countries which have given Jews equal rights. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Jew has endured, through all these miseries, thanks to his firm belief in God and his love for his family. This has bound him to the members of his race, regardless of their whereabouts.</p>
   <p>"In America, the Jew is the equal of all others, and he knows how to appreciate the liberty and justice which he enjoys here. In every community where he settles and earns his living, he remembers his less fortunate brothers in this country, as well as those across the water. He also extends aid to unfortunate non-Jews, because justice is written on his flag.</p>
   <p>"The B'nai Brith," he concluded, "is the embodiment of Jewish justice and Jewish charity, and Mr. Adolph Kraus, the president of the organization, in whose honor we are gathered here, is a man who has devoted a great part of his life to the splendid achievements of which the Jews are so very proud, and of which, we non-Jews are equally as proud."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sigmund Livingston was the second speaker, followed by Mr. Kraus himself <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>who thanked the B'nai Brith and Mr. Taft for honoring him with this banquet on his seventieth birthday, and assured then that as long as his health would permit, he would continue to work for the unfortunate and persecuted "of the Jewish race, who are always exposed to dangers among people who do not understand, and do not want to understand them".</p>
