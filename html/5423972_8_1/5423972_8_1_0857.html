   <p>The constitutional convention in Springfield, from which a great deal was expected, has been nearly forgotten by the public at large. This has given some groups an opportunity to try to smuggle into the new constitution some paragraphs which are against the interests of a large part of our population.</p>
   <p>One of the paragraphs which these groups tried to smuggle in, deals with the fundamental rights of a large part of the population of this state, and particularly the rights of a cosmopolitan population like Chicago's. This paragraph permits the "reading" of the Bible in the public schools, which is something that the Protestant clergy and fanatics had for a long time wanted, but were unable to get because the old constitution expressly forbade it.</p>
   <p>The paragraph in question reads that it shall not be forbidden under the new constitution to read selected passages from the Old and New Testaments in the public schools.</p>
   <p>Should this paragraph be adopted, the Protestant clergy, basing itself upon a Protestant majority in any locality, will demand that the Bible shall be taught in the schools and that it shall be taught according to the ideas of the teacher, and not according to the religious convictions of the children.</p>
   <p>We shall not speak about the appalling prospects of Jewish children being compelled to listen to "selected readings" from the New Testament. We shall confine ourselves to saying that it would be an outrage against Jewish religious sentiments [to compel children] to listen to "readings" of "selected" passages from the Old Testament which the Christian teachers will choose to read in accordance with their understanding [of them], and which will be read from a Christian translation which, in many instances, is known to be in complete variance with the Jewish text and Jewish interpretation.</p>
   <p>The Jews, however, are not the only ones who are protesting against this proposal. The Catholics take the same attitude. The Protestant Bible is profoundly disliked by the Catholics, and the reading of a Protestant Bible to Catholic school children must, surely, violate their religious feelings.</p>
   <p>The retention of such a point in the constitution would cause religious strife with its regrettable effects. It would also be a violation of a fundamental American law regarding the strict separation of the state from the church. Luckily, there is still time to oppose such a reactionary plan. It is not too late to protest sharply, and to strengthen the position of the liberal delegates to the convention, who are fighting the clericals, and who want the paragraph about reading the Bible in the schools to be eliminated entirely. If the convention passes this paragraph, then the voters of the state should reject the new constitution in toto, when it is submitted to them for ratification. It will be much better to let the old constitution, with all its faults, remain in force than to adopt a new constitution which has such a reactionary clause, irrespective of the merits of the other clauses of the constitution.</p>
