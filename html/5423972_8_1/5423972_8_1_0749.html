   <p>There was a time, and the majority of our readers still remember it, when a socialist, a freethinker and a radical of no particular description considered the question of education a matter which concerns only the petty bourgeois and the orthodox. The radical movements were borne at the time by people who were themselves in need of education. They couldn't imagine they would have to bear the burden of their children's problems and offer their opinions and express their sentiments in settling the question of education for the youth.</p>
   <p>In those happy heydays of radicalism, the young radical Jews formed an estimate of the world through the reflection of their parties' programs. At that time the most rational believed naively that they were living in the Age of the Messiah, and that all economic ills and human ailments were <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>merely the birth throes sustained by a Messiah, and that the liberating prophecies of Isaiah and Micah would come to pass in our own generation. At that time, the redemption was so close that it seemed as though the nations were converting their destructive weapons into working implements; that geographical boundaries were being abolished; and that the long period of prejudice existing between races and nations was disappearing. In those happy utopian days no one dared to utter a word with reference to nationalistic education. Children were to be raised for humanity, so why teach them conflicting issues when they are striving for unity and humanitarianism?</p>
   <p>The gruesome reality, however, awoke the radical generation from their slumber. They had arisen and found themselves confronted with complicated problems begging immediate solution which they were lacking. And one of these problems is the educational problem of our youth.</p>
   <p>The younger radical Jew heard a call: Return, you children, to your <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>home. True, you and all good people are working tirelessly for the emancipation of mankind, and are each new-born day paving the way for its arrival. But in spite of all this, there can still be a delay. And until the grass grows up, don't allow the steed to starve.</p>
   <p>The neo-radical Jew desires to have his son educated in Yiddish. He wishes to link his son's soul with the soul of the soul of the Jewish people, who have illumined the world for thousands of years. But whenever the radical Jew went among his co-religionists, instead of receiving a friendly welcome he encountered the barkers who pull their customers by the skirts and berate one another. One group would shout: Don't send your child to the Hebrew school. Hebrew spells religion and religion is reaction. A second group would brawl: Don't sent your child to a Yiddish school, because Yiddish is not Yiddish and rather than have your child taught the ugly jargon of the Diaspora, teach him the beautiful language of the independent nationalities with whom your people live as neighbors.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>And the radical Jew stood bewildered, not knowing where to go. He was certain of one thing, that the beautiful language of a nationality will not make a Jew out of his son. And even if the child remains living amid other nationalities, he will eventually become a Sunday Jew whose rabbi will praise hypocritically the great culture of the dominating Christian world, deny the duration of the Jewish faith, and extinguish every flame of the Jewish soul which emanates from the poor Jewish Ghetto to the rich Yehudim (German-Jewish) Temple.</p>
   <p>However, the contention that Hebrew spells religion appeals often strikingly to the heart of the Jewish radical. This is one of the many traditions he preserved from his storm and pressure period in the epoch of his struggle against Judaism. He still remembers well that the religion which he fervently opposed, was embodied in the Sidur Machzar, and Slichoth (prayer books), -all in Hebrew.</p>
   <p>Yet, whenever he passes a synagogue, even an outmoded one, he hears a heavenly voice from the burning thorn bush which warms and stimulates his heart. Blessed is the earth on which Jewish children unite with the spirit of their race. He <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>reminds himself suddenly of the memories of his childhood, when he discovered the invaluable treasures of Jewish culture, and when his soul would immerse each day in the brilliant light which was lit by the great Jewish souls of each generation.</p>
   <p>He reminds himself of the time when he sang triumphant hymns with Miriam and Devorah; when he offered blessings to beautiful nature together with the personages in psalms; when he gave vent to his heart for his longing for freedom when reading the poems of Ben Gabriel and Yehudi Halevi.</p>
   <p>He reminds himself of the time when he dreamt of the legends of our ancestors in the folks schools in Palestine and Babylon; when he reviewed the sayings in Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes; when he recited the proverbs of Ephraim and Yehodi in their glowing epochs; when he sighed at the condemnatory utterances of our Prophets and rejoyced over the good tidings brought by them to our ancestors in the streets of Jerusalem and Shomrim.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>And his heart swells with love and respect for the old Jewish Torah (Law) which appears so young and fresh--just as if it were handed down today--the Torah whose strong appeal for justice and love are interwoven with the entire Jewish literature which gave rise to the reactionary days of the Middle Ages with such lofty principles, as "Thou shalt not deliver a run-away slave unto his master, and thou shalt not take young birds away from their mothers."</p>
   <p>In his memory becomes refreshed the interpretations of the Torah by the great Jews of each generation. He brings back to his memory the moral principles enunciated by great Jews prior to the destruction of the second temple--the most humane principle which was made everlasting in the brief words of Hillel: "Do not do unto others that which you would not want them do unto you." This is the basis of the entire Torah. All else are but comments. In his ears ring the inspiring words, of the Jewish Medrashim (interpretation of biblical literature) of the Middle Ages--morals and ethics; and he sees how the Jew holds the banner of love for justice and how he cried out loudly, "Let there be light" when darkness prevailed all over and evil and prejudice ruled the world.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>A shivering sensation penetrates his body when, in his presence, the proud spirit of the voluntary heroes of Palestine is praised; or when the martyrs of Diaspora, who sacrificed their lives the world over for their God, are mentioned; or upon hearing the names of the matchless heroes who endured afflictions, who put the Spanish Inquisition to shame, and who exhaled their last breath with a self-conscious, "Hear, Oh Israel!" on their burning lips.</p>
   <p>He also conjures up in his mind the wonderful cabala and chassidism (from the Chassidic sect), and enwraps himself in the Jewish spirit which sought to liberate itself from its tragic environment on earth through creating a heavenly environment, where Israel, stripped of all earthly worries, is the center of all the world.</p>
   <p>He also recollects the Haskalah (Renaissance) period of the enlightened Jews who foresaw the morning star of European civilization, and who wanted to escape the Ghettos. But they were bound to these Ghettos by the fetters of <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the strong love for the language of their Prophets, and this love sprouted out into beautiful flowers and created a comparatively rich literature.</p>
   <p>He sees how the ancient language in which Amos and Micah had denounced the oppressors of the impoverished people, now summons through the socialistic labor press of Jerusalem the working people to battle against the old system which breeds oppression and subjugation, and how the Tichiwo (sic) language (Yiddish), in which his grandmothers have recited their prayers for hundreds of years, evolved into a colorful language with a modern literature and press that reaches millions of Jews.</p>
   <p>And he, the radical Jew, who was given a good education, comes to the conclusion that if he wants his child to remain a Jew, he must then endeavor to lead his child to the fountain of Judaism, to the eternal fountain from which drank the Prophets, the Maccabees, the heroes of Palestine, the martyrs of Diaspora, the authors of Talmud and Medrash, <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>the Jewish philosophers and jurists from the biblical times down to our present age.</p>
   <p>The nationally inclined radical Jew is therefore interested in the establishment and maintenance of a radical Jewish school where his child shall become acquainted with the radiant soul of his eternal people, with the people who possess a Palestine and live in Diaspora, with the people who have a holy language [Hebrew] and a mother-tongue [Yiddish]. Without the Torah of the Diaspora, the Jews will become hardened Karaites. Without the language of the Diaspora the Jews become deafened souls and beg solution to their problems, and are not judged properly by all.</p>
   <p>The nationalistic, radical Jew wants his child to know both languages, the language which now awakes to new life in Palestine and the language which unites almost all Jews in Diaspora.</p>
   <p>The love of the nationalistic, radical Jew for the Jewish people has nothing to do with the Jewish religion. It is a love that doesn't depend on anything.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>This is why the cultural treasures of the Jewish people are so dear to him, and for the same reason does he watch over them, his people, and his culture with so much love and devotion.</p>
   <p>Note:- The Karaites were a Jewish sect, professing, in its religious observances and opinions, to follow the Bible to the exclusion of rabbinical traditions and laws. IR.</p>
