   <p>The first annual convention of various Zionist organizations of Chicago will take place next Saturday and Sunday. This will be the first great conference of Chicago Zionists since the introduction of the district system. At this conference, we will be able to gauge the strength of our organized forces in the city, and to see how many new forces have recently arisen. They have been talking recently about new Zionist forces and about some Zionist youth organizations in the city. Young people, who have a lot of imagination, really think that the Zionist forces in Chicago are so plentiful that one has only to organize them and put them to work.</p>
   <p>We shall be able to tell, at the conference next Saturday and Sunday, how much truth there is in the theories held by Chicago's young Zionists.</p>
