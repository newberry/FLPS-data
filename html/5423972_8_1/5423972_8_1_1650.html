   <p>Representatives of Reform Judaism in America are now celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of their "faith". For this purpose, two thousand gentlemen from all parts of the country have convened in New York. It stands to reason that these two thousand gentlemen are convinced that Reform [Judaism] is a more agreeable religion than the real Judaism. They are also convinced that Orthodoxy will eventually disappear and Reform Judaism will take its place. As far as their first conviction is concerned, it is in truth well founded. No rational person will dispute the fact that Reform Judaism is more agreeable than our old-fashioned Judaism. A religion that does not impose any obligations on the individual, but only extends him privileges, is certainly very agreeable. But their second conviction, that the day will come when Reform Judaism will replace the Jewish [orthodox] religion, is irrational optimism. We have already had the Karaites who were large in number--they probably out-numbered the present-day Reform Jews--and what became of them? Nothing. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Reform Jews will either have to become Jews again or nothing will become of them as Jews, because Reform Judaism is some sort of a pretext for evading Judaism.</p>
