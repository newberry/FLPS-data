   <p>The Pure Food Law, which Congress passed June 30, 1906 is now effective. It is unlawful to misrepresent the quality or merits of food, drugs, or liquors. It is unlawful to tell your customer that such articles as liquor, drugs, etc. were imported when they were made in the United States. It is unlawful to designate a bottle of liquor as cognac when it is not actually cognac. It is against the law to call a bottle of liquor rye whisky when it is bourbon. It is unlawful to call a bottle of liquor whisky when it is only made of alcohol. It is unlawful to call a bottle of liquor sour mash or bourbon when the whisky was not made in Kentucky.</p>
   <p>Congress has, however, allowed the disposition of old stock in bottles under the old labels until October 1. After that time it is unlawful for the seller <span class="page-break">\2</span>to misrepresent the liquor by saying that it is old goods, whereas the bottles were just filled. The wholesaler who sells his goods after October 1 must furnish a Pure Food guarantee, and the retailer must furnish his customer the same kind of a guarantee. The penalty for violating this law is a fine and a jail sentence. Every dealer must have his name and address and a Pure Food guarantee on all labels which are stuck on bottles, and the label must state the exact kind of liquor the bottle contains.</p>
