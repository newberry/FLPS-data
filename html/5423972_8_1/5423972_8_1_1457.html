   <p>This year's campaign of Mo-ath Hitim [a campaign to provide the poor with food for Passover] is quieter than it was last year. It is being conducted in a systematic, centralized way, because the Association of Synagogues is taking part and everything is being done this year by the presidents of the synagogues to raise more money for the poor people who have to apply for Mo-ath Hitim. It is still not known whether the average Jewish citizen is doing his duty this year. Every Orthodox Jew of Chicago should figure out how much he can give to the Mo-ath Hitim Fund and not to wait till the last moment, because the poor people cannot buy at the last minute everything they need. Give at once your contribution to Mo-ath Hitim! Do not wait for the last moment!</p>
