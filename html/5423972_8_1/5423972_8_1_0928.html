   <p>Ramah Lodge has played an important part in the early history of Chicago. In the year 1857 when it was instituted, the city had but 80,000 inhabitants. The Jewish Community was small and divided. There were the German Jews and the Polish Jews. They hardly knew or cared for each other. There existed a great need for an organization upon whose platform all Jews could be united and whose purpose it would be to promote the common interests of all our co-religionists.</p>
   <p>When the movement was started in 1857 to establish such an organization in Chicago, Henry Greenebaum was an eager worker.</p>

Cohen, who at that time was head of K.A.M. Temple, was chosen president; Rudolph Rosenthal Vice-President and Herman Felsenthal, secretary.
