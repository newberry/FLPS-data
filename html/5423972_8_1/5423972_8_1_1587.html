   <p>"We are a part of the American Zionist Organization and we will carry out its plans and its resolutions. Dr. Chaim Weizmann is our acknowledged leader and beloved president of the World [Zionist] Organization. We support him and his policies and we pledge ourselves to stand by him and his associates in their work."</p>
   <p>The second annual convention of the middle western Zionists came to a close last night with the adoption of this resolution, which was adopted unanimously and enthusiastically. The election of new officers took place before the adoption of the resolution. Harry A. Lipsky was unanimously elected president of the "Middle Western Region of the Zionist Organization of America"--as this organization will henceforth be called.</p>

   <p>Yesterday's first session took place in the afternoon after all committees had completed their work. Robert Hess of Milwaukee was chairman, and B. Hodes, secretary. Meyer Abrams, speaking for the constitutional committee, reported that minor changes had been made in the constitution. The constitution declares that the middle western Zionists adhere to the Basel program and promise full moral and financial support to the Zionist World Organization and to the American Zionist Organization. I. T. Feingold proposed that the constitution should be adopted unanimously. It was so moved and carried.</p>
   <p>The new name of the Zionist organization here is: "Middle Western Region of the Zionist Organization of America".</p>
   <p>A letter from the former rabbi of Lomza, who spoke in the name of the Chicago Orthodoxy, was read at the convention. The greetings from the old Jewish leader were warmly received. Rabbi [Judah Leb] Gordon blessed the convention <span class="page-break">3</span>and expressed his hope that Palestine would be built according to the Jewish faith and the Jewish spirit.</p>
   <p>While the committees were working on their resolutions and recommendations, the delegates spoke of the fact that their children are not growing up as Jews who are interested in Jewish life and who are sympathetic to Jewish suffering. One after another, the delegates rose to tell how their children had become estranged from them, and how many of the children were ashamed of their parents. One could judge from their quiet, moving words that their hearts ached, that they spoke with sorrow and bitterness. When Robert Hess of Milwaukee, chairman of the educational committee, exclaimed in a moving voice, with pain in his heart, that our young generation was almost lost to us, the hall became as quiet as though it were a cemetery, and it seemed as though everybody agreed with him, however painful agreement might be.</p>
   <p>Report on the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] Max Shulman reported in the name of the Keren Hayesod Committee regarding <span class="page-break">4</span>Keren Hayesod work in the Middle West. The delegates were highly satisfied with his report.</p>
   <p>The Keren Hayesod maintains fifty-two kindergartens [in Palestine], sixty-five schools, twelve grammar schools, and seven trade schools. There are 505 teachers employed in the schools where 13,000 children study. The chief language is Hebrew.</p>
   <p>The Hadassah has supervision over twenty-two settlement houses and seventeen hospitals. The Keren Hayesod contributes the money for their maintenance.</p>
   <p>The midwestern region has raised $343,407.62 for the Keren Hayesod, of which $152,080 was raised during 1923. Not included in this amount is the $25,000 which Milwaukee sent directly to New York, and the $35,000 sent by Minneapolis and St. Paul.</p>
   <p>The main office of the Keren Hayesod in London has received, up to now, <span class="page-break">5</span>$4,300,000, of which sixty-three per cent came from America. Forty-two per cent of the money raised was spent for agriculture, thirty-nine per cent for education, and fifteen per cent for the Halutzim.</p>
   <p>All the money was spent by the World Zionist Executive Committee through its representatives in Palestine. Mr. Shulman gave figures to prove that not more than fourteen per cent of the money raised goes to cover the expenses of collecting and transmitting the money, while the cost to other organizations is thirty-two per cent.</p>
   <p>The Adopted Resolutions</p>
   <p>Dr. Rosenzweig proposed, in the name of the resolutions committee, a number of resolutions which were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>(1). To thank Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, for his untiring work in behalf of our holy ideal, and to grant him a vote of confidence in recognition of his work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>(2). To conduct intensive and energetic propaganda work among the young generation for Zionism and for the Jewish religion.</p>
   <p>(3). To support the Palestine Development League.</p>
   <p>(4). To support the National Fund.</p>
   <p>(5). To thank Dr. Abramowich for his work as director of the midwestern bureau.</p>
   <p>(6). To help found and take part in the establishment of an American colony in Palestine to be called Herzl, in memory of Dr. Theodore Herzl.</p>
   <p>Thank the Courier</p>
   <p>Dr. Rosenzweig proposed, amid stormy applause which lasted several minutes, a special resolution offering thanks to the Courier for its steady support and <span class="page-break">7</span>work in behalf of Zionism and the Keren Hayesod. S. L. Antonow took this opportunity to speak briefly about the wonderful work of the Courier in behalf of Zionism and all other Jewish national movements in the Middle West.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Zanderling Speaks on Herzl</p>
   <p>Rabbi Zanderling delivered a short lecture on Dr. Herzl. He held the audience spellbound with his talk on the great Jewish leader, who left us so prematurely. Tears came to the eyes of the audience when they heard Dr. Zanderling tell how Dr. Herzl suffered and struggled for a Jewish home for the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weizmann was present at this lecture. He listened with deep respect to everything that Rabbi Zanderling had to say.</p>
