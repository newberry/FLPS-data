   <p>The fight, which is being conducted in mass meetings in our synagogues, against the missionary plague will help to advertise the activity of the "soul snatchers" rather than weaken it. The danger to Jewish children of missionary propaganda cannot be removed by resolutions of condemmation, or by appeals to the parents to protect their children from the pestilence by a voluntary police guard. Negative ways of struggle, prohibitions, and condemmations will only serve to inflame the minds of our children, and their desire to taste the forbidden fruit will drive them to visit the nests of the "soul snatchers" where their young minds will be poisoned.</p>
   <p>The missionary plague can only be removed by positive and productive means of struggle--primarily by propaganda for national and religious Jewish education. Our religious leaders, representatives of national movements, community and <span class="page-break">\2</span>cultural workers must provide the West Side with Jewish cultural institutions, with educational institutions for adults, with Jewish clubs, libraries, lecture halls, and lecturers to spread Jewish thought, Jewish knowledge, and national ideas. These will be the most productive means of struggle against the plague of conversion.</p>
   <p>The national education of Jewish youth, a strong Jewish consciousness, and atmosphere of Jewish ideals--all these will form a powerful front against the missionary pestilence. The "soul snatchers" will not be able to sneak through such a fortress of Jewish culture.</p>
