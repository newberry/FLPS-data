   <p>It is estimated that though our Jewish citizens have lost not less than $20,000,000, they immediately after the fire took systematic measures to provide for the relief of those of their brethren who had been burned out. The result of these measures was that though there are 15,000 Jews in Chicago, not one of them has been seen to ask for aid of the general or special relief committees of the Gentile.</p>
   <p>The lodges of B'nai-Israel of this city at once made an appeal to the brethren throughout the United States, which was literally responded to; $18,000 having been received here, and distributed among the needy, up to November 5. In order, however, to furnish permanent relief for the suffering families of Israelities, $50,000 more are required, and it is hoped that this will be furnished by the Jews throughout the country.</p>
