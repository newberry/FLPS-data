   <p>The annual collections made in the temples on "erev" Yom Kippur for the United Hebrew Charities were very gratifying this year. The toal amount is in the neighborhood of $20,000. At the North Chicago Temple, about $900 was subscribed; at Zion, about $2,400; at the K. A. M.,about $4,000; and at Sinai, $12,000. This latter sum was collected in the fifteen minutes following Dr. Hirsch's eloquent plea, and the amount is probably the largest contributed by any single congregation in this country under similar circumstances.</p>
