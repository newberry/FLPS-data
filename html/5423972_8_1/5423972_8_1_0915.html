   <p>The Alliance Israelite Universalle has determined to be an exhibitor at the World's Fair. The Alliance will show specimens of the work performed by the pupils in all its schools, photographs of the school buildings, products of the agricultural school at Jaffa and of the technical school at Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>Documents will also be exhibited describing the action taken by the Alliance in the interest of the Jews in countries where they are still persecuted. This will not be the first occasion that the practical work of the Alliance has been exhibited to the public, but hitherto these displays have been on a small scale.</p>
