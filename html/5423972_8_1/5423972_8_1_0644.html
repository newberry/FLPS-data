   <p>Dear Editor: A very splendid and successful meeting of a liberal progressive element was held Wednesday at the Hebrew Institute. Mr. S. Rubinstein and Dr. Joshua Stulman explained the purposes and duties which now stand before liberal Jewish youth in regard to our national language. It became clear to everyone that while Jewish national thought is gaining more ground daily among Jewish liberals and the working masses, yet their animosity due to estrangement from, and ignorance of, our language (Hebrew) imposes a historical duty upon us. We must organize ourselves and through the agency of a strong national Hebrew movement defend our national language from its aggressors, the modern apostles of Yiddish. We must do this with the same idealism, self-sacrifice, and love with which we fought these very same elements fifteen years ago to defend our nationalism and national point of view. Just as before we must stand organized to defend our Hebrew position until we secure a final victory.</p>

   <p>The people present at the meeting responded to this warmly and favorably, twenty-five persons enlisting in the movement. The following officers were elected: Mr. S. Rubinstein, president; Mr. Lieberman, secretary; and Dr. Olshon, treasurer. A committee elected to formulate the various plans for activities is composed of the following friends: J. Elson, S. Kardiman, Aaron Katz, Jacob Ben Ami, Dr. H. Epstein, and Dr. Joshua Stulman. This committee will meet tonight, Friday evening, at the home of Dr. Epstein, 1259 West 12th Street, to work out a plan for Hebrew activities in Chicago.</p>
