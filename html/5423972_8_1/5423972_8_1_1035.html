   <p>Following a two-hour conference with Mr. Adolph Kraus, president of the Order B'nai Brith, the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan issued a statement in which he said that officially the Klan is not anti-Semitic, and that its sole mission is to defend the civilization of the white man in America; as though a foreign power were going to invade America to attack the civilization of the white man in America. After the chief of the Ku Klux Klan emphatically declares that the Klan is not anti-Semitic, he then goes on to enumerate the sins of the American Jews--they did not build America; they have only made money in America; they have contributed nothing to American civilization, etc. One of the greatest sins of the American Jews, says the chief of the Ku Klux Klan, is the fact that they have remained Jews; that they do not mingle with the converted Jews, etc.</p>

   <p>After Dr. Evans, Imperial Wizard of the Klan, made this statement, the B'nai Brith published an editorial interpreting it. This editorial interpretation is much more important than the anti-Semitic statement of Dr. Evans. In the B'nai Brith editorial, no facts are presented; the editorial does not point out what the Jews in America have done for America. It does not, for example, mention that three great scientists in America, Loeb, Michelson, and Oxner are Jews; that the greatest American sculptor, Rodeson, is a Jew; that the greatest contemporary jurists, Untermyer and Bodenheimer, are Jews--the B'nai Brith probably does not know this. On the contrary, the B'nai Brith apologizes to the chief of the Klan because Jews do not become converted, and it [B'nai Brith Organ] declares that "it does not care whether a Jew goes directly over to the Church". It goes on to say, "We do not quarrel with one who fraternizes with Christians. We are Jews in the synagogue only, just as the Christians are Christians in church only".</p>
   <p>If this is the program of the B'nai Brith, I am no longer a member of that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>organization. I will send in my resignation today to the secretary of the Rama Lodge because I do not want to belong to an organization that apologizes for its Judaism and that approves of conversion and assimilation.</p>
   <p>I have no complaint against the chief of the Ku Klux Klan. I know why he does not love us. But I do have a bone to pick with the president of the B'nai Brith. If his Judaism is such as he described in his reply to Dr. Evans, I cannot understand why he needs a B'nai Brith organization.</p>
