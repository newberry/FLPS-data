   <p>My dear Doctor: In response to your request for a message of good will and sympathy to greet the convention of American Zionists who are to gather in this city on the fourteenth of this month, I am pleased to have the opportunity, in behalf of the people of Chicago, to extend a most cordial welcome to the delegates and visitors who may come within our gates on this occasion.</p>
   <p>Nowhere in the world is there a broader spirit of tolerance than here in Chicago, and nowhere is there a more general recognition of the right of the individual to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, according to his own standard of faith or religion. It is, therefore, peculiarly appropriate that the Zionists of the world should appoint this city as their meeting place to consider ways and means of rescuing the Jews of Continental Europe from the persecution and maltreatment which they suffer there. Our people, animated by the belief that their own liberty is secure, have a sympathetic interest in the aspirations of their fellowmen in other countries for the quiet enjoyment of the blessings of liberty.</p>
   <p>In the hope that the deliberations of the convention will be productive, and will result eventually in lifting the yoke of oppression from your people in Europe, I am</p>
   <p>Faithfully yours,</p>
   <p>William Hale Thompson.</p>
