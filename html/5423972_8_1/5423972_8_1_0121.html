   <p>Judge David severely criticized the newspapers and Chief of Police, for interfering with the Wanderer's case, when a petition was brought to him to grant Carl Wanderer, who murdered his wife, and an unidentified vagrant, a hearing to determine whether he is sane.</p>
   <p>The Chief of Police expressed himself to the effect that Wanderer should be hung.</p>
   <p>"It is the duty of the Chief of Police and everyone else to keep their mouths shut", said Judge David. "This trial cost the State about $50,000, although it does not concern me. If I would know that the jury was influenced by the Chief's statement, I would dismiss them."</p>
