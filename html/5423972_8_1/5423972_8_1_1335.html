   <p>We are notifying our sister members that the Ladies Society for Learning in Safed, Palestine will have an important meeting Sunday evening, April 3, at the Beth Midrash Hagadol and B'nai Yaakov Synagogue, 836 Maxwell Street. We beg all sisters who are members or who wish to become members of such a worthwhile organization to attend this meeting.</p>
   <p>Dear Sisters! Do not think that because this organization was neglected, it is dead. The flame of the Holy Torah must continue to shed light. Help us, Sisters, to achieve this holy goal, and your heavenly reward will be great.</p>
   <p>At the same time we would like to inform you that Simhah Charlotte, 1521 West Twelfth Street, has the power to collect dues and other monies for the Society. We ask the sisters to treat him accordingly.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Malkah Miller, president.</p>
