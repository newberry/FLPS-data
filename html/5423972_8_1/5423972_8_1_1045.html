   <p>The Keren Hayesod ["exchequer of World Zionist Organization] drive for a quarter-million dollars opens in Chicago today. It is, therefore, fitting and proper that we say a few words about the objectives of the Keren Hayesod--what it is striving for and what its final goal is. The Keren Hayesod does not have millions of dollars in its treasury. It functions on a budget of two million dollars a year--and with this relatively small sum of money, it cannot do national work on a large scale. Even five million dollars a year would not be enough to cover a large amount of work. But it does not have five million dollars a year to proceed with the construction work in Palestine. However, with this two million dollars, it could, in the course of ten or fifteen years, solve the Jewish Question, although it could not solve the question of the Jews. The Jewish Question is the problem of establishing a Jewish majority in Palestine. If there were a half-million Jews in Palestine, the Jewish Question would be solved, inasmuch as it was solved when forty-three thousands Jews returned from Babylon to Palestine. The return of forty-three thousand Jews from Babylon to Palestine, during the time of the Prophets Ezra and Nehemiah, did not solve the problem of the one hundred thousand or millions of Jews who remained in Babylon, or in Egypt, or in the other countries of the Diaspara. We do not know what became of those masses of Jews. History has no record of them. But the forty-three thousand Jews who returned to Palestine laid the cornerstone for a new Jewish future, for a new Jewish state, and assured and secured our historical existence as a nation.</p>
   <p>That we still exist today [as a nation] and still struggle for a [national] future, is due to those forty-three thousand Jews who returned to Palestine from their exile in Babylon. The rich Jews who lived quite comfortably and who gave charity, remained in Babylon and in Egypt. Forty-three thousand poor Jews went to Palestine and built up the Jewish land, thereby solving the Jewish Question--the question of the national and political existence of the Jewish people.</p>
   
   <p>The Keren Hayesod can and will solve the Jewish Question. Every halutz who enters Palestine to help build the land is a part of the huge national structure. When there are one hundred thousand halutzim in Palestine--Palestine will be ours because one hundred thousand halutzim will mean the economic future of one-half million Jews. In case of emergency, these one hundred thousand halutzim will also mean one hundred thousand defenders.</p>
   <p>A half-million Jews in Palestine will solve the Jewish Question--the question of a politically assured Jewish nation in a national homeland. This one-half million will naturally provide economic opportunities for another half-million, etc. However, the question of the Jews will not be solved, and it is not the task of the Keren Hayesod to solve it. It will, naturally, be much better for the Jews in the Diaspora if Palestine has a Jewish majority, and a Jewish government. The prestige of the Jews will rise; they will no longer be hated or suspected, and when a Jewish government in Palestine is an actuality, the threat of pogroms against the Jews will be over. Those who are ashamed of their Judaism today, will no longer be ashamed--at any rate, they will be in a better condition morally than they are today. But the Keren Hayesod cannot and will not solve their problem because that is not their mission. If it [Keren Hayesod] had the means, it would remove another half-million Jews from the Diaspora over a period of ten or fifteen years. But it would not be able to rehabilitate seventeen million Jews in Palestine because the country can only absorb from five to six million people.</p>
   <p>The Keren Hayesod must and will help solve the Jewish Question--it will establish a Jewish nation in Palestine and will assure our existence as a nation, which is possible only in Palestine; but it will not help the individual Jew.</p>
   <p>The person who realizes that the Jewish Question is much more important and critical than the question of the Jews--who realizes that the Keren Hayesod is doing the same thing for Palestine that the forty-three thousand Jews of Babylon did--that person will support [the Keren Hayesod] wholeheartedly and most generously.</p>
