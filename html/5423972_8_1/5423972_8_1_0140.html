   <p>Chief of Police Gleason, in last Saturday's Police Bulletin, paid many compliments, praising the Jewish second class detective, Sergeant Michael Weisbaum of the Maxwell Street police station. Sergeant Weisbaum has especially distinguished himself in tracking down pick-pockets. He and his partner, Fred Roth, together, succeeded in rounding up three of the most notorious pick-pockets on the West Side. This trio of pick-pockets were tried in the Criminal Court, found guilty, and sentenced to a year and over to Bridewell. Sergeant Weisbaum said that he will not rest until he roots out all pick-pockets on the West Side.</p>
