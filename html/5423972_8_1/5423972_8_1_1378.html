   <p>Yesterday Chicago Zionists observed Herzl Memorial Day in a magnificent manner. Meetings in all parts of the city proved to be very successful. Disregarding the heat, thousands of Jews gathered to pay homage to the deceased leader of the Jews.</p>
   <p>In the early morning all the children from the Talmud Torahs marched in parade to the Herzl school. There under the direction of Dr. A. Levinson, the children held a meeting during which Mr. H. Steinberg, Dr. G. K. Rosenzweig and Mr. M. Abrams spoke; they pointed out the significance and importance of the day. The children were especially interested in the Herzl pictures shown them by Mr. M. Cohen as he told of various incidents in Herzl's life. Two thousand children participated in the march and the meeting.</p>
   <p>At three o'clock, three large meetings were held. On the Northwest Side at the Sabin school, where over a thousand people gathered, Dr. S. M. Melamed, Leon Zolotkoff, and Max Shulman spoke. Mr. M. Cohen used pictures to illustrate incidents in the life of Herzl. On the South Side, at the Hebrew Congregation, prominent speakers addressed a large assemblage.</p>
   <p>Especially noteworthy was the meeting at the Herzl school which began at eight in the evening. It was conducted by Dr. G. K. Rosenzweig. A huge crowd filled the large hall and gallery of the school. Speakers were Mr. M. Abrams, who pointed out the significance of this day for Jews, Dr. S. M. Melamed who delivered a beautiful speech about the personality and influence of Dr. Herzl, Mr. Sam Ginsberg, and Mr. H. Steinberg who spoke on Herzl and Zionism.</p>
   <p>Enthusiastic applause greeted the appearance of Madam F. Reinhardt who sang various Jewish songs. She was accompanied at the piano by Miss Rosen. Max Shulman spoke last. Various pictures of Herzl's life were shown. A prayer for the deceased was delivered by Rabbi M. Alpert.</p>
   <p>Local Zionists can congratulate themselves upon such a splendid and unusually successful commemoration of Herzl Memorial Day. This day will linger in the memory of many local Jews and will also contribute much to augmenting the Zionist ranks in Chicago so that at the coming convention of American Zionists, soon to be held in Chicago, the Zionist membership may reach the twenty-five thousand mark.</p>
