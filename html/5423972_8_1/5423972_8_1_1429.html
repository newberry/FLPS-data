   <p>May Day Parade in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The fact that May Day occurred on Sunday, brought a big turn out to the Socialist May Day Parade. The official parade started at 12th and Ashland avenue. Small parades from various sections of town converged with the larger parade at their appointed place. All nationalities were represented. Jews and Poles appeared to be in a minority. It was estimated that more than three thousand men and women participated, carrying Scoialist banners and Red flags, playing and singing the Marsellaise.</p>
