   <p>Meeting of the Palestine Committee.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of the Palestine Committee of the Federation of American Zionists on April 30th, it was decided that a committee should form a corporation to buy 10,000 dunams of land in Palestine. Each one who buys one or more dunam of land has a right to vote in the election of directors of the corporation. The land will be given to the Jewish National Fund to be cultivated, but the corporation will control the use of the land and retain the land for the purpose of establishing an American Colony in Palestine. He who buys 50 or more dunams within a year may have the right to use the land himself, upon proper application of the Jewish National Fund.</p>
   <p>It was decided that a committee to two be appointed, whose sole purpose will be to contact interested people and sell them interests in the land. The Palestine Committee feels that all Zionists throughout the land should initiate such projects in their sections of the country. In a short time, Mr. Zevy Cohen of Jaffa, will embark on his world propaganda tour for the purchase of land in Palestine.</p>
