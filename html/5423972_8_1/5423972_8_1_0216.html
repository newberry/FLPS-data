   <p>The voice of the Jewish Courier recently raised against the recent rise of "White Slavery" in the neighborhood of the Jewish settlement has brought tremendous response. The members of our community were not fully aware of this growing menace but now that our columns have taken up the crusade, the citizenry is fully aroused, and a demand for action forthcoming.</p>
   <p>As a result, a committee has been designated by the Bnai Brith to look into the matter and expose those who are involved in bringing "White Slavery" into the Jewish settlement district.</p>
   <p>A city ordinance imposes a fine of $200 per day upon all landlords who knowingly allow their apartments to be leased for vice purposes. We feel that by exposing the landlords who are guilty of leasing their apartments for immoral purposes, the problem will be solved. The names of this type of landlord should be given to this committee and the committee will see to it that the law is enforced. It may be noted here that all leases of this type are void and not binding since illegal in the inception.</p>
   <p>We call upon the citizens of the West Side to cooperate to the fullest extent in eradicating this evil and this can be done only by exposing the landlords and the "White Slavery" dealers.</p>
