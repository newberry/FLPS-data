   <p>Ramah Lodge has assumed the leadership in the effort to raise the B'nai B'rith institution in this city to a proper and dignified plane of service. The president, vice-president, treasurer and secretary are all college graduates who have already made a record for themselves in the service of civil and social interests.</p>
   <p>Ramah Lodge, over forty years ago, took the initative in the organization of the U. H. C. of Chicago and has since then dispensed charity in a quiet manner. A most cheering evidence of the activity of the lodge is the organization of an auxiliary, consisting of over 150 boys and girls under the age of 21. This organization will be a powerful lever in the consolidation of the young elements of Jewish society in Chicago.</p>
