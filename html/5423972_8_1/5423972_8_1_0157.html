   <p>The newspaper columns have recently been full of reports of various crimes and the enormous expenses entailed in court proceedings. These reports are published in order to acquaint the public with the facts about the careers of criminals, with a view to freeing society of this burden by checking criminal tendencies during early childhood.</p>
   <p>The fact that juvenile delinquents are imprisoned in various institutions does not solve the problem. Our national expenditure has risen to millions of dollars, and statistics show that such imprisonment does not tend to prevent crime. It has been shown that many adult criminals spent part of their childhood in institutions of correction. On the other hand, it was revealed that in one city, the system of providing juvenile delinquents with a normal environment, cost only one-eighth of what the cost would have been for supervision in an institution. What is more, the new system was more successful.</p>

   <p>We have just become interested in this problem. We are beginning to realize that many boys and girls who have been arrested for the first time for violating certain laws, are really not bad children. They are normal children who could become good citizens, but as a result of bad influence and poor environment, they have committed antisocial acts.</p>
   <p>Two children are never influenced alike. Nevertheless, there are certain types that become more or less general. One type is the stubborn child, in whom obstinacy has developed because of the parents' unreasonable commands and unjustified demands. Another type is the uncontrollable child, whose training has not been consistent. He would be permitted to do a thing at one time, and would be punished for doing the same thing at another time. Such a child has no conception of right and wrong. He has queer notions and caprices. The deceitful child has probably been deceived by adults who wished to exploit the child. Regardless of how much that child is punished for telling lies, he will grow up to be a liar because children acquire habits from observation, not from lectures.</p>

   <p>A child sometimes steals because he lives in an immoral environment, or because he may love to take risks, or because he associates with bad company, or, perhaps, because he is poor and in need. In every case, the true cause of theft must be discovered and removed. Sometimes a child neglects his school-work because it does not interest him and does not answer his needs. Sometimes a child runs away from home because the home is poor and uncomfortable. Many cases are known where boys and girls were given the opportunity to leave home under surveillance, and after they wandered about a bit, or worked on a farm, they were perfectly willing to return home.</p>
   <p>The Children's Bureau has compiled the facts about ten thousand juvenile delinquents. This data was drawn from the annual reports of seven juvenile courts and showed that forty per cent [of the delinquents] came from homes where the families had been broken up as a result of death, divorce, or the separation of parents.</p>
   <p>In the cases where the parents lived together, a large percentage of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>mothers were employed outside of the home, or some other abnormal condition prevailed. These facts bring to mind many necessary social benefits which should be created, chief among them being pensions for poor mothers, so that children shall not be deprived of the careful attentions of a mother, or that work outside of the home shall sap all the vitality of the mother.</p>
   <p>There are children with diseased minds, who should be removed from society and sent to special institutions. But in a number of cases, many mentally ill children can be segregated in separate classes in public schools, where they can be taught the fundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as various useful work, such as the use of simple tools, house cleaning, gardening, cooking, sewing, washing, etc. When such children get jobs, they must be kept under the surveillance of intelligent adults. The mentally diseased child becomes a criminal not because he inherits a criminal tendency, but because he is easily influenced and often lives in a poor environment. It is just as easy to teach him good habits as bad ones. People with very limited intellectual capacity find ways to get by and to earn a living honestly. Some even <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>have noble traits.</p>
   <p>All children should be given an education in keeping with their natural ability. If a child of unusual ability is placed in a class where he does not have to exert himself, or put forth any effort, he may become lazy, arrogant, and even the leader of a gang. Every official of a juvenile court knows of a number of cases where boys are punished for staying out over night, for stealing, for damaging property, and other such crimes that they have committed because they had no other outlet for their energy. This problem is often solved by organizing clubs, athletic societies, and other such groups of boys and girls, by giving these children more interesting schoolwork, and by influencing the parents to make their homes more attractive to the children.</p>
   <p>The schools are beginning to realize that it is within their province to aid in the prevention of juvenile delinquency. In a number of cities, teachers are taking over the duties of court officials. They visit the homes of the children, find out the causes of truancy and other difficulties. Then they <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>devise means to overcome these difficulties. Through the teacher, the home is brought in closer contact with the school. The teacher employs all possible means to improve the welfare of the children.</p>
