   <p>Perez Smolensky's novel, The Wanderer In The Paths of Life, which we read when we were small children, is now out-of-date. As a narrative, it has really grown old, and belongs to a time which is long since past. But specific observations made by the author, with reference to human behavior, under certain conditions, are full of universal wisdom and experience, and these never grow old.</p>
   <p>When Joseph, the hero of that story, suddenly and unexpectedly, inherited a fortune, he, first of all, decided to dress in fine clothes. But because he was naive, because he had always been a Yeshiva Bocher (theological student), he did not know what style of clothing to select. But his eye was attracted to a nobleman whom he used to see every day at the entrance of a magnificent hotel. The nobleman wore a long coat with brass buttons, and gold arm bands on his sleeves. He also wore a top hat with a gold ornament <span class="page-break">2</span>on one side, which made him appear very dignified. Joseph decided to have such a costume made for himself. When the costume was finished, he wanted to take a suite in the same magnificent hotel in which that nobleman lived. When Joseph entered the lobby, the manager became angry because he wasn't at his post, and because he hadn't opened the door for the guests. The manager mistook him for a doorman because his costume was like that of a doorman.</p>
   <p>This is a ridiculous incident, caused by ignorance and inexperience. In America the same thing often happens to us. In the process of becoming Americanized, we commit a folly which is analogous to the case of Joseph in Vienna, if not worse.</p>
   <p>How do most Jewish daughters become Americanized? They put on a six-dollar pair of shoes with a high French heel; chew gum in street-cars and in other public places; laugh out loud; use English expressions such as "Cut it out", <span class="page-break">3</span>and "Aint he mean"; they wear flower-garden hats so as to attract the attention of other passengers.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to intimate that all Jewish girls are like that. There are Jewish daughters who do not chew gum, who dress conservatively and in good taste, who speak gently when in public places; and who generally conduct themselves modestly. The loud individual is more quickly heard than are a hundred quiet ones. Thus the boisterous and gum-chewing daughters of Israel are more quickly the center of attraction than are the quiet and modest ones.</p>
   <p>The sight of a half-dozen Jewish girls either on their way home from work, or riding to a park on a Sunday in a streetcar, makes one indignant. The six-dollar shoes, the frilled silk blouses and the vivid hats are not becoming to them because they are really decent Jewish girls who would not behave immodestly. They do not wish to attract the attention of strange men. But they <span class="page-break">4</span>think that high-heeled shoes, low-cut blouses, and varicolored hats are the American style, because they see other girls so attired. They chew gum not because they like it a great deal, or because it is necessary for their digestion, but because they see other girls do so. They do not realize that, in the eyes of respectable people, they look like a herd of young cattle, chewing their cud. They laugh out loud not because they are hilarious, but because they have heard other girls laugh out loud. They speak loudly and are the center of attraction because they have seen other girls, Jewish or non-Jewish, who have become Americanized long ago, behave so.</p>
   <p>They make the same mistake that Joseph made. The typical, well-bred American girl possesses good taste and a sense of that which is most becoming. The well-bred American girl does not chew gum, nor does she wear shoes with a <span class="page-break">5</span>three-inch heel, nor does she laugh or speak loudly in public places in order to attract the attention of others. The well-bred American girl dresses conservatively and with good taste, and is modest.</p>
   <p>After seeing how some Jewish daughters behave , decent American men and women think that they are all vulgar and think that they are worse than they actually are.</p>
