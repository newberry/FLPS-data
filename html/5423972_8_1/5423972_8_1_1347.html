   <p>The Jewish Agriculturists' Aid Society of America, an organization chartered under the laws of the State of Illinois and with offices at Chicago, encourages and assists the Jewish poor that are able and willing to establish themselves as farmers in the United States or in Canada.</p>
   <p>The Society began operations fourteen years ago. On the 16th of October, 1888, in the study of Dr. Hersch, its plan was mapped out by the doctor and two of his colleagues, Rabbi I.S. Moses and Rabbi A.R. Levy. Gaining a few friends for the cause, among whom were Herman Felsenthal, Adolph Loeb, Samuel Gans, Adolph Moses and Israel Cowen, the work has been carried on by independence and prosperity.</p>
   <p>In its last report of the Society goes a detailed account of the condition of 89 of its proteges. These 89 Jewish farmer-families work an aggregate of 10,617 acres of land. The value of these estates is $140,000. 22 of the farms are free of every encumbrance and the total indebtedness against the remaining 67 is $40,000. Of $35,525 in loans made to the Jewish farmers, all but $14,030 have been repaid.</p>
   <p>The actual expense of carrying on the program of the J.A.A.S. is assumed by the A.J.C., and by the few members of the Society. The officers are President, Adolph Loeb; Secretary, Leopold Gans; and, Treasurer, E. Rose.</p>
