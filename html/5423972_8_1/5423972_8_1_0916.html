   <p>The Chicago branch of the Jewish Alliance held a rousing mass meeting last Sunday afternoon, at the Temple, corner Clinton and Judd Streets. Mr. H. Eliassof presided. The speeches made drew forth much enthusiasm and 160 new members were added to the roll, making about 300 in all. The speakers were Dr. Felsenthal, Henry Greenbaum, Dr. I. S. Moses, Rev. A. R. Levy, Leon Schlossman and Henry Mitchell. The Rev. Wm. Blackstone, who was present at the meeting, also spoke on invitation. A contribution of $20.00 was received from Nathan Eisendrath; $25.00 from Mr. Baumgarten; $10.00 from Henry Mitchell, and others also subscribed liberally.</p>
   <p>The object of the Alliance is to give aid to the poverty-stricken emigrants that come to this country and to make good American citizens of them. A business meeting will be held soon to arrange for the practical work to be done toward ameliorating the condition of the refugees here.</p>
