   <p>In the 1913 publication of the Observer, it had already been discussed that there was a tendency of a shift in the population, in comment made on the attendance at a Patriotic Rally on the Fourth of July of that year. The Irish, Greeks, and Italians seem to have threatened the Jewish hegemony of that neighborhood already at that time. Still the district was predominantly Jewish, since at the above affair of a thousand children mentioned, only seven per cent were non-Jewish, while at a picnic that followed during the Summer of that year, only ten out of five-hundred and fifty persons were non-Jewish.</p>
   <p>Something of the size and nature of the Institute activities may also be gleaned from its records of expense and income as reported in the Observer of that year. The English Department, for instance, records a total income of $1,876.43 and an expenditure of $2,691.99. Compare these figures with the figures of today and you will observe a startling change. You have already heard from the Treasurer's Report, and I hope that you will take the time and interest to glance at the report of the Treasurer, which will be included in the Secretary's Report and which will be printed in the Observer shortly, and really get the significance of the growth that your Institute has made. In 1914 the deficit for the year was shown to be $6,000.00. The Directors, at that time, were empowered to raise $40,000.00 in order to help defray the expenses of the ensuing year. Today we are asked to raise approximately $150,000.00 in order to meet the budget, which will run in the neighborhood of $350,000.00 if we include the Northwest Branch and continue the responsibility as far as maintenance is concerned in our Taylor Street Branch.</p>
   <p>The financial figures enumerated seem so trivial at this time. I am speaking now of a period of almost fifteen years ago. At a cursory view of the matter it may seem that the service of the Institute was very limited. Nothing could be further from the truth. The figures of attendance, the number and variety of activities all belie this possibility. The Institute was indeed a very busy hive at this time. One fact alone will be sufficient to show the response made to the service offered. When, in 1914, the Penny Milk Station, made possible by the generosity of Dr. Rubel, was opened, one-thousand glasses of milk at one cent each were sold on the third day after the opening, and five-thousand glasses on one single day during the following Summer. The concerts, lectures, and English classes were all well attended. The new Gymnasium which was established in 1917 was the beginning of the present mammoth institution of physical education harbored by the Institute. I will refer to the activities of this department at greater length further on in this report. There were only eight officers of administration at that time, ten instructors in the English classes and five in the Gymnasium. Nevertheless, the Institute was the hub of the West Side Jewry. The next few years showed a rapid expansion of the various types of service rendered at the Institute as well as many additions to the activities formerly in vogue. This state of affairs may best be summarized by interpolating a page from the Observer of 1916. There the total aggregate attendance is shown as more than 65,000 a month. This represents a quintupling of figures in three years. Likewise we see in the Financial Report of the year a steady growth in both items of revenue and expense. Let me cite a single typical month for the purpose of comparison. The income in May, 1915, totalled $6,581.53 while the expense amounted to $10,061.77. This represents a deficit of $3,480.24 for a single month.</p>
   <p>In 1916 during the same month, the revenue income had jumped to $11,984.40 while the expense amounting to $12,013.66 showed a reduced deficit of only $29.26. During this month the revenue almost equalled the expenditures, as may be seen.</p>
   <p>1917 was a year of consolidation and broad expansion. In my report to you that year, I called to your attention the establishment of our Evening High School, now and for many years an accredited institution and one of the best secondary schools in the State of Illinois.</p>
