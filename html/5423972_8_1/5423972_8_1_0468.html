   <p>We do not hear so much nowadays, as we used to, about the mission of Israel, but it is still advanced by some people as a reason for holding aloof from, if not for opposing the Zionist movement. The explanation that is offered in declaring the ideal of Zionism to be inconsistent with the existence of a mission, is that the latter requires the continued dispersion of Jewry, whereas the former calls for its reunion in its ancestral land. But those who believe that [that] disposition is essential for the fulfillment of Israel's destiny betray a gross ignorance of Jewish thought and tradition, for the exile from the Holy Land was always proclaimed not as a blessing, not as a means toward the propagation of a mission, but as a national punishment. "It is because of our sins that we are exiled from our land and removed far from our soil"--runs the prayer in our ritual.. If our dispersion had been considered to be necessary or desirable, we should not have repeated throughout the ages: "Next year in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Jerusalem!," but "Next century" or "Next millenium in Jerusalem!" And instead of our eyes and our souls being always turned in worship toward the site of the Temple, they would have been turned away from it.</p>
   <p>The doctrine that seeks in the mission of Israel justification of the Diaspora is a fallacy designed to deflect the aspirations of Israel from their rightful goal. However we may define or formulate that mission, it cannot be seriously contended that it cannot be discharged more efficiently by the nation living in its own land than by the myriads of national fragments scattered throughout the globe: for these fragments are more likely to coalesce with the greater masses around them than to preserve their distinct identity unimpaired and influence their surroundings.</p>
   <p>There are some who are impatient of the idea that Israel should have to justify his continued existence by a specific task. They point to all the other nations of the world whose right to existence has never been challenged or made dependent <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>upon the exercise of a mission, and they claim that there shall be no differentiation between them. Have the Poles a mission or have the Czechoslovaks? Nobody asks and nobody cares, yet the creation of States for the Poles and Czechoslovaks is held to be one of the most important fruits of the great war. If, however, Israel had to justify his existence before the bar of the civilized world (when there is a civilized world), he could render an account that could put his judges to the blush. He could point to his wonderful spiritual achievement--the Bible, with its incomparable teaching of pure monotheism, its impressive revelation of the Decalogue, its unsurpassable code of social righteousness, and proclaim aloud that these, the cardinal principles of his national polity, are not for his sole possession, but to be shared by the whole of mankind. And when the nations of the world all put into practice the spiritual and moral precepts of Israel, his mission--unto them--may be said to have been fulfilled.</p>
   <p>But the first and most instinctive privilege of a nation, as [well as] of an individual, is self-preservation. The Jewish people must first look after itself, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>must assure the continuance of its national existence. Its mission will then also have a better prospect of preservation and favorable acceptance. Even the most pious of Jewish communities fails to make an impression upon their persecuting neighbors; much less communities of easy-going conformity. But assembled and settled in the national home, living amid all the inspiring scenes of Scripture, and breathing "an air that maketh wise, "the Jewish people will have an opportunity of realizing in their own commonwealth the virtues of their inherited teachings and thus presenting a concrete and vital embodiment of the mission of Israel.</p>
