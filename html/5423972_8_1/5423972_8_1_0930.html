   <p>At the outbreak of the Civil War, under the auspices of Ramah Lodge, a mass meeting of Chicago Jews was called for the purpose of raising money to recruit a company of Jewish volunteers to form a part of the 82nd Regiment of Illinois Volunteers.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a great success. The sum of $11,000 was promptly subscribed from which fund a bonus of $100 each was given to 104 men enlisting in the company. With one exception, all of the officers of the Company were Jews and they achieved a splendid record during the War.</p>
   <p>On June 17, 1865, the 82nd Regiment returned to Chicago, but out of 1,000 members, only 250 came back.</p>
