   <p>From the report of Superintendent A.R. Levy, on the relief work of the Executive Committee in Aid of the Russian Refugees.-</p>
   <p>"We have been able to secure employment for a good number of unskilled laborers and boys. However, our means do not suffice to meet the emergency. We are unable to find employment for all. There is but one solution to the problem - the refugees must be distributed throughout the country. The burden of this enforced and abnormal immigration is cast upon the few larger communities in the country and, our city is receiving more than its due share. It is to the country places, to the smaller cities, to the towns and villages, that we must look for the remedy. An earnest and urgent appeal must be made to our brethren in the country who will surely share with us the burden that ought to rest upon all Israelites alike. Let an appeal in the form of a letter be addressed to individual members in the smaller communities and the result will, no doubt, be very satisfactory."</p>
