   <p>The great difference between the traditional four questions, contained in the Passover service, which arrests the attention of Jews once a year at the Seder, and the ancient and constant questions which appear before us every day throughout the year, and have been present for centuries, is that the latter questions remain unanswered whereas the answers to the former are contained in the Hagodah (prayer book for Passover).</p>
   <p>What will become of the Jews? This is the basic question, the most difficult and the most painful. All other Jewish questions are minor, and may be considered as the children of this basic question. They change according to conditions, and from time to time, assume new forms, but in essence, they are parts of the difficult problem, "What will become of the Jews?"</p>
   <p>We have had a Jewish problem in Poland and Lithuania--this was basically a Russian problem. Then Germany came and occupied Lithuania and Poland. By this change, we believed that the Jewish problem would be solved. But no. It split in two. Now we have a Jewish problem in Germany and a Jewish problem in Russia.</p>
   <p>It is our misfortune that those who raise these questions in Germany are Jewish anti-Semites. "What about the Ost-Juden (Eastern Jews)?", they ask. Many of them proposed that Germany should enforce the ghettos for the Ost-Juden just as Russia has done. It is obvious that if the instigators of assimilation will have the authority, the Jews of Poland will have no voice at all in determining their own fate.</p>
   <p>One would think that the Jews could expect, in these times, at least something from a general Jewish organization which would take in the entire Jewish people. In a world that speaks and understands only the language of nations, and not that of small sects and individuals, the Jews, too, ought to learn this language, and speak to the world so. Thus when the Jews begin to organize as a nation, and support a Jewish Congress, then the divergence in opinion on political and economic questions should cease. The chief objective should be to organize the people. We find the greatest obstacle in the excuses offered by the proponents of assimilation among us, who use different pretexts but are similar to the Jewish anti-Semites in Germany.</p>
   <p>Now is the time when every Jew must face the problems of the Jewish people, and either join their ranks or step outside. It doesn't make any difference under what excuse he refuses to fall in line with his people. He stands outside of his people, and does not want to be counted in their organization. By so doing, he reduces the effectiveness of the organization, and thereby indirectly helps the Jewish anti-Semites.</p>
