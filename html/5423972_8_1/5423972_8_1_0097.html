   <p>No author of detective stories did ever concoct such a well planned and nauseating crime as did two youngsters from two well-known Jewish families. All America is astonished, especially the Chicago Jews, to whose faith belongs the innocent victim and the two criminals, whose grandfathers fought in the German revolution in 1848 and whose fathers were elevated to prominence in the second largest city in America. Some of their relatives are famous for their wealth and interest in charity and social welfare. Young Loeb, and Leopold distinguished themselves in school and college. The entire world was laid open to them, prepared to give them influence, glory, and riches. The future was awaiting them, prepared to spread their path in life with sweet-scented flowers. What father and mother would not wish to have children like that, and raise them as they were raised?</p>

   <p>What was the cause of their ruin? What was that black, abominable mouse that gnawed on their humanity, their respectability, their responsibility, their moral sentiment?</p>
   <p>To this question there is only one answer. These two children were ruined by their riches. Everything they desired was within their reach. There was nothing that could excite them; they were never hungry, never went thirsty, never craved curiosity; they never had 'to put a finger in cold water' to satisfy their desires. Their riches trickled on their spirit.</p>
   <p>But the mind must have something to do, the young heart craves excitement, youth looks for color, emotions, and adventures. Well, all these longings for adventure ended in a brutal and criminal catastrophe.</p>
   <p>An object that costs nothing is worth nothing; anything you can get without working for it is worthless. Everything other children of their age dreamed of having they had without the least exertion. Things that others would consider themselves fortunate to have, was of no interest to them.</p>

   <p>They could learn nothing from those whom they associated with. They were sent to schools where they came in contact with their sort; children with well-built bodies, nice clothes, and poisoned souls. The work of their grandfathers who fought in barricades against the Prussian tyranny, who worked and planned, and fortified themselves in a new country, now ends in dark shadows. When their fantastic idea started to work on them, when their desires started to brew for excitement, little did they know that they were to find themselves in a frightful, fearful entanglement which may end in the gallows.</p>
   <p>They are not the first, neither will they be the last. Poor and rich destroy alike; one with the filthy nails of hopelessness, the other with the weight of gold squandered in luxuries.</p>
   <p>In fact, we sympathize with the parents of the two boys. Their grief is terrible and without limit. It is for this reason that we dislike the system in which the best capabilities and finest opportunities are being ground to dust, while crushing the life out of all natural sentiment, <span class="page-break">4</span>all human instinct. We meet their fathers this time at the same point. We all would sooner see our children die on the battlefield, for a good cause, than to see them choked on the gallows as criminals.</p>
   <p>Once more has the magnificent garden of capital exposed its poisonous, black flowers.</p>
