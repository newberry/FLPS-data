   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>I have the honor of submitting to you the following report of the West Side Religious School.</p>
   <p>The year now closing has been very successful, although the school has labored under many disadvantages. Since the building of the new freight terminal, the neighborhood has greatly changed. Many families that formerly occupied the blocks between Canal and Halsted Streets are now more comfortably housed as far west as Douglas Park. This has made a change in all school conditions. Some of the public schools, the Foster, the Dante and the Washburne, which formerly were crowded, have had to close rooms and new buildings have had to be erected farther west.</p>
   <p>The attendance fluctuates as it does in all religious schools. The children come because they are interested in the work offered, but the interruptions are many owing to the various school activities in the neighborhood. When one considers that the picture shows are very attractive and that entertainments are constantly being offered at Maxwell Street Settlement or Hull House, or Henry Booth House, or West Park No. 2, it is a surprising fact that so many little children come regularly for religious instruction.</p>
