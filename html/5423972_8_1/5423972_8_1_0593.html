   <p>Jewish Chicago - Then and Now. by Eugene Spivack.</p>
   <p>The Jewish life and the Jewish neighborhoods of Chicago are continually changing even before our eyes.</p>
   <p>We do not know whether there were any Jews in the early days of Chicago's founding. No records of any such first settlers have come down to us and we do not know the level of Jewish life existing at that time. Under the cloud of forgetfulness lies the childhood of Chicago Jewish life.</p>
   <p>However, there are several Jewish individuals who can recall very well the historical Chicago fire of 1871. There are many Jews who can recall Chicago in the 1880s when it began to grow again, and when Canal street became the main Jewish business street and when Jewish life concentrated itself around that street. There were the synagogues, Hebrew schools, the Jewish Theater, and there also was heard for the first time the free sayings of the radical street corner speaker who addressed the Jewish masses, which consisted of a large number of shop workers.</p>

   <p>Not a trace of this Jewish life on Canal street has remained. The district is covered with railroad tracks and the dominating sound is the constant panting of the locomotives.</p>
   <p>It is not so long ago since Ashland Blvd. was the main street of Chicago's bourgeoisie. To live on Ashland Blvd. in those days was equivalent to living on Michigan Blvd. today. Now the wealthy have moved and their homes have been preempted by the workingman.</p>
   <p>It was not so long age that the lower portion of the West Side, near the downtown district was densely populated with Jews. Now the streets of that district are being rapidly emptied of Jews, who are being replaced by Italians and various Slavic nationalities. An interesting observation - the Hebrew Institute, on Taylor and Lyttle streets, which six years ago was in the heart of the Jewish ghetto, is now the central point of the Italian population and one can see more Italian visitors than Jewish ones.</p>

   <p>It is only during the past 15 years that the lower West Side rich Jews began to move into the Lawndale district, and, in so short a time, they have successfully developed that beautiful neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Only a few years ago, the 12th Street car ended at Kedzie Ave. It did not pay to extend its service because of the thinness of the population. Now Kedzie and Roosevelt are smothered with Jews. It is the busiest street in Chicago, besides downtown. The entire Jewish life is concentrated in the Lawndale district.</p>
   <p>Also, the Jewish ghetto of the Northwest Side has moved, in the last five years, from the district centered around Division street and Milwaukee avenue to the Humboldt Park district. Their place was taken by Poles.</p>
