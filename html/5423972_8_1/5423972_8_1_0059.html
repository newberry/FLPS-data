Gatrert, superintendent, and Messrs. Henry Greenebaum, Charles Nosminsky, B. W. Seligman, W. Felsenthal, A. Moses, and J. L. Unna.

   <p>There were also received thirty-two cases of clothing, blankets, bedding, etc., which were distributed under the kind and excellent management of Mrs. Henry Greenebaum, Mrs. Charles Kosminsky, and Mrs. Adolph Moses.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Relief Association took active part in relieving the wants among the sufferers of its own nationality. The sum total of its receipts and disbursements is $18,000 in money and about $5,000 worth of clothing contributed by the Hebrews of Cincinnati. The largest portion of the money came from generous people from other cities, in sums from ten to two hundred dollars, but a portion was contributed by the different Hebrew societies composing the association. The St.Joseph Hospital on North La Salle Street, which was destroyed by the fire belonged to the United Hebrews. It will shortly be rebuilt. An active part was performed in disbursing the relief by J. Rosenthal, Esq.; Abraham Mart, president of the association; Philip Stein, its secretary and Nelson Morris, its treasurer.</p>
