   <p>The First Rumanian Congregation extends many thanks to all who participated in our Services of Canter Judah Zevee Cohen, with his sons, the Cohen Brothers. Their choir was excellent and we were all highly pleased with the Succoth Services. We wish the old Cantor loads of luck and many happy long years.</p>
   <p>We also take pleasure in notifying the public that the whole Succoth holiday services, will be conducted by the young talented Cantor and his choir. Tickets for this holiday may be obtained on Thursday and Friday at the Synagogue. The price of the tickets are, for men 50¢ and for women 25¢.</p>
