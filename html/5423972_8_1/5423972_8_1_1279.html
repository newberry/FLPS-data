   <p>Up to now it was probably unknown to the Jewish masses that the American Jewish Committee had sent, at the close of last year, a petition to the Pope in Rome requesting him to do what was in his power to stop the cruel persecution of Jews in Poland and Russia. Together with the petition, the American Jewish Committee also sent the Pope a book, which it had then published, describing the trials and tribulations of the Jews. In the petition, the committee expressed its conviction that the Pope certainly knew what was being done to Jews in those countries, and the hope that he would do something to halt the persecutions.</p>
   <p>As the petition was sent under the seal of secrecy, the answer of His Holiness came as a surprise. Cardinal Gaspari informs the Jewish Committee that the Pontificus Magnus of the Catholic Church acknowledges with profound interest the petition of the Jewish Committee in behalf of the three million American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Jews, but declares that the Pontiff knows nothing of the persecutions which are described. "But, as a loving father of humanity, and as head of the Catholic Church which possesses such glorious traditions," he says that all nations should unquestionably dwell in peace, and that it is wrong to persecute people because of their creed.</p>
   <p>Because the response from the Vatican speaks of the Pope's deep humanity and tenderheartedness and tolerance, the Vatican has obviously sent this message to the world. And thus the whole world now knows that the three million Jews in America petitioned the Pope in behalf of their persecuted brethren in Poland and Russia; that the Pope himself knew nothing of the persecutions, and that it is [his belief that it is] absolutely wrong to persecute people because of their religious beliefs.</p>
   <p>The American Jewish Committee had, without a doubt, the best intentions when it sent the petition to the Pope. It had even congratulated itself upon the idea. And it did prove to be helpful--to the Pope, but not to the Jews. The Poles <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and the Russians will thank him for not having known anything about the persecution of Jews, and the reminder to the world that in Rome there is seated a Pontificus Magnus who is sympathetic, tolerant and humane also amounts to something.</p>
   <p>As has been said, no criticism can be brought against the Jewish Committee because it certainly meant well, and after all, no harm has been done. But if the whole action is not a characteristic piece of benighted thinking, we do not know how else to designate it. The mediator sets forth on his mission and performs his duty. Perhaps it will be beneficial. If so, he is credited with an important achievement. If not--well, so he did not succeed, but his intention was good.</p>
   <p>With all due respect to the Pope as head of the largest Church in the world, we doubt very much whether the appointed delegates of Americans Jewry should have come forth with such a petition officially in the name of three million Jews, when it is clear to every intelligent man that the Pope cannot help in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>any way in this matter. Could anyone have expected the Pope to tell the Catholic Poles, "Do not persecute the Jews, you murderers." "I know nothing about the persecutions," was the diplomatic response, which was very beneficial to the Catholic Church. We, however, could have done without it.</p>
