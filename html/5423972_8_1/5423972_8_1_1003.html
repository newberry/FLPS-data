   <p>We are very glad to note that the Independent Order B'nai B'rith, through its Executive Committee, decided at a meeting held in Memphis on April 19 to put an end to its indifference to what is going on in Palestine. For a number of years now the Independent Order B'nai B'rith has taken the curious position that on so vital a question as Zionism it preferred to be neutral. But its neutrality meant the exclusion of discussion of Zionism from the lodge room. Now, in response to a widespread demand, the Executive Committee has decided to raise a fund of $25,000, which will be used for the building of houses in Palestine. The fund is to be collected from the lodges of the Order and is to remitted to Palestine to be expended under the supervision of the Jerusalem lodge. We take this action to mean that hereafter, at B'nai B'rith meetings, discussion of the subject of Zionism will be permissible and members who desire to introduce the question will not feel as if they are acting contrary to <span class="page-break">\2</span>official policy. The action taken will meet with general approval in B'nai B'rith circles, for the request that a more favorable attitude be taken toward Zionism came from the rank and file of the Order, who are not immune to the Zionist inspiration. As a matter of fact, the membership of the Order is now wholly different from what it was fifteen or twenty years ago. It represents in many cities all elements of the community, where formerly it represented only one element. The new elements that have come in, in so far as they have Jewish interests, are strongly concerned for the future of the Jewish people and all currents of Jewish opinion find reflection in their thinking. The Executive Committee, which persisted in keeping the lid down, were doing a great injury to the Order, which could have become one of the most influential Jewish organizations in America. We have no doubt that the new policy will bring about a general revival of interest in the B'nai B'rith organization. The Order is to be congratulated.</p>
