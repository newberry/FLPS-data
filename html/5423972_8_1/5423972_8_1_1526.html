   <p>The question of the relatively small attendance at the Sunday services was brought up for discussion and it was the sense of some of the members present that it was attributable in a large measure to the length of the services. Accordingly, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
   <p>Resolved: That it is the sense of the Board that the attendance at the Sunday services will be materially increased by so arranging them as to conclude the same not later than 12 o'clock noon.</p>
