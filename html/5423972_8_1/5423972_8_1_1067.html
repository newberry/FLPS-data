   <p>The Hebraists of Chicago have very good memories. They remember, for instance, that once upon a time, a man by the name of David Frishman lived, and that it would be no more than right to hold a memorial meeting for David Frishman. The memorial meeting, as I understand it, will take place next Saturday evening in the Talmud Torah of the Congregation Kehilath Jacob.</p>
   <p>I have nothing against a memorial meeting being held at a Talmud Torah, but David Frishman, that fine spirit, poet, and artist, deserves to have a memorial meeting held for him in the most beautiful hall of a downtown hotel, rather than in a forsaken corner of the ghetto. However, a person should have some sense of the fitness of things, and my Hebraist colleagues of Chicago do not always display tact or good taste.</p>
