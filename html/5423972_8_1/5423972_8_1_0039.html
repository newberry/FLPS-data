   <p>The noble relief work that has been conducted on the West Side by Mr. Kopperl, Mr. Kalis and others, was discontinued on Thursday, for lack of funds. This band of Jews who devoted time and money to relieving the distress of all who applied for aid, made no distinction of race or creed.</p>
   <p>On the last day, tickets were given out for 3,820 families, consisting of 4,960 adults, 10,622 children. The number of families relieved were 36,756, consisting of 43,794 adults and 68,714 children, a total of 112,508 persons.</p>
   <p>While this station was primarily established in behalf of needy Jews, but a very small proportion of the applicants were of that faith. There were Germans, Russians, Poles, Swedes, Slavs, in fact representatives from every country on the continent. The vast majority of those applying were Bohemians. About 2 per cent of the total were Jews.</p>
