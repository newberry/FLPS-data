   <p>Report of the Building Committee.</p>
   <p>The argument has been advanced that as the drift of habitation was to so large an extent southward at the present time, that it might be a wise plan to sell our present building and erect a new structure. So far as the locality is concerned, in the judgement of your Board and Committee, it is believed that our present site is perhaps as good a location as can be secured, notwithstanding the fact that the great majority of our members are quite distant from our building.</p>
