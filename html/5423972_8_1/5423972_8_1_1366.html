   <p>Yesterday, the city of Chicago paid final honors to Woodrow Wilson. All work stopped for one minute at three o'clock in the afternoon, in all stores, shops, and factories. The movement of trains, streetcars, elevated, and private automobiles stopped for one minute. The performances in all the theaters were stopped for one minute at three o'clock in the afternoon. Dozens of memorial meetings were held in various parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Memorial meetings took place last night in many synagogues of the city. The synagogues, in spite of the cold weather, were crowded with men and women. Rabbis and speakers addressed all meetings. The cantors sang the "Prayer for the Dead" and read some chapters from the Psalms. Appropriate resolutions were adopted and sent to Washington, to the family of the dead friend of Israel and of humanity, Woodrow Wilson.</p>
