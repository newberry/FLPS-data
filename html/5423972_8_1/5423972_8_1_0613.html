   <p>A few days ago Arthur Brisbane, the popular columnist of the Hearst press published an article in which he discusses the reason why Jews are hated. After treating the matter at length, he arrives at the conclusion that Jews are disliked because of their knowledge. Jews know more than non-Jews, because theirs is an earlier civilization than other peoples'.</p>
   <p>This answer by Mr. Brisbane to one of the most difficult and complicated problems in the world's history, proves the nobility of thought of the great columnist, but the answer in itself is not adequate because it is not the only possible answer to the question. It is true that in a certain sense Jews know more about the secret forces of life, but a people is not hated and persecuted, as we have been, because of its wider knowledge. The ancient Greeks, in many respects, knew more than we did; they were superior to us in science and philosophy, in art and politics, especially in the art of enjoying life, and yet the Greeks were not detested.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian people of today are the most enlightened and advanced. The average one of them "knows" much more than does the average member of other groups, yet the Scandinavians are not loathed nor persecuted. It is similarly not true that the Germans are hated because they know proportionately more than the other great nations. When the world bears malice toward a people, it has definite reasons. More or less knowledge has very little to do with the hatred of a people. It may often happen that a people will be envied for its advanced culture, but a great abyss separates a theoretical envy from an actual hatred.</p>
   <p>There is an entirely different reason for the aversion of the peoples of Europe to the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>The next thing to be considered is that hatred against the Jews exists only where there are great numbers of Jews. In countries where only a small number of Jews live, there isn't the slightest sign of antagonism toward them. This proves that the reason for the hatred against us is not an academic, theoretical one, but a practical, sociological one. This is important to establish because this fact is contrary to the assertion of writers like Brisbane--that the hatred against us is purely of a theoretical nature based on the question of more or less knowledge.</p>
   <p>Enough books to fill libraries have been written on the subject. Everyone who considered this question failed to see the simple cause; i. e., a human being is naturally intolerant and subjective. This applies to the individual, as well as to the group. When the individual, even though theoretically tolerant, sees that an acquaintance has an alien pattern of life, which to his way of thinking is wrong, he becomes furious. What is true of the individual is also true of a people, of a race, of mankind.</p>
   <p>The Jews are hated for a thousand reasons, but all of them spring from only one source--they have their own way of life. We Jews are the "bolsheviks" in the history of the world when we consider the obstinacy with which we have followed our own pattern of life, regardless of whether or not that pattern was popular with the other nations of the world. Our religion, our ethics, our concept of life and the world, our actions, as a result of this unique concept of life vary as much from the religion, ethic and concept of life of other nations, as the bolshevik theory of politics and economics from a citizen's concept of them. Mankind does not love a people who walk their own way, and when that people is obstinate, disregarding the opinion of others, then this obstinacy evokes violent hatred.</p>
   <p>The best explanation for the hatred toward Jews was given by Haman: "Their religion, laws and concept of life differ from those of other peoples", meaning that the Jews have the "audacity" to adhere to their own mode of life.</p>
   <p>In ancient times, when the whole of mankind were idol-worshippers and everyone was steeped in polytheism, the Jews were strictly monotheistic--believing in one spiritual God. Later, when Christianity first made its appearance, as a poor compromise between polytheism and monotheism, the Jews remained true to their original religion. This was bitterly resented by the other peoples of the world. For the last two thousand years their maxim has been that a nation must live within a state. We have lived two thousand years without a state and yet have not perished. They claim that might is right. We say that right is might. In short, though we don't agree with them, we still exist. They, the majority, cannot submerge us. The majority always has a burning wrath for the obstinate and for the minority which stands by its principles, because the majority is never tolerant. Its will must serve as law, and we, who are unwilling to submit to its will, are placed therefore outside the law. This is its act of vengeance for our reluctance to submit to its will.</p>
   <p>We are hated because as a people and as a culture group, we follow our own path in life, and we will be despised as long as we continue to go our own way. That means that we will be eternally discriminated against, for we shall exist forever and eternally remain Jews. Thus, not because we know more, but because we are Jews, are we hated.</p>
