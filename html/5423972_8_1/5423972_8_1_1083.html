   <p>Mr. Nachum Sokolow and his associates will arrive in Chicago on March fourteenth, and honor us with their presence ten or twelve days. The Chicago Jews, always hospitable and generous, will no doubt extend to them a cordial reception, and we assume that various Jewish organizations in the city will vie with one another in convincing Mr. Sokolow and his associates of their hospitality and generosity. But what is the Orthodox Jewish community of Chicago going to do in the way of paying its respects to Nachum Sokolow, one of the greatest Jews of our time, and his associates, the leaders of the World Zionist Organization? Are the Chicago Orthodox going to act as a distinct group, or will they just participate in the various receptions and affairs individually and do no more?</p>
   <p>We believe that it is the duty of the Chicago Orthodox Jews to act as a group and to give an official reception to Mr. Sokolow and his associates as a group. We believe it to be their duty to act that way, because after all, it will be the Orthodox Jews in Chicago who will first be called upon to give for the Keren Hayesod, and who will be the main givers. It can already be taken for granted that the so-called Reformed Jews will not contribute one farthing towards the Keren Hayesod. There is a silent boycott going on against the Keren Hayesod, and this boycott is in full swing. The so-called German Jews, carrying on their silent boycott against the Keren Hayesod, will surely not go out of their way to receive Mr. Sokolow and his associates, nor are the radicals expected to do it, for the radicals are also participating in a boycott against the Keren Hayesod, and will do nothing to help rebuild Palestine. The main financial burden will have to be carried by the Orthodox Jews, or at least by those who are not in sympathy with reform or radicalism.</p>
   <p>One can easily imagine that both factions will watch very closely the achievements of the Orthodox in the field of financing Zionism. They will want to find out what the Orthodox are actually able of accomplishing. It is for the first time that the Orthodox Jews in America have to act independently of both Jewish factions, and must work on their own hook just because the others refuse to participate. Nothing is more indicative of the moral strength of a group of people than its ability to make great sacrifices for a certain cause. Both the Reformers and the radicals are still in doubt as to the virility and strength of Orthodoxy. Now they will have the opportunity to find out how strong and resourceful Orthodoxy is in America, and especially in Chicago, where the Orthodox are supposed to be very strong. Since the Keren Hayesod proposition is now in the main up to the Orthodox, the response to the Keren Hayesod appeal will enable the others to measure Orthodox strength and Orthodox enthusiasm. If the Orthodox fail in their efforts, then they only reveal their impotency and invite the disrespect of their antagonists, but if they are successful in their efforts to raise large sums for the Keren Hayesod, they strengthen considerably their own position, and they invite the respect and arouse the esteem of their antagonists. It is for this reason alone that Orthodoxy in America, and especially Orthodoxy in Chicago, that is supposed to be Orthodox should act as a unit, and should make it their business to raise as much money as possible and to give Mr. Sokolow and his associates as cordial a reception as possible.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the various Orthodox Congregations in Chicago should undertake to raise certain sums from the members of the Congregation, and all contributions from all the Orthodox Congregations in Chicago should be presented to Mr. Sokolow as the contribution of the Chicago Orthodox Jewish community towards the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>We hope that the heads of the various Chicago Jewish Orthodox Congregations will accept our suggestion and act on it quickly. The time is short and a great cause is at stake.</p>
