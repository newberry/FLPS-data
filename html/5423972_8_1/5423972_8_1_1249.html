   <p>The Independent Order, Brith Abraham, the largest Jewish order in the world, at its annual convention, held June 3 and 4, adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Independent Order Brith Abraham had, at its annual convention in 1913 and later in 1915, given its approval and recognition to the Zionist program, and had urged its members to render financial and moral support to the Zionist movement, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Recent events encouraged several large powers in Europe to take interest in a practical solution to the Jewish problem and aid in building a Jewish home in Palestine, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The success of this depends largely on the determination and will of the Jewish people to offer sacrifices for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Be it, therefore, resolved that we, delegates to the convention, representing 200,000 Jews, shall renew our belief in the Zionist ideal, the hope of our forefathers, and our present hope, and</p>
   <p>Be it, further, resolved, to support the Zionist organization in the achievement of any possible plan proposed, which will lead to the building of a Jewish home in Palestine.</p>
