   <p>If the Jews of Chicago continue to manifest their present indifference to the Zionist convention, which should be an historic event, they will only justify the opinion of those New York Zionists who were opposed to holding the convention in Chicago because they had very little confidence in the enthusiasm and willingness of the Jewish masses in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Within a week the convention will be opened in Chicago, but in the Jewish neighborhoods of Chicago very little preparation can be seen for a gala reception for the convention; there is very little convention atmosphere. Perhaps the convention committee can be partly blamed because it devoted so much time to technical and financial problems, such as securing advertisements for the souvenir book, etc., and so little time to the enlightenment <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the Jews of Chicago as to the importance of the convention. The convention committee depended upon the Jewish press to perform the latter task, but did not supply the Jewish press with enough material to enable it to keep the reader aware of what was going on, to keep him well informed, and to arouse his interest in the convention. The program of the convention has not yet been published, and even the most active Zionists of Chicago do not know what the main features of the convention will be, nor what message the Zionist leaders will bring. The agenda of the convention should have been made known at least a month before the opening of the convention so that the most active Zionists would, at least, know the position they should take on certain important problems.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, this still does not excuse the indifference of the Chicago Jews to this great forthcoming event.</p>
   <p>The representatives of various districts should have accomplished much more than they did in the way of enlightenment. Every district should have <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>concentrated all of its energy upon intensive propaganda in its respective neighborhood, and the convention committee should have issued an appeal to the Jews of Chicago to contribute to the success of the convention by manifesting a greater interest in this fateful Zionist assembly which is to be held in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is still not too late to do this work. We demand of the convention committee that it devote less time to technical problems and more time and effort to the enlightenment of the Jewish masses of Chicago regarding the importance of the convention. This will help to make the convention a grand success.</p>
