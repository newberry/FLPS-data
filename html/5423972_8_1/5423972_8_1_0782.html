   <p>There is an overcrowded and congested condition prevailing in the schools in the Douglas Park Jewish neighborhood. A large percentage of children of Jewish and other nationalities are given only half days schooling. Such is the present condition in the West Side schools. The fast growing Jewish population in the Douglas Park area is the cause of this school congestion.</p>
   <p>The School Board Committee visited the district and made a survey of the situation. The public is expecting an early decision of the School Board with regards to additional buildings. The Board is considering two propositions, one is to build new buildings on the play ground lot and the other is to build on to the present buildings.</p>
   <p>The Committee spent three hours in the neighborhood studying the rapid growth of the Jewish population in Douglas Park. The following gentlemen are on this Committee: Messrs. Lipoky, Bennett, Harding Coster, Setness and Larson.</p>
