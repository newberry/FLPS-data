   <p>A message to our new immigrant Jews.</p>
   <p>You are now amongst us, in the land you so ardently wished to be in and in which you have strived to settle as an equal and free person to work, and enjoy the fruits of your labor and struggle. You are now amongst us - your sisters and brothers - who have suffered jointly with you when the sword of destruction and ghastly hunger faced you. In those horrible days, our great masses became active in the rescue work. We have tirelessly harnessed every effort to save you from the hand of the pogrom inciters. We sounded the alarm daily in the Jewish neighborhoods in order to get aid for you and we received aid according to our strength.</p>
   <p>You are now far from that valley of misery. Now you are secure, peaceful, and satisfied. But, in these very moments you must remember the hundreds and thousands of our sisters and brothers, who remained there. They must have urged you to help them upon your arrival here. We call upon you not to betray them.</p>
   
   <p>We, therefore, request your presence at a special meeting of all new immigrants, Thursday, June 16th, in the Labor Lyceum, Kedzie and Ogden. There we will discuss further activities, to help our sisters and brothers. Bring your friends.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours</p>
   <p>Peoples Relief Committee.</p>
