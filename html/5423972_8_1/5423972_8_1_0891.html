   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald, noted Jewish philanthropist, was authorized by the Jewish social leaders to represent them (at the Republican Convention) and submit a plank to the Republican Platform concerning American passports in Europe. The plank reads as follows:</p>
   <p>The transactions of the President and Congress, by breaking the treaty of 1832 with Russia, is heartily approved as a testimonial that all American citizens are equal. From now on, all treaties, between our government and any foreign government, shall be expressly written guaranteeing the full rights to all foreigners and opposing any limitations against our citizens, regardless of religion, race, or previous citizenship.</p>

   <p>Mr. Rosenwald is now working with the Illinois delegation in order to carry through this plank for the assurance of future American treaties with Russia, which shall enable the Jews to travel there without fearing the Russian laws.</p>
