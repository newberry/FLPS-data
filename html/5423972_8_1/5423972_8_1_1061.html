   <p>The United Orthodox Jewish Congregations of Chicago have decided to collect a vast sum of money for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer for the World Zionist Organization]. The representatives of this organization figure that they can raise a quarter of a million dollars and have the best part of the cash ready upon the arrival of Dr. Weizmann. Inasmuch as the last year's contribution of the Orthodox Synagogues (sic) of Chicago to the Keren Hayesod was twenty-three thousand dollars, the determination to raise a quarter of a million dollars this year means that either the men heading the synagogues have come to a realization of their duty or that they are exaggerating matters and over-estimating their own strength. We believe that they are doing both. On the one hand they realize that the sum of twenty-three thousand dollars as the contribution of the Chicago Orthodoxy to the Keren Hayesod is insignificant and on the other hand they are over-estimating their strength when they believe that they will be in <span class="page-break">2</span>a position to raise such a vast amount of money from among their constituencies. It is, however, feasible and possible to raise the sum of seventy-five to one hundred thousand dollars from the Chicago Orthodoxy for the Keren Hayesod, but to do that a good organization is necessary to do the work, and this organization is not yet in sight.</p>
   <p>We believe that by this time all the membership of the Orthodox Synagogues in Chicago must be in the neighborhood of from seven to eight thousand and there is no reason whatsoever why each and every member should not donate at least ten dollars for the Keren Hayesod. There are also thousands of Orthodox Jews in Chicago who, for reasons of their own, are not affiliated with any synagogue, but that attend synagogues from time to time, and they are well known to the synagogue leaders. Many of these men are well to do and in course (sic) of a drive they, too, should be impelled to make their contributions for the Keren Hayesod. It is therefore no exaggeration (sic) to say that the sum of seventy-five to one hundred thousand dollars could be gotten for the Keren Hayesod, on condition that an organization be established for these funds. We also believe <span class="page-break">3</span>that an organization can be established if the leaders of the synagogues are satisfied to closely cooperate with the Keren Hayesod office in Chicago. We believe that a committee of two hundred, consisting of all the president (sic) and vice-presidents and some members of all the synagogues must be called into being to carry out part of the resolution adopted at the recent meeting by the representatives of the United Orthodox Congregations. These two hundred members must devote at least two weeks time to the task of soliciting and collecting the money. If a drive on such a schedule should be organized, it will be found that thousands of Jews in Chicago who have Orthodox leanings would contribute to the Keren Hayesod and it would also be found that there are thousands of Jews in Chicago who have never heard of the Keren Hayesod at all and who, however, if approached in the right spirit, will not refuse to support it.</p>
   <p>The total subscription list of the Keren Hayesod in Chicago does not exceed three thousand names. Among these three thousand names there are any number of men and women who are not Orthodox. It is safe to assume that only two thirds of all the Chicago donors to the Keren Hayesod either belong to Orthodox Congregations <span class="page-break">4</span>or are Orthodox in sentiment, but there are in Chicago from seven to eight thousand Jews who are affiliated with Orthodox Synagogues and most of the members of the synagogues are not poor people. A poor man cannot belong to the synagogue because the membership is very costly. It is not only a question of annual dues but of occasional donations too, and only men who are somewhat settled in life can afford to be members of a Congregation, so that those Chicago Jews who are affiliated with the Orthodox Congregations can afford to give something for the Keren Hayesod too, and the only task before the representatives of the United Orthodox Congregations is to reach these people, to explain them (sic) the situation, and to tell them what their duty is. There is no doubt in our mind that ninety out of one hundred will do their duty if given the proper explaination (sic) and being (sic) told what is at stake. There is also no doubt in our mind that if the leaders of the Orthodox Congregations were to sit down and figure out what they can achieve and what they cannot achieve in the course of a drive and if they were to figure out what forces there are at their disposal to participate in this drive, that they would raise a vast amount of money and would quadruple their last years (sic) quota, but if they mean to <span class="page-break">5</span>raise a quarter of a million dollars, they will raise very little, because this figure testifies to the fact that the representatives of the Orthodox Congregations of Chicago are not fighting right and are not approaching the solution of the problem in a business-like way.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why we are not so enthusiastic about the resolution and why we are not so optimistic as to the possibilities of carrying out the resolution. Let the Orthodox representatives face the reality (sic) as it is. Let them find out what they can do, and let them only do that which is possible to be done (sic).</p>
