   <p>A group of arrogant young men, who call themselves I. W. W.'s are beginning to practice their old tricks of aggravating the Jewish people and poking fun at God. These young men have arranged a ball for Yom Kipur night in the Workers' Institute.</p>
   <p>They have deluged the Jewish district with "literature" about their Kol Nidre ball. The Jewish masses have contemptuously denounced this insolent action on the part of these young men; they have protested the action of the Workers' Institute in renting a hall for this purpose.</p>
   <p>When Mr. [A.] Tobinson of the Workers' Institute was asked why he was permitting the most sacred sentiments of the Jewish people to be trampled upon, he replied that he had already rented the hall for Yom Kipur and that he could not retract his decision. He also said that the Workers' Institute could not discriminate <span class="page-break">\2</span>against anyone--apparently, not even against insolent ruffians who only seek to create scandal.</p>
