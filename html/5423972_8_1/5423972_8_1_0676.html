   <p>Next Tuesday, Oct. 17, is the last registration day for the coming elections.</p>
   <p>Citizens registering next Tuesday will have a voice in the coming election, when it will be decided who shall be the next president, who the governor of the state and many other public officials.</p>
   <p>Naturally, when a citizen fails to register, he is deprived of the privilege to vote, which means that he will not have the slightest say in the new administration of federal and state governments.</p>
   <p>A citizen who registers at the primaries, fulfills his duty as citizen and resident of this country. It shows that he appreciates his citizenship and makes use of all the privileges given him by the constitution of the United States. It also shows that he is a patriot of this country, and that he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>likes to see the country progressing. If one administration is not satisfactory, he can vote it out, preventing it from remaining in power, and electing in its stead one fulfilling its duties and promises to the citizens.</p>
   <p>Any citizen registering but not voting neglects his duty as such, and his action is considered unpatriotic. He, therefore, has no moral right to complain about an administration failing in its duties and promises. Such a citizen is not a live part of the body of American society, but a dead member partly attached to the body to which it belongs.</p>
   <p>There are many who give various reasons for their negligence to vote, claiming that they don't believe in the principles of a certain party or that they have no confidence in a certain ticket.</p>
   <p>When this is analyzed it shows how groundless these reasons are, for no one in this country is forced to vote for any given party. If one is not in accord with the Democratic administration, one has the privilege to vote for the Republican ticket, and should both tickets not be to one's liking, one may <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>vote for the Socialist or any other ticket of one's choice.</p>
   <p>But if registering and voting is a duty of citizens in general, it is more so in the case of the Jew, because by fulfilling this duty he shows how highly appreciative and respectful he is to the Constitution of this country, which proclaims equality of political and citizen's rights, things of which he was deprived in the unfriendly countries of Europe from which he emigrated.</p>
   <p>The trouble with many of us is that we possess too short a memory. We forget the slavery in which we were kept in the European countries, and it seems to us that we were always free citizens and therefore have no duties in this country to guard and defend our citizen's and political rights.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish citizen must always remember, and cherish as a great day, the day, when he received his naturalization papers, for on that day he became a live member of our great American Nation. He should praise the Lord for bringing the Jews to the shores of America where they enjoy equality among all other nationalities from the four corners of the earth, under the protection of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the "Stars and Stripes."</p>
   <p>It would be a great injustice and ingratitude to the country, the Constitution, and all our free institutions if we would show our appreciation for the marvelous gift of free citizenship given us by neglecting to vote.</p>
   <p>The vote is the most powerful weapon that the Jew possesses in this country. He can command respect and defend himself against his enemies. And most of all, it is a remedy to combat his foes, who are afraid of his vote, being forced therefore to leave him in peace.</p>
   <p>And so, we appeal to the Jews, as citizens, reminding them that if they consider themselves true and worthy patriots of this country, it is their duty to register next Tuesday, Oct. 17th, so that they may vote in the coming elections.</p>
