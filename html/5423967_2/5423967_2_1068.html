   <p>At Wieboldt's Department store, Milwaukee and Paulina, there are working about ten Russians. In one of the departments of this store the cashier is a Russian lady from Moscow.</p>
   <p>A Russian workman assures us that there are even considerably more Russians working at Wieboldt's, but they are scattered in various departments of the store, and sometimes newly hired Russian workmen do not know that many Russians are working in this store.</p>
