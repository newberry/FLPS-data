   <p>This is the third time that we write about the permanent Russian theatre. We have found out from definite sources that the mistaken course of the theatre is being changed.</p>
   <p>The theatre is re-organizing along entirely different lines, this on the basis of an honest, modest Russian theatrical enterprise.</p>
   <p>So, at least we believe we have now in our colony at the head of the administration a person with a good theatrical name, Mr. Klekner. The name of Klekner is familiar to the theatrical colony of Chicago, both for his parts in plays, and for his staging of them.</p>
   <p>Beginning next week our Russian permanent theatre will appear before the Chicago public in a re-organized form. From next week, plays of a Russian repertoire will be performed. A. P. Chekhov, the great Russian <span class="page-break">2</span>author and dramatist, will open the season period. On Monday and Tuesday "The Bear" will be performed. On Wednesday and Thursday, "The Proposal"; on Friday and Saturday, matinee and evenings, the four-act play, "The Living Corpses," which made a big hit in Russia, will be performed, the author of which is A. Evdokimov.</p>
