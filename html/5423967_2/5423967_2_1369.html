   <p>On Saturday, May 9, the Chicago Stadium will present the Festival of Dances. After preliminary contests, in which several hundred dancers competed, only twenty-three girls and twelve boys were chosen to appear in the Festival. Among these, chosen as the best dancers, we find the names of two Russian girls, Anastasiya Lialush and Anna Cherepachevich, who have appeared a number of times to entertain [our] Russian people by dancing at functions arranged by our newspaper and by other Russian organizations.</p>
