   <p>The commissars are now the actual government of Russia; the Soviets, the organs of government. As soon as tsarism was overthrown they re-appeared supporting the needs of the masses. Power came into the hands of the workers and peasants. The Soviets were more democratic than the government of Lvov and Kerensky. The more the Provisional government went to the right, the more the Soviets went leftward. The Soviets destroyed Kornilov and the Provisional government.</p>
   <p>The Soviets won not because of Lenin and Trotsky, but because they freed and awakened Russia. If there were no Soviets the government of Russia would be despotism. The Soviets come from the people. The Bolsheviks would be nothing without the Soviets. They are an expression of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>popular will and are the most democratic form of government on earth. The Soviets do not depend on the Bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>No political party has today any strength. Many revolutionists throughout the world fear revolution itself. But the revolution saved Russia.</p>
   <p>Through these organs the Russian people itself shapes its life.</p>
