   <p>In Congress the question of breaking off diplomatic relations with Russia was raised. In connection with this the Bolsheviks are sounding an alarm. The Bolshevik press is full of agitation in defense of the USSR and the peace-pursuing policy; and war has been declared against the Hearst papers, because they daringly oppose the Bolshevik regime. These [Hearst] papers now print serial articles by T. Walker, in which he states that Russia is afflicted with widespread famine, and many people are dying from starvation. The Bolsheviks, however, assert that there is no hunger in the land of the Soviet, for there was a bountiful harvest in 1933, and the harvest of 1934 exceeded the norms set by the government statistical bureau. Such evidence the Bolsheviks submit to disprove what Walker states. But, it would be quite proper to ask them: At whose disposal do the peasants harvest; do they dispose of it of their own accord or do the Bolsheviks control it?</p>
   <p>Shouts of the local Bolsheviks raised in their press and at meetings once more confirm the moral bankruptcy of Bolshevism. They are trying to bring pressure to bear upon the United States government in order that it may continue unbroken its diplomatic relations [with Russia]. They shout, threaten, curse, and beg the Government. All this noise only proves that they are just Stalin's blind tools, and nothing else. It is unthinkable that the Government should pay any attention to the Bolshevik hysteria and ballyhoo. It would be just right if the United States government should break off every form of relations with the Bolshevik government and the political adventures that constitute their regime. They exist in Russia only because they were recognized by most of the capitalistic countries. Had it not been for the support they received from the outside, their regime in Russia would have been overthrown a long time ago.</p>
   <p>At a meeting in New York some "proletarian woman" donated a diamond ring, and another, a watch, in defense of the Bolshevik dictatorship. Such things as these, the proletarian ladies with gold watches and diamond rings, are giving of their valuables for the purpose of spreading Bolshevik propaganda.</p>
