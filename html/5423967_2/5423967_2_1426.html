   <p>Last Tuesday there was a meeting of the Pushkin Committee. Delegates of Wood Street, Leavitt Street, and other organizations were present. I. I. Voronko notified the Committee about the negotiations with Americans regarding the presentation of the Pushkin Opera "Eugene Onegin" on Memorial Day.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Opera Company is ready to comply with the wishes of the Russian colony in that regard. The honoring of A. Pushkin, according to the opinion of the majority of the Committee, should not be limited to the Opera only, and the Committee plans to have a special evening of merriment in the Russian colony, dedicated to the Jubilee. The Committee has rejected the recommendation of having this Jubilee in conjunction with the Bolshevik organizations.</p>
