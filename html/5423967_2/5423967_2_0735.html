   <p>On the pages of the Saturday is sue of the Daily News, one of the large Chicago newspapers, there appeared a notice containing a very serious accusation against the Russian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The statement is made that in the radical circles of the Chicago Russian colony there are many persons hired by the German government who, being controlled by that government, openly make propaganda among the Russians for the idea of a separate peace with Germany.</p>
   <p>The influence of this propaganda is so destructive, so it is said further in the notice, - that it is to be considered as a greater danger, a greater harm than explosions of munition plants producing munitions for Russia.</p>
   <p>Information about this propaganda, says the newspaper, has been <span class="page-break">2</span>received from the local Secret Service and from one "Russian revolutionist" who visits all Russian meetings....</p>
   <p>We consider it to be our duty to answer this notice, because it throws discredit on the Russian immigrants of Chicago in the eyes of the American public, and because it disfigures the truth. We want to discuss briefly the question as to whether it is true that an energetic propaganda in favor of a separate peace with Germany is being carried on in the Russian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In as far as we have been able to make observations in our multifarious contact with representative members of the Russian colony at public and private meetings, the voices advocating a separate peace with Germany are so feeble and insignificant that they do not attract <span class="page-break">3</span>anybody's attention. There is no need of talking about any energetic activities directed towards this aim. It is sufficient to point out the fact that not a single meeting advocating a separate peace has been held, nor has a single Russian pamphlet of such a character been published.</p>
   <p>On the contrary, we observe just the opposite. The overwhelming majority of the Chicago Russians hate the German government to such an extent, because of its cruel way of conducting the war, that any talk about the necessity of concluding a separate peace with Germany arouses only protest and indignation in the heart of every Russian.</p>
   <p>We believe that if an inquest would be made as to this subject in the Chicago Russian colony, the result would be a most unfavorable one for Germany.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>On the other hand we think that if it had been proved that certain members of the Chicago Russian colony are agents of the German government, such persons would have fared very badly. And this is easily understood.</p>
   <p>The Russian colony in America lives at the present time by the same things which are the vital issues in Russia.</p>
   <p>And Russia, by the mouth of even its most radical representatives, such as Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Kerensky, the Social-Revolutionary Party and the Soviet of Workmen's Deputies, - has declared itself decisively against a separate peace with Germany.</p>
   <p>On the contrary, Russia has resolved to continue the war "until the policy of the German government towards all countries is changed."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This view has been expressed quite recently by the Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom), organ of the Russian Social-Revolutionists.</p>
   <p>On our own behalf we may add the following: there can be no talk about a separate peace with Germany as long as German militarism remains such a terrible threat to all European states; as long as free Russia is threatened by an invasion of the monstrous German army; as long as Germany will not renounce the predatory, grabbing policy towards all the nations involved in the present war.</p>
   <p>We are sure not to be mistaken if we say that all the Russian colony will support this our view. As far as we know, even the most extreme internationalists are in favor of provoking a revolution in Germany in order that the war would be stopped. Even they do not talk a bout a separate peace with Germany.</p>
