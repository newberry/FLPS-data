   <p>When I was a boy and attended school, our teacher told us that all the people who lived in our great mother country, Russia, were not Christians; there were heathens there also. The teacher, as I still distinctly remember, told us that spiritual leaders, earnestly and zealously, continue to preach the Gospel among these heathen people. Many of these heathens have since been converted to Christianity, but they still retain their idols to use in the event of a misfortune. In such unfortunate moments, they pull their idols out of hidden pockets, and flagellate them because a misfortune has occurred.</p>
   <p>At that time, I could not understand how people could believe in idols after they had become Christians. Up to the year 1935, I did not believe this; finally, I saw some idols, with my own eyes--not in the primeval forests of Siberia, but here, in Chicago, in the center of the most civilized country [in the world]. A Bolshevik had invited me to celebrate <span class="page-break">2</span>the arrival of the New Year with him. When the time came, I took my wife and children to the Bolshevik's home. As soon as we entered the house, my attention was drawn to the pictures which lined the walls. I was astonished to see that most of those pictures were portraits of the Bolshevik leaders, drawn in different postures. Among them, I saw Lenin, sitting, standing; Lenin, with extended hand, pointing a threatening finger at the mob. There were Stalin, Molotov, Zinoviev, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Voroshilov on horseback, and other Bolshevik idols, who still continue to slaughter the Russian people. I looked further and saw that our Bolshevik had a Christmas tree, decorated with angels and figures of Santa Claus at the top. I took my seat at the table, on which there was a box. I looked in the box and saw some Christmas greeting cards. Christ was portrayed on them, resting in a cradle. A star shed its white light on the Infant, angels were on guard all-around. I asked the Bolshevik's boy if papa had mailed any of those cards to his friends. "Yes," said the boy, "papa sent out about two dozen of them." It's true that Mr. Deviatkin does not believe in Christ and His teachings. It all seems <span class="page-break">3</span>very strange, but it is also true that our Bolsheviks believe in gods and worship the idols of the Kremlin.</p>
