   <p>For a long time for the majority of us, the Russian woman of our colony was a sphinx.</p>
   <p>We knew very well that a remarkable Russian woman, Ekaterina Ivanovna Breshkovskaya, had visited Chicago about three times.</p>
   <p>We knew that there had lived here for a long time Maria Shkolnik, who had written a book in English.</p>
   <p>Many of us have seen that most talented Russian dancer, Anna Pavlova, perform her dances; have listened to the singing of the talented singer Maria Kuznetsova, of Nina Tarasova, Isa Kramer and others; have admired at picture shows the very talented moving picture artists Nazimova and Petrova, also the acting of the incomparable actress, Knipper-Chekhova.</p>
   
   <p>Finally, we knew and we know that there are residing in Chicago several very gifted Russian women artists and doctors, and women possessing great knowledge.</p>
   <p>But we knew little about the average Russian woman of our colony.</p>
   <p>She was hidden from us. Stuffy rooms of basements in poor districts of Chicago were hiding her.</p>
   <p>Daily and nightly toil was hiding her - hard, thankless, monotonous toil.</p>
   <p>For a long time one could meet that average Russian woman only at her home, on holidays, in the church.</p>
   <p>She had no time to go to meetings or evening entertainments occurring in the colony. She would seldom be seen on such occasions.</p>
   <p>To us she was something hazy, impersonal.</p>
   
   <p>But at present her shy, modest face can be seen much more clearly.</p>
   <p>And here she is, the same as she was in Russia: Working the whole day long, sorrowing during the dark night.</p>
   <p>Here also, when you look at her life, you are involuntarily reminded of the words of the poet: "Oh, what miserable lot, the lot of a woman! How could one find in this world anything sadder than that?"</p>
   <p>We are astonished by her patience, by her "unfeigned tears," her labors, her devotion to her family.</p>
   <p>Almost every Russian woman who comes to America has to pass several years in stuffy basements.</p>
   <p>Such a woman mostly works at home in the day time, and in a factory during the night.</p>
   
   <p>Many women had to work not only for their families, but also for boarders: they had to do some washing for them, to cook their meals and to keep their rooms clean.</p>
   <p>The work of a man immigrant was hard during the first years. He had many troubles. But he was able to get a rest on Sundays, to visit and meet his friends, to go to evening entertainments, to meetings held by Russian organizations; he could find some time for reading. But the women! The majority of them had no such opportunities.</p>
   <p>The man was hearing the English language spoken where he was working and on the street, and some times he could attend a Russian school.</p>
   <p>The woman was "freezing at home.</p>
   <p>The men owe to the women a large part of the progress which they have achieved while living in America.</p>
   
   <p>The Russian woman was helping the men in all possible ways to save some money and to get some education. And every husband who has learned something and has acquired a house or some other property, owes much to his wife, for she has been working hand in hand with him.</p>
   <p>Many unhappy marriages occur among us. There are some giddy women who are unfaithful to their husbands and families and succumb to the temptations of an easy life. There are in general cities which tempt men and women by luxury and pleasures. This is a sad thing. But the Russian colony is not the only one to suffer from such causes. Among the other foreign colonies there are also such women. But they are like drops of rain which disappear in the sea; so these giddy women disappear in the mass of women, mothers, devoted to their families, of women toilers.</p>
   <p>During the last two or three years one can notice among the general mass of Russian women immigrants some intellectual awakening.</p>
   
   <p>The average woman reads, begins to learn the English language, appears at evening entertainment and meetings. (Note: Such an awakening among the Russian women immigrants belonging to the working class was quite noticeable in Chicago several years before the time mentioned by the author of this article. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. S.)</p>
   <p>There begin to appear in Chicago women's societies for mutual aid. A Russian women's progressive society has been formed in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Articles written by women appear more and more often on the pages of Russian newspapers. The writers belong to the working class: Anna Kachuly, Kezuk, Yakimovich and others.</p>
   <p>Some of these women show some talent as organizers. The Russian women are getting organized. They reach towards light and knowledge. They learn and teach children. We welcome this awakening.</p>
