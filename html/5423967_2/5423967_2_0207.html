   <p>Stalin and his commissars are waiting in the Kremlin with bated breath for the happiest moment in their lives, when Uncle Sam will at last give official recognition to the Soviet government and will admit Stalin's diplomats into Washington. If we are to believe the Associated Press dispatch, the question of the recognition of the Soviets has already been decided in Washington, in the affirmative, and the exchange of envoys is expected to take place before Congress convenes.</p>
   <p>With great persistence the Bolsheviks have striven to obtain American recognition, and the Soviet Union has campaigned actively for a long time, and has spent colossal sums of money, toward this end. The results of this campaign are already here. The Bolsheviks have succeeded in securing the support and co-operation of such American statesmen and politicians as Senator Borah, former Senator Burkhardt, former Goverhor Alfred [E.] Smith, and others, besides many corrupt American newspapermen, with whose aid American public opinion was induced to favor the recognition, under the pretext that it would bring innumerable commercial advantages and gains to the people of this country. Being only superficially acquainted with Soviet affairs, the American public with all seriousness receives and accepts the Soviet declarations, declarations of the Soviet propaganda machine, to the effect that the Soviet government is ready to make huge purchases of American cotton, meat, and other goods, amounting to many millions of dollars. It is also pointed out that the Soviet government might be ready to accept the responsibility for the tsarist debts contracted in this country, and that the planned Second Five-Year Plan will produce a great demand for American machines. Together with this, the American press, whether through ignorance or through design, keeps silent about the results of the First Five-Year Plan, which had ruined the nation and had doomed millions of peasants to death from starvation and, at the same time, had placed the Soviet government in an extremely difficult position.</p>
   
   <p>At present, it occurs neither to the American government nor to American business, looking for new markets, that the Soviet government is completely insolvent. If such well-organized countries as Germany, France, Great Britain, and others, have found themselves close to bankruptcy, what can be said of Soviet Russia? The demand for foreign goods in ruined Soviet Russia is tremendous, but the people have absolutely nothing with which to pay for the goods. The Soviets are unable to meet even the current credits extended to them by the German, English, French, and other financiers and industrialists. The Bolsheviks do intend, and will not be able, to honor the loans and credits offered them in the United States. It is said that our government in Washington is prepared not only to grant recognition but to offer them a loan of seventy-five million dollars. The Bolsheviks, naturally, can use that gift, but there is no reason to suppose that the money will be returned to the United States government.</p>
   <p>In an article entitled "The Collapse of the American Dollar, and the Enthronment of Hitler," in the May I issue of Izvestia, Karl Radek proved that American capitalism is doomed, and that, as a consequence, the inevitable Bolshevik revolution in America will release Moscow from the responsibility of paying back its debt to bourgeois America.</p>
   <p>Let the American capitalists lend us money and provide us with goods, and we, the Bolsheviks, will pay them back in our own Bolshevik way--with a crack on the head!</p>
