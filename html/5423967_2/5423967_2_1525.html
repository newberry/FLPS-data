   <p>After prolonged negotiations, Russian Chicago is destined at last to be enriched by a new society which is very necessary for the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>We mean the "Society of Russian Physicians in Chicago."</p>
   <p>According to the information we have received, there are in Chicago no less than 75 Russian physicians. Besides, there are in this city several Russian scientists with well known, even world renowned, names. Let us mention, as an example, professor A. A. Maximov, who is occupying at present a chair in the University of Chicago. Another well known scientist is Assistant Professor Kolodny, of the Illinois University.</p>
   <p>The initiators of this excellent undertaking are the physicians, G.V. Krasnow, A. I. Nedzelnitsky, N. V. Popov and a few others.</p>
   <p>The first organizing meeting of the first Society will take place on Friday, July 18, 1924, at 3 p.m., in Mr. Murashev's laboratory, at 32 North State Street.</p>
