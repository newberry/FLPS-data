   <p>The telegraph wires carried throughout the world the news about the bloody collision between the Communists and the Ukrainians in Chicago. The Ukrainians had been demonstrating against the Soviet government in Russia, which they held responsible for the unheard-of starvation and cannibalism now raging in the Ukraine and in Russia proper. All newspapers gave detailed descriptions of the clash and how it came about. Briefly, this sad incident had the following foundations:</p>
   <p>A few hundred Communists had attacked the Ukrainians, numbering about five thousand persons, during their march to the place of the demonstration meeting called by the united Ukrainian societies. A bloody fight ensued, such as Chicago has probably never seen before. There were more than one hundred seriously wounded, not to mention many scores of slightly wounded. Almost all of the wounded suffered from cuts and deep wounds in their heads, as a result of blows inflicted by clubs, rocks, bottles, pieces of iron and other <span class="page-break">2</span>weapons.</p>
   <p>Despite all the detailed reports of this bloody clash, one thing remains a mystery. What, in reality, caused the conflict? What were the reasons, the motives for the attack? We can assume that our local Bolsheviks did not like the display of free will on the part of the Ukrainian people, and their boldness in voicing their protest against the Bolshevik tyrants in Russia. Consequently, the Bolsheviks, blinded by Marxism, Leninism and Stalinism, decided to give the protesting Ukrainians a good lesson. In this country it is not against the law to organize and participate in public demonstrations, when police regulations are properly observed. But, evidently, according to the conviction of the Bolsheviks, the right to protest and demonstrate should be their exclusive monopoly, as it is in Soviet Russia and in fascist countries.</p>
   <p>As in New York, the Bolsheviks in Chicago acted according to plans laid out beforehand; they attacked first, from ambush and unexpectedly, thus disorganizing and overwhelming the demonstrators. Such have always been their tactics: <span class="page-break">3</span>to instill fear and to overpower by tricks and stratagems. According to the crooked Bolshevik logic, the mailed fist is always the best argument. If the Bolsheviks in New York and in Chicago are so sure of prosperity and well-being in the Soviet Union, then why are they so eager to crush all the demonstrations against the conditions there? Why don't they say "let these ignoramuses demonstrate and cry their throats out. It won't hurt us." But, no, our American Bolsheviks do not believe in the Soviet prosperity and, therefore, they resorted to clubs, rocks, bottles, etc. to prove their argument. By using such methods the comrades betray their weakness, cowardice and lack of confidence in what they preach.</p>
   <p>The Bolshevik attacks on the demonstrating Ukrainians prove their low cultural level, their hooligan wantonness, their lack of conscience, their wickedness, and their craving for blood. By their blindness and their ignorance they remind us of the most terrible mediaeval fanatics, whose zeal and fervor bordered on insanity and beastly brutality. Such are the American Communists.</p>
