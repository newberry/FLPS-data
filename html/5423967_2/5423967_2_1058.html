   <p>What do the businessmen of Chicago who have business relations with Russians think about the buying capacity of Russian immigrants, the position they occupy in the city of Chicago and about their life?</p>
   <p>This question may seem to be somewhat strange, even useless; yet undoubtedly it is not devoid of some interest. Especially, of course, for Russians.</p>
   <p>The writer of.this article had the opportunity to carry on a conversation about the question with several representatives of industrial and commercial firms and banks which have often business relations with Russians.</p>
   <p>The representative of a small factory where some 50 Russians are working said the following:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"The Russian workmen, as far as I have observed, are industrious and do their work conscientiously.</p>
   <p>"Some twelve years ago," he continued," or only ten years ago, many Russians would agree to work for any remuneration and as many hours as would be demanded from them. At the present time one hardly ever comes across such Russian workmen. Now they know the real value of their work and the value of the time they spend on it;they do not feel self-conscious when they talk to their employers, they are conscious of their human dignity. You don't see any of the submission and shyness in them which you could observe before. They are not so afraid now to lose their jobs. A good Russian workman who feels that he is a master-workman in his line demands to be put to work in decent conditions and at a salary that would correspond to the quality of his work. If this is not granted him, he quits."</p>
   <p>Approximately the same was told me by the representatives of other firms of the same kind.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>One of them who was extremely inimical to trade unionism made a remark which from our standpoint was very gratifying.</p>
   <p>"The trouble with the Russians is only this," he said, "that during the last years they have taken an extraordinary interest in unions.</p>
   <p>"As to the efficiency of their work we cannot complain about that. They are industrious workmen, pretty bright, and can adapt themselves quickly to various kinds of work."</p>
   <p>The representatives of three commercial firms on Halsted Street, which have many Russian customers, all gave me very much the same answers to my questions.</p>
   <p>"The Russians," so they told me, "buy pretty expensive clothes and shoes. They want to be shown high grade goods and are ready to pay for them a corresponding price. They are not stingy with their money."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>One of these gentlemen told me the following:</p>
   <p>"For many years I had to come into contact with Russians. As far as my experience goes I have observed that the Russians have noticeably improved their material welfare.</p>
   <p>"Previously, some seven or eight years ago, they were buying cheap goods; now many of them buy pretty expensive suits, over-coats, furniture and even shirts."</p>
   <p>Representatives of banks situated in neighborhoods where many Russians are living declare that the number of Russians who deposit money in these banks and the number of their deposits is considerably increasing every year.</p>
   <p>My interview concerning Russians with Mr. Baskin, the representative of the West Side Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>He is assistant cashier and manager of the foreign department of the bank, and for eight years he has had continually business relations with Russians.</p>
   <p>"The Russians," said Mr. Baskin, "are noticeably progressing in all respects. From poor streets and miserable shacks they are migrating to more attractive neighborhoods and to better apartments.</p>
   <p>"At present many Russian workmen are earning plenty of money and live quite comfortably. Years ago they used to send their not yet grown-up children to factories and works. Now they are sending them to local American high schools.</p>
   <p>"Our bank," continued Mr. Baskin, "is visited daily by about 100 Russians, and on Saturdays by 300 or 400. Among our Russian depositors there are a good many who have deposits amounting to $8,000, $10,000 and $12,000.</p>
   <p>"During last year alone Russians have bought in our bank bonds to the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>amount of $200,000. Their deposits are very large. About 30 percent of our Russian depositors are buying houses.</p>
   <p>"I know some Russians," added Mr. Baskin, "who some seven or eight years ago were leading a miserable existence, but now have become excellent mechanics, chauffeurs, cabinet-makers. During the last years the almost criminally trustful disposition of the Russians who would put confidence in every crook has also disappeared. They do not deposit their money any more in banks with a shady reputation. They have learned their lesson. They are looking now for reliable banks, having a large capital and being under the control of the state authorities."</p>
   <p>Such is the opinion of businessmen about Russians residing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>An almost endless number of similar characteristics could be added to those already quoted in this article. But we think that what has been <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>said is sufficient to convince our readers that the material conditions of the Russian immigrants in Chicago have considerably improved, and that along with them the general state of the colony has also improved.</p>
