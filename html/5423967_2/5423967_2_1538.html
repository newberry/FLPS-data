   <p>[Translator's note: Schkliar is a leader of the Russian communists in Chicago, and Novy Mir (New World) is their newspaper, published in New York.]</p>
   <p>Despite the good shakedown that Russian communists in Chicago suffered only a little while ago, a shakedown which many of them could ill afford, their weekly sheet has been turned into a daily paper under the name of Novy Mir, and Schkliar continues to assess his comrades with new extra and superextra "voluntary" contributions for the newspaper's maintenance fund. Now he sounds the alarm again and tells his flock of sheep that if they wish to see their paper come off the press on time everyday they must shell out a few more dollars per head. Chicago communist organizations have already received from Novy Mir a list of the quotas of money to be collected toward <span class="page-break">2</span>the fund by each organization. The money is to be forwarded to Novy Mir, we presume, as a milk fund for Schkliar's children.</p>
   <p>Not even the women's communist organizations in Chicago are not forgotten in the roll call. One of them is assessed a hundred dollars. The communists in Chicago--those that are Russian--are already scratching their heads and thinking:</p>
   <p>"No matter how much we contribute, the bottomless barrel of Novy Mir cannot be filled!"</p>
   <p>The communists make a hollo about the rising taxation burden on the country, and yet the "comrades" themselves are ready to take the last shirts off the backs of their own followers. Such are the benefactors of the proletariat!</p>
