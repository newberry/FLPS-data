   <p>The Federal Government in its desire to thin out large populous cities begins to send people out on farms. Among them you find many Russians, even from Chicago. The Government has appropriated one-half million dollars, which will be spent for the accommodation of two hundred Russian families (twenty-five hundred dollars per family). The money will be advanced in the form of loans for thirty years with three per cent interest. The Government ships the settlers, gives them shelter and enough food until they can make a harvest. The settlement will be located along a highway, 18 miles from San Antonio, Texas, where the Medin Irrigation System has been built in order to make the soil fit for crops. The settlers themselves will build homes of four rooms each, with flat roofs, and porches, on lots 120 x 150 feet; moreover, the State will build a school as soon as the farmers are settled. Thus, a typical Russian village with electric light and a water supply system will be built.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Each settler, besides receiving money, will get 10 acres of land (with extra charges for irrigation service) where he may raise vegetables, fruits and berries only, if the soil is not suitable for raising grain crops. All the produce from these parcels of ground will be put on the market and sold through the Settlers' Co-operative Organization, for individually the farmers could hardly hope to dispose of their surpluses at the prevailing market prices. In connection with the farmers' Co-operative there will be established a chicken and dairy farm. It is planned to acquire over one hundred milk cows and about two thousand hens. For storing perishable products a co-operative refrigeration plant will be built. The Government offers all the means for purchasing farm equipment and live stock to each settler. For this purpose, each settler concludes a contract with the Government concerning the terms of exploitation of the ground, particularly, with regard to debt obligations. The interest will be paid from the first year, and the capital repaid from the third year at the rate of $158 per annum.</p>
   <p>The organizers of the settlement assert that the land selected for the Russian farmers is quite suitable for truck farming, and possesses irrigation facilities. <span class="page-break">\3</span>The climate is dry sunny, and without winter. It is possible to raise two crops a year on the same piece of ground. The plot of 10 acres not only can feed a family of six members, but makes it possible for the settler to pay interest and installments on his debt to the Government.</p>
   <p>Such preliminary terms of settlement are favorable to the Russian farmers desiring to settle on the land. If such settlers prove to be real tillers of the soil, the success of such a co-operative living is assured. But, the trouble is that the first settlers will not be the tillers of the soil from the ranks of the prewar immigrants--not the Russian peasants from Ohio, Pennsylvania and the Dakotas--but intellectuals and white-collar men from the post-war refugees, mainly from the states of New York and Illinois.</p>
   <p>It has been pointed out that the climate down there is dry, the soil half sandy and the subsoil waterless (there are no wells at all), and there are no forests nor grass. The entire locality resembles the environs of Tashkent in the Russian possessions in Central Asia. Constant irrigation and fertilization of the soil will be required; otherwise the work of the men will have <span class="page-break">\4</span>been done in vain. It will be necessary to dig special irrigation ditches, and to clean out constantly the sand blown into them by the winds, and carried around from one place to another. Who knows what is in store for the Russian immigrants there--hard work and failure, or success? Perhaps those Russians, the born tillers of the land, could manage to succeed in this new endeavor of raising vegetables, fruit, berries, chickens, and cattle, but what city denizens could do so? For the best development and success of this co-operative farming, real tillers of the soil are needed. If such settlers are in the majority there, then the whole project from the very beginning will be handled by strong and practical hands, and success will follow the sweating unremitting toil.</p>
