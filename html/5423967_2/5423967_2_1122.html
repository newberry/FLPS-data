   <p>In Chicago, through the efforts of the League of Lovers of Music and other American organizations of this city, it was proposed to create a "Grand Auditorium in the open air" next season. This Auditorium will be located in Grant Park, not far from Soldier's Field, and will have a capacity of 9500 persons.</p>
   <p>In this Auditorium the best operas will be produced, and will be heard simultaneously by over 9500 people; the best artists will be invited, and an excellent orchestra, chorus, and ballet will be organized. To direct the opera, our compatriot Mr. Gavriil Severinovich Khrzhanovsky, opera artist and great connoisseur of music, has been invited. According to information received by us, Mr. G. S. Khrzhanovsky has already begun work on the organization and completion of the groups of singers, chorus, orchestra, ballet, etc.</p>
   
   <p>All prominent American newspapers say much about this venture, pointing out its necessity in such a prominent city as Chicago.</p>
