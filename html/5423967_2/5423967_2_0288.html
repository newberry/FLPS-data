   <p>The leaders and members of the Synod church on Leavitt St. feel very sad. In all the Russian colony intensive work is going on in building schools, founding libraries, arranging lectures, plays and other useful evening entertainments. Gradually the colony is getting organized, is learning, and has long ago ceased to think about the restoration of the old regime. But the people of Leavitt Street and their leaders are still thinking about the re-establishment of the throne. "They read the Shanghai paper with the picture of Nicolai Nicolayevich, and rejoice at the thought that he might become a tsar." So writes to us about them the worker Serghey Bakalets.</p>
   <p>These poor people of Leavitt Street!</p>
