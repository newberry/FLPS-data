   <p>I went to a Bolshevik gathering, and overheard a conversation in regard to the number of people that were present at an event in honor of the Soviet flyers. Someone had said: "There was not less than 12,000 persons." A Mr. Trushinsky answered: "There were not as many as you think." "But how many were present?" someone else asked. Mr. Trushinsky withdrew from his pocket certain records and began to examine them. According to his records, it was found, there were a total of 4,510 tickets sold; 4016 of them at 50 cents, and 494 at 25 cents. The total net intake was $2,131.50.</p>
   <p>This announcement aroused the simple-minded Bolsheviki's displeasure, and a commotion followed.</p>
   <p>The commissar wishing to calm them, demanded: "How dare you assert so confidently that there were considerably more people, when you did not even count them." Whereupon, hot words followed: "The Friends of the Soviet Union are dishonest and crooked. They took the money for themselves and if any real members of the party should shield or protect them, they are no better. It would have been wiser, if we had managed everything ourselves, so that no one would steal from us.</p>

   <p>Next time, instead of throwing away a fortune, we won't give up a penny," At that moment one of the commissars entered and angrily shouted. "If the Rassviet learns of this matter, it will only be too glad to print every detail." Someone asked him. "Why? - are you afraid of the truth? - is it not true that the "Friends" took the money? - The Rassviet would be right in printing this, for, we must admit, the Rassviet was right, when it warned the Russian Colony of the "Friends" aim to exploit the occasion honoring the Soviet flyers, for their own benefit, by extracting money from the pockets of the Russians, which did happen.</p>
   <p>We must thank the Rassviet and its staff, for protecting the interests of the Russian Colony, and defending them from profiteers, and adventurers.</p>
   <p>It was confirmed by note all Russians present at the mass celebration honoring the Soviet flyers in Chicago that, from 12,000 to 14,000 people participated.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the greater part of the receipts went into the pockets of the organizers.</p>
