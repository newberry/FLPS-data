   <p>Friends and Readers: You have been the readers and supporters of the newspaper Rassviet for over nine years now. You read Rassviet because it is the only Russian newspaper in America in which you find a broad and true interpretation not only of world events but also of the life of the entire Russian group in this country. Rassviet is your newspaper, as it honestly and disinterestedly defends the interests of all the Russian people--your interests-- in America. It points the way to a brighter and more independent life. Rassviet pays the most serious attention to all your needs and aspirations. On its pages you have the right and the opportunity to express your thoughts and views upon any subject, or to discuss any question that may trouble your mind. Our editors do not throw your correspondence into the wastebasket because of poor grammar or illegible writing. On the contrary, they read all your notes very carefully, correct them if necessary, and print them on the pages of our newspaper with impartiality and good will. No other Russian newspaper in Europe or in the United States offers such broad privileges to its readers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Rassviet prints not only the articles prepared by a selected group of editorial workers, but also the writings of tens, even hundreds of persons, with the result that our newspaper may be truly regarded as the collective soul of the Russian group in America. This is the reason for the wide support which this newspaper enjoys. Rassviet listens attentively to every word you say, and prizes highly every thought you express. We are always trying to be of help to you in every way. No doubt you see all these efforts and, on your part, value our work and our newspaper and everything for which it stands. Were it not for your support, our publication, in all probabilities, would not exist today, as it receives no subsidies from anywhere.</p>
   <p>In addition, Rassviet is engaged in the cruel struggle against the dark forces of reaction which are attempting to get into their net the greatest possible number of victims from among our group, in order to use them as a source of their income, and, in the future, to use them for cannon fodder to attain their criminal aims. You know these dark forces and their insidious work, so I do not need to dwell longer on this subject.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>However, you should not infer that, because of good understanding and pleasant relations existing between you and this newspaper, you can just be complacent and do nothing. No, you should not stop at that. You should continue to do all in your power to make Rassviet the largest Russian publication in America, to improve its contents, and to supply it with a strong foundation, so that it may weather all possible storms that may threaten it in the future.</p>
   <p>Do not think that your present aid to this newspaper is sufficient or that your work is done when you send in your subscription or buy the newspaper at the newsstand. You should also participate actively in the work of improving its value and of strengthening its financial position. Financial aid to this publication can be rendered by securing new subscribers, by bringing to us printing orders from your societies, by soliciting advertisements for our newspaper, by arranging special social enterprises, and by collections. Many Russian societies served by this newspaper have for their slogan: "Every member of the organization must bring in one new member." In like manner, the readers of Rassviet can adopt the slogan: "Every reader of Rassviet must secure one new reader for this newspaper." But even this is not sufficient. Remember that <span class="page-break">\4</span>the editors of this newspaper without your aid cannot improve the contents of the publication. You can help by sending in your articles, letters and reports. You can even help us with your counsel. In addition, you can send to our office your opinions and preferences as to the kinds of material you would like to see in the newspaper: general news, political articles, economic reviews and discussions, scientific or philosophical articles, labor questions, tales, poems, fiction, international problems, news about the situation in Russia, the life of our Russian group in America, and American problems. When we know your tastes and requirements, we can adapt our policy accordingly and offer you the things you like most, and thus also avoid printing material of which you do not approve.</p>
   <p>There will be some critics, no doubt, who will say that the newspaper should try to raise its readers to its own level, and not to lower its level of quality to meet the lower tastes of its readers. But the fact is that a popular newspaper should maintain the closest ties with its readers. Only then can it fulfill its mission. Only then can it lift the cultural and moral level of its readers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Please remember, friends and readers, that Rassviet is not a private commercial publication; it is rather a public undertaking which directly concerns all Russian organizations and all Russian public life in America. Then, please, do all you can to raise this newspaper to its proper height in all directions. In a larger sense, all services which you may render to this publication are services rendered to yourselves and to your country. Show your power now, show your united strength to your enemies and ours, and prove to them that by your common effort you can build and maintain your own Russian newspaper, free and independent of the dark forces that surround us on all sides. In your own hands is the weapon with which to fight this creeping danger [the Communists].</p>
   <p>Rassviet is your spiritual beacon, warning you against dangers, and showing the right and safe road to your final goal. Therefore, it is up to you to do all you can to make that beacon brighter and brighter.</p>
