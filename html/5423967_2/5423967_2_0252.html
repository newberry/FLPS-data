   <p>On Sunday, Dec. 11, 1927, Mr. E. Z. Moravsky, editor of the Chicago Russian daily newspaper Rassviet, went to Gary, Ind., to give there a lecture in Russian at the Neighborhood House, 17th and Adams Street. The lecture was arranged by the Russian group Samoobrazovaniye (Self-education). The theme of the lecture was: "The Bankruptcy of Bolshevist Communism." This lecture almost proved to be fatal to Mr. Moravsky. The local Russian Communists hated Mr. Moravsky and the Rassviet, on the pages of which every day the truth about the crimes and evil deeds committed in Russia by the Communists was told plainly, being substantiated by official data taken from the Russian Bolshevist press. Not daring to attack Mr. Moravsky in Chicago, where he has many friends and supporters, the Russian Bolsheviki had thought that they would have a better chance at Gary, and almost succeeded in putting into execution their evil plans. A whole crowd of these Bolshevist ruffians <span class="page-break">\2</span>came to the lecture. They asked the chairman whether they would be allowed to ask questions and to refute the lecturer's statements. The chairman told them that they would be given the opportunity to do so after the lecture.</p>
   <p>The lecturer gave a short survey of the events that had happened in Russia from February to November 1917. He then characterized the several phases of the attempts of the Bolsheviki to organize Communist production and distribution and showed that all these attempts have resulted only in an unheard of system of enslavement of the population. He also pointed out that no other government had ever committed so many crimes and atrocities as the Bolshevist government has done; that that government had never kept honestly any of its promises to the people. It was evident that at present the Soviet government, which was arranging compromises with the bourgeois states, cared only about its own welfare, not about the welfare of the Russian <span class="page-break">\3</span>people. The lecturer proved his statements with such a wealth of facts and figures taken from official Bolshevist publications, that the Gary Bolsheviki who were present, did not attempt to refute him and only occasionally showed their disgust by hooting.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviki saw that the lecture would soon be over, and felt that they could neither refute the statements of the lecturer nor embarrass him by their questions. So they decided not to let Mr. Moravsky finish the lecture, to start a fight and to beat Mr. Moravsky up. They immediately started to put this program into execution. Mr. Moravsky was speaking about the failure of the Bolsheviki to give to the Russian people anything like an adequate education. The Communist ruffians started to cry: "Down with the white guard! It is all a lie!" Mr. Moravsky tried to stop the noise by saying that he was willing to interrupt the lecture and to let the Bolsheviki state their objections. He would then answer them and finish <span class="page-break">\4</span>the lecture. But the Bolsheviki did not want that at all. What they wanted was to create a fight. They were shouting: "He has been slandering the U. S. S. R. long enough! He must be killed on the spot!" With such cries the ruffians rushed towards the lecturer and tried to get hold of him and to drag him outside. One of them hit Mr. Moravsky on the leg, trying to knock him to the ground. But some persons from the audience came to Mr. Moravsky's rescue. While they were fighting, the Bolsheviki succeeded in escaping from the lecture room.</p>
   <p>The Gary Russians were revolted by the dastardly conduct of the Bolsheviki and resolved to arrange another lecture for Mr. Moravsky and to take measures so that on this next occasion the Communist ruffians would not have a chance to repeat their attack.</p>
   <p>Later it was found out that the leader of the Bolshevist gang was a <span class="page-break">\5</span>killer. Once he had killed a negro just because the latter had refused to give him some cigarettes. He had been released, however, in that case because the person who had had to investigate it had been a member of the K. K. K.</p>
