   <p>I was sitting in the parlor of that highly talented artist, Madame Inna Burskaya, and was dreaming a beautiful dream. My soul was permeated by the beauty of the "Song of Songs."</p>
   <p>I was in the home of Madame Inna Burskaya. What an unusual combination: a singer, an artist and an infinitely kind, beautiful soul. She has had remarkable success on the stage, yet she is not proud.</p>
   <p>She knows perfectly well all the European languages, yet she talks very little. She earns much money and gives it all away; she sings wonderfully and acts still better. This is Inna Burskaya.</p>
   <p>She is an astounding mezzo-soprano, and she does not only sing beautifully <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but is also incomparable as an actress; when she plays some role she is the very impersonation of that picture which the author or the composer had before his mental eye when he was writing this role.</p>
   <p>Madame Inna Burskaya is the best singer of our times for the operas "Carmen," "The Queen of Spades," "The Tsar's Bride," "Il Trovatore," "Aida," "Evgheniy Oneghin," and "Sampson and Delilah." When she sings and acts she is full of love and devotion for her art. The theater is not a workshop for her, it is temple. Her soul is permeated by the ideal of art and by the beauty of music. For him who looks for artistic ecstasy on the theatrical stage it is a real event to see Inna Burskaya playing her role. She knows how to affect the inmost of your soul by her acting and singing. She brings to the stage discipline, earnestness and thoughtfulness. Whatever part she sings in an opera she always inspires you with love for art. It does not matter in what language she is singing-it may be French, or Russian, or Italian. You see only Burskaya on the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>stage, and the difference of languages vanishes, is of no importance. You are in the realm of inminite beauty.</p>
   <p>With all my soul I have been serving art at the old Russian Grand Opera together with Inna Burskaya. During several years I have been traveling in various countries and had the opportunity to see almost every day Inna Burskaya and to listen to the singing of this queen of the stage, this bewitching magician of the opera. But I had still more opportunity to observe the life of this wonderful woman, and I say that in our times she is unique as an artist on the stage. And, what is more, is unique also when she is not on the stage.</p>
