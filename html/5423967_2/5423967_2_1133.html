   <p>Paul Zaichenko, the noted piano pedagogue, has been intimately identified with musical activities in Chicago for a number of years. In consequence of the remarkable success of his classes at the Uptown Conservatory, he has been re-engaged for another season; he has a large class and some very fine talent to work with.</p>
   <p>This teacher is particularly fortunate in having an unusual number of boys in his piano class, and their work is fine throughout, for he knows how to arouse and hold the interest of boys to an exceptional degree.</p>
   <p>His pupils have made regular and innumerable appearances in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On Sunday afternoon, October 30, at Uptown Conservatory, Mr. Zaichenko will present twenty-eight pupils of his class in a piano recital, these being:</p>
   
   <p>Olga and Mary Nikiforow, June Goldberg, Anna Hecht, Minerva Goldenson, Anna Krawchuck, Jane Eschenbacher, Sophie Kominsky, Ruth Hannaberg, Ethel Goldberg, Goldie Becker, Elaine Hannaberg, Beatrice Bresn, Isabelle Stivens, Francis Kacello, Benjamin Altschul, Isaac Lieboff, Joseph Kuzin, Nathaniel Farber, Benjamin Coven, Maynard Goldberg, Esther Bernstein, Mary Schepis, Jennie Altschul, Bella Altschul, Olga Brashovetz, Florence Gielow and Esther Faitelson.</p>
