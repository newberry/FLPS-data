   <p>The Russian Opera which visited us last year attracted to its performances every evening large crowds of people.</p>
   <p>In the lobby of the theater during the intermissions one could meet old members of the Russian colony who during the last years would seldom show themselves at Russian concerts, balls, and various other entertainments bearing a Russian character. The Russian Opera made good that trust which was reposed in it by all the social strata of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>The Opera infused new blood and a new, healthier spirit into the life of the colony.</p>
   <p>It was a real pleasure to look at the smiling faces of the Russians who had come to the Opera to listen to their favorite singers.</p>
   <p>Around the Russian Opera which was visiting us there was truly created some peculiarly palpitating joyful atmosphere. Old friends who had been immersed in their every day affairs and had not seen each other for several years, would renew the old ties of friendship after having met at the Russian Opera.</p>

   <p>When the Russian Opera left us life became dull again.</p>
   <p>But we had to become reconciled to this fact.</p>
   <p>Now, after a long interruption, the Russian Opera has come again to visit us.</p>
   <p>And it is a real pleasure for us to have to point out that besides the same guests who have visited us last year there will appear on the stage of the Russian Opera also our great singer and artist Fedor I. Shalyapin.</p>
   <p>Shalyapin's visit is a really wonderful surprise for us, and we must be grateful to fate for having the rare opportunity of seeing here, in America F. I. Shalyapin and of listening to him in one of his best roles in the opera "Boris Godunov."</p>
   <p>The Russian Opera will begin on the 19th of February.</p>
   <p>It has been announced that it will stay in Chicago four weeks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>I think that the Russian Opera could be induced to stay here much longer, and that this depends on us.</p>
   <p>If we shall pay very frequent visits to the Russian Opera we shall thereby give it material and moral support, thus allowing it to prolong its stay in Chicago. Usually our life is pretty dull. We are all occupied with our everyday routine business. In most cases this business does not give satisfaction to our souls, and after a day full of drudgery and worries we are involuntary drawn in the evening to go to some place where our soul can get some rest from it all.</p>
   <p>And where else shall we go now if not to the Russian Opera? Where shall our soul find better rest than there?</p>
