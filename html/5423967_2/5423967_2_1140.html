   <p>As we have already communicated in our newspaper, Alexandr Nikolayevich Kaminsky, the favorite of our colony, is conducting the orchestra at the Milford theatre.</p>
   <p>The Milford theatre belongs to Balaban and Katz, the largest company of theatre owners in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This theatre holds 1,500 persons. Americans like to go and listen to Mr. Kaminsky's "Milford--Kaminsky Orchestra."</p>
   <p>"Our orchestra is composed of the best musicians and is conducted by Mr. Kaminsky, a violinist of international reputation!" Thus declares the direction of the theatre.</p>
   <p>The daily program of Mr. Kaminsky's orchestra almost invariably includes several Russian numbers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>And it is by the performance of these Russian numbers that Mr. Kaminsky has captured the exceptional sympathy of the public.</p>
   <p>On Sundays Mr. Kaminsky and his orchestra play serious overtures, such as the "1812 Overture" by Tchaikovsky, the "Sheherazade" by Rimsky Korsakov and many others.</p>
   <p>Thus Alexander Nikolayevich Kaminsky accomplishes a great work--that of acquainting the Americans with Russian music.</p>
