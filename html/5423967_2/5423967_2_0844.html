   <p>Besides the Administration bill on social insurance which was introduced in Congress by Senator Wagner of New York, there is another bill on old age pensions introduced by Congressman Townsend. It provides for an old age pension of two hundred dollars per month for everyone who has reached his or her sixtieth birthday. This money is to be paid by the federal government on condition that the applicant has no criminal record, that he has been gainfully employed, and that he agrees to spend his monthly pension allowance within thirty days and within the boundaries of the United States.</p>
   <p>This project of social security is extremely attractive and appealing to those who quality. Two hundred dollars a month is good wages, not only for aged persons but for young ones as well. Three quarters of the people gainfully employed receive less than this amount for their work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The question arises: What means are to be used to meet such an expense? According to the statistical data, there are about eight million aged persons in the country, and to pay them the amount specified would require over nineteen billion dollars. Compare this sum with the normal budget of the country, which amounts to no more than four billion dollars.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt's bill provides for payments of thirty dollars a month by the federal treasury to those aged people of sixty-five years and over. This amount may be increased by grants from the respective state treasuries. Townsend's project imposes on the federal treasury a load amounting to nineteen billion dollars. President Roosevelt's plan is to be financed by appropriations from the government, and payroll assessments amounting to 2 1/2%. Townsend's bill contains no provisions for its financing, and all the expense of the project--over nineteen billion dollars--is to be borne by the federal treasury.</p>
   <p>Despite the attractiveness of Townsend's plan, its utopian and impractical phases are very obvious. The entire plan is without financial basis and contrary <span class="page-break">\3</span>to simple accounting principles. For example, if we take the highest figure for the national income, which during the years of prosperity rose to ninety billion dollars, even then the expense of this item in the national budget would not be practical. Only a part of the total national income goes to the federal treasury; the rest is spent by the people themselves. Of course, part of the national income is the profit of shop and factory owners. However, if this entire amount were taken from the employers, it would not be sufficient to cover the expense of paying pensions amounting to two hundred dollars a month as provided in the Townsend plan.</p>
   <p>The government's bill on social security is in need of essential modification, particularly in regard to the age limitations. Due to the rapidly increasing tempo of modern industrial life, men of forty-five years of age are being discarded as worn-out element. They are being replaced by younger people. At the age of fifty or fifty-five, men are entirely incapacitated for work. For this reason alone, sixty years should be established as the age limit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The amount of the pension should be increased to at least fifty dollars a month. It should be noticed that the pension is not to be paid to the family, but to the individual member. Therefore, if a family consists of four members whose total income amounts to two hundred dollars a month, each member of such a family receives an average income of fifty dollars a month. If the amount of the pension is fixed at fifty dollars, the standard of living of the person receiving this amount would not be lowered as compared with his life when employed. This would be true provided that the cost of living does not rise in the meantime.</p>
   <p>The principle is the important thing in approaching this problem of social security. The fact that the government itself found it necessary to pose the problem before the legislative bodies and the people at large is significant. The government came to the conclusion that a normal social life is impossible unless people are provided with security against unemployment, old age, and sickness. Under present circumstances, social insurance is a necessity. A <span class="page-break">\5</span>great majority of the people are incapable of providing against these hazards to their economic stability. There are many millions of able-bodied men who cannot find work to occupy their hands.</p>
   <p>The fight waged by the reactionary forces against this plan of social insurance will be a bitter one. This should indicate to the people who are really interested in the passage of social legislation of the type proposed that they must insist on adoption of the government proposals. Furthermore, they must give stronger support to those who favor such a law.</p>
