   <p>All America mourns the death of ex-President Wilson. From all parts of the world telegrams expressing a sincere sympathy are being sent to Washington. They are sent by prominent persons holding very different views. Wilson's death has aroused a sincere feeling of sorrow both among moderate people and among radicals.</p>
   <p>The late ex-president Wilson was an outstanding statesman and one of the prominent presidents. By his idealism he reminded one of the greatest among the American presidents, Abraham Lincoln. Woodrow Wilson was the best representative of the liberal intelligentsia of modern America.</p>
   <p>His peaceable policy, his celebrated fourteen points and his struggle for the self-determination of the nations attracted to him the sympathies of all the toiling and thinking population of America and of all the world, and earned him the veneration of men of various classes, holding various views. For a long time Woodrow Wilson's name has been pronounced with the feeling of deepest love by all opponents of war and oppression. For a long time his activity has been praised not only on <span class="page-break">\2</span>the pages of the liberal press, but also on the pages of labor and socialist newspapers and magazines. America regarded Wilson as a kind of Moses who will be able to lead it out of all the trials and hardships awaiting it. Other countries considered him as a great humanist whose authoritative words and deeds can lead Europe out of the befogged condition into which it had been led by war, imperialism and tyranny.</p>
   <p>All those who wanted the world war with its slaughter of millions of men and the bacchanalia of despotism to be stopped listened with bated breath to the words of the president of the great republic.</p>
   <p>The celebrated German publicist, Maximilian Harden, has rightly called Woodrow Wilson "the Hamlet of American history." Wilson was an idealist. This idealism enabled him to reach great heights, gave him wings, but brought him later tragic experiences, and he was led to act in a way which was justly blamed both in America and in Europe.</p>
   <p>We are alluding to his voyage to Europe, to his activities there and, after his return from Europe, in this country.</p>
   <p>An idealist, possessed of a strong faith in humanity and in the good <span class="page-break">\3</span>intentions of some of the European statesmen, he was not able to cope with the artful scheming of the crafty European diplomats when he came into contact with them. Impelled by an intense desire to restore peace to the world as soon as possible, he began to abandon some of the principles which he had professed before. He struggled stubbornly for a long time trying to uphold these principles; but one after another they have been wrecked by the European diplomats. His extreme idealism and his lack of understanding of the methods of the European diplomats led him to accept the terms of the treaty of Versailles and to believe in the sincerity of the motives which lay behind the creation of the League of Nations. After his return from Europe to America, having yielded to the influence of some American diplomats of the same crafty character, president Wilson also committed some justly blamed acts.</p>
   <p>Still Woodrow Wilson was acknowledged both by his partisans and by his political opponents to have been one of most honest and loyal American statesmen.</p>
