   <p>This organization was formed on May 26, 1913, by a group of twelve Russian workingmen, who decided to lay the foundation of a society whose aim should be the self-education and unification of Russian workers and peasants in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This society was named 'Brotherhood of the Russian Toiling People,' and its aim was best expressed in the following clauses of its program:</p>
   <p>Clause 2. Anyone, man or woman, understanding Russian, may become a member of the Brotherhood of the Russian Toiling People, regardless of nationality or convictions.</p>
   <p>Clause 5. One cannot be a member of the brotherhood if he does not go <span class="page-break">2</span>hand in hand with the toiling masses and who does not live a simple (purely proletarian) workingman's life.</p>
   <p>From these clauses it is easy to see the non-partisan tendency of this organization; and along this pattern were formed a number of organizations in America at that time.</p>
   <p>In June of 1914 a convention took place in Detroit of non-partisan progressive organizations. At this convention the Federation of Russian Workers' Unions in the United States and Canada was formed, the Chicago brotherhood being part of it, and known, from then on, as the Chicago Union of Russian Workers.</p>
   <p>At the base of this union is the principle of class struggle, and this <span class="page-break">3</span>is illustrated by the program of the union, which declares that the struggle between the disinherited workers and peasants - who with their labor created all the wealth of the world, and the wealthy - who seized into their hands all the wealth of the world - will end only when the toiling masses, organized as a class, will comprehend their true interests and will gain control, through a forcible social revolution, over the entire wealth of the world.</p>
   <p>With this sweeping change accomplished, and with the simultaneous destruction of all the institutions and powers of the government, the disinherited class will proclaim a society of free producers, striving to satisfy the needs of each separate individual, who in his turn gives to society his labor and his knowledge.</p>
   <p>Toward the Socialist Party the union has a negative attitude because <span class="page-break">4</span>'the tactics of the Socialist Party, as a part of the international social-democracy which is striving to seize power by parliamentary means, have a most demoralizing effect on the toiling masses.'</p>
   <p>Not any less negative is the union's attitude toward the American Federation of Labor, inasmuch as the latter 'by its ultimate aims, as well as by its tactics, is a reactionary organization striving to coordinate the interests of labor with the interests of capital.'</p>
   <p>One need not, however, deduce from the above that a member of the union must not belong to the American Federation of Labor; it is permissible, except that 'while one is obliged to belong there, he should remember to promulgate the ideas and principles of the union as much as possible.'</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the program of the union recommends joining the I. W. W. and influencing the further development of this organization <span class="page-break">5</span>in the spirit of the principles laid in the groundwork of the union.</p>
   <p>Wherever a possibility arises to organize workingmen of an entire industry, or even if only of a part of an industry, members of the union should organize then into the I. W. W. union.</p>
   <p>Quite frequently, in such instances, the question arose: Why then does not the union join the I. W. W.? The answer was, firstly, because of the comparative high initiation fee. Secondly, because of the requirement of a certain number of members for granting a charter, and its expensiveness (around $10). And then certain deductions are made (from membership dues) for the Central Committee of I. W. W.; furthermore, the Russian locals of the I. W. W. are not getting anything in return, neither a Russian paper, nor appeals in the Russian language, nor pamphlets, nor <span class="page-break">6</span>an agitation of their own; whereas by membership in the Federated Unions of Russian Workmen in the United States and Canada, the union has the benefit of federation magazines, pamphlets, and agitation funds, i. e., the union is entitled to funds for all these things.</p>
   <p>In analyzing the question as to the social and material values of the union one should before all else bear in mind that the organism is afflicted with a chronic disorganization.</p>
   <p>Almost always one sees the lack of a leader or of leaders, without which, as one may expect, no undertaking can achieve success. This is so because the majority of members are people who have not had any experience in organization affairs. Furthermore, the majority of members in the Union are of a transient type; this is enough to explain the perpetual disorder which reigns almost uninterruptedly in the affairs of the union, which <span class="page-break">7</span>as yet has proved incapable of producing a single leader from its midst. If I was asked for a reason why this is so, my answer would be that it is all due to the lack of intellectual forces among the union membership.</p>
   <p>And yet, one must not overlook the enormous, useful work which the union is doing for the sake of educating the vast Russian toiling masses.</p>
   <p>Despite the scant membership of the union, it successfully maintains permanent quarters with a library and reading room where lectures are delivered weekly on such interesting and useful topics as God and War, Anarchism, the History of Culture, a series of lectures on philosophy, etc. As to the degree of interest in such lectures - one should judge by the fact that from 75 to 80 people have been attending them, filling the union quarters' capacity to the last inch of space, many unable to get a seat.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>On the whole, considering the scope of its possibilities, the union solved its problems satisfactorily, and, should it continue on the path of strengthening its organization, it is destined to play a big role soon in the life of the local colony.</p>
