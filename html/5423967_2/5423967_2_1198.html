   <p>At the picture show arranged at Marshall Field's Department Store can be seen two pictures painted by I. Orlev, a young artist residing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of these is named "The Second Advent"; the other, "In Sorrew." Beth pictures have been highly praised by several artists. The attention of connoisseurs is especially attracted by the picture representing "The Second Advent." The second picture represents a woman gripped by sorrow.</p>
   <p>Our young artist is working intensely in his modest studio on Edison Avenue. He is working also in one of the large art studies downtown.</p>
