   <p>In 1907 there came to America from the province of Tver the son of a peasant, M. I. Volkov. He had not a cent in his pocket, but in his soul there was a whole wealth of desires and aspirations to learn and to become a man.</p>
   <p>In the beginning our peasant from the province of Tvor lived in America on those cents which he was earning in a tailor shop where he was sewing on buttons.</p>
   <p>Later he found some work in a drugstore and after that in a tool-maker shop; he has been a type-setter, a painter, a laborer on farms and railroads in construction, a miner, etc.</p>
   <p>This man had to change many a "noble profession for another. Yet, working strenuously and having to stand all kinds of hardships, this peasant from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the province of Tver remembered one thing: it is necessary to learn; it is necessary to get from America all the good that this country can give us and to bring it all to Russia.</p>
   <p>Remembering this, the young Volkov was working during the day and learning in the evening. First, he attended an evening school, then he passed the examination which opened to him the doors of the high school, and ultimately he was admitted to an agricultural college, from which he was graduated with honors. The American universities, seeing how strenuously this Russian peasant worked at his studies, granted him a scholarship which allowed him to perfect his education, and the result of it was that Mr. Volkov became an M. A. and later a doctor of philosophy.</p>
   <p>In the Russian universities, before one could occupy a professor's chair, one had to study a long time, then first get the degrees of "master" and "doctor," and only then one could become a professor.</p>
   <p>The peasant from the province of Tver, Volkov, has achieved this in America. He labored and he has achieved; he desired and his desire has been realized; he did not spend his evening in taverns and speakeasies, but went to school.</p>

   <p>Having received the degree of doctor he remained with the University of Illinois where he has taught Agricultural chemistry during six years; at the same time has also been writing for the Russian and American press.</p>
   <p>Here is an example to follow for many of us. Here is a man who has come straight from an out-of-the-way village of the province of Tver as an ignorant peasant, a tiller of the soil; but he will return to Russia as a man who has earned a high scientific degree.</p>
   <p>(Note: While residing in Chicago, professor Volkov has done a great deal of good for the Russian colony by participating in its public, cultural and educational work. He has participated as an active worker in the Russian People's University, having been a member of its Council and a lecturer on agriculture. Besides he has also given a number of public lectures on economic and scientific subjects. He has been the editor and publisher of the weekly paper Amerikanskaya Rus (American Russia), which existed in Chicago one year. N. K.)</p>
