   <p>New "class enemies" have appeared in the USSR. At the present time, the Bolshevik papers have been paying a great deal of attention to them. Who, then, are these enemies? They are the rowdies.</p>
   <p>It appears that rowdyism has recently begun to flourish in the Socialist State, at a very fast tempo, and the Bolshevik press, awakening to the situation, prints appeals to all public-spirited citizens of the USSR to take part in the fight against this new menace.</p>
   <p>Pravda, of January 2, prints an editorial entitled "Rowdyism and the Fight Against It," in which among other things we read: "Reports from Lugansk, advise us that in that city,the rowdies are getting bolder and bolder, although no steps have been taken to stop their depredations. They have been particularly violent in Liubertsii (near Moscow). Every day, one or another citizen is assaulted. In the suburb named after Kalinin, the streets are not illuminated. Taking advantage of the darkness, the rowdies assail every passer-by."</p>
   <p>Further on, Pravda attempts to convince its readers that rowdyism is one of the evils surviving from capitalism, although in reality it is a product of bolshevism. Rowdyism is not "the cursed inheritance of the past" because the Soviet rowdies are not old, but young men, who were born and reared in the "Socialist" environment.</p>
   <p>Further on Pravda, classifying the rowdies as enemies, writes: "The rowdy, as an ally and accomplice of the class enemies, violates our social order and the civic rights of the people. Often they [the rowdies], are organized and assisted by our enemies. This is one reason why it is justifiable to consider rowdyism as an outgrowth of a lack of culture. Springing from this lack of culture, it (rowdyism) is used by the class enemy in order to harm us, and, consequently [for these two reasons], the struggle against rowdyism should be merciless.</p>
   
   <p>"Soviet and Party organizations that forget the fight against rowdyism do not fulfill their most elementary obligations."</p>
   <p>That these class enemies were not generated by the old, but by the bolshevik regime, is revealed in the Komsomolskaya Pravda (translator's note: newspaper of the Young Communist League), [in the issue] of January 5. The newspaper laments the growth of rowdyism in the villages and cities, and informs the readers that leaders of Young Communist League branches, in the respective localities, do not pay any attention to the way in which the boys and girls pass their leisure time. From the cossack village, Krasnoprmayskaya, the newspaper is advised that there, the collective form club and the House of Socialist Culture are converted, in the evenings into halls for all kinds of meetings and conferences. The rest of the time, they are firmly locked up. The village is a large one; it numbers 1,500 inhabitants. The library, however, has only forty-five books and a few pamphlets which nobody reads.</p>
   
   <p>Quite often, they drink, fight and generally misbehave in those places. Another reporter, from the railway station Domodedovo on the Moscow-Kursk line, states that at the Konstontinovsk factory, the Cultural work is very disorganized. The young people there are drinking and gambling at cards. The same situation can be seen in scores of other places, according to the same newspaper.</p>
   <p>From what has already been said, one may conclude that the ranks of the new class enemies are being augmented not only from the nonpartisan ranks, but from the Young Communist League youths, as well.</p>
