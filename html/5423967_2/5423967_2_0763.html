   <p>By many opponents of the New Deal a large number of the laws enacted by Congress in the last three years are regarded as violations of American traditions, steps toward socialism, etc. In the eyes of others the measures proposed by President Roosevelt are only the first steps, very timid steps, as a matter of fact, toward the attainment of the country's social security, a matter in which the United States which is lagging far behind such countries as England, Sweden, and Norway, where similar laws have been in force for many years without provoking in anybody's mind the suspicion of radicalism.</p>
   <p>The latter viewpoint is shared by the chairman of the Social Security Board, John Vinant, who in a speech the other day appraised the value of all measures passed concerning social security. In his opinion the year 1936 will be marked in American history as the year of the first attempts to put into practice that principle <span class="page-break">2</span>according to which society as a whole has a certain responsibility toward helpless old people, toward the unemployed, and in general toward all the victims of the "machine age".</p>
   <p>At the present moment particular attention is being paid to insurance against unemployment, which constitutes a part of the law on social security. In its essence this form of insurance may be described as follows:</p>
   <p>Every enterprise employing eight or more people is taxed one per cent of the entire payroll during the year 1936, two per cent during the year 1937, and three per cent during the years following. The money thus paid in goes into a special fund from which unemployment benefits will be paid after several years.</p>
   <p>If in any given state an unemployment insurance law approved of by the Federal Government is on the Statute books, the payments made by the employers go into the State unemployment fund. Nine States, including Illinois, have already <span class="page-break">3</span>adopted laws providing unemployment insurance. It is expected that in 1936 a number of States will pass similar laws, although each State is left free to decide just what form is most suitable as long as the measure satisfies the minimum requirements of the Federal law on social security.</p>
   <p>Critics of the law point out that it does not include agricultural workers and those employed in small shops. Mr. Vinant does not defend these shortcomings in the law but considers that the first step in recognition of social responsibility for mass unemployment has been taken, and that other steps in this direction will follow.</p>
   <p>The second important reform introduced by the law on social security is the system of old-age pensions. From now on the Federal Government will meet part of the expense involved in paying such pensions. In order to receive the Federal Government's aid, the States will have to introduce the system of paying pensions to persons 65 years old or older. This provision will mean a great deal for States which heretofore have paid pensions only to persons 70 years old or older.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Other provisions of the law anticipate the payment of Federal subsidies to States rendering assistance to needy aged persons, homeless children, the blind, etc., and also give encouragement to States in their work of caring for maternity cases and promoting social hygiene.</p>
   <p>The main task in the field of social security, according to this plan, is assigned to the individual States, but behind each State stands the Federal Government willing to pay a subsidy.</p>
