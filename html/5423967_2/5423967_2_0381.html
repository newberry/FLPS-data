   <p>The Russian colony of the United States will gather at a convention for the consideration of a whole series of questions which have arisen in connection with recent events in Russia and United States. For the consideration of the order of the convention and also for the consideration of the question about the unification of the Russian colony of Chicago and suburbs, a conference of the representatives of the Russuan organizations was called in Chicago. This conference elected a Provisional Committee for the convocation of the conference and representatives of the organizations of all Russian immigrants. It was decided to invite one delegate from each organization which has more than 25 members and two delegates from each organization which has more than 25 members. The Provisional Committee will convoke this enlarged conference on November 13, 8 o'clock P.M., at the Russian Branch of the American Socialist Party, 1149 W.
