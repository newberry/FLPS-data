   <p>A prominent Englishman declared the other day that humanity had lived through the golden age of freedom and was now retracing its steps back to the slavery of the New Middle Ages. The events that have taken place since the World War only substantiate this statement, says this English authority.</p>
   <p>At the head of the reactionary forces attempting to turn back the clock of history stand the Bolsheviks and Fascists, even though they profess extreme hostility toward each other. In reality, however, the Bolsheviks and Fascists are blood brothers, for they resemble each other in many respects, and both alike remind us of the inquisitors of the Middle Ages. Both in Russia and Germany slavery in its worst forms has been fully realized. In these countries, all liberty has been destroyed, and the masses have been converted into slaves of the state.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Knickerbocker, an American correspondent, has come to the same conclusion. Speaking of the "second revolution" his name for the first five-year plan, he said that it took as many victims as were killed in the "ten days that shook the world". Just as the October revolution of 1917 terminated in famine in 1922, so the five-year plan resulted in hunger which continues even today and has carried millions of its victims to premature graves. With the exception of Germany during the Thirty Years' War, no nation has ever gone through as much suffering and terror as Russia has endured under Bolshevik dictatorship, writes Mr. Knickerbocker.</p>
   <p>The full measure of horror is not, however, the result of famine conditions alone. Along with hunger, cruel slavery and bloody terror hold sway. Capitalism in Russia has been destroyed, but its place has been taken by a single capitalist slaveholder--the state. Its power over the masses is limitless because it controls not only the material but the spiritual life of the population as well. As a capitalist and slaveholder, the state realizes enormous profits from its undertakings, inasmuch as it employs cheap slave labor.</p>
   
   <p>Outside Russia it is customary to think that the communists are the only free people in that country. But this is not so. Communists simply live under better conditions than the rest of the population, but they are also enslaved to the fullest extent. Within party ranks, there is a military, barrack-like discipline; no free expression of opinion, no independent judgment is permitted. Every word of criticism directed at the supreme dictator is regarded as a crime; the cruel purges instituted by Stalin against those who dare to oppose him bear testimony to this fact. Communists as such live under even more oppressive and onerous conditions than the common people, because they accept their slavery willingly whereas the rest of the population were enslaved by force. Almost the same state of affairs is observed in Germany, where at the helm of the state there stand, not Bolsheviks but Fascists who call themselves National Socialists.</p>
   <p>The English authority [mentioned in the first paragraph] thinks that other European countries may follow in the footsteps of Germany and Russia, if the more enlightened people in those countries do not deliver, before it is too late, a blow against those reactionary Bolshevik-Fascist forces which destroy culture and civilization and establish a regime of inquisition and slavery patterned after the Dark Ages.</p>
