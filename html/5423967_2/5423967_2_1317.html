   <p>d) The discovery and development from among the members of the Society of new talents, unknown to the public.</p>
   <p>e) The creation of studios.</p>
   <p>f) The creation of a nook where the members of the Society, as well as all persons interested in art, would meet and pass their time.</p>

   <p>All persons who can be in some respect useful in the pursuing of the objects of the Society, and can further its development, are eligible to membership of the Society.</p>
   <p>The fees and dues are as follows: an entrance fee of $2, and monthly dues of fifty cents.</p>
   <p>Besides the administrative committee and the various commissions managing the internal affairs of the Society, the general assembly has organized three special committees: an editorial committee, a theatrical committee, and a committee of the fine arts.</p>
   <p>All these committees are already working assiduously at the realization of the objects of the Society, and the Russian colony of Chicago will soon witness the first fruits of their labors.</p>
   <p>The committees meet periodically when necessity arises. General assemblies of the Society are held regularly twice a month. These meetings are open to all those interested in the activites of the Society.</p>
