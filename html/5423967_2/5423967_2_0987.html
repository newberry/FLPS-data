   <p>Why do some of the celebrated Russian scientists either escape from U.S.S.R. or, if allowed to leave Russia temporarily, why do they not return to their native country?</p>
   <p>We have succeeded in getting some information about the reason for the exclusion of Professors V. R. Ipatiev and A. N. Chichibabin from the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
   <p>Professor Vladimir Nikolayevich Ipatiev, in spite of his high rank of Lieutenant General and his important office of professor of chemistry and member of the Academy of Sciences, always was and still remains a democrat at heart. He not only did not let his sons join the "Corps of Pages" (Pazheskiy Korpus) where the children of privileged aristocrats alone could get a military education, but even did not send them to an ordinary military school. Instead of that he sent all his three sons to the most democratic high school, where mostly children of poor parents--of shop-keepers, janitors and workmen--were taught.</p>
   
   <p>"I wanted my children," said Professor Ipatiev, "to learn all about the life of the poor people, and, after finishing their studies at the high school, to select such professions as would appeal to them."</p>
   <p>The fate of Professor Ipatiev's sons was a sad one and was the cause of much grief to their father.</p>
   <p>The eldest son, Vladimir, was killed in the World War. The second son was graduated from the faculty of natural sciences of a Belgian university and later was sent by the university to Africa, to the Belgian Congo, where he died of the yellow fever which he caught while trying to discover some means of curing this terrible disease.</p>
   <p>His third son, who is at present a professor of chemistry at Moscow University, had to repudiate his father, as one who belonged to the category of "those who refuse to return." The son was commanded to do so by the bolsheviki.</p>
   <p>"I have never meddled with politics," said Professor Ipatiev; "I was devoted to science alone. I have been spending all my forces, all my energy on scientific work, and will do so to the end of my life.</p>
   <p>"I have dedicated all my scientific knowledge and all my discoveries to my native country, irrespective of the form of government existing there. During the World War I was put at the head of the Chemical Committee of Explosives of the Defense of the country.</p>
   <p>"When I took over this work there were only 3,000 tons of explosives available. During one year I succeeded in building 22 chemical plants where all the chemical products needed by the army were produced--also such products which before the war had to be imported from abroad, chiefly from Germany.</p>
   <p>"Towards the time when the revolution started there had been accumulated in Russia over 3,000,000 tons of explosives. Thus this industry had become 100 times larger, and the Soviet government used these accumulated stores of explosives during the whole civil war, and also during the war with Poland.</p>
   <p>"After these wars had been liquidated Lenin sent for me and personally proposed to put me at the head of the Commission of National Production. Later I was asked to become a member of the Technical Council. Thus, de facto, I was a member of the Soviet government, and worked without respite for the good of my country.</p>
   <p>"At the same time I was made a member of the G.A.U. (Note: It may be "Gosudarstvennoye Akademicheskoye Upravleniye," which would mean: "State Academic Administration." D.S.) When it was resolved to diminish the number of members of this administrative body, Lenin said: You can eliminate anybody except Ipatiev.</p>
   <p>"You can see from that what a necessary person I was for the Soviet government," said Professor Ipatiev.</p>
   <p>"What compelled you to leave the U.S.S.R.? Political oppression, economic conditions or any other cause?" Such was the question we asked Professor Ipatiev.</p>
   <p>"No," answered the Professor. "We, scientists, can stand all kinds of physical and moral privations and discomforts for the sake of science.</p>
   
   <p>"But we cannot stand the interference of politicians with scientific work--an interference which becomes oppressive and curtails free scientific investigation. Let me illustrate this by an example: there have been cases when some half-educated commissar, who did not know well even the elements of arithmetic, would make to me such remarks as that: 'I can see, Professor, that the lectures you are giving, are not those that are needed.'</p>
   <p>"I was working in 1901 on problems of catalysis, in the realm of organic compounds and catalytical reactions; also on colloidal substances and phenomena of absorption. I was also investigating the pyrogenetic dissociation of organic substances and the preparation of aromatic carbohydrates from naphtha. And there comes an almost illiterate bolshevik and tells me that I am not giving the right kind of lectures. Naturally this sort of thing would throw me entirely out of gear, and I would return to my home looking excited and terribly pale. I may mention, by-the-by, that when I left Russia my lectures were taken from the archives where they were filed, and now they are read to the students.</p>
   <p>"Now it is just this bolshevistic oppression, this interference with the freedom of scientific investigation which is the chief cause of the dissatisfaction evidenced by Russian scientists. This is the reason why they endeavor by all possible means to leave the U.S.S.R. and not to return there when they have succeeded in getting out of it."</p>
   <p>These were the last words uttered by Professor Ipatiev about this subject.</p>
   <p>I asked the professor one more question, as to his position in America, and this is what he answered:</p>
   <p>"While I was still in the U.S.S.R. I proposed to continue some chemical experiments which I had begun already in 1905 with the purpose of getting a highly active gasoline out of naphtha (oil). But my proposition was not accepted.</p>
   <p>"When I came to America I communicated my projects to the gasoline producing firms. They immediately gave me all that was necessary for this work. They built a chemical laboratory, ordered or made all the necessary apparatus and instruments. And thus I was enabled to get the following results:</p>
   
   <p>"Previously out of 100 gallons of oil there could be extracted only 10 gallons of gasoline; the remaining 90 gallons were wasted, consisting of substances that were useless.</p>
   <p>"Now, when my process of extracting gasoline is used, the Company gets out of 100 gallons of oil from 60 to 70 gallons of gasoline. In other words, instead of 6 or 7% of gasoline which were extracted before, they are getting now from 60 to 70% of highly active gasoline the use of which allows aeroplanes to achieve a speed as high as 500 miles an hour.</p>
   <p>"My patent is used not only by the Gasoline Company with which I am working, but has been also bought by many oil producing firms in Europe and Asia.</p>
   <p>"I send all my scientific investigations to the Academy of Sciences in the U.S.S.R.; but for the sake of the principle of freedom of science I have refused to return to the U.S.S.R., and because of this I have been excluded from the membership of the Academy of Sciences."</p>
