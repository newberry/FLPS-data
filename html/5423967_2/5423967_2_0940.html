   <p>On January 6, the Supreme Court of the United States, by a vote of 6 to 3, declared unconstitutional and subject to abrogation the entire set of measures connected with the new agrarian policies inaugurated by President Roosevelt and known under the initials A.A.A. (Agricultural Adjustment Act). This decision, following a series of others that voided a considerable number of the legislative enactments pertaining to the economic field and adopted under the sponsorship of the Roosevelt Administration, deals a heavy blow to the entire structure of the American New Deal.</p>
   <p>As we all know, the A.A.A. was adopted in May, 1935. The measure was designed to relieve the agrarian crisis. Considerable overproduction of a number of farm products and the resultant sharp falling off in prices of practically all agricultural products, compelled the American farmer, burdened with heavy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> mortgage obligations and high taxes, to sell his products considerably below their production cost.</p>
   <p>The task assigned to the A.A.A. was to reduce farm production and establish a degree of equilibrium between supply and demand, in the American domestic market, at least. The strengthening of prices which would follow the establishment of such an equilibrium would result in increased purchasing power on the part of the farm population consisting of thirty millions of people. To comply with the provisions of A.A.A., the farmers would have to reduce their acreage, in conformity with instructions promulgated by the Farm Administration, devoted to several most important products. For this reduction in sown area the farmers were to receive certain premiums in cash from the Federal Government. The total amount of these during the enforcement of the A.A.A. reached the sum of nearly a billion dollars. To cover, at least in part, the expenditure involved in the administration of the Act, a special tax was to be imposed upon the processors of those farm products for which the farmers were receiving bonuses.</p>

   <p>Condemnation by the Supreme Court of the A.A.A. puts the Federal Government in a very difficult position in so far as its finances are concerned. This decision, first of all, repeals all the processing taxes, which, according to official estimates, were to bring to the Federal Treasury not less than two hundred million dollars during the fiscal year. On the other hand, even after the abolition of the A.A.A., the Administration will have to fulfill a whole series of contractual obligations to the farmers in respect to payment of the premiums on contracts concluded prior to the decision of the Supreme Court. According to the data cited by the American press, the farmers are due to receive on their outstanding contracts not less than six hundred million dollars, which sum was to have been obtained by the Federal Government by the imposition of some other tax.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, adoption of the A.A.A. forced the Administration to create the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, requiring a large and complex personnel of sixty-five hundred people. The Administration must now be dismissed.</p>

   <p>The decision of the Supreme Court was worded in such a way that it declared unconstitutional the establishment of any kind of control over prices of farm products or over farm production. One may assume, therefore, that this decision will be construed to cover, not only cereal, but other forms of farm production, as well; and that the laws controlling production of cotton, tobacco, and potatoes will also be repealed.</p>
   <p>Besides the consequences just enumerated, the decision of the Supreme Court puts at issue the question of whether or not American agriculture, although greatly strengthened during the past year, will be able to recover and develop without the aid supplied by the A.A.A.</p>
   <p>At the time of the introduction of the new agrarian policy by President Roosevelt the situation of American farmers was desperate and demanded immediate attention from the Federal Government in order to prevent a total collapse. At present, when the prices of agricultural products have been somewhat raised and stabilized, when stored surpluses of products--which formerly sharply depressed market <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a> prices--have diminished, it is possible to think that the Supreme Court decision will lead to another deterioration in the American agricultural situation. One should now note, particularly, the fact that prices on all products controlled by A.A.A. have not suffered any change since the Supreme Court decision became known.</p>
   <p>It is even possible that in the revival of American agriculture, which is now noticeable, a greater role was played by the poor harvest of last year than by the artificial reduction in acreage prescribed by the A.A.A. Quite symptomatic also is the fact that the reaction of the farmers themselves to this decision, seemingly unfavorable to them is far from being hostile or even irreconcilable. One should not forget that the A.A.A. in helping the farmer, used a great deal of red tape and many bureaucratic methods which, quite naturally, produced much resentment in American farming circles. Perhaps in the process of the economic revival which we observe now in the United States, and which, naturally, is spreading to the agricultural areas, the American farmer without any real loss to himself will be divested of the crutches supplied by the A.A.A. which helped <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a> him to survive the most acute period of the agrarian crisis.</p>
