   <p>The fight between Democrats and Republicans waged at election time begins to assume the proportions of a very hot battle. The parties, in the persons of their prominent and active members, subject each other to very severe criticism.</p>
   <p>The Democrats, as we all know, energetically defend their New Deal, initiated by the Roosevelt administration, and propose additional social reforms. Some of them even side with those who propose to limit the prerogatives of the Supreme Court and to amend the Constitution.</p>
   <p>The Republicans, on the other hand, carry on a relentless struggle against the New Deal, defend the Constitution, and approve of the decisions pronounced by the high tribunal. Some of the Republicans even go so far as to assert that the new course taken by the present administration will inevitably lead the country into utter economic chaos and to the establishment of some form of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dictatorship. Some anticipate a red dictatorship; others are in fear of Fascism.</p>
   <p>It is quite well understood that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats spare any words. As it always happens in a fight between political parties, the contestants often resort to demagogy and accuse each other of acts of which both sides are innocent. For instance, only recently a very serious controversy was going on between the defenders of the New Deal and its opponents concerning the resources of this country and the distribution of its wealth. Some of the Democrats contended that from sixty to ninety per cent of the wealth belongs to a small group of men constituting only one or two per cent of the country's population, and that such a state of affairs is a great injustice. Liberty League, to which Republicans belong as well as many conservative Democrats, calls such statements false and considers that they are put forward for the purpose of aggravating class antagonism and helping the Democratic party to win the election.</p>
   <p>The League in order to refute such statements has published figures tending to show that in 1934 sixty per cent of the national income was the share of those <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>whose income in that year amounted to $5,000 or less. The share of those whose income exceeded $5,000 amounted only to ten per cent of the national income, and the share of persons receiving $100,000 or over amounted only to one per cent of the total national income.</p>
   <p>The League also estimated that if all incomes exceeding $5,000 were distributed evenly among the entire population, every one in the country would receive only forty dollars, and that if all the wealth in the country were distributed evenly among all the people each one would have property worth only $2,400. Farther on the League asserts that annually from seventy-five to eighty per cent of the national income is paid in wages and salaries, and that consequently there is no ground for the assertion that the lion's share of the national income remains in the hands of a small group of people.</p>
   <p>There is no reason to doubt that many Democrats in their agitation resort to falsehood, but we also know that Republicans, Socialists, Communists, and other political parties are guilty of the same vice in no less degree. And all this <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>is quite natural, for politics and demagogy are inextricably bound together. It is not merely by accident that victories in the political field are won not by really prominent public men and statesmen but by shrewd demagogues.</p>
