   <p>My dear Mr. Novin: It is difficult to express how sorry I am that I was unable, on account of illness, to send you my greetings on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of your publication.</p>
   <p>May I now convey to you and to your editors my sincerest felicitations and best wishes for your continued success in spreading knowledge and culture, the only means of combating ignorance in this world. Please pass on my salutations to your editor in chief and to all your associates.</p>
   <p>In these difficult times, full of evil intentions and devices directed against truth and culture, the voice of the press, sensitive and responsive to all the attacks of evil forces, is of extreme value.</p>
   <p>I am also sending you my hearty greetings and my best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Z. G. Lichman,</p>
   <p>Rerich's Art Gallery,</p>
   <p>New York, N. Y.</p>
