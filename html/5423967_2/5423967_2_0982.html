   <p>The impression of the newcomers to America is that the dollar dominates here, and that nothing else matters. But if one had attended the meeting of the American Medical Association, this impression would have disappeared, says Dr. Nedselnitzky. Listening to the reports of hundreds of dispassionate workers, scattered all over the United States, one easily changes one's mind about the country of the "dollar," and sees clearly the striving toward pure science and the sincere eagerness to serve suffering humanity. Seventy-five hundred physicians were gathered at the meeting. The meeting was opened with a speech by the president, Dr. Thayer. During his speech, Dr. Thayer pointed out that during the last twenty years many fundamental reforms in the medical schools have put America in second place among the nations in respect to medical training. After the general meeting, which took place in the Auditorium, one of the finest buildings in America, fifteen sections of medical science were organized. Many reports were made; discussions after each report, exchange of opinions went on for three days. The physicians discussed anemia, the cure of which is helped by the use of liver for food; the cure of cancer by radium <span class="page-break">2</span>treatments; the cure of infantile paralysis by the use of a special serum. If used in time out of one-hundred sick children, only nineteen probably would have shown bad results. Many other sicknesses were discussed. Dr. Nedselnitzky pointed out that apart from a wealth of purely special information, many of the discussions were devoted to subjects of great importance and interest from the standpoint of the general public.</p>
