   <p>As is well known, on Monday, April 27, 1931, there took place at the City Hall the inauguration ceremonies on the occasion of Mr. Anton Cermak, new mayor of the city, assuming his post.</p>
   <p>On Friday, April 24th, immediately after the decision about the consolidation of the clubs, the chairman of the Russian Clubs in the city of Chicago, V. Kishun, together with several leaders, called a conference to decide about the participation of Russians in the inaugural ceremonies. After a brief talk with Mr. Cermak's personal secretary the Russian delegation was assigned six seats. To head the Russian organization was elected M. Mikhalchik, chairman of The St. George Brotherhood. The rest of the members were: V. Veliky, vice chairman of the Russian-American Club; Mary Moravsky, member of the administration of The Russian-American Club; V. S. Olesuk, member of the board of directors of the Independent Society and of the administration of the Russian-American Club; Dr. L. G. Pertsov, physician of the Independent Society, and attorney A. J. Pikiel, a political worker and counsellor on judicial matters in different Russian organizations in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The delegation left for the City Hall, where people were admitted only with passes. The delegation arrived with all members present and took a prominent part in the inaugural cermonies. Mr. Cermak was informed that the Russiansalso want to honor him. He expressed his deep gratification that finally the Russian colony also takes an active part in Chicago political life among other colonies that play a prominent role in the life of a city with three and a half million people.</p>
   <p>We shall express the hope that with the uniting of all Russian clubs in a Single Russian Club, after the amalgamation of the Russian Society "Knowledge" with the Independent Society, the Russian people in Chicago will finally form one single family and will take a proper place under the hospitable sun of America.</p>
