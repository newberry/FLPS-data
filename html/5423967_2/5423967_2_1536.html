   <p>In the early part of 1928 a letter from Prof. Linberg, Dean of Medical Dept., University of Smolensk, was read asking that the society become the patron of that University. He stated that the R. M. S. of New York had become a patron of Minsk University and that the German Medical Society had contributed to the University of Erlangen. A committee was appointed to devise means of raising funds. (From circular letter.)</p>
