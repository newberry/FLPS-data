   <p>A few days ago the poet worker, who published his literary work in our paper, visited our office. He writes under the pseudonym "Sibiryak". Who did not read his first literary experiments, which are sincere and youthful? Who would believe that a man fifty-five years of age, broken down with heavy sickness, would possess such a youthful passion and inspiration? A man who over fifteen years ago left his far native city on the Amur and who even to-day cannot forget his native river and his mother Russia, which he describes in his beautiful poem, "Vesienneye utro na Amurge" (A Spring Morning on the Amur). Russian Chicago grows and ripens spiritually. (Ed. Note: This refers to I. Churinov.)</p>
