   <p>Since the appearance of Rassviet ten years ago today, the Bolsheviks have not been able to sleep. Why? Because Rassviet declared war on all enemies of freedom, truth, and justice, and began to defend the right of every man to a free life, a life without dictatorship, persecution, and exploitation.</p>
   <p>It is a known fact that many Bolsheviks in this country work as secret agents for the Moscow government, are under the direct orders of Moscow, and are paid for their work by the Moscow Political Bureau. As soon as Moscow learned of the appearance of the anti-Bolshevik Rassviet, orders were issued to the Red agents in America to quash this publication and to nip it in the bud. Because in this country the Bolshevik agents could not use the outright methods and means of accomplishing their desires that they empley in Russia, they had to resort to roundabout, indirect methods of action. Believing themselves to be unsuspected as secret agents, they feigned friendship for Rassviet, and, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>under various guises, sent in their articles to Rassviet. Some of these agents had pretended in their articles to be anarchists, others white guardists, and still others liberal-minded defenders of the people's rights. However, unnoticeably, by degrees, they began to change their views, which were becoming increasingly "red". In all such cases, Rassviet always knew when to call a halt to the sham and cut off these wolves posing as lambs from contact with our readers. Further investigation has always shown that these "contributors" were on the G. P. U. (The Bolshevik Secret Police) payroll and sooner or later were recalled to Moscow.</p>
   <p>For ten years Rassviet has traveled a difficult, thorny road, especially during the years of the world economic depression. But neither financial setbacks nor Bolshevik provocations have succeeded in crushing Rassviet's great work. Rassviet's future is now assured, as it is the only Russian progressive newspaper in the United States and in Canada.</p>
   <p>Because of all the foregoing facts, Rassviet deserves the full support of all <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Russian workers. With their complete support, Rassviet will be in an even better position to defend the interests of all working people and to spread education and culture among the Russian people in America.</p>
