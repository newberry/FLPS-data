   <p>On December 28, 1924, the first performance of the opera "Boris Godunov" by Musorgsky took place at the Douglas Park Auditorium. Mr. Pfeffer, the organizer of this cultural undertaking, intends to acquaint the public at large with the Russian and Italian operas which are usually inaccessible to the average person on account of their expensiveness. Mr. Pfeffer intends to present it on a large scale. Besides the usual musical Fridays, he has organized also musical Saturdays and Sundays in different districts. For this purpose Mr. Pfeffer invited the best forces of our colony and all of our native talent. In this opera participated N. Karlash, Svetlov, G. Feygin, Dayen and others. The next opera, "La Traviata," will be produced on Jan. 4, 1924.</p>
