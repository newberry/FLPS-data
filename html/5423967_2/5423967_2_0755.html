   <p>One of the most prominent French economists and sociologists, Professor A. Ziegfried, [recently] read a report at the meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce on the economic situation in the United States. The economist had just returned to Paris after a trip to America. In his report he states that the economic crisis in the United States is being mitigated. The panic that gripped the country in 1929 and 1930 stopped in 1933. The purchasing power of the people is rising, and the number of automobiles made and sold is increasing very rapidly. However, the professor thinks that in this gradual return of economic well-being we must distinguish two processes--one that is natural, and another which is artificial. The artificial process has been set to work by Mr. Roosevelt, who by a series of measures is mobilizing the purchasing power of the nation. For this purpose he is forced to resort to the assistance of the banks. And the question now arises: is there any limit to such support? In the opinion of American economists, of those who support the fiscal policies initiated by President Roosevelt, the banks' resources are unlimited. The French economist does not quite share this opinion.</p>
   <p>As far as the natural process of mitigating the American crisis is concerned, it is developing very slowly but continuously. One quite favorable sign of the economic recovery that is taking place is the re-establishment of confidence. The immense sums of money hoarded during the last few years are beginning to come into circulation. The machines with which American industry was equipped during the prosperous years little by little are becoming obsolete and must be replaced by new and improved models, and this circumstance permits one to expect a revival in industry in the not very far distant future.</p>
   
   <p>In his report Professor Ziegfried discusses in detail the notorious American "reformers," particularly Mr. Townsend and Father Coughlin, the priest of Detroit. As we know, these prophets of better times propose extravagant means to put an end to the crisis. Thus, far instance, Townsend's project in its essentials centers around the payment of two hundred dollars monthly subsidy to each American citizen who has reached the age of sixty, with the provision that such money shall all be spent within the same month. The state by imposing and collecting a sales tax equivalent to two per cent of each purchase will put the money back in circulation, and this will lead to a revival in the economic life of the country. About the same sort of scheme is offered by Father Coughlin. The French professor considers the Townsend plan a very harmful Utopia, but he states that Townsend has millions of American followers--laborers, [other] employees, and farmers.</p>
   <p>There is nothing surprising in such movements. The distressful economic conditions in which millions of Americans find themselves drive many people to despair and make them follow blindly in the footsteps of various "saviors". And yet Americans have proved to be better balanced people than Europeans, for the latter blindly follow not only numerous Utopias but such chimerical schemers as the Bolsheviks and the Fascists, who instead of freedom and prosperity are propagating lawlessness and poverty.</p>
