   <p>On November 20, 1927, the "Russian Center" of Chicago arranged a celebration in honor of Leo Tolstoy at the large hall of the Y. M. C. A. at 1621 W. Division St. Speeches were made by Miss Jane Addams, Ilya Tolstoy Jr., General Yuzefovich, and Mr. V. I. Pustovoytov. There was a very interesting musical program in which some of the best artists participated: the well-known violinist Timofey Kromylov; the opera singer T. Zabludovski; Miss M. Gorshchinska, of the Polish State Opera; the opera singer T. Zabludovski; Miss M. Gorshchinska, of the Polish State Opera; the talented pianist Harry Luckman, and others.</p>
   <p>In spite of the interesting program the attendance of the celebration was not as large as was expected. One of the reasons was that several other Russian organizations had unfortunately arranged entertainments on the same evening. On top of that, the Russian Chicago Bolsheviki had made some propaganda against this Tolstoy celebration, assuring the people that it was organized by the "whites", evidently designating by this term all those who do not sympathize with bolshevism.</p>
