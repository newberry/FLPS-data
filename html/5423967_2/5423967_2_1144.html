   <p>In the section of our newspaper devoted to the "Life of Russians in the city of Chicago" there appear often notices informing our readers of the arrival of Russian artists in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Lately such arrivals have occurred very frequently. Artists come to Chicago and are dispersed, getting engagements in various American theaters.</p>
   <p>Only few of the Russian immigrants visit these theaters. Yet Russian artists act, sing, or play in these thoaters with great success.</p>
   <p>A few days ago I had the opportunity of going to one of these theaters. As usually the show began with a moving picture. After that came a short comic act. A singer sang some songs; next same a comedian; some music was played on the organ; scenes from the life of various cities were shown; there was some music. After one of the items of the program there appeared on the stage three Russian artists. The sound of Russian music filled the hall. The artists immediately captured the attention of the audience. The public became absolutely silent. When the artists were singing one could not hear the slightest noise, <span class="page-break">2</span>not a whisper, not any movement that would be audible. Complete silence set in.</p>
   <p>The artists were singing Russian folk-songs. One would think that these songs could be understood only by us. Russian immigrants. But it seems that the language of music is an international one. The wonderful melodies of these songs threw a spell over the large audience. The listeners did not know the Russian language, but felt the beauty of the melodies and the stirring depth of the music of these songs the words of which they could not understand. Every song was rewarded by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>When the Russian artists had left the stage one could hear from all sides such expressions of enthusiasm as "wonderful songs", "real artists" etc.</p>
   <p>When leaving the theater, one of the Russian immigrants was praising enthusiastically the singing of the artists and telling how regrettable it is that only few Russians visit those theaters where Russian artists are singing, acting etc. "These artists," these were his words, addressed to a groups of Russian immigrants, "made one travel in my thoughts to Russia; for several minutes it seemed to me that I am not in America, but in a Russian theater in my native country."</p>

   <p>And this did not happen at some concert of Shalyapin or Rachmanninov. Nor at some performance by Anna Pavlova or Maria Kuznetsova. It happened while the above mentioned Russian was listening to some melodies sung by modest Russian singers. Russian songs. Russian music, and Russian artists are making their charm felt more and more by the residents of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The following Russian artists achieved a brilliant success during the last few years when appearing on the stage of the Chicago Opera: F. I. Shalyapin, Gheorghy Baklanov, Alexander Kipnis, Inna Bursky. (By the by, Rosa Raisa, the now so popular opera star, was also born in Russia.)</p>
   <p>During the winter season sometimes that most talented composer Rachmaninov appeared in a musical performance; also the world renowned Russian violinists Misha Elman, J. Heifetz and Zimbalist.</p>
   <p>Russian singers have been continually singing in many theaters. We shall mention in this connection the names of Dnieprov, V1. Svietlov, Evgheny Stebelsky, Madam Dayen, Madam Kitayev and others.</p>
   <p>Almost in every theater you find several Russian musicians in the orchestra. Moreover from time to time there comes to Chicago some Russian chorus, or some well <span class="page-break">4</span>known Russian singer or dancer. In many theaters pictures of life in Russia are shown, and in such cases the orchestra plays Russian melodies.</p>
