   <p>"Russian songs full of life, songs of the brave". (Note: quoted from a popular Russian song. D. S.) Beautiful are the songs of our native country.</p>
   <p>Our guests, the Kuban Cossacks, sing them well.</p>
   <p>Some thousand Russians were listening to their singing last Sunday, at the concert in the Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
   <p>All these Russians, without exception, were delighted by the singing of the chorus.</p>
   <p>This chorus of Cossacks is a great musical achievement, a serious and interesting phenomenon in the realm of sounds and melodies.</p>
   <p>In every song, so well rendered by them, one could feel an artistic, original creation.</p>

   <p>With their very first song the Cossacks had conquered the public....</p>
   <p>Several Russian and Ukrainian melodies were cleverly combined by the conductor of the chorus, Mr. Sololov, into an interesting pot-pourri through the whole of which the melody of the Volga boatmen's song runs like a red thread. It was evident that all the elements of the theory of musical composition were well known to the composer of this pot-pourri. But the best number of all was, of course, the singing of "Ei ookhnyem" (the Volga boatmen's song) itself....</p>
   <p>Of the members of the chorus the following were particularly good; Mr. Zemtzev, a tenor possessing a remarkable falsetto, and Mr. Saveliev, a lyric tenor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grishayev, dramatic baritone, has an agreeable voice. Mr. Frykin has a winsome baritone voice. And Mr. Kolesnikov possesses striking bass notes in the lowest octave.</p>
   <p>As to the conductor himself, Mr. Sokolov, he is a man who had the highest musical training, and he conducts the chorus beautifully.</p>

   <p>The chorus is his child.</p>
   <p>He picked out the singers of the chorus and by dint of persistent work he created this artistic ensemble.....</p>
