   <p>Because:</p>
   <p>1. His honesty was never doubted, and even his worst enemies affirm his unselfishness.</p>
   <p>2. As mayor, he had nothing to do with the increase and re-classification of taxes, the responsibility for which rests entirely with the revision and tax committees.</p>
   <p>3. He was against Silas Strawn and Tony Cermak in their devilish plan directed towards a lowering of taxes for the benefit of downtown property owners. He is fighting the News and the Tribune, which are soliciting the help of small taxpayers for the enactment of a law seemingly with the object of effecting a higher tax on downtown groupings, and a lower tax on regions further away from downtown.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>4. He took over Chicago from his predecessor with a deficit of seven million and operated the city departments without any tax income for a period of two years, yet there is now in the treasury something like $1,500,000.</p>
   <p>5. Under Thompson's administration the Health Department indicated that the rate of mortality went down to 10.4 per thousand, which is a record for the city of Chicago not equalled by any other big city in the world.</p>
   <p>6. He solved the city's transportation problem. During his term a subway law was passed. Work will begin as soon as the downtown property owners are defeated in court.</p>
   <p>7. Last November he vetoed a Telephone Company project whereby he saved $40,000,000 for the people.</p>
   <p>8. The National Council for Insurance Companies affirmed that the Chicago Fire Department is not inferior to any fire department in the world, and but few are equal to her department.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>9. He lowered infant mortality by 50%.</p>
   <p>10. The milk in Chicago is more carefully tested than in any other city in the world, and in January of this year he achieved a reduction by one cent per quart of milk.</p>
   <p>11. As a result of economic management, and with the support of the City Council, the maintenance of all the city departments taken together is not more than the maintenance of the Police Department alone of New York City.</p>
   <p>12. Seventy-eight per cent of the city's bridges were built under Thompson, and 75 1/2 miles of city street widening was accomplished during his term. These perfections raised real estate values in Chicago by one billion dollars.</p>
   <p>13. Last summer the mayor paid good wages to 15,000 workingmen on public works.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>14. The mayor had always fought, and is fighting now, for higher wages to workingmen, for protection of the masses irrespective of nationality, race or religion, and against the oligarchy of organized capital.</p>
   <p>15. He restored confidence in the future of Chicago, as a result of which the financiers of the world invested their money in stock on splendid buildings, which are the center of Chicago's picturesqueness.</p>
   <p>16. Under Thompson's guidance, crime has been on the down grade in Chicago since 1915, as compared with other cities, except for the intervening four years, when he was not the mayor of Chicago. The Federal Government stated that among all the cities in the country with a population of 100,000 and above, Chicago, with reference to crime, occupies the 68th place.</p>
   <p>17. He gave to Chicago the most capable chief of police, and the best reorganized police department that this city ever had.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>18. He gave to Chicago a satisfactory system of waterworks, supplying one billion gallons of water in 24 hours for less money than in any other city in the world. Besides, this system has a reservoir with a capacity for 800,000,000 gallons per day, and it could be thrown into the main arteries within two seconds, should the city be threatened with a conflagration.</p>
   <p>19. Mayor Thompson straightened out the channel of the Chicago River.</p>
   <p>20. He put an end to the wrangling between the Illinois Central Railroad and the South Shore Railroad with the results of the electrification of the Illinois Central and the perfection of the great Grant Park, Field's Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, the Mars Field, and the territory for the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>21. With the help of the Board of Education, he took 73,000 children from temporary school makeshifts and transferred them to beautiful schools during the past four years. Thompson was always interested in children's welfare.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>22. He wishes to be your mayor not for personal interests, but rather because he wants to give to the population electricity, gas, telephone service, transportation, etc., at the lowest price compatible with a fair income on the invested capital.</p>
   <p>Mayor Thompson is your servant, not your master.</p>
   <p>Wm. Hale Thompson.</p>
