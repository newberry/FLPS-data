   <p>The second lecture, delivered by [Madame] T. V. Cherniavina before the Society of Friends of Russian Culture, was unusually successful and ended with an improvised banquet. Honors were paid to Madame Cherniavina, this truly remarkable Russian woman. Present at the lecture were many representatives of various Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>Madame Cherniavina in her lecture drew a vivid picture of present-day Russia, and showed those elements and factors of which the life of our native country is composed. She looked into the future of Russia. She told the audience about the Soviet children, growing under entirely different conditions from those that surrounded the old generation. She declared that, from the very first days of a child's conscious life, the soul of the child is imbued with three cardinal and fateful stimuli: need, dependence and inequality. A piece of bread, or even a crumb or a potato, represent in themselves real embodiments of these stimuli; embodiments <span class="page-break">2</span>deeply and firmly imbedded in the child's mind, which is not yet able to grasp ideas, symbols or other abstractions.</p>
   <p>The whole home life, all the cares and worries of fathers and mothers, their talks and quarrels, revolve around constant, unrelievable need. Constant scheming and ingenious strife for a piece of bread, the never-ending apprehension that there may be no bread tomorrow, compel children even in their early age to center (sic) plays and other recreations. Boys and girls in their earliest childhood, at three or four years of age, not only are glad when they receive a piece of bread, but become criminals and thieves through stealing and hiding stolen bread from their own brothers or sisters. The parents observe all this with astonishment. The same children clearly realize that this bread, or even a crumb, is given by somebody from the outside, by those who may give today and withhold tomorrow. Songs in which the USSR is pictured as the father and the UKP [Translator's note: The Communist party of Russia] as the mother, are composed and sung by the children who are firmly convinced that these <span class="page-break">3</span>"fathers" and these "mothers" give them bread, and that those fathers and mothers who work and hustle to exhaustion provide the meager existence. "One who did not eat potatoes does not know what happiness is", so runs one of the children's songs.</p>
   <p>Finally, no one can instill into the children's minds the idea that everyone has an equal right to food, to a piece of bread, and to the precious potatoes. Even the small children openly declare that only some children are entitled to white bread, while others have to be satisfied with the black variety; and that there are children who have no rights to food at all. For the children of school age this condition of the inescapable, all pervading trinity: need, inequality and dependence, becomes more glaringly obvious in all its manifestations as they acquire a wider knowledge of things, and become more conscious of injustices.</p>
   <p>Former classes of society do not exist any longer; but, at present, the school children themselves can differentiate between children of intelligent <span class="page-break">4</span>families and those from families of the workers or peasants; they know quite certainly and exactly that there are among them children of families deprived of all rights: children of kulaks [Translator's note: Kulaks were formerly, well-to-do peasants, now mostly those who refused to join the collective farms], children of workers and of party members. All these categories of children are separated and segregated by labels and other discriminations which are impressed on the child's conscience once and for all. Children of "servants of religious cults" and children of kulaks bear upon themselves the other children's odium which correctly reflects the unbearable conditions and the despair of their parents.</p>
   <p>The children of workers and state employees, whose fathers receive less than 150 roubles per month, enjoy the exclusive right of eating in the dining rooms outside their schools, while the school lunchrooms, or, rather the supplementary feeding counters, do not satisfy even the least discriminating semi-starved children. To gain admittance to the reserved eating places or to remain barred is the burning and ever-present problem for the school <span class="page-break">5</span>children. This is the pillar around which they build up their lives, hopes, and joys.</p>
   <p>The teaching personnel, of course, has nothing to do with this discriminating class or group fencing, with this cultivation of the trinity of want, dependence and inequality among school children; but, the administrative personnel of the schools, among whom are to be found many agents of the GPU [Translator's note: GPU is the secret political police under the Bolshevik rule] occupying important posts, is undoubtedly the author and creator of that quiet, bloodless terror which poisons and maims the child's life in its first tender buds.</p>
   <p>The Pioneers, swearing allegiance to the USSR [Translator's note: Pioneers, a Bolshevik organization for school children, similar in form to our Boy Scouts of America], of course, do not pass through a course of special training in espionage and treachery for the benefit of the Socialist state; however, the encouragement, the approbation, and the glorification of such <span class="page-break">6</span>deeds or misdeeds is cultivated with the help of rewards, and the wide publicity given in the newspapers to the "feats" of young informers, even when their activity in espionage work might be directed against their own fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters. Children of 12 or 13 years of age, thus, betray their own fathers and mothers, because they can get their piece of bread only by using all means--fair and foul.</p>
   <p>A boy 12 years old may betray his older brother, who would suddenly and unexpectedly return home after years of absence dictated by events of the [Ukraine] Civil War. Such "heroic deeds", of course, are not characteristic of the majority of children; but, the everyday life and circumstances surrounding it, within which this abominable conduct takes place and is accepted as something valorous and praiseworthy of youth, undoubtedly constitutes a phenomenon seen nowhere before and not endured or dreamed of by parents in any other country. Yet these very same children, while being victims and witnesses of this imbecile, forcible experimenting with human nature, work out within themselves something which appears to be an antidote, <span class="page-break">7</span>characterized by a very healthy skepticism, sound humor, and an invincible independence in imagination. The children, subjected to distractions and perplexed by constant changes in teaching methods and textbooks, nicknamed as "cursed Lord Dalton" one of the authors of the new teaching methods. The children, disgusted with daily-repeated and government-prescribed obligatory glorifications of Budenny's [Translator's note: Budenny was one of the Bolshevik military commanders who distinguished himself by daring cavalry exploits during the Civil War in Ukraine] valorous deed, sing: "Chickens and geese we will feed to the bourgeoisie and Budenny's cavalry we shall eat ourselves".</p>
   <p>Contradictions, inconsistencies, and complexities of the Soviet daily life, even for children, produce in their minds something of a juvenile wisdom of practical conduct, due to which the children, perhaps even more than grownups, observe the rule: "one should not speak all that he thinks".</p>
   <p>Within the higher institutions of learning the same basic characteristics of <span class="page-break">8</span>school life, and the same stimuli branch off more profusively, multiply and grow stronger while preserving the selfsame cursed trinity of want, dependence and inequality. "Social origin" is the factor which pre-determines one's chances of admission to a higher school. "Change of parents for a definite period" is a common occurrence necessitated by want and need. Elopements from home, falsification of documents, changes of name and vocation --all these anomalies are connected with the desire to avoid restrictions and discriminations imposed by the Bolshevik regime. They are fantastic and yet indispensable to the youth striving to receive formal education in the USSR. Favoritism, "pulls" of aunts and godfathers, social connections of parents purposely made and so well made use of in old Russia, have been resurrected, multiplied, and complicated to a degree never heard of before. However, what only an influential aunt could have done is being accomplished by "working around a machine". The status of one working by a machine tool is required in order that a young man or young woman may become a musician, mathematician or even an actor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>In such forms, Madame Cherniavina sketched the growth, schooling, and development of the Soviet youth, tracing it from the cradle to the university.</p>
