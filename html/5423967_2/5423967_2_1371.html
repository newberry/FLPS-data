   <p>On Wednesday, February 26, the first lesson in Russian dancing was given in the new field house in Humboldt Park. Twenty-two pupils came to take the first lesson. For the second lesson, which is scheduled for to-morrow, a much larger number is expected. The first class was attended by pupils of the Russian children's school maintained by Branch Number Eighteen of R. I. M. A. S. and by members of the Russian Youth Club of R. I. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>Because of the desire of many young people to take advantage of the dance classes it is necessary to join the school now, for after March 15 new pupils will not be accepted.</p>
   <p>Among those who took the first lesson were several children of other nationalities.</p>
