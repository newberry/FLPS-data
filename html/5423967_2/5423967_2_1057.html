   <p>About eight hundred Russian immigrants are working in the Boston Store. About 150 of them are real Russians, the remaining 650 or so are Russian Jews.</p>
   <p>During lunch time you can hear Russian spoken in every nook of this very large store.</p>
   <p>Many Russians are holding responsible positions in the store. There are some Russian foremen, managers of departments and experienced workmen.</p>
   <p>Many Russians do their shopping in this store.</p>
   <p>The workmen get wages; while the majority of the employees, the clerks, get only a very small salary, but are also paid a commission on the sales they make and earn much more money than those who are getting only wages.</p>
