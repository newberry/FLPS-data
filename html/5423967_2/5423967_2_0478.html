   <p>"Here must be considered the founding, only three or four months ago, of the Society for Aid to Political Prisoners and Exiles in Russia. At the present time this society has already around 150 members; each of them works valiantly for the good of this organization. This can be seen from the great financial success of the recent undertaking which brought in around $300. The question of exile has now begun to interest the Russian colony in America. It is hoped that in the future Russians in America will work to make such organizations flourish, the need of which is only too clear for every thoughtful man."</p>
