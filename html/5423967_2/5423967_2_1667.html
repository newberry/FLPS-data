   <p>Having lived in the United States for twenty years and always having read four newspapers--Rassviet (The Dawn), Golos (The Voice), Novoe Slovo (The New Word), and Noviy Mir (The New World), I have noticed that they are always fighting among themselves.</p>
   <p>If these four newspapers would carry on organizational work in America and Canada to organize the workers properly, then we would reach the heights which other nationalities have attained--but that we do not have. We do not have solidarity--we only slander each other with the aid of our four Russian newspapers. The newspapers among themselves also revile each other.</p>
   <p>Each of the newspapers prides itself upon being a workers' newspaper. Noviy Mir soon surely will be awarded the Komintern's premium for slander.</p>
   <p>If the Russian press would consider this important matter and gather the Russian workers into one solid organization, it would receive the gratitude of the entire Russian population in the United States and Canada.</p>
