   <p>The author recognizes that there is much discussion in the press about recognition of the Bolsheviks. In his opinion, if the Bolsheviks can prove that their government is an expression of popular will, it should be recognized. Otherwise it should not. The Bolsheviks suppress everything that resembles true democracy; they dissolved the constituent assembly because it would not recognize them as the government. As long as they cling to their fanatical beliefs they are a menace to democracy. Its leaders play on the ignorance of the masses. The Bolsheviks are Rasputins intoxicated by power. Being a Socialist, the author shares their economic views, but repudiates their tactics. The author bases his conclusions (so he says) on facts in his possession, and would be glad to be convinced to the contrary. Only then could he work with the Bolsheviks.</p>
