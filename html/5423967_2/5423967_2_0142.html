   <p>All Soviet indictments are very stupidly worded, and reveal no literary style whatsoever. Wouldn't it be possible to put someone on this job who really knew the general political line, and could write well? Perhaps he could devise a more ingenious plot, one that was less stereotyped, and wouldn't be laughed at by everybody.</p>
   <p>Indeed, in every indictment, the defendants are charged with one, aid to interventionists, and two, collaboration with some foreign consul or ambassador. At present, this stereotyped effect is somewhat modified by the fact that the consul is now invariably anonymous, as is the country he represents. This metamorphosis is quite understandable, however. Litvinov meets the [representatives of the] "criminal country" in the League of Nations, and because of this particular falsehood, he might be <span class="page-break">2</span>called a downright liar, which is indeed a disgraceful epithet. If a person accuses someone, he must submit some proof, some evidence. The name of the country suspected, however, is omitted--the line is filled in with dots; dots take the place of the name of the consul involved, and the person charged with the crime, is shot. This court procedure can find its analogy only in the Middle Ages. This particularly stupid wording is evident also in some other respects: in the amounts of money received by the saboteur--in this case by Mr. Nikolaev--from the mythical consul. He received five thousand rubles! But what [kind of] rubles? None of the [published] versions of the indictment mention "gold rubles," and, therefore, they must have been ordinary Soviet paper rubles. This was a surprisingly miserly consul--and surprisingly greedy traitors. They were willing to sell their country for a [mere] pittance.</p>
   <p>If the consul had been English, he would have paid Nikolaev forty or forty-five pounds sterling. If he had happened to be from Czechoslovakia, <span class="page-break">3</span>the consul would have paid only three or four thousand crowns. Think of it! A traitor could be bought for forty pounds!</p>
   <p>In all former court hearings, in cases where allegedly State Wreckers were involved, the figures ran immeasurably higher, and, therefore, we cannot understand why the communist Nikolaev should have appraised his traitorous wrecking services at many times less than the bourgeois engineer-wreckers. We can only conclude that it is much cheaper to buy a communist than a counterrevolutionary White Guard. Thus we see how carelessly the indictments are worded in the institution that was hurriedly created to replace the one [which was] just as badly tailored. [Editor's note: This refers to the Soviet government which replaced the Czarist regime.]</p>
   <p>Obviously, this institution must have writers who will shout to the entire world: "Death to the enemies of Soviet authority." Instead of shouting, they ought to help the Soviet authority from appearing ridiculous and <span class="page-break">4</span>shameful [in the eyes of the world].</p>
