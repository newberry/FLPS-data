After recounting all that Dr. Krasnov has done for the Russian colony during his residence in Chicago Dr. Chulok told the guests that besides being the founder of several Russian civic and scientific organizations Dr. Krasnov in the course of his active career has prepared and delivered hundreds of lectures on medical and scientific subjects before Russian and English-speaking people.</p>
   <p>The Oasis Club was founded at the time when social and political controversies were at their height, and when the cleavage between the opposing schools of political philosophy was widest. In its five years of existence the Club has attracted into its membership the most prominent artists, literary man, and lecturers, and by the constant care of Dr. Krasnov the organization has grown and prospered. At present the Club commands the attention not only of the Russian but also of the English-speaking intellectuals.</p>
