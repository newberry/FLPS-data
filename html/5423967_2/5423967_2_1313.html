   <p>The Russian prime donna, Inna Burskaya, continues to sing with remarkable success at the American Opera in Ravinia Park.</p>
   <p>American newspapers often give enthusiastic reports about her acting and singing.</p>
   <p>Some of the critics believe that, with respect to fame and talent, Inna Barskaya takes the second place after F. I. Shalyapin, our most talented artist.</p>
   <p>After the end of the season in Ravinia Park, Mme. Burskaya intends to undertake a short trip to Europe. After that she will sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.</p>
   <p>Mme. Burskaya is not only a remarkable artist; she is also an exceptionally kind woman.</p>

   <p>She is always ready to respond to every request for help. She is continually helping artists with whom she had been associated during her previous artistic career, chiefly former artists of the Russian opera, which was broken up.</p>
   <p>Mme. Burskaya occupies a very modest apartment in a quiet, cozy nook of Highland Park.</p>
   <p>She studies very much.</p>
   <p>Fame which is apt to give a swelled head to almost any artist, seems not to have affected Mine. Burskaya at all, and she is not elated because of her success - a success that only few artists have achieved.</p>
