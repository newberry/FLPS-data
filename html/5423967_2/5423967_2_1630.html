   <p>Dear Editor: Allow me to express my profound gratitude to Rassviet, and to its publishers and editors. My friends also join me in expressing publicly our appreciation of its splendid work.</p>
   <p>Every intelligent worker knows that Rassviet devotedly defends the interests of the working class, and guards the Russian group, warning it in time against charlatans and adventurers of all kinds preying upon the ignorance and credulity of our people. Thanks to Rassviet, the Russians in Chicago and elsewhere have accomplished many things, have learned much, and have saved many a hard-earned dollar which but for it would have gone into the pockets of grafters and swindlers.</p>
   <p>Rassviet has done and is doing much useful work in gathering our people together into groups and organizations. It has inspired many Russian workers to strive for more culture and more education. Much truth and knowledge has been instilled into the minds of the Russian people by our newspaper Rassviet.</p>
   <p>Much credit goes to Rassviet for its successful efforts in strengthening and expanding the two largest Russian organizations of mutual aid, the Russian United Mutual Aid Society, and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <p>Is it known to you, my dear editor, how much Rassviet has suffered from its enemies? Its enemies and ours continue to attack this newspaper because it enlightens the people, and correctly explains and interprets the life problems facing our group.</p>
   <p>Thanks to Rassviet, many Russian workers are beginning to be able to understand many complicated questions, and to distinguish white from black, good from evil. The newspaper Rassviet is the only progressive educational publication serving the entire Russian group. Every one who strives for knowledge, truth and information should read this newspaper. Rassviet is published by workers and edited by workers for the use of all Russian workers.</p>
   
   <p>Because of all the foregoing facts, we, [the Russian-American public,] should do something worth while, within our means and possibilities, to help our Rassviet. In the near future the two largest Russian mutual aid societies in the United States will hold their conventions. Rassviet has always supported these two organizations and helped them to grow and expand their activities. It would be, therefore, quite proper if our friends, the delegates who will come to these conventions, would pass a resolution of aid to Rassviet. For instance, each society could give a concert once a year for the benefit of Rassviet. It would not be difficult for either to arrange such a concert, and the money thus obtained would be very useful to Rassviet, which is in need of financial assistance at this time. There is no doubt that a little help like this, given as a token of public appreciation of its work, would give to Rassviet new ambition and new energy to continue its work for the welfare of the Russian group. Other national groups often arrange various social enterprises to help financially their own press. Why should we not do the same?</p>
   <p>The more we stick together the more impervious we are to all hostile forces endangering our national unity and our national well-being.</p>
