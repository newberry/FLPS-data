   <p>The American newspapers supporting the Republican party frequently publish articles directed against the Roosevelt Administration. Moreover, these newspapers print many cartoons, in which they mock and jeer at the present Administration.</p>
   <p>The press molds public opinion. The press does not always honestly and honorably serve the best interests of the public welfare; in the majority of cases it uses its pages to shape public opinion in favor of the political party it supports. For this reason, frequent press attacks are launched against the party in power and against the men holding high public offices.</p>
   <p>In recent weeks, many such attacks and a great number of pseudo-scientific arguments have been directed by the Republican newspapers against the "Brain <span class="page-break">2</span>Trust" in Washington. The aim of these attacks and arguments has been to convince the public that the present Administration is leading the country straight to ruin and to social and economic catastrophe.</p>
   <p>However, when we consider objectively the past and the present situation of this country, we come to a quite different conclusion. When the Republican party was in power, everything was sweet and rosy in the eyes of the Republican newspapers; they sang praises for the Hoover Administration while the country was on the verge of bankruptcy and, perhaps, revolution.</p>
   <p>We may skip the stock-exchange panic with the tremendous losses sustained by shareholders, but we must take note of the bank catastrophe during the Hoover Administration, in which hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of families lost their life savings. During those crucial days, the Hoover Administration was quite inactive and did not undertake any measures to <span class="page-break">3</span>counteract the bank failure epidemic. The economic crisis deepened, and more and more men were thrown out of work. When winter saw unemployment and want at their high point, when people were sleeping in tents and in barracks, the Hoover Administration remained unperturbed, and even would not believe there was any unemployment in the country. To make matters worse, the governors of many states sent reports to Washington in which they declared there was no unemployment in their states. Only Governor Pinchot of Pennsylvania had enough courage and honesty to tell the truth. In his report, he stressed the need of immediate aid, and said that in his state hundreds of thousands of people were suffering from starvation.</p>
   <p>When the Roosevelt Administration took over the reins of the government, the economic situation of the whole United States began to change for the better. Unemployment still persists, and the industrial crisis will probably continue for some time. But it cannot be denied that the economic situation at this moment is less critical than at any time during the Hoover Administration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Judging by the initial actions of the present Administration, President Roosevelt and his entire cabinet are convinced that fundamental economic reforms on a wide scale are inevitable, if prosperity is to return to the masses of the American people. The thirty-hour work week introduced by Miss Perkins has to be strengthened and more fully applied in all industries, in the opinion of the Administration. Social security and unemployment insurance have been made a part of our economic system by the Roosevelt Administration. Surplus incomes of Big Business are to be converted into special funds to be used for relief of the unemployed.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the legislative measures either already introduced or shortly to be introduced by the Roosevelt Administration are bound to improve greatly the economic position of the working people of this country.</p>
   <p>The Republican party, however, is using all the means at its command to <span class="page-break">5</span>counteract the measures introduced by the Democratic Administration, and to destroy the blessings of the reforms already in force. All these Republican efforts to thwart the policies and reforms of the present Administration have only one aim--the regaining of their lost power. But even if the Republicans did regain political control, the people of the country would gain little by it, and would stand to lose all the gains achieved during the Roosevelt Administration. The Republicans have proved they have no initiative and no vision, the two attributes necessary for changing or improving the condition of the people of the United States.</p>
