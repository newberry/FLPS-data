   <p>Last week, almost on the same day, two adventures were exposed, one in the Canadian province of Alberta and the other in the United States. As we know, in Canada there exists a "Social Credit" party, in the program of which is included the fantastic theory invented by a major of the British aviation corps by the name of Douglas; this party proposes to liquidate the persistent economic crisis by paying to each inhabitant of Canada twenty-five dollars weekly. Before the last election the Social Credit party, headed by a teacher, carried on very intense agitation among the people of Canada. The propaganda spread by the proponents of this theory, of course, had a certain influence on the population, particularly on the farmers, for besides paying twenty-five dollars a week for nothing they promised to reduce the taxes on the farmers' property and theroughly to seak the rich. As a result of all this propaganda the Social Credit party gained a victory in the province of Alberta, and most of the people began to wait for the dividends, the reduction of the taxes, and some other acts of benevolence from their new benefactors. But as might have been expected, the whole thing proved to be a soap bubble. Major Douglas, having convinced himself of the impracticability of his theory, went to England, leaving to his own fate the new premier of Alberta, Mr. Aberhart. The farmers began to bombard him with letters and telegrams, but there was no answer to their queries. Finally his patience was exhausted, and he appeared with a declaration to the effect that because of unforeseen circumstances he was forced to postpone the payment of dividends for an indefinite period. These unforeseen circumstances proved to be the inevitable lack of money. Moreever, the new provincial government, instead of lowering the taxes on the farmers' property, raised them. At present the people who voted for the new party are convinced that its promoters in reality are only shrewd political adventurers and not sincere protectors of working people as they pretended before the election.</p>
   <p>The other adventure was exposed in Washington in the investigations of the so-called Townsend organization. Members of this organization, as is known, appear to be more generous than their Canadian brothers, for according to their theory the crisis will end only after the Government begins to pay pensions to all persons who have reached the age of sixty at the rate of two hundred dollars a month. At present there are in the United States hundreds of so-called Townsend clubs and organizations. Members of these organizations pay ten cents a month dues. Since the Townsend movement appeared (January 1934) up to the present time the total amount of the dues paid by the members of this movement, according to the estimates made by one organizer, is nearly a million dollars, and according to estimates based on the data supplied by the latest quarterly financial statement of the organization itself the total paid in will amount to two million dollars. In the investigation it was discovered that the leaders of this organization did not care so much for the passage of the bill guaranteeing the monthly two-hundred dollar pension as for their own selfish interests. The salary of one of the organizers of the Townsend movement, it was discovered, was twelve thousand dollars a year.</p>
   
   <p>Others were getting $1,800 to $2,100 a month, and the rest received forty per cent of the money collected by them as dues. Thus, taking advantage of credulous people, a group of adventurers were receiving good incomes and had gained great popularity and even the support of the liberal elements in the country.</p>
   <p>In such a manner burst two new soap bubbles which in theory would have brought relief and security to millions of people.</p>
