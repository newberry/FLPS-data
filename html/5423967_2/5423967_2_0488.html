   <p>Chicago Russians, Russian Jews, and Poles and not a few Americans last night wildly acclaimed Mme. Katherine Bereshkovsky agent and representative of the Russian revolutionary propaganda. At the West Side Auditorium, Taylor and Center St. the spacious hall was filled to its seating capacity long before the time set for the meeting, while in the street outside surged many hundreds struggling for admission. Two policemen vainly attempted to control the crowd, which, despite the fact that the sale of tickets was stopped, forced its way into the hall.</p>
   <p>The punctuations of applause and cheering during the address of Mme. Bereshkovsky were echoed by the throng in the street, and at the conclusion of her speech in the hall Mme. Bereshkovsky addressed an open-air overflow meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>She spoke in Russian and without incendiary utterances, recited the wrongs of the Russian people and told of the progress of the revolutionary movement during the last forty years. She frequently was interrupted by cheering, and at the close of the meeting, as the gray-haired speaker seated herself on the floor of the stage, with her feet in the footlight trench, hundreds struggled to shake her hand, while cheer after cheer was given.</p>
   <p>Judge E. O. Brown, who presided at the meeting, was the only one to make reference to the sanguinary events of the day in St. Petersburg, none of the speakers having learned the details of the uprising. For a moment after he announced the report that many of their countrymen had fallen before the attacks of the troops, intense silence reigned, and then the audience burst into cheers for the revolution and hisses for the Romanoff dynasty.</p>
   <p>"I feel that my place is now in Russia "declared Mme. Bereshkovsky, in opening her address "The important epoch has arrived. In Russian prisons are perishing thousands who have worked and hoped for the event which now is transpiring.</p>

   <p>For forty years this agitation has been carried on with the object of teaching the masses the true state of affairs in Russia.</p>
   <p>Russians, Poles, Jews, Finns and other subjects of the Czar have been horribly maltreated, as all the world knows.</p>
   <p>"At last the important moment has arrived for the nation to arise and demand political freedom. Now all are ready to die for the cause. The uprising will not be confined to St. Petersburg, but in every portion of Russia, in cities and villages, millions will join in the protest.</p>
   <p>"Many here in America and in other nations no doubt believed the Russians were not far above cattle intellectually. The world did not know the development that was going forward, until one fine morning the nations were astonished to learn that an open protest had been made. But to Russians it was no revelation. All knew that the supreme moment was coming, and now that the critical moment is here, all parties and nationalities in Russia are united for the one purpose.</p>

   <p>Czar Nicholas has shown himself near-sighted and foolish not to have realized what the result would be.</p>
   <p>"But we must have sympathy and aid. America must sooner or later speak, and with the aid of free nations our task will be easier. We appeal to the nations of the world to help us appose tyranny. Forty years ago we were only a handful, now every class of people in every province is organized for the final blow. Many are in prison, many have perished, but as by magic thousands, tens of thousands, have risen to take their places in aid of the cause.</p>
   <p>"My purpose in coming here is to tell you these things, not because our organization is weak, but because we need sympathy and support and we will get it by letting the world know the truth. Many in this country are ready and willing to return to Russia and sacrifice their lives if need be to help free the nation from tyranny. The Czar is not what he has been pictured he is a weakling.</p>

   <p>Our dream is soon to be realized. The time for the final blow is here."</p>
   <p>Peter Sissmann, an attorney, spoke in Yiddish, appealing for financial aid for the revolution.</p>
   <p>Miss Jane Addams spoke of Tolstoy's prediction of a passive revolution and said the time had come for the Russians to demonstrate the new conception of freedom and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>"Three things are asked," she said- "freedom of speech, a free assembly and abolition of autocracy.</p>
   <p>All America can stand for these three things, and liberty lovers throughout the world can side with the movement."</p>
   <p>Dr. Theodore B. Sachs, who translated Mme. Bereshkovsky's speech into English, added on his own behalf that as a Russian Jew he had prayed daily for the success of the revolutionary movement.</p>
   <p>"As Russian Jews" he said "we love Russia, but we abhor the Russian government."</p>

   <p>Clarence S. Darrow, who had been announced to speak, was out of the city, and Jenkin LLoyd Jones was absent on account of a cold.</p>
