   <p>Since the publishing of the Soviet criminal code, one of the eminent Italian lawyers declared that said code was composed not by civilized people, but by savages.</p>
   <p>The same could be said of the Italian code, which was presented lately for approval to the Italian Supreme Council, which is called erroneously a parliament.</p>
   <p>The new Italian criminal code, as well as that of the Bolsheviks, has been composed undoubtedly, by ignorant, uncivilized people. Notwithstanding the abase statement this Italian code will be passed, without fail, by the parliament, and will empower the Fascist judges to make a mockery of the rights of the Italian people.</p>
   <p>One cannot, believe the fact, that the Italian people will always be under the yoke of the Fascist dictatorship. Sooner or later they will overthrow <span class="page-break">2</span>this cruel dictatorship and will abolish this code worthy of savages. But as long as the Fascist regime exists in Italy, the Italian people will be deprived of their rights.</p>
   <p>The Fascist code abolishes the 'man' and converts him into a chattel. Man, according to the Fascist code, cannot be an individual being, he is but the small cog in the State machine.</p>
   <p>The State stands above all, while man is insignificant. The Fascist Government will take care of this small cog, as long as its services are required. However, as soon as it outlives its use, it will be discarded.</p>
   <p>Man, according to Fascist understanding, appears to be the property of the State and, therefore, it uses him in the way it considers best. The freedom of the individual is but one of the bourgeois prejudices. The right to live is also a bourgeois prejudice and, hence, the Fascists establish capital punishment for political and criminal offences. (murder of the first degree ) Jury trials are also declared to be bourgeois. The lawbreakers will be sentenced arbitrarily by a judge and three counsels, who will take the place of jurymen.</p>

   <p>The difference between the Bolsheviks and Fascist codes consists chiefly in this; that the Bolshevik principle is based upon the antagonism of classes, while that of the Fascists has for its basis the welfare of the State.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks are trying to exterminate all their enemies; while the Fascists seek the destruction of all those, who are of no use to the State or are abstacles to the smooth function of the State machine. In general their principles do not differ very much form one another. Both these codes, the Bolshevik and the Fascist, have abolished freedom for man as an individual.</p>
