   <p>Still another news item, apparently concurrent with the article by R. L. Ossky, or else in its wake, is this rather significant news item, with its high praise for the wisdom with which the Federal Government planned the work for the Third Loan among the thirty foreign nationalities in the United States so that the work progresses with the utmost success materially and morally, and this great success is due to the fact that "among them were no Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, or extreme fanatics."</p>
   <p>(Note: The remaining two thirds of this article shall be translated fully for the implied inner jealousies in the colony as they seep through its life.)</p>
   <p>"In contrast to the others was the attitude of the Russian colony. To the repeated appeals and invitations to meetings some Russian organizations, rather than give this reason or that, even if out of mere politeness, for their absence, found it necessary to remain silent.</p>

   <p>Sad as this may be, one must admit that one of the reasons for the passive attitude of the heads of some Russian organizations to the cause for a Third Liberty Loan is the absence of advantages in this work.</p>
   <p>The second reason is the drive for supremacy and the refusal to accept a situation where others, not they , are the domineering elements. One of them, for example, the "honorable" chairman of a Russian organization, speaking with a press representative, frankly stated his indignation because he was not given charge over Liberty Bond sales among Russians.</p>
   <p>Others again, engaged in securing "ten million pairs of boots for brothers and sisters in Russia," became so steeped in the job that they left to others "the job of selling Liberty bonds."</p>
   <p>To the credit of the broad Russian masses one cannot fail to remark that despite the passivity of their leaders the great bulk of the colony evinces <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the liveliest interest in behalf of the loan, and are appreciably helpful. Certain organizations act likewise.</p>
   <p>It is of interest that some radical and moderately progressive organizations have joined hands in this work.</p>
   <p>In the name of Liberty for the entire world we declare that irrespective of convictions, views, and principles, all should immediately become fused in the single great common cause to liberate the world from German barbarity.</p>
   <p>Assist with every means to secure this liberation.</p>
   <p>Help as you can the United States Government because you will thereby render great assistance to our much tried native land.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Buy Liberty Bonds and prove that you also, Russian citizens, constitute a power in America.</p>
