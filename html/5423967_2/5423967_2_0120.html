   <p>After Kirov's assassination in Leningrad, American Bolsheviks began to weep over him at their gatherings. Meetings in his memory were arranged all over the country, on instructions from the Bolshevik center in New York. In the resolutions adopted at these meetings, those counterrevolutionaries who had stood at the head of the Bolshevik party during the last seventeen years were condemned.</p>
   <p>As is well known, prior to Kirov's murder Kamenev and Zinoviev occupied very important posts. The Leningrad branch of the G P U, headed by Medyved, was the stronghold of the Bolshevik regime. After the assassination, all of them were classed as counterrevolutionaries and White Guards, and were severely punished by Stalin. Their fate was unfortunate. Formerly, on their orders, thousands of people were killed, and now they themselves were put in jail. This was the result of Marxian-Bolshevik "dialectics".</p>
   <p>Obviously, the time is not far off when the Bolshevik dictatorship will fall <span class="page-break">\2</span>apart completely. The time will come when the Russian people will demand an accounting from the Kremlin soul-destroyers for their crimes.</p>
   <p>The Kremlin despots were not brave enough to say openly that Kirov's assassination was premeditated and executed by the Bolsheviks themselves, by those of them who disagreed with the "general policy" carried on by Stalin. They attempted to explain Kirov's murder by saying it was the result of a White Guard conspiracy, even though the White Guards had nothing to do with the crime. These false accusations were advanced by the Bolsheviks in order to confuse the Russian people. Then, and only then, were the culprits apprehended.</p>
   <p>Who will believe them, now that Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov, and others are numbered among their enemies and are no longer one-hundred-per-cent Bolsheviks?</p>
