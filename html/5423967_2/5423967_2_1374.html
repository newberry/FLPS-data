   <p>This summer on Soldier Field the Chicago city authorities plan to hold a dance festival. The Russian colony in Chicago has received an invitation to take part in the program.</p>
   <p>The Bunin Children's School has already decided to take part in the dance festival and without losing any time is preparing its pupils for their appearance. They are learning Russian and classical dances. For this purpose one of the best Russian dance masters has been engaged. Well-trained children may expect to win money prizes. City authorities permit this school to conduct its classes in the field house in Humboldt Park, where the dancing exercises will soon begin.</p>
   <p>For all information concerning the dancing classes apply to Mr. A. Bernov.</p>
