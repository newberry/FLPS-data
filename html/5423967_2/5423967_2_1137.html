   <p>The concert and theatrical performance arranged by the Russian progressive organizations of Chicago on Sunday, March 25, 1928, at Walsh's Hall for the benefit of the striking miners, was a success in spite of the Lent and the absence of dancing on the program.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with a speech by Mr. Radcliff, president of the Chicago branch of the A. F. of L., who very eloquently related the history of the origin of the miners' strike and the various phases of its development. The orator made a soul-stirring appeal to those present not to forget the 750,000 sufferers who are fighting for their rights.</p>
   <p>The comedy, "On a Revision," was another fairly successful number on the program.</p>
   <p>The picture "The Destitute Children," staged by Dr. Korablinov, deserves great praise. The children who participated in this picture received much applause.</p>
   <p>The concert opened with solos by Misses Maksakov and Groschinsky, who had <span class="page-break">\2</span>to sing several encores.</p>
   <p>Very good as usual were the young dancers, - pupils of Russian schools, taught by Mrs. J. M. Sholy. Mr. Chernyshev's string orchestra also pleased the audience.</p>
   <p>The greatest "hit," however, was made by the Moscow Quartet, which was something new for the Chicago public. Especially Mr. V. Barstov's magnificent bass voice was greatly appreciated by the public. Mr. V. Barstov had to sing several times.</p>
   <p>Our popular baritone, Mr. T. K. Korablinov, as usual earned much applause. He and Miss Maksakov also sang very well a duet.</p>
   <p>The Gypsy Camp Chorus sang several beautiful songs with which the public was very much pleased.</p>

   <p>Before the end of the program Miss Maksakov, at the request of the committee, went through the audience and collected $30.10. The proceeds from the concert were sent to Frank Morrison, Secretary of the American Federation of Labor, A. F. of L. Building, Washington, D. C.</p>
