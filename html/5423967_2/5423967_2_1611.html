   <p>Rassviet celebrates today the tenth anniversary of its existence. The entire Russian colony in Chicago, and especially all members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, join in the celebration and in the feeling of victory for the Russian cause in America.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is doubly proud of this great tenth anniversary because it was this organization that first espoused and then brought to fruition the idea of a daily Russian newspaper in Chicago. That was eighteen years ago. The publication continued for some time. Ten years ago, an independent publishing organization was set up which took over the job and gave us the daily Rassviet. The seed we had sown is now producing good, wholesome fruit, nourishment for the minds and hearts of the Russian people in Chicago. The daily Rassviet will be more and more appreciated by our people as time goes by and as Rassviet becomes stronger and stronger. The older members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society probably still preserve the copies of this first Russian daily newspaper in Chicago, published by their organization. For them the tenth anniversary of Rassviet should have a special significance. We should always remember that any publication in the Russian language, especially a daily publication printed in a foreign country, far away from our homeland, should be very dear to us and should receive our full support. Only by means of the press can we show to people of other nationalities living in this country, and also to our own people, all our achievements worthy of general knowledge.</p>
   <p>It is a commonly accepted axiom that by the press of a given national group in this country one can judge its culture and its general advancement. Any national group without newspapers and other publications in its own language is as good as lost, and has no future. Newspapers and magazines are the most effective conveyers of knowledge and culture to the people.</p>
   <p>The foregoing facts are the reasons why the Russian people in America should strive to have their own newspapers and magazines. Only by owning and supporting our press can we keep abreast of other national groups in this free country and avoid falling behind. If we consider the imposing number of persons making up the Russian colony in Chicago and near-by towns, we are led to the conclusion that we should have not only more than one daily newspaper, but also a few weekly and perhaps monthly publications.</p>
   <p>May Rassviet live and flourish for many years to come!</p>
