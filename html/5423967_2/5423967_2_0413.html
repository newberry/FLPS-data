   <p>We, a group of engineers from Russia gathered at Chicago, July 6, 1917, filled with joy about the brilliant success of the Russian revolution and the liberation of Russia from the autocratic yoke, send our hearty greetings and congratulations to the Russian Republic and to the great Russian people, as represented by the Russian Provisional government and the Soviets of the Workers and Soldiers Deputies. We firmly believe that the Russian Provisional government, according to the will of the people, is leading New Russia on the path to liberty and progress and, consequently, it should be supported by everyone who has at heart the interests of Russia. Upon considering this question we decided: (1) To organize the Society of Russian Engineers of Chicago and do all what is <span class="page-break">\2</span>possible for our native country during the time of our sojourn in America; (2) To communicate to the Russian Provisional government the hearty desire of everyone of us to return to Russia at the first call in order to serve the common cause with our knowledge and experience.</p>
   <p>The President of the Society,</p>
