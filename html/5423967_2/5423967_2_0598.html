   <p>There is an abyss separating the Russian colony and the Russian intelligentsia. The intelligentsia, because of its education, is far removed from the common people; the common people, because of their lack of education, are far behind our intelligent class. The people do not understand the intelligentsia and the intelligentsia does not understand the common people. Between these two classes there is no friendship, and, as a result, our public life suffers with inactivity.</p>
   <p>The people without their intelligentsia are like the army without its commanders; the intelligentsia without the common people is like a staff of commanders without an army. Neither group can accomplish anything important without the other. The people have no experience, the intelligentsia no power.</p>
   
   <p>It is true that the Russian colony in America has at its disposal but a very small number of persons belonging to the intellectual class. But is this small intellectual group interested in the life and affairs of the colony? Does it contribute anything to the common Russian culture and well-being of the colony?Does it properly represent the Russian people in the cultured American circles? If not, then why not, for what reason? And why is it, in the final analysis, that the people do not seem to be in need of the aid of our intelligentsia?</p>
   <p>Here is a problem that should make us think. One of the writers in Rassviet put the blame for all this upon the people themsleves, upon the colony. He states that the colony drives away the intelligent class from participation in its work. With this statement, of course, we cannot agree. It is true that the colony is rather cool in its relations with the intelligentsia, but, alas, the whole blame for it cannot be laid upon the people. They were brought up that way, and now it is not fair to demand more from them. The common people will always remain common people, especially the Russian common people, who came here from the western part of Russia, where except for the landowners they never saw anyone belonging to the intelligentsia class. This is why they are now so extremely cautious in their relations with the intelligentsia. Here, in dealing with anyone belonging to the intelligentsia, the former Russian peasant first feels him out, examines him, and applies all caution, as though afraid of having again to kiss the hand of his master. The common people crave the company of the intelligentsia of their own nation, the intelligentsia which would bring them light and not sneers and scorn.</p>
   <p>In order to fill up and level this abyss between the common people and the intelligentsia, it is up to the intelligentsia to become more national, to drop its ways of mockery and ridicule of the common people because they are uneducated and crude, and to live with them and help them become more enlightened and educated. So far our Russian intelligentsia keeps away from them and only shows itself among the common people once in a great while, while the intelligentsia of other national groups lives and works with its people.</p>
   <p>Here is an example: Not long ago there was held in Chicago a convention of the Ukrainian intelligentsia living in America. These people, unlike the Russians, had declared: "Because we are the intelligentsia, we are the leaders of our people, whether they like it or not. We work for the benefit of our people, we speak for them, we represent them where it is necessary, we write for them, sing for them, play for them, dance for them, etc." But what is our intelligentsia doing? When its representatives come to any Russian meeting and see that there are none there but peasants, they then turn about and leave. They do not want to have anything to do with peasants, forgetting that those peasants cannot in an instant equal them in education. At the same time, these peasants are the very substance of the Russian-American colony and of the whole Russian people; therefore, it is necessary to consider them and to work for them.</p>
   <p>Because of this lack of understanding of its own people by the Russian intelligentsia, because of this gulf separating the classes, there is always the misunderstanding and distrust so evident in their mutual relations. It is true that a certain part of non-Russian intelligentsia some time ago tried, for its own gain and convenience, to make this gulf between the Russian common people and their intelligentsia still deeper and more precipitous. They excited both sides to quarrels and squabbles, in order to step in themselves and enjoy the profits from the natural desire of the people for enlightment, education and the knowledge of the world around them. [Translator's note: By non-Russian intelligentsia the author means the Russian Jews who played, and still play, an important part in the Russian public life in America.] On the other hand, both parts of our Russian colony have a mutual disregard for each other on their own accounts.</p>
   
   <p>The colony can make a great advance, if this abyss between the people and the intelligentsia becomes filled up and obliterated, if neither one side nor the other will listen to those instigators, representing the non-Russian element, if the intelligentsia and the people mend their relations, and if they form a closer bond and extend their mutual support. As far as the R.I.M.A.S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society]is concerned, it, more than any other Russian organization in Chicago, needs that closer bond and mutual support of all Russians for the good and progress of the entire Russian colony.</p>
