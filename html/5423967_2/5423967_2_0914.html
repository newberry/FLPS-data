   <p>Often the immigrant newspapers in America marvel at the peaceableness with which the American political parties conduct their campaigns.</p>
   <p>If a Republican is elected instead of a Democrat, or vice versa, then the newly elected person converses in a very friendly fashion with the man whom he has displaced. They get together, they shake hands in all friendliness. The old one congratulates the new one for having been elected. The new one praises the old one for his good work, and the erst-while rivals part amicably.</p>
   <p>"How good it would be," sighs the immigrant newspapers, "if we too had it like this."</p>
   <p>Indeed, in the old world political strife is conducted without any mercy. In the past the monarchists in Russia would either send the Socialists into exile or to the gallows. At present the Communists more frequently shoot down the monarchists and less frequently exile them to Siberia.</p>

   <p>In Italy the fascist is heading for some sort of Christian liberalism, so as to better sock the workingman on the ear, and burn his libraries.</p>
   <p>Similarly in other countries (is this true). However, the difference of attitude may not be attributed entirely to the peaceableness of the Americans, nor to the poor manners of the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The old world is cramped. Each verst is populated by nearly one hundred people. There is no free land. Every place, whether on the farm, in the factory, in the stores or in the offices, has dozens of aspirants. For every plot of land owned by landlords there are dozens of landless peasants.</p>
   <p>In Europe, politics is a ferocious strife. One group aims to wipe out the other group, and this accomplished to divide the spoils.</p>
   <p>So far, America has no such problems. America has plenty of freeholds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The country is not yet exhausted, so that all may live in plenty.</p>
   <p>There is, of course, great exploitation of the working class by the capitalists. Still, one can live better here than in Europe, exploitation notwithstanding.</p>
   <p>This is why the American nation does not know yet what acute political strife is like.</p>
   <p>Besides, the foreigners, who are in most cases the unskilled, hard laborers, are also in most cases without the right to vote. They are not yet naturalized. The radical parties in America are as yet weak and few in number, and the Democratic and Republican parties differ but little from each other. They have no serious cause for bitter strife between them.</p>
