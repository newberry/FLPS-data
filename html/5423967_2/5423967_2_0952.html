   <p>The condition of peasants during these last years in practically all countries has become so much worse and so tragic that even the official press in various countries has begun to write about these forgotten men. The peasants are now living through the most distressing hardships in all countries--be they capitalist, fascist or socialist Russia. In India, according to government reports, the peasants now suffer from extreme poverty. The average span of life in that country, according to the same data, is approximately 23 years. In China chronic famine conditions prevail, just as in Bolshevik Russia. The other day American correspondents reported that, during the last few months in those territories seized by Communists, over three million Chinese peasants died from hunger. There were described recently in the magazine Neizo the conditions under which Japanese peasants live. The author finds that life for the peasants in the "Land of the Rising Sun" is becoming unbearable under the heavy load of taxation. In many localities famine conditions have existed for years and have lately been aggravated by continued drought. The distress drives many peasants to suicide. Mortality among children is increasing rapidly.</p>
   <p>Peasants in the European countries, excepting Russia, find themselves in better circumstances than their brothers in the Asiatic countries, but even they live through hardships never experienced by them before. For instances, Gazeta Warshavska describes the conditions of Polish peasants in this manner: "Peasant households with small, allotments of land--those that could not feed the families before--now find themselves in the most pitiful circumstances. Poverty is peeping through every crevice of the peasant hut. Economy has been carried to extreme forms. Most villagers live on potatoes; bread has become a luxury. There is no money to buy kerosene, and flint is being substituted for matches....."</p>
   <p>Last year in Poland there were many cases when entire villages were sold at auction for non-payment of taxes. Almost the same condition may be observed in all European countries, let alone Russia, where the conditions are still worse and where peasants are actually dying by the thousands from hunger, even when the crops are good. The farmers in Canada and the United States are also poverty stricken. According to official data, thirty-three thousand farms were given up in Canada during these last years, with a total acreage of five million acres. Total indebtedness of Canadian farmers on land exceeds $566,000,000, exclusive of the debts owed by tenants.</p>
   <p>The conditions of the American farmers are no better and are well illustrated by the following figures: in 1929, out of each thousand farms, 19.5 farms were sold for debts; in 1930 their number was increased to 20.8; in 1931 it was 21.1; in 1932, 41.7; in 1934 (despite the moratorium declared in many states) the number of insolvent farms jumped to 54.1 out of each thousand.</p>
   <p>The governments of various countries, instead of helping the farmers in some substantial way, are imposing additional burdensome taxes and impoverishing the peasants more and more.</p>
