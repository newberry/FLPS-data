   <p>Ten years ago today, the first issue of Rassviet appeared in New York. It was a happy day for all patriotic, progressive Russians in America, for they were witnessing the fulfillment of their persistent efforts to establish an independent Russian daily newspaper. This happy event in the life of the Russian group in America was of especial importance to those Russian organizations which were the initiators and chief financial sponsors of this daily publication. Ten years have now passed since that happy December day. We have a feeling that the present tenth anniversary of Rassviet will evoke similar happy emotions and a sense of deep satisfaction in the hearts of all Russian people in America.</p>
   <p>Rassviet had to overcome many difficulties in the first decade of its existence. The difficulties and the impediments were so much the greater because Rassviet was not a commercial publication, but a publication with definite cultural and educational aims, which it has pursued even in the darkest days of its existence. Our financial worries increased still further when the industrial depression <span class="page-break">2</span>swept the country and when the bank failures deprived many people of their savings. Our circulation suffered on that account. But despite all the difficulties, we have survived, and even today, when the economic crisis still persists and when many American and foreign-language newspapers have been forced out of business, Rassviet lives and will continue to live. That we still continue our mission and that our prospects for the future are good, we owe to the dogged determination of the men behind this newspaper to survive, as well as to the generous aid of the Russian organizations which helped to establish this publication ten years ago.</p>
   <p>Side by side with the financial difficulties, we had to face many troubles of a rather complex nature. As soon as Rassviet had appeared on the stands, other newspapers printed in the Russian language for purely commercial reasons began to attack Rassviet as their looming competitor. Various Russian political groups, especially the Bolsheviks, and local political bosses and other self-seekers who were living as parasites on the body of the Russian colony did not like Rassviet, and did all they could to kill it. We still have many enemies among our own <span class="page-break">3</span>group. There are, for instance many reactionaries who regard Rassviet as a revolutionary publication. The Bolsheviks and the anarchists (the home-grown species) brand Rassviet as a reactionary sheet. The church people call it the godless newspaper. Atheists find Rassviet too religious and too nationalistic. The extreme Russian nationalists call it the organ of internationalists. The internationalists regard Rassviet as a nationalistic publication. It is difficult to satisfy everyone. Only the cultured and the liberal-minded regard Rassviet as an exponent of high human principles, of free thought, of freedom, culture, and justice for all. And they are right. Rassviet, from its very inception, has served the highest human ideals and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
   <p>Rassviet stands outside all classes, parties, and religions. For this reason, Rassviet always presents all questions with complete impartiality. All social problems, all social evils and injustices, all violence, are always judged in Rassviet on their own merits, regardless of who is responsible for them.</p>

   <p>Rassviet devotes much attention to the life of the Russian people in Russia, who are suffering terrible persecution under the Bolshevik slavery. We also concentrate our efforts to present to our readers the true picture of the life of the Russian group in America. Rassviet regards it as its first duty to defend the interests of the Russian people and to fight their enemies. Otherwise, this publication could not be considered a Russian newspaper, but merely a newspaper published in the Russian language.</p>
   <p>The real merits of Rassviet and its worth to the Russian people are best expressed in the many interesting articles written not only by our editorial staff but also by our readers, and published in this issue of our newspaper. We deem it necessary, however, to note the fact that there still are many shortcomings and defects to be overcome before Rassviet can fully justify the trust and hope reposed in it by the Russian people.</p>
   <p>The defects of Rassviet may be divided into three separate groups: defects in ideals and policy, defects in the literary standard, and defects of a technical <span class="page-break">5</span>nature. There have been times when Rassviet displayed a certain instability and inconsistency in its ideals, and deviated from its basic principles. Lately, however, these vacillations have been done away with, and now Rassviet follows the true course of the principles which have been laid down for it, without stopping or hesitating in the face of any obstructions.</p>
   <p>The literary defects of Rassviet have not yet been entirely removed, because of the fact that our editorial staff is too small and is unable to edit carefully every piece of material that goes into the newspaper. The editor of Rassviet is often forced to do so many jobs at the same time that the quality of the material suffers and the literary level of the newspaper falls rather low. This unsatisfactory condition is the result of the financial difficulties experienced by Rassviet. Other newspapers of the type of Rassviet also find themselves in similar financial circumstances. Rassviet is not attractive enough typographically, owing to the limited selection of type in our printing shop, a condition which is due to insufficient funds.</p>
   <p>From all the foregoing facts, the following conclusion may be drawn: The greater <span class="page-break">6</span>and the more spontaneous aid and support Rassviet receives from the Russian people, the sooner all our shortcomings will disappear and the quicker the readers will receive a greater and improved Rassviet, improved both in form and substance.</p>
