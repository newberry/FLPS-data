His name is known at present to all the scientific medical world. He is professor of Neurology of the Illinois University and consulting physician of State Psychiatric Hospital; he also has held the office of president of the Chicago Neurologic Society....</p>
   <p>The Russian Medical Society has at present more than forty members, and in the very near future will possess its own headquarters--a reading room and club house--for its scientific and business meetings.</p>
