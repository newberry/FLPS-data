   <p>For a member of years many Russian colonists have written protests to the Chicago Library committee concerning the predominance of Marxian and Bolshevik literature among the books to be found in the Russian section of the Chicago Public Library, but all such protests were in vain. The committee did not pay any attention to them. Finally a collective pretest signed by several church organizations was presented to the city authorities. The matter received a public hearing last Friday. As witnesses the Library committee invited the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty of the Diocese of Chicago, the Reverend F. Turchenke, and the editors of the two Russian newspapers in the city, Mr. E. Moravsky and Mr. V. Cheslavsky.</p>
   <p>At the hearing it was definitely established that in the Russian section there is much Marxian literature, and that the other scheels of thought are presented <span class="page-break">\2</span>only scantily. There are only a few books on religious, philosophical, and immigrant subjects.</p>
   <p>As a result the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty in co-operation with Mr. Moravsky and Mr. Cheslavsky was entrusted with checking over the Russian catalog and compiling a list of books which are not to be found in the Library, but which should be acquired and placed on its shelves. All the books listed [by them] will be purchased for the Russian section.</p>
