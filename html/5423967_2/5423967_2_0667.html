   <p>Newspapermen, diplomats, statesmen, professional saviors of mankind of every description and others are straining themselves to the utmost in order to keep the turbulent world from being thrown into a new and more horrible tempest of war and human destruction. All their efforts may be regarded as good and praiseworthy, for even a very poor peace is better than a good fight.</p>
   <p>But with good intentions and pious words the road to paradise is paved. War is a terrible thing. It has been definitely condemned and men shudder at the thought of its horrible consequences both for the victors and the vanquished.</p>
   <p>All this is taken into thorough consideration by our peacemakers. And yet the more they speak of pacifying Europe the more they are concerned with increasing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their armaments, and their appropriations for war and national defense.</p>
   <p>As strange as it may seem, the most ardent advocates of peace, who are ready even now to turn swords into plowshares, in reality are the most persistent advocates of war and the most determined militarists. They are the ones who care most for military preparedness.</p>
   <p>Litvinov, with his peaceful talks, his demands for the security of the small nations, his pacts of non-aggression, gives nobody any rest. Bolsheviks advocating and threatening just recently to blow up the bourgeois world and start the conflagration of world revolution, crawl on all four before the bourgeoisie and Tories and swear by all Bolshevik gods in assuring their former enemies of Bolshevik peaceful intentions, of their hatred for war and the absence among Communists of any evil designs against the class enemies.</p>
   <p>While Litvinov's right hand promotes peace on earth, Voroshilov's left hand is militarizing the country by converting it into an armed camp.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"We are ready for the fight," shout soviet militarists. "We shall show the cursed bourgeoisie where they get off." In England, France, Italy and other European countries, the same double-faced policy is being pursued, the same military swagger. From the impoverished and destitute population the Bolsheviks take the last shirt and spend the proceeds from its sale on armaments. They all prepare for the fatherland's defense, for defense of a country in which millions of people languish in prison, concentration camps and exile.</p>
   <p>There was a time when Europe envied vanquished Germany. That was prior to Hitler's appearance on the scene. That was a happy time for the Germans, the upkeep of a small regular army, the size of which was strictly limited by the Versailles Treaty, cost very little. German youth did not feel the imposition of a compulsory military service. The government income was spent on the social and cultural needs of the people. German industrialists enjoyed unlimited credit facilities abroad. The number of unemployed was reduced to a minimum. Germans did not feel the pinch of meatless days.</p>

   <p>Since Hitler appeared the situation has undergone a radical change. The turn was for the worse. All gains have gone to naught. Hitler under much less favorable circumstances attempts to accomplish what the German Kaiser could not succeed in doing--in subjecting the entire European continent to German domination.</p>
   <p>English people, of course, are right when they regard Hitler as the most dangerous man in Europe. This man truly can do much harm to the world, if he loses control entirely over his ambitions. The European diplomats, sincerely desirous of preserving peace, quite reasonably point out that the new war, even if it results in a victory for Germany, will not put an end to the injustices perpetrated by the Versailles Treaty. It will only multiply and aggravate them. Prior to the war a great deal of combustible material had been accumulated. The Treaty of Versailles not only did not improve the general situation but actually made it worse. However, there are no reasons to assume that a victorious Hitler would impose on the conquered nations a more just peace treaty.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Englishmen again quite reasonably assert that there is no sense in fighting over something that can be attained by peaceful means. Taking lessons from the loss of the American colonies, England extended dominion rights to all other important possessions. Ireland, in fact, was accorded entire independence, although during the time of Gladstone English people were opposed even to partial Irish autonomy.</p>
   <p>During our times, Mussolini succeeded in snatching a very juicy morsel from the French without a fight. Why, then, should Hitler fight when he can accomplish a great deal by peaceful diplomatic methods.</p>
   <p>But Hitler, seemingly, has no patience. He, it appears, relies more on force than on diplomacy. Hitler, of course, is a dangerous man and needs to be watched. This watching should be done, however, collectively and by common effort. If in 1914 the Kaiser had known that the entire world would rise against him, he would hardly have dared to involve himself in the dangerous adventure.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>This is the reason why at present the English people are trying to mobilize all proponents of peace against all possible aggressors. All those who desire to preserve peace should rally against those countries which contemplate war. The latter countries are being segregated as possible bandits and disrupters of peace. This produces a very favorable mitigating influence on the rapacious instincts of the militant nations and it has a sobering effect on the mentality of the dictator mind.</p>
   <p>The world at present is divided into two hostile camps--those who want to fight and those who are opposed to any war. To the second camp belongs a majority of the nations. Preservation of neutrality under existing conditions is impossible. In 1914, Italy, America, Rumania and Japan were not bound by any treaty to the belligerent countries, and yet they had to take part in the World War.</p>
   <p>It is quite probable that English diplomacy will succeed this time, too, to mobilize a majority of the countries and their public opinion against war and <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>its possible incendiary, Mr. Hitler. But this is not all, and there is no guaranty that the pacifist camp created to-day will not fall out to-morrow, and that the day after a new combination of powers will not arise with different views and other aspirations.</p>
   <p>If Stalin can find a common language with the English tories, then who can assert that he may not fall in the brotherly embraces of Hitler at an auspicious moment? From friendship with Mussolini it is only one step to amity with Hitler.</p>
   <p>The Pope of Rome threatens that God's retributions will come on all instigators of war just because he has no army. With heavenly powers, however, he will not travel far. No pact or collective agreement will prevent war, the danger of which is appoaching with fateful inevitability with the growth of rearmament. The latter has reached a point of dizzy development. And if there is no force which will make governments desist from increasing their armaments one must expect a war despite all talks and pleadings for peace.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The last war has not taken away the taste for war. It means that more blood will be shed. Of course, new millions of men will perish, but many heads of war instigators also will fall beside the victims of the next world carnage.</p>
