   <p>In various parts of the city there are many Russians working in the furniture-making trade.</p>
   <p>Among them there are many skilled workmen, cabinet-makers and carpenters, but also many who have just learned to do machine work.</p>
   <p>Most of these Russians are working in the furniture workshops located either downtown or on the South Side.</p>
   <p>F. i., ten Russians are employed by the firm, "Chicago Furniture Company," at Clybourn and Osgood St. Not far from this factory there are some other furniture factories in each of which ten or more Russians are employed.</p>
   <p>Unskilled workmen are paid in such factories at the rate of 50 and 60 cents <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>an hour and work 54 hours a week. As an average they earn from $27 to $32 or $33 a week. Some are doing piece-work and can, by working very hard, earn about $40 in one week.</p>
