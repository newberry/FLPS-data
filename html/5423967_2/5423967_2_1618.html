   <p>I am sending you my wholehearted greetings on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Rassviet and its splendid work in behalf of all Russians in foreign countries abandoned by their own mother country, Russia. For no matter in what place in this world we may be, it is a foreign country for us, Russia alone excepted.</p>
   <p>I wish that the message carried in Rassviet--the good, sensible, and indispensable message that reaches the Russian people in this country--will spread and flourish for many years to come and will brighten the path for all Russians living outside of Russia.</p>
   <p>Your friend and admirer,</p>
   <p>Maria Kurenko.</p>
