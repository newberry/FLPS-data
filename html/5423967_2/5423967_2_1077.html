   <p>A considerable number of Russians are working in the Chicago department stores.</p>
   <p>Most of these Russians are employed in the hardest kinds of work; sweeping and washing the floors, working in the shipping departments, on the elevators, etc. In some of the stores there are Russians who are foremen. In one of the departments of the Boston store the foreman is a Russian immigrant by the name of Alexander Krivoy. We have been told that he fulfills his duties very well and has the reputation of an able and conscientious workman.</p>
   <p>In the Boston Store alone there are working about 200 regular Russians. Besides these there are also employed there about 200 other immigrants from Russia, such as Georgians, Jews, Germans, etc.</p>
   <p>In the Boston Store, as in other department stores, the wages are low; the average is from $17 or $18 to $25 or $26.</p>
