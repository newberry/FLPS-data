   <p>In Chicago there exists an excellent Russian church chair, at the Holy Trinity Cathedral.</p>
   <p>Not long ago the Znanie Society brought up the question of organizing a chair in Chicago, and this has been accomplished. The Znanie Society organized the chorus which, as we have learned, is under the direction of a very capable conductor. Several persons with very good voices have already registered; and to our belief, the day is near when we shall hear in Chicago thrilling Russian songs, performed by the chorus of the Znanie Society.</p>
