   <p>On February 23 eighteen years had passed since the day when the decree for the formation of the Red army instead of the "Red guard"was promulgated. Moscow newspapers devote a great many articles to this anniversary. In them all it is asserted that Soviet Russia is the most powerful country in the World and as such can carry on war on two fronts simultaneously, and that the Red army can crush any enemy who dares to set foot on Soviet territory; but on the other hand all these articles betray a panicky state of mind and imply that Soviet Russia is threatened with war by Japan and Germany.</p>
   <p>According to the information of the Soviet newspapers the Red army at present consists of 1,300,000 men. The old military ranks have been reintroduced in order to "increase the authority of the commanding personnel." Lately particular attention has been paid to the technical equipment of the army and to the construction of a fleet. The commander of the military forces in the Kiev <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>district, Mr. Yakir, presents these figures:</p>
   <p>Prior to the World War the old Russian army supplied by importation from abroad 89 per cent of its needs in automobiles, 90 per cent of its trucks, 100 per cent of its caterpillar tractors, 72 per cent of its artillery, and 60 per cent of its rifles. At that time Russia imported 75 per cent of its shells and 60 per cent of its cartridges. At present complete self-sufficiency has been attained in this regard, and Russia does not depend for such equipment and ammunition on foreign countries. All that is necessary for defense is being produced in abundance in the country and in quantities sufficient"for equipping our army with artillery, aircraft, and tanks in a manner not less adequate than the equipment of the best foreign armies".</p>
   <p>It should seem, therefore that since they possess so huge and so powerfully equipped an army, the Bolsheviks should not be afraid of any enemy, and yet the Kremlin is in the grip of a deadly fear. At the session of the Ukrainian Central Executive Committee the chairman of the Council of the People's Commissals, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Liubchenko, declared:</p>
   <p>"The whole world sees how German fascists in conspiracy with Japanese militarists and Polish landowners and officers are preparing a war on the Soviet Union. The entire world setup demands of us the utmost strengthening of the military defense of our socialist fatherland."</p>
   <p>From this statement one can only deduce that the Red army in its present condition is not in a position to crush any enemy. On the occasion of the eighteenth anniversary of the founding of the Red army the commander of the far eastern special army, General Blucher, in the order of the day addressed to his troops at Khabarovsk declared:</p>
   <p>"The threat of military attack again hangs over the far eastern confines of the Soviet Union. Playing with fire continues ceaselessly along our far eastern boundaries. Japanese militarism stealthily approaches our borderline both directly and through other territories."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>General Blucher calls upon his special army to be in constant readiness [to deliver a]destructive and crushing counterattack.</p>
   <p>The appearance of German troops in the demilitarized zone on the banks of the Rhine is also regarded by the Bolsheviks as preparation by German fascism for an assault on Soviet Russia, and several days ago Pravda gave space to an altogether panicky article in which it was stated that Japan has already completed all the necessary preparations for a war against the Soviet Union and will send to Siberia her army of two million men.</p>
   <p>If the Red army is really able to crush any enemy, then, we ask, why such a panic? We can explain this in only one way: if the Bolsheviks are not afraid of enemies from outside, then they are afraid of the enemies within, and they are principally afraid of that selfsame Red army which in case of war may do away with the Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>
