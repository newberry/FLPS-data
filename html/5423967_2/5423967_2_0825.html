   <p>A conference of housewives has opened in Chicago. A. Brown, an economist from Boston, delivered an interesting speech. In his report, Brown declared that the present industrial crisis is a result of the financial catastrophe of 1929, and the financial catastrophe in its turn, occurred as a result of the "economic illiteracy of the population".</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Brown, in the United States, only two per cent of the population know anything at all about economics, and ninety-eight per cent are completely ignorant of the subject. This statement is substantiated by the research carried on by the American Association for the Advancement of Economic Science. He also declared that in the United States there is only one city (Brookline, Massachusetts), where the pupils in all the schools, beginning with the kindergarten, are taught the science of economics and financial problems.</p>
   
   <p>In all other cities, these subjects are taught only in the higher institutions of learning, in the departments of economics.</p>
   <p>At first glance, A. Brown's idea may seem paradoxical, for until now, not one recognized economist ever claimed that there is a connection between the present crisis and the economic ignorance of the great majority of the people.</p>
   <p>Only Marxists claim that there is a connection between the intellectual condition of the people and their economic conditions. But even they do not think that the intellectual development of the people predetermines their economic conditions, but that the opposite process is true. Thus, ignorance, in their opinion, is not a cause but a result of the existing economic conditions.</p>
   <p>But if, for Brown's expression "economic ignorance," we substitute "general ignorance," then it will be clear that Mr. Brown is more correct than the "wise men" from the Marxist camp. In that case, his statement will not appear so absurd and paradoxical.</p>
   
   <p>A. Brown errs only in that he considers ignorance an active force which creates economic events of one kind or another. This is not true. Ignorance is not an active force, for it never created anything and never will. Ignorance is a total lack of knowledge, a vacuum, and, as a vacuum, it can create nothing. It may be used by both destructive and constructive forces for either good or evil.</p>
   <p>Since, however, the number of ignorant people is great, as compared with the cultured and intelligent people, ignorance has always represented a certain quantitative force which could not be overcome by the qualitative force of the cultured people. For many centuries in the past, the most advanced people all over the world strove to rearrange life on a better basis, but all their attempts were shattered against the rocks of ignorance, which were converted into the citadels of evil social forces. Formerly these fortresses were in the possession of capitalists and at present they are being captured by the worse forces of communists and fascists.</p>
   <p>The significance of ignorance as a main prop for all the evil social forces has not been altered, however: the slavery of the Middle Ages, feudalism, capitalism, communism, fascism, war, and all other social disasters could not have occurred, had it not been for ignorance.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are compelled to say that it is not economic ignorance alone, as Mr. Brown thinks, but general ignorance that is the main cause of all social cataclysms, including the present world economic and political crisis.</p>
   <p>If the preponderant majority of the people knew how to solve all social problems, there would be no unemployment, no need, no wars, and none of that political gangsterism which at present passes under the name of communism and fascism.</p>
   <p>The whole tragedy is not that all these things exist, but that people do not want to free themselves from ignorance--this main cause of all social calamities.</p>
