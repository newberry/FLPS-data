   <p>The Citizens Civic Club of Russian-Americans of Chicago, Inc., was organized in 1928 to interest Russians in Chicago in local community affairs. It has at the present time between 400 and 500 members including a large number of workers. The club explains American immigration laws to its members, urges Russians to take out their citizenship papers and gives them all necessary assistance in this.</p>
   <p>The organization is non-partisan in politics. It sponsors lectures on civic subjects and during campaigns explains the duties and obligations of citizens and the issues at stake. Meetings are usually held once a week; however, before elections the club meets more frequently.</p>
   <p>The secretary is V. T. Greevsky, 2305 N. Major Ave., Chicago. Telephone Berkshire 1181.</p>
