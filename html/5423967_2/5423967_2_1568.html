   <p>I am a native of the Carpathian mountain region, and yet I have read the newspaper Rassviet every day from the first day of its appearance. Rassviet, for me, represents my daily spiritual food. In it I find many useful and interesting articles. The newspaper always expresses the thoughts and aspirations of the Russians in Chicago and in the United States.</p>
   <p>During this new year of 1935, I wish this newspaper success in its task of uniting the Russian and Carpatho-Russian colony in America.</p>
   <p>I am delighted with the articles contributed by Minsky Muzhik, dealing with the sufferings of the Russian people undertthe yoke of the bolshevik tyrants.</p>
