   <p>A telegram with the following contents was sent to Senator Hardwick, Congressman M. London, and Congressman B. Mason.</p>
   <p>"We, the conference of the Russian Socialist Organizations for Aid to the Russian Revolution, protest against the persecution of Russian citizens in the United States; we protest also against the mobilization of Russian citizens for the American Army during the war, as we are deprived of the rights and privileges of American citizens during peace time. Finally, we oppose the forcing of the Russian citizens to renounce the loyalty to free Russia by forcing them to take out first citizenship papers.</p>
