   <p>The entertainment given by the newspaper Russian Herald was a colossal success both morally and financially.</p>
   <p>Already about 4 o'clock the vast hall of the West Side Auditorium became crowded, and soon the program of the concert was started. This program proved to be very interesting.</p>
   <p>We feel that it is our duty to say first of all a few words about our artists-guests who have been singing for the first time in Chicago for a Russian audience.</p>
   <p>Miss N. S. Meshayev, artist of the Italian Opera, has a beautiful and well trained voice. She sang with perfect ease a difficult aria from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the opera, "Traviata." After that she sang two excellent lyric songs.</p>
   <p>The first appearance of this talented artist before the Chicago Russians was appreciated by the public, and the singer was rewarded with loud and prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>The baritone, Mr. V. A. Dubinsky, was also singing for the first time in Chicago. Mr. Dubinsky has sung at the former Grand Opera in Moscow, has held an important position in Zimin's Opera; in America he has sung at Baliev's Theatre, "The Bat."</p>
   <p>Mr. Dubinsky's singing before a Russian public at the concert under discussion was a treat for all those members of the Russian colony who love Russian art.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dubinsky has a beautiful baritone voice. He sings easily and correctly <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the upper notes, accentuating every sound, which in the rendition of this talented singer get a peculiar meaning and power.</p>
   <p>The artist sang with great spirit "The Two Grenadiers," by Schumann, and "Ei Ookhnyem" (Song of the Volga Boatmen), but the public wanted to hear more of his singing. The applause was thunderous, and the talented singer had to appear again on the stage. Everybody tries to get as near to the stage as possible and to pacify his immediate neighbors. Now we listen to the wonderful melody of the Russian song "Nye Vyer" (Do Not Believe). When the last words of this song had been sung, a sort of sigh of regret was heard, and then again thunderous applause. This was a proof of the fact that the Russian colony had given this excellent singer a really hearty, warm welcome which he has certainly deserved.</p>
   <p>Miss Pava Maksakov, the favorite of the Russian colony, dressed in the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Russian national costume, sang several songs, among them the beautiful song about "the Russian easy life and the Russian fields."</p>
   <p>When appearing again in the second part of the program, the singer sang several Gipsy songs. The public gave a hearty reception to the singer, applauding for a long time.</p>
   <p>Miss E. L. Suesser who was accompanying the artists on the piano performed her part very well.</p>
   <p>As usually the public listened with great attention to the trio conducted by Mr. A. N. Kaminsky. The trio consists of N. A. Rukhadze (piano), N. A. Kaminsky (cello) and A. N. Kaminsky, the favorite of all of us, who also played a solo.......</p>
