   <p>On March 4, a business meeting was held by the Women's Progressive Society. The meeting was attended not only by the members but by the entire membership of the regional committee and by the members of the Russian section of the Communist party, with Mr. Deviatkin at the head.</p>
   <p>I have already written in Rassviet about the dissensions and squabbles in our Society. I do not know whether we shall live to see order and agreement or not. The trouble is that we, the women members, are mere members and have very little to say about administrative matters in the Society. In other words, our role is a small one: work and say nothing. Our real bosses are the "specialists," such as Deviatkin, Eberhard, Baran, regional committee members, the communist cell and other outsiders.</p>
   <p>And so it happened that at our meeting of last week twelve men came and took part perforce in the proceedings. They all came to defend our financial secretary, Arseniu Zibulia. I have written before that this woman for several years occupied the post of financial secretary, and when Madam Klimkova was elected to <span class="page-break">\2</span>this post she refused to take over the duties unless the financial books were audited by the control committee. Such a committee was elected, but Madam Zibulia insisted on party members taking charge of the auditing. To the great disappointment of Zibulia, Mr. Eberhard, one of the members of the control committee, at the preceding meeting, declared that the financial books were not in good shape. At the meeting on March 4, Eberhard, however, declared that the accounting was in good order, and that the retiring financial secretary owed no money to the organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Deviatkin, at this time, jumped to his feet and tried to defend Madam Zibulia, claiming that she was a party member, a very diligent worker, and that the accusations heaped on her were slanderous attacks conducted by Mrs. Klimkova, whom he called "a White Guard Woman," whose sentiments were inimical to the revolution. The women's voices rose in protest against this attack and Deviatkin was forced to yield.</p>
   <p>The meeting, after continual accusations and counter accusations, ended in uproar <span class="page-break">\3</span>and indignant cries directed against Deviatkin and Eberhard.</p>
   <p>To the rank and file members, the affair was a bitter disappointment, for the business for which the meeting was called was left undone, and the question of financial accounting still remains open and will have to be considered at the next meeting.</p>
