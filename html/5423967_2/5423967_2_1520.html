   <p>Recording his observations at this meeting the reporter gives for a background the slow process of assembling. At 9:30 P. M., when the reporter entered the hall, there were only about half a dozen people. The reporter was advised that doctors are slackers at meetings; that the Chicago Medical Society of 4,000 members has an attendance only of 150-200 people at its meetings. That doctors work late because their patients, workingmen, appear for care only after work. Then, too, there are night calls to make. Besides, this being summer, a good many are on vacations, some of them are abroad.</p>
   <p>On the whole it was considered satisfactory when twenty six physicians participated in this gathering.</p>
   <p>Exactly at 10 P. M. the lively chatter died down, and Dr. H. R. Krasnow declared the meeting opened, requesting that a chairman be elected.</p>
   <p>After a short silence Dr. M. Sahud suggested Dr. Hassin, who declined because <span class="page-break">\2</span>he was not familiar with the purposes of the pending organization. He suggested Dr. Sahud instead, and with the hearty approval of all present Dr. Sahud took charge of the meeting and requested that a secretary be chosen.</p>
   <p>Several voices named Dr. Krasnow who was at that time comfortably tucked away in a corner of the hall, but was obliged to abandon his nook and take his seat next to the chairman after repeated requests.</p>
   <p>The Organizing Committee's Report was first in order, and Dr. Sahud, who was also a member of this committee, in an introductory speech stressed the necessity for an organization of Russian doctors in Chicago, as much for their own sake as for the sake of the entire Russian colony here, for scientific purposes as well as economic.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sahud's motive for organizing was that the natives see them as competitors, hence their aloofness. Newcomers in the profession are met with open hostility. He felt that the Russian physicians need not feel a bit inferior about their own great savants in the profession--"they have, up to now, counted our Mechnikoff as a Frenchman. In Hassin of Chicago they discovered that <span class="page-break">\3</span>'he indeed possesses an excellent German mind'. Only for Maximov they are unable to invent something; here nothing can be done, he is a Russian, and that's all".</p>
   <p>Dr. Sahud stressed the need for organization among Chicago Russian physicians for the sake of a better understanding between the old timers and the newcomers, for mutual aid purposes, and also that the Chicago Intelligentsia may prosper; he concluded his eloquent speech with the remark that "We have convinced Americans of the great Russian Art by our Moscow Artists, we shall yet convince them how great and high is the banner of the great Russian scientific standard."</p>
   <p>Others at this meeting voiced the same sentiment, and Dr. N. V. Popov stressed the point that this organization should chiefly concern itself "with scientific questions on Medical regulations be it in America, abroad, or in their native land. Dr. Nedzelnitskii summarized the several problems of this organization but concluded that "time will show which ones should be stressed most; whereas, at the present moment the most important thing is to be organized."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Dr. Krasnow pointed out that, side-by-side with the American Medical organizations in Chicago, there "exist and prosper medical organizations of other nationalities also--Polish, German, Italian, Scandinavian, Bohemian, and others;" that all the more should there be room for an organization of Russians, whose position is more isolated and less favorable than that of the other nationalities. "The Russian Colony in Chicago is staggering in darkness, and is sinking in ignorance for the reason that it is less organized than are the others. Medical quacks have sent down deep roots, owing to broad activities of all sorts of pretenders to omniscience, and pseudo-doctors. All this the organization shall combat."</p>
   <p>The following participated in the discussions: Drs. G. V. Hassin, Piet, Berkman, Broide, Zipenuk, Herzfeld, Hilkevich, and others. All agreed that organization must be accomplished, and activity started.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that Drs. Nedzelnitskii, Popov, Sahud, Spivak, Treiger, and Krasnow (the latter also temporary Secretary), all of the organizing committee, should work out a declaration of purposes and problems of the organization, which would be submitted for approval at the next general meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It was also decided to publish in the Russkii Viestnik a preliminary sketch for publication purposed.</p>
   <p>Thus was laid the foundation of a new and very important organization.</p>
