   <p>In the town's vast smoky heart</p>
   <p>A new gray day is born.</p>
   <p>Morose shadows spread</p>
   <p>Around steel skyscrapers.</p>
   <p>Fog strolls calmly through the darkness.</p>
   <p>On State Street, thronged by day,</p>
   <p>The seething life is still asleep.</p>
   <p>Rails on countless roads</p>
   <p>Rhythmically squeak and hum.</p>
   <p>Factory whistles shriek.</p>
   <p>Life begins to be heard,</p>
   <p>Risen from sleep, an onrushing storm.</p>
   <p>Once more the mighty wave</p>
   <p>Of workers is moving.</p>
   <p>The streams of noisy streets</p>
   <p>Foam with swarms of people.</p>
   <p>Death every day here waits</p>
   <p>To end short lives with doom.</p>
   <p>Some grasp wealth.</p>
   
   <p>Others strive to cheat hunger,</p>
   <p>And others still worship idleness,</p>
   <p>Hooking some fish in the depths of sleepy pools.</p>
   <p>All we are slaves of Mammon.</p>
   <p>Our common device is the dollar,</p>
   <p>And seeking it we perish.</p>
   <p>Rejoice, man, cry and pray.</p>
