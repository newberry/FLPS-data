   <p>Almost in all American factories if has become customary to burden the Russians with the hardest, least remunerative work, demanding, though, no special skill. However, there is no rule without some exceptions. And one of these pleasant exceptions is one of the Chicago factories producing bedsteads made of metal. Out of the 90 men working in this factory, 15 were born in Russia. The administration of this factory is ready to meet all the requirements of such Russian workmen as are really willing to work. All these 15 Russians have good jobs and earn from 25 to 60 dollars a week, working in clean and large rooms. The office of "production superintendent" is a very responsible one and requires much knowledge. A Russian immigrant, Roshman by name, is production superintendent in this factory. He came from Russia some ten years ago and started by doing the plainest and most fatiguing work; but he succeeded in drawing to himself the attention of the administration, and now he has become a most necessary employee for whom it would be difficult to find any substitute. Unfortunately, there <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are few Russians in Chicago who have succeeded in getting such good positions. Yet it is a pleasure to point out that their number steadily increases.</p>
   <p>As an example of the good position which the Russians are occupying in this factory, I shall mention the following fact.</p>
   <p>When about a week ago the administration of the factory, together with one of the banks, had announced that any workman who wanted to accumulate some savings could, through the intermediary of the factory, deposit in the bank every week a certain amount of money for which he would get six per cent, 3% from the bank and 3% from the factory, the majority of the Russians answered this announcement and started to open savings accounts.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, there are not many factories in Chicago which give to the Russians such good opportunities as this one does; but we must not only hope, but be sure that the Russian workmen, who get more skilled with every day, will soon be able to occupy better positions in the American factories.</p>
