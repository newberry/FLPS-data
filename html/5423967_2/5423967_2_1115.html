   <p>The well-organized life in the land of our adoption in general, and that of its many national groups in particular, have shown that only those nationalities and organizations can survive and can retain and expand their influence which are properly organized, strongly united, and well disciplined. The example of other well-organized national groups has been followed, at last, by the Russian artists who live in Chicago. They have banded together and have formed a club, the Russian Artists Club of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Club recently gave a concert, which was a great success, both artistically and financially, the following Russian artists, members of the Club, participated in the concert: P. M. Maksakova, M. G. Rykova, A Grech, A. Grishayev, A. Dobrohotov, L. Zemtzev, V. Kitayev, S. Sokolov. After the concert there was a ball; members of the Artists Club mingled with the public, adding zest and interest to the entertainment.</p>
   <p>The Russian Artists Club is arranging another unusual entertainment, which <span class="page-break">2</span>will be held Saturday, December 1. The affair will take place in the evening at the Russian Democratic Club, 1902 West Division Street. Unemployed artists will be admitted free.</p>
   <p>The Russian Artists Club invites every Russian in Chicago and vicinity to come to one of their entertainments and become acquainted with the Russian artists and their way of doing things. Roman Rykov, the Russian-Polish artist, was the initiator and organizer of the Club.</p>
