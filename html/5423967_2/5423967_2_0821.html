   <p>In one Federal district court, a petition for naturalization was approved which had been filed by a foreigner who had at one time served a sentence for homicide. In another court, the petition of an alien who was sentenced to serve a jail term in a minor traffic case was rejected. In some district courts, persons with criminal pasts manage to slip through investigations and examinations and receive their second papers, once it has been established that during the preceding five years they have not violated any laws. In other courts, the violation of "dry" laws, or even city ordinances regarding trade practices, bar many applicants from citizenship.</p>
   <p>A number of such facts, indicating the need of establishing some definite rules and requirements for candidates for citizenship, were contained in a report read at the annual meeting of the National Council on Naturalization and Citizenship. This report, which raised many important points and was followed by a very heated discussion, emphasized the fact that the existing laws invest the judges who hear <span class="page-break">\2</span>the petitions with unlimited discretionary power to decide whether the applicant is eligible to citizenship or not. As a consequence, we see a very varied interpretation of the law, and many deserving aliens are not admitted to citizenship, while in some places, citizenship is accorded to undesirable applicants.</p>
   <p>A great deal of interest was provoked by the report submitted by the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization. Colonel D. McCormick urged the revision of the existing laws concerning the deportation of aliens. Starting with the declaration that some provisions of these laws are too severe, Colonel McCormick insisted on giving the Secretary of Labor the right to cancel the deportation of aliens who do not have criminal records, if the deportation threatens particularly cruel consequences and involves the disruption of a family. At the same time, he recommended that teeth be put into the law concerning the deportation of criminal elements--gangsters and racketeers especially.</p>
   <p>Colonel McCormick said that at the present time, criminal elements frequently <span class="page-break">\3</span>escape deportation, and persons guilty only of technical violations of the law are being sent out of the country. The law on deportations is mandatory as far as the Department of Labor is concerned.</p>
   <p>Neither the Secretary of Labor nor even the President himself has a right to cancel deportation orders, even if they consider the decision unjust. Consequently, there are many cases where a husband is separated from his wife and children are deprived of their parents.</p>
   <p>In one case the Department of Labor had to deport to Canada a two-year-old child, although they realized the cruelty inflicted on the family and the child, and the senselessness of the action taken. The deportation orders were given when it was established that the child had been brought into the country without proper entry registration, as a result of an oversight, while the child's mother was admitted into the country legally.</p>
   <p>Colonel McCormick cited several cases where deportation proceedings involved <span class="page-break">\4</span>sending persons guilty only of technical violations of existing laws, out of the country. Unbelievable as it may seem, the Department of Labor handles scores of cases every month, which involve the disruption of family life. Such deportations cannot be ended unless and until Congress either modifies the existing immigration laws and empowers the Secretary of Labor to cancel deportation proceedings against persons whose cases merit special consideration and leniency.</p>
