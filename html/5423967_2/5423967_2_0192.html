   <p>A year ago the Bolshevik agents so befuddled many prominent American Citizens with Bolshevik propaganda that some of them regarded the recognition of the Soviets by the United States as a most important and very urgent problem. The Soviet agents suggested that the recognition of the Soviet government would stimulate commercial relations between this country and Soviet Russia, and would regenerate economic life in America, since the Soviets were ready to place in America hundreds of millions of dollars worth of orders for commercial products, thus banishing unemployment at one stroke.</p>
   <p>For this reason many prominent persons, including congressmen and noted economists, demanded the recognition of the Communist regime by our Government. Now, however, as might have been expected, the same men and the country as a whole are beginning to awaken from this pro-Communist stupefaction brought about by Red propaganda. Now they understand that they have been fooled by Bolshevik agitators.</p>
   <p>Soon it will be a year since the day of the official recognition of Soviet Russia, and we have seen as a result of this action no benefits of any kind accruing to this country. Maxim Litvinov, Soviet Foreign Commissar, during his talks with President Roosevelt promised the United States huge Russian orders for American goods, but in reality Russian orders for the last year have not increased but have actually decreased as compared with the prerecognition period.</p>
   <p>Litvinov made the declaration that the Soviet government would in principle assume the old Russian debts to the United States, but that this question required further discussions which could be conducted only after the Soviets were officially recognized. Several months of haggling following the recognition brought the question no nearer solution than it was at the beginning of the discussions.</p>
   <p>In political relations the recognition has brought rather wild, bitter and disappointing results. While negotiations in regard to recognition of the U.S.S.R. by the United States Government were in progress American Communists kept their activities within certain limits of decency, so as not to impede the negotiations going on between Moscow and Washington. But after the recognition was an accomplished fact they spread out their immense Red propaganda from coast to coast. This fact alone greatly frightened and disturbed even those who not very long ago loudly voiced their demands for the recognition of the Soviet Union. Soon, Communist propaganda schools opened up in such centers as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other industrial and commercial centers of the United States. The same American Government which only a short time before had been the subject of high praise for its liberal views was now the butt of attacks by the American and Russian Communists. President Roosevelt was accused of becoming more and more a fascist every day.</p>
   <p>The audacity and great boldness of the American Reds have helped to awaken the American masses to the great Red danger threatening this country. The people themselves have begun to fight the spreading Communist blight. As an example of the awakening of the American masses to the Red danger we mention only the following two facts which speak for themselves: The people of the Pacific coast are organizing to counteract Red propaganda; public organizations in Chicago are instituting common action to fight Communism, which strives to overthrow the American Government and establish a bloody regime like the one in Russia.</p>
