   <p>History of the Russian Holy Trinity Cathedral Capella, p. 80</p>
   <p>The Russian Holy Trinity Cathedral of Chicago was founded in 1892. The present spiritual head of this well known church is the Most Reverend Leonty, bishop of Chicago diocese, assisted by the Very Reverend Sergius Snegireff, dean of the cathedral.</p>
   <p>The Holy Trinity Cathedral Capella Choir has during its long existence gained the well-deserved reputation of being the best trained Russian church choir in this country, with an extensive repertoire of classical, antique and modern Russian Orthodox Christian church music. In existence since the year the Holy Trinity Cathedral congregation was founded, the Capella was reorganized in 1916 by director V. T. Greevsky and the scope <span class="page-break">5</span>of its work widened considerably. Included in its repertoire were not only the beautiful prayer-inspiring chants of the Russian church, but also popular Russian melodies of great composers; ancient musical legends of boyar times; the plaintive songs of the steppe, the river, and of the common peasant.</p>
   <p>Music-loving American people of this great city and of the surrounding area have, during the past decade, honored the Capella with hearty applause on its many public recitals.</p>
   <p>On the present occasion the Capella, for the first time in its history, is appearing together with the other two Russian church choirs of this city, that of St. Michael's Church and of the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul, as a united choir in honor of this great Slavic concert.</p>
