   <p>On August 17, 1924, there will take place the opening of the Russian Cooperative Restaurant No. 2, at 760 Milwaukee Avenue. The cooperators are very busy getting ready for the day of the opening of their second restaurant.</p>
   <p>This time the cooperators went to work energetically, with assurance and skill, as they have learned their lesson well when they were organizing their first restaurant. They have found very comfortable quarters for the second restaurant, supplied with all conveniences; these quarters have been thoroughly repaired, painted and cleaned; new equipment has been acquired, and at present the restaurant looks just swell.</p>
   <p>A good staff of employees has been recruited; among them an experienced cook; in short, everything has been prepared for the opening in an exemplary way.</p>
   <p>(Note: - This restaurant existed for about one year and six months, when it had to be sold, as business became slack. N. K.)</p>
