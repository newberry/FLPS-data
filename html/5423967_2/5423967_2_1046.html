   <p>There are many so-called Russian-American firms in Chicago which are almost unknown to the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Among these firms we find the following:</p>
   <p>Russian-American Cement Company</p>
   <p>Accordion Manufacturing Company</p>
   <p>Food and Product Corporation</p>
   <p>Frock Company</p>
   <p>Oil Company</p>
   <p>Tobacco Company, and others.</p>
   <p>All these firms are called Russian-American companies. Two or three of these firms have commercial relations with Russia.</p>
   <p>Some Russian merchants living in Chicago, who have come from Russia, have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>been visiting Russia from time to time in order to make contracts with large Russian firms.</p>
   <p>A short time ago the merchant D. Brodin undertook a voyage to Russia with such an aim. He has returned to Chicago a few weeks ago.</p>
   <p>There are in Chicago some firms which receive from Russia raw materials. There are also some which export to Russia machines, tools, and various articles.</p>
