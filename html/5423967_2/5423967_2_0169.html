   <p>Last Saturday the bolshevik executioners killed fourteen more men. This time the bolsheviks did not kill White Guards [Translator's note: Partisans of the old regime], but their own comrades from the party, L. Nikolae and thirteen other bolsheviks from the opposition group. The Soviet papers publish official statements to the effect that Kirov's assassination was organized by communists--followers of Zinoviev and Kamenev. These conspirators were brought before a military court and sentenced to death by shooting. Their case, just as the cases of the first victims of bolshevik terror, was carried through in an inquisitional manner, behind closed doors, with no defense or mercy plea permitted. As a result the conspirators were executed immediately following the pronouncement of sentence.</p>
   <p>As far as the ringleaders--Zinoviev and Kamenev--are concerned, they, as was <span class="page-break">\2</span>to be expected, were not even brought before the court. According to reports from Warsaw, they were banished to Solovki[Translator's Note: island concentration camp in the White Sea].</p>
   <p>According to European newspapers, Stalin's leniency toward Zinoviev and Kamenev was dictated by Stalin's fear of shooting them, as was the case with Trotsky, for their execution might threaten the dictator's regime with serious consequences. Some of the European newspapers compare the current bolshevik terror to Hitler's purge of last year, when some of the prominent National Socialists were shot down. But it's impossible to compare these bloody events. Stalin's terror is many times worse than Hitler's terror. Hitler tried to eliminate only those of his comrades who sought to gain the upper hand in authority, and never touched innocent people. Stalin, on the contrary, began his purge with the mass destruction of the Russian people who had not had any part in Kirov's murder. Why did bolsheviks <span class="page-break">\3</span>kill one hundred and three men in Petrograd, Moscow, Minsk and Kiev? Nobody knows the reason, perhaps not even the red executioners themselves.</p>
   <p>It's true that the bolshevik press tried to implicate the victims in the terrorist plot, and the plans for a revolutionary coup d'etat, but this accusation cannot be justified in any way. Only idiots would think that preparations for a crime and its execution are the same thing.</p>
   <p>If preparations for revolution are a crime, deserving capital punishment, then, on this basis, all the communists in the capitalist countries, in so far as they participate in preparations for revolutionary coup d'etats and seizure of authority, should be punished by death.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are compelled to think that the bolsheviks killed one hundred and three men merely to intimidate the Russian people, merely to ensure their submission to slavery and hunger, so that they would not dare to fight the <span class="page-break">\4</span>bolshevik parasites and oppressors.</p>
   <p>If the bolsheviks destroyed one another as mad dogs do, perhaps it would not be bad at all. When, for instance, bandits of Chicago or New York destroy one another, it does not sadden or make anybody indignant. But when they attack innocent people, the population declares war against them. At present there is a war going on in Russia between two sets of political bandits--between Stalinists and various bolshevik opposition groups. However, innocent people suffer more from this war than do the bandits. Herein lies the tragic part of the latest events in Russia.</p>
