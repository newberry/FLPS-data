   <p>The Union of Russian Artists appeals to the Russian youth and to all older artists living in Chicago to join our union, to work together with us for the benefit of the whole Russian colony. Among the Russian youth there are many talented boys and girls, but their talents are not expressed on the stage.</p>
   <p>Parents! If you want your sons and daughters to represent and develop Russian art in the United States, advise your children to join our union of Russian artists where they can use their artistic abilities and can become artists.</p>
   <p>Russian youth--singers, dancers--we appeal to you to join our union, where by common effort we shall serve the cause of Russian art. Our membership fee is only a dollar a year. You can join the union by applying at the Russian Democratic Civic Club, 1902 West Division Street, between eight and nine o'clock every Tuesday evening.</p>
