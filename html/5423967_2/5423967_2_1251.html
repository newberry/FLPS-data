   <p>As I remember, one of the members of our Chicago colony complained in Rassviet that American film producers when they portray scenes from Russian life distort reality and quite frequently without any justification present our long-suffering native land in a bad light to the American public. To my regret this is being done not only by American film producers but also by our respected compatriots, and what is worse, they do it with respect to their own native art.</p>
   <p>Our immigrant dance girls in performing the prisiadka [Translator's note: A Russian folk dance] squat only on one leg, and the other leg is thrust forward. I am not a dancer, and I know very little about dancing, but still I think that squat dancing should be performed by men only. Women have never performed this dance in Russia while acting female parts. And besides, the dance cannot be executed successfully with a skirt on. If the skirt is long, it interferes with the movements; if it is short, the dance may be regarded as indecent.</p>
   
   <p>But here in America and in Chicago particularly our Russian dance girls in their desire to show off before the public do squat dancing dressed as women. I remember how briskly and gracefully the squat dance was performed by Miss Schadko on the occasion of the opening of the Russian-American Club, but she was dressed in wide black velvet pants with a red sash around her waist and wore a Cossack's fur cap and a Russian shirt. In all her appearance one noted her good taste and her thoughtful, loving attitude toward her native art.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately only a few dancers reveal so sensible an approach to the exposition of Russian plastic dancing. Very often they confuse masculine roles with those of females, and they wittingly or unwittingly distort national dances and falsify costumes, revealing lack of taste and knowledge.</p>
   <p>Thus many foreigners (not Russians) receive a false impression of this Russian popular art which it required centuries to create, the kind of art that has conquered the entire world without a battle, without shedding a drop of blood.</p>
   <p>Such art deserves to be treated with the greatest care and attention by every one of us and still more by those who have dedicated their lives to it.</p>
