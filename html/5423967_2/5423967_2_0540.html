   <p>On Tuesday, March 17, in the City of Chicago and all over the State of Illinois a registration of American citizens will take place for the purpose of qualifying the citizens to vote at the next election. Those persons who are not registered may not cast their ballots even though they are citizens of this country. In view of the fact that the next election will be one of the most important, and that the outcome of it will determine the future of the United States for a long time to come, the Russian-American Citizens' League urges all Russian citizens who have their second papers to register on the day appointed by the authorities.</p>
   <p>Registration in all precints of the City of Chicago and in the rest of the State will take place, we repeat, to-morrow, Tuesday, March 17. The registration places will be open from eight o'clock in the morning till nine in the evening. Those who have changed their places of residence since their <span class="page-break">2</span>last registration must register again. For those citizens who have registered before, and who still reside at the same address it is advisable to ascertain whether their names are on the registration books. We know that the names of many Russians who previously registered are not to be found on the lists.</p>
   <p>Find out in advance where your place of registration is, and go there to-morrow.</p>
