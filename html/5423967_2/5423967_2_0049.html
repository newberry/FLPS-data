   <p>Cowardice is the basic quality of villains. Fear of justice and fear of punishment always pursue a villain. His criminal conscience is frightened by the slightest rustle. He is afraid of his own shadow. There is no cruelty or crime to which a villain will not resort in order to escape justice or to postpone punishment, even for a short time. Such is the nature and psychology of the Bolshevik villains. Psychopathic criminals who shed oceans of human blood and destroyed a great country and its culture, who for many years amused themselves with crime and with the spectacle of their own destruction, cannot help but recognize their own crimes. Fear of the people's wrath and fear of punishment pursue the Soviet government like a shadow. Thus, there are ever new cruelties and crimes. This is the explanation for their ingenuity in the persecution of innocent men and women by inhuman acts and torture. This is the fear of human apes, conscious of their own crimes and pushed by this fear <span class="page-break">\2</span>to new crimes and cruelties. The Soviet government is in constant fear and it fears war more than anything else; it fears the Russian people whom it has so ruthlessly persecuted and destroyed. War is a terrible word for the executioners of Russia. This word implies an armed Russian people who will be stronger than their executioners. The Soviet government has not been guided by patriotic sentiments in its peace proposals, nor by anxiety for the future and fate of Russia, of the country which the Bolsheviks destroyed and despoiled more than any outside invader would or could have despoiled. What kind of patriotism can be professed by a clique of anonymous international villains who obliterated even the name "Russia" itself, destroyed the country's culture, desecrated religion, and defiled great memorials and treasures of national history? War for the Soviet government is like a summons to appear before an inexorable court of history, which intimidates the cowardly villains. The Soviet government does not fear a foreign foe. It fears the Russian people; it fears Russia, its wrath, and its vengeance. Whether in war or in peace, the Bolsheviks cannot escape the imposition of a heavy sentence from the court of history. War is the shortest way to the trial of bolshevism before such a court, and for this <span class="page-break">\3</span>reason, the Bolsheviks have a frenzied fear of war and are frantic and cruel in their persecution of their victims. In panicky cowardice and cruelty, the Soviet government seeks out the so-called undesirable and unreliable elements of the population in the large cities. Scores of thousands of innocent people have been seized and thrown into jails and concentration camps. These remnants of the "bourgeois" classes are only the tragic remainder of the former intellectual class of Russia. War has not yet come, but the victim upon whom the Bolsheviks, those criminal maniacs, intend to allay their animal fear and inhuman wrath, has already been chosen.</p>
   <p>The war of bolshevism against the peaceful population of Russia has been going on for nearly twenty years. It has been a more cruel and destructive war than any ever fought by the most ruthless alien conqueror. In this war of bolshevism against Russia, many millions of people have died of hunger or the sword; the achievements of Russian culture have been destroyed; the shrines of the Russian people have been desecrated and demolished; such great words as Russia, Motherland, Religion, have been eliminated from the Russian language. Temples <span class="page-break">\4</span>have been converted into stables. All over the world, various "friends of the Soviets" are selling the sacred treasures of the Russian churches. Russian shrines, consecrated by centuries of prayer, have been burned, destroyed, or thrown on the scrap heap. National treasures of Russian museums have been stolen or sold.</p>
   <p>Is not this, then, a war against the Russian people--a war, which in its ruthlessness and destruction is worse than the most horrible war of invasion? An elemental hatred of Russia is the essence of bolshevism. There are no bounds to this hatred.</p>
   <p>The most horrible crime of communism has been the annihilation of the intellectual class of Russia and the destruction of Russian culture, without which no cultural development is possible; the cultural traditions have been destroyed. The cultural regeneration of a Russia destroyed by bolshevism would seem to be a miracle of a far-distant future. Russia, as a cultural national and historical entity, no longer exists. The country has been <span class="page-break">\5</span>stunned by the blows of bolshevism. Bolshevism is a violent distortion of Russian history, of Russian national thought, and of the will of the Russian people. It is worse than the most barbarous form of war or the destruction of a conquered country. The periods of barbarous invasions, of wars and their destruction become insignificant compared with the barbarism and destruction wrought by bolshevism in Russia.</p>
   <p>One need not be surprised by the barbarism perpetrated today by the Bolsheviks on the tragic remnants of the cultured classes in Russia. The annihilation of of the Russian people and the destruction of Russia are the aims of bolshevism. The barbarous persecution of innocent people, the murders, and the deaths from starvation have been the systematic methods practiced by the Bolshevik regime for many years upon the Russian people.</p>
   <p>Fear is always the second nature of a villain. To kill in order not to be killed is the cowardly nature of an executioner. The Soviet executioners kill at random and persecute countless numbers of their "class enemies,"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>who are the entire Russian people. The present persecution of scores of thousands of people is, according to the Bolsheviks, a "patriotic" move. This action, they claim, is an extraordinary measure of defense of the socialist state from "the unreliable elements," and is dictated by the panicky fear of the Soviet government before the possibility of war.</p>
   <p>Patriotism is a current word in the Communist back rooms, and torture chambers of modern Russia. In the war which is being hatched in those torture chambers, patriotism will play an important role. Millions of men will be killed for the sake of "internationalism" and "socialism," but these words cannot inspire men to deeds of valor and sacrifice. Centuries of recorded history indicate, however, that one word will inspire such sacrifice. That word is "Patriotism". But this word, which has been so severely persecuted in Russia during these terrible years, in its Bolshevik application is only a deception. Who can believe in the "patriotism" of the murderers of the Russian people and the destroyers of Russia, in the patriotism of the anonymous names and pseudonyms of the "socialist international," in the men who suddenly fell in love with <span class="page-break">\7</span>Russia? The patriotism of the traitors and swindlers of Russia has demanded a horrible price: scores of thousands of innocent people have been doomed to death in the Soviet prisons and concentration camps.</p>
   <p>We may be able to quiet the newly made "patriots" of bolshevism. The hungry and oppressed people of the "bourgeois class" in Russia do not threaten them, in the event of war. But a terrible danger menaces them from the wrath of the whole Russian people, and particularly, from the Red Army, which the Bolsheviks, boast so much about. Therein lies the real danger, and therein is the cause of the fear and panic of the "modern patriots" of the Soviet regime. This is the real cause of the Soviet "peace" policy, which the Bolsheviks pursue despite their inherent warlike philosophy of class struggle. These peace demonstrations are only a way of warding off the inevitable and ominous threat of trial before the court of history, the approach of which is sensed distinctly by the "Soviet peacemakers".</p>
