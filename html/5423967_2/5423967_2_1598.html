   <p>Today marks the passing of ten years since the first issue of Rassviet left the press on December 8, 1924. Ten years is but a short interval of time, a brief moment, in the life of an organization in normal times and in favorable circumstances. But when we consider the economic difficulties and various other handicaps which had to be overcome by Rassviet in these ten years of constant struggle for existence, we readily realize that Rassviet's achievements are praiseworthy and that its success is most heartening for the future.</p>
   <p>The roots of the present daily Rassviet go rather deep, however. In 1918, when the Chicago Russian colony was roused from its slumber by the great revolution in Russia, a Russian publication called the Peasant and Worker came into being. It had a short life. The idea of a local Russian-language paper persisted, however, and soon another publication appeared, which was published irregularly --as a weekly, as a monthly, and again as a weekly--until December 1924. At that time, some of the more outstanding Russian organizations and private individuals got together and changed the publication into a regular daily newspaper, giving it the name Rassviet. The first issue of the daily Rassviet appeared on the stands December 8, 1924.</p>
   <p>For all its good work in informing and educating the Russian public, Rassviet and the men behind it are often the victims of rude attacks and much mudslinging on the part of Bolsheviks and others who regard themselves as anarchists and enemies of the present system of society. Rassviet has always been and always will be the newspaper for all the Russian people, no matter what their religious, political, or social viewpoints may be. Its pages are always open to all opinions. Everyone has a right to express himself freely in the pages of Rassviet on any and every subject he wishes. When we have free speech, free press, and free assembly, the people can always choose what is best for the greatest number of them, discarding what they think is nonsense and trash.</p>
   
   <p>Let us hope that Rassviet will live to celebrate its twentieth anniversary; that the commemoration will find us all in better circumstances; and that it will be witnessed and cherished not merely by our closest friends and a small group of supporters and sympathizers but by the entire Russian colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The continuation of our unremitting fight against ignorance, against economic slavery and exploitation of the poor by the rich, depends entirely upon the attitude of the Russian people. We invite all Russian people in Chicago and in near-by towns to become readers of Rassviet and active supporters in its fight for a better future for all Russians in America.</p>
