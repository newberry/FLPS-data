   <p>Last Saturday a meeting was held at the hall of the Auditorium Theatre on the occasion of the arrival in Chicago of a special Russian mission led by Professor Bakhmetieff. The meeting was organized by Russian, and in great majority by Jewish, socialist and progressive groups. The great majority of the people present at the meeting were also Jews. The number of people at the meeting might have been about 3,000.</p>
   <p>The hall of the Auditorium was magnificently decorated in red, with flags, and amongst them could be seen Russian white, blue and red flags. Appropriate inscriptions expressing honor for the Russian revolution and expressions of greetings for the mission decorated the walls.</p>
   <p>The mission arrived in the hall at 9:15 P. M.; it was greeted enthusiastically by the rising of the audience; the band played the "Marseillaise" and the "Star Spangled Banner."</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Comrade Krasnow, who called on Comrade Berg to preside it. Comrade Berg extended a hearty welcome to the mission in the name of the groups who organized this meeting. Following this, the band played a funeral march in honor of the recently deceased Russian revolutionists, as well as those who gave their lives in the struggle for freedom in the last hundred years.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Comrade Mark Khinoy, who spoke for the Russian branch of the Social-Democratic Party in Chicago. Ending his speech, he said that the present Russian revolutionary government does not intend to occupy Constantinople, does not wish to penetrate the Balkans, nor is it going to conquer Galicia. In the name of the United Jewish Workers' Parties of Lithuania, Poland and Russia(bund, the Yiddish name of the party) spoke Mr. J. Mile.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Lithuanian Section of the Socialist Party and the workers' organizations spoke Mr. K. Jurgelonis, who ended his speech with the assurance that Lithuania, Poland, Curland and Russia will become one great republic. He evidently is not interested in the news coming from his own country which affirms the genuine wishes of the Lithuanians for union with Poland.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Russian Progressive Parties spoke Mr. Yuriy Kozak and D. Ordovsky, very likely a Little Russian (Ukrainian).</p>
   
   <p>The first declared openly that he was a Cossack and that he had been a tsarist petty official and that he had not been able to learn anything in Russia except reading and writing. He had not learned anything there about the dignity of man nor about the duties of a good citizen. All this he was taught in this country. This simple and rather clumsy speech gave a true and clear picture of Russia under the tsarist regime.</p>
   <p>The speech of Mr. Orlovsky was of a pacifist spirit, which was the reason why the presiding officer asked him to discontinue speaking.</p>
   <p>After him Mr. Bakhmetieff, the leader of the Russian mission, was the speaker. He described the difficult conditions existing in Russia, which is forced on one hand to fight a powerful enemy and on the other hand must combat her own anarchy, spread by the adherents of the former tsarist regime.</p>
   
   <p>Ambassador Bakhmetieff extended to all present greetings from the new and free Russia, and gave assurance that the new and free Russia, in spite of tremendous difficulties, will have enough strength to retain and preserve the dearly bought freedom. His whole speech was circumspect, and with not one word would he affirm what former speakers promised, that nations comprising old Russia would have a deciding voice about their political status.</p>
   <p>After him spoke one of the members of the mission. He acknowledged the debt of Russian to the Russia emigrants and emphasized that freedom for Russia was won by the ideals of freedom acquired by emigrants in foreign lands, which they brought back upon returning to Russia, and that Russia broke the chains of tsarist despotism thanks to the emigrant.</p>
   
   <p>During the meeting an excellent orchestra played revolutionary anthems, and most frequently the "Marseillaise."</p>
   <p>The whole meeting came off quite well. But the small number of Russians present and their inept part in the program mirrored the whole moral misery of Russia, oppressing her peoples and keeping them in darkness and ignorance through centuries. This is the best proof that Russia will need great efforts and hard work to save, under such circumstances, and preserve what the present revolution has won.</p>
