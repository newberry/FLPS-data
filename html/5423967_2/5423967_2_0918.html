   <p>Bolsheviks quite often declare that only in the U.S.S.R. has woman attained complete equality with man, both in family and public life. Lenin himself once stated that "the inequality of women has been completely eliminated in the U.S.S.R." The same Lenin also declared that "a woman liberated from the kitchen should be able to rule over the state."</p>
   <p>But subsequently it appeared that in the U.S.S.R. woman was liberated in name only, not in fact. The kitchenmaid still remains at her old job, since even the Bolsheviks themselves have been unable to govern the state properly. Thus the woman in the U.S.S.R. has had her inequalities removed in law only; in reality, her position has become worse.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks regard the Russian woman as a"legal being" only because she works everywhere on equal terms with men. According to Soviet official data.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>there were 446,500 women workers in Moscow on January 1, 1931, and by January, 1934 their number had risen to 710,300. At present, Russian women work in mills and factories, in the building industry, in road building, and even in mines. All this the Bolsheviks consider a great accomplishment--the liberation of women.</p>
   <p>It is true that prior to the Bolshevik Revolution, the number of women in industry was very small,and there were practically no women engaged in such hard labor as road building and coal mining. Women were not employed in such work because they were denied the right to work but because there was no necessity for it, since the entire family could live on the earnings of the husband or father.</p>
   <p>At present, however, the entire family is at work, and yet it cannot secure for all its members even the very necessities of life. The women in the U.S.S.R. now perform the heaviest labor, not because that kind of work appeals to them <span class="page-break">\3</span>but because, like chain-gang laborers in this country, they are being driven to work, despite the Bolshevik laws on equality.</p>
   <p>Despite the laws on equality, woman's labor in the U.S.S.R. is paid for at a lower rate, a fact of which even the official Soviet newspapers quite frequently inform the outside world. More than that, the "liberated women" very often are subjected to such abuses and indignities as were not dreamed of in the days of serfdom. Thus, for instance, in Pravda of April 15, we find the following news item: "On a pig-raising farm of the Verkhosluinsk collective (in the region of Krasnouralsk), the president of the collective, Mr. Lebedeff, and the superintendent in charge of the pig-raising farm, Mr. Chernich, encourage the feeding of little pigs from the breast of the caretaker, a woman by the name of Votinova. The feeding of the little pigs from the breast of this woman was commended and was considered a praiseworthy example of 'shock labor'. They (the supervisors) were high in their praises when they related this at the plenary session of the Verchosluinsk County Committee, and at the regional convention of the County Collective Farm Representatives, where Mr. Uglov, <span class="page-break">\4</span>chairman of the County Rural Committee and a member of the Communist party, presided."</p>
   <p>This is the kind of equality that has been attained by the Russian woman under the Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>
