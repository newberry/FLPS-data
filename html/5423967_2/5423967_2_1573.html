   <p>To The Editor:</p>
   <p>Allow me to convey my greetings to you and to all your associates and coworkers on the tenth anniversary of your newspaper.</p>
   <p>It is a difficult problem for any Russian publication to survive ten years in these uncertain times with limited financial reserves and in the face of indifference and lack of response among the Russian people in general. Yet you have overcome all difficulties and impediments. You have passed unscathed through many trials. I hope that Rassviet will continue to perform its mission, and that in the future it will be able, am now, to surmount all the obstacles which it may encounter; obstacles are usually plentiful in the publishing business.</p>
   <p>Rassviet by its printed message awakens the Russian masses and raises their <span class="page-break">\2</span>cultural level.</p>
   <p>No other Russian newspaper in America comes so close to the Russian working people as Rassviet does. Rassviet reflects the manysided life of our colony in Chicago; it is always open to all opinions.</p>
   <p>Greetings to all editors, correspondents, composers, printers, and other persons associated with your great work. I wish you success in your difficult task. May it bring happiness and wellbeing to all the Russian working people in America!</p>
   <p>Reverend V. Antziferov</p>
