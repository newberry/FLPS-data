   <p>The Russian colony had the pleasure of greeting a rare guest, Alexander Alexandrovich Bublikov, who was a member of the state Imperial Duma, and the first minister of communications after the overthrow of the autocracy.</p>
   <p>A. A. Bublikov, after being commissioned by the revolutionary committee, had arrested Tsar Nikolas.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bublikov was invited to Chicago by the Section of the Russian 'Zayem Svobody' (Liberty Loan). In this behalf, on Wednesday evening, May 1, in Pulaski Hall, there was held a grand meeting. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Dr. Krasnow, who explained the purpose of the meeting, introducing A. A. Bublikov.</p>
