   <p>The fall season is with us again. The activities of the Russian organizations will again take on a more lively tempo. The rhythm and the character of all activities of the organizations are in turn reflected in the Russian press. Especially the daily Russian press serves as the mirror of Russian life in general, and plays an important part in all the work of Russian organizations and benefit societies. The organizations which have no close ties with the press, or which are not supported by the newspapers, usually lead a miserable existence. On the other hand, the organizations which work in co-operation with the newspapers, grow, flourish, and usually achieve great success in their work. For this reason every large Russian organization in America has either its own publication or maintains the closest relations with a friendly newspaper.</p>
   
   <p>Readers who are interested in world events, in the life of the Russian group in this country, and in the activities of Russian organizations should fellow closely their Russian newspaper, where they will find facts and editorial comment on everything worth their attention. The readers, on their part, may aid greatly in molding public opinion by active participation in the discussions on timely topics and on current events. The columns of this newspaper are always open to its readers. Readers of Rassviet are especially urged to write their views on any subject that interests them. The editors of Rassviet will be grateful for any valuable thought or suggestion sent by readers.</p>
   <p>Contributors and correspondents have a great opportunity to render useful service to the Russian reading public. The activities of Russian organizations, and of Russian public life in general will soon reach their highest point of the year. The correspondents duty is to inform the public of everything that is going on in their immediate surroundings. They may evaluate and may throw their own light upon the subject they describe, remembering that the duty of the newspaper is to censure and oppose everything that is bad, and to commend and encourage everything that is good. Naturally, the newspaper is primarily interested in facts and not in opinions. Neither readers nor correspondents should feel restrained from writing simply because of their insufficient knowledge of the art of writing. Any interesting item, any information, communication, any report or any other correspondence will be carefully corrected, edited and then published in the pages of Rassviet. It is necessary, however, to avoid all personal quarrels and attacks and to keep away from all abstract questions. The articles and letters should be as short as possible, should be clear in meaning, and to the point. The writer should confine himself as far as possible to presenting the facts and leaving the rest to the editors.</p>
   <p>The Russian press in America plays on increasingly important part in the lives of the Russian people in this country. Accordingly, the Russian readers, correspondents, and organization workers should make every effort to maintain the closest possible contact with the Russian newspapers. Only by thorough co-operation with Russian newspapers can the Russian organizations in this country prosper, Russian cultural and educational work go on, and the Russian national spirit grow and develop among the Russian people in America.</p>
