   <p>"The organizing committee of the present meeting asked me, as an official representative, to tell you, Russian citizens, a few words about the purpose of the Third Liberty Loan. I accepted the request with the greatest of pleasures for many reasons.</p>
   <p>"Firstly, it gives me great pleasure to speak to the colony and to tell it my opinion as to what direction it should take in these hard times which we are now enduring; secondly, I wish to tell you ...., that the present evening appears to be a great step ahead in the life of our colony. Up to now, as you know, we have had meetings of several different clubs, parties, and religions. The present evening appears to be favorable for an alliance of the colony; no <span class="page-break">\2</span>matter what parties there are, it is a national affair.</p>
   <p>"This is the first manifestation of our colony in behalf of this friendly country which has given us shelter and has treated us the same as other people, (enabling us) to enjoy freedom in spiritual and cultural development.</p>
   <p>"Russian citizens, the moment has come when you can and when you should declare the loyalty of the Russian heart to America for all that America and her people, and her most honorable representative, President Wilson, have done and continue to do for your injured mother country, and by so doing they do (the same) for each of you and to all of you likewise. You remember, my fellow citizens, when Russia, after the three years of bloodshed, of war, without provisions, without ammunition, hungry and cold, - was forced to <span class="page-break">\3</span>leave the battlefield. All had forsaken her. I do not want to criticize one of the greatest active men of England, Lloyd George. I am sure he did not want to give the meaning to the words he expressed in the very minute of desperation, but these words sounded as an insult to the Russian nation. You remember the words of Lloyd George, who pronounced them quite loudly, (saying) that Russia cannot fight any longer and therefore it is necessary to leave them to themselves.' Who opposed this decision in parliament? The representative of the American nation, President Wilson. He, as a wise statesman, understood the condition of our ruined Russia and was not afraid to step out in her defense.</p>
   <p>"You remember when three weeks ago we all were troubled by news that Japan had decided to occupy Vladivostok and establish its foot in Siberia.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"There is no smoke without a fire, and those plans no doubt have been (long) in preparation. But (who) mixed them up? Again it was the faithful friend of Russia, the representative of the American nation, President Wilson. The future historian of Russia (if only our country-will pull through this catastrophe) whose duty it will be to record the personal merit of the far-seeing man of politics of that great nation, and the Russian people, will be obliged to remember long the helping hand of the American nation in saving Russia from being devoured by Germany.</p>
   <p>"In what way can we, the citizens of free Russia who have emigrated to America, repay good for good?</p>
   <p>"War, my friends, is a terrible thing and, thanks to the culture of Germany, a cruel hyena. I shall not describe to you all the horrors of war. I shall only tell you that in order to conquer the spirit of <span class="page-break">\5</span>Satan which is the Kaiser, it is necessary to have many millions in the army and a yet greater amount of sound money. These are the means, my friends, by which we can and should help America, with our lives and with our pockets.</p>
   <p>"I kindly ask you to join the army and offer every dollar that you can get along without. Do not forget, my friends, that only by this you can prove that you still love our poor country and that you wish her liberation.</p>
   <p>"I wish to warn you that whatever you hold back now you will be sorry for in the not far off future. Russia as a nation, I speak to you with zeal in my heart, at this very minute does not exist.</p>
   <p>"In order to save Russia, its honor and its right to existence, it is <span class="page-break">\6</span>necessary that the Allies should crush the hydra of German militarism. We should conquer, and if the endeavors of our Allies fail, then good-by fatherland, good-by honor, good-by liberty of the Russian nation and the democracy of all the world - all will go for nothing and we all shall be under Germany. And do you know what this means? It is easier to take a rope and to tighten up the noose around our own neck and kick for a while our legs in the air.</p>
   <p>"Offer your dollars, hard-working Russian fellow countrymen, and the Righteous God will reward you for the fulfillment of a duty of honor."</p>
