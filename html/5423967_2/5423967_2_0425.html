   <p>(5) The return to the parishioners of all Russian church property appropriated by the bishops. (6) Dismissal of all former tsarist officials, consuls, and representatives in America and their replacement by representatives of free Russia. (7) The taking of measures against the Russian clergy, which agitates against the new people's government and for the restoration of monarchy in Russia. (8) The confiscation in favor of the people of all the property received as a reward for service to the former tsars. (9) Prohibition of the sale of liquors. (10) Russia should be a democratic republic. (11) The introduction of obligatory general education for the people. (12) The expression of deep thanks to the American republic, which has taken under its protection all Russians who suffered from the former tsarist regime."</p>
   <p>The present resolution was worked out after a grand manifestation in <span class="page-break">\3</span>honor of liberty and unanimously accepted by the Russian-Ukrainian massmeeting, and it was resolved to send it immediately to the Russian State Duma.</p>
   <p>Note: This resolution is an expression of the public opinion of the progressive part of the Russian colony in Chicago, which was hostile to the tsarist regime. In general one could safely say that almost the whole Russian colony was supporting at that time the Provisional government of Kerensky, with the exception of a small number of persons who belonged to different political movements more to the left than the government of Kerensky. This resolution reflects the frame of mind of the great majority of Russians in Chicago. N. K.</p>
