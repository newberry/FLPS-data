   <p>The following are excerpts from newspapers abroad commenting on Belorusskaya Tribuna in Chicago:</p>
   <p>Belorusskaya Sprava (White Russian Recorder) of Vilna points out that inasmuch as the object of this publication is to bring back to their own language and culture those White Russians in America who fight shy of it, why then is this paper in the Russian language and not in the White Russian? The writer A. further states that while White Russians may regard themselves as of the Russian culture, many are Catholics and they register as Poles; they do not read Russian;.... "still something should be done also for them." The writer criticizes the paper for the apparent complete disregard of the fact that there is a White Russian Socialist Soviet Republic in the USSR formation; that instead, the paper plays up the independence ideal, and independence - being among the things wishful but nothing more, - will not impress the realistic American.</p>
   <p>Golos Belarussa (The Voice of a White Russian), Riga, merely records the existence of the paper and remarks that it is published in Russian for two reasons: (a) A great number of White Russians are Russified and they consider the Russian culture as their own, (b) the paper wishes to reach also other nationalities (Slavic). It is further said that Belorusskaya Tribuna has a White Russian literary section; that the paper has eight pages and contains much interesting material.</p>
   <p>Still another paper, Syalyanskaya Niva (Country Pastures) of Vilna, heartily greets the birth of this paper and commends the Tribuna's platform for an independent White Russian state free to work out its own destiny, unshackled by dictums from Moscow or White Russian skinners (the same as kulaks). The writer quotes extensively from an article by the editor of Belorusskaya Tribuna. The title of the article is "Zaraspyatuya" (For Her Who is Crucified), its gist being that it is entirely safe to let Belorusskaya (White Russia) work out her destiny; that being a peasant population largely "all the other classes in White Russia taken together would still leave the peasantry in the majority....," she could not but persist on a policy for industrial as well as political democracy. The writer also remembers that the editor of Belorusskaya Tribuna, Joseph Voronko, was "the first chairman of White Russia's National Republic Government."</p>
