   <p>The local communists have again started to attack with bitter hostility and hate the two largest Russian organizations in America, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society and the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society. The chief reason for these attacks is the fact that both these organizations are nationalistic: they are trying to preserve the Russian language and traditions among the Russian people in America. All national activities, whether cultural, educational, or economic, are hated and fought by the Communists.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Society and the Russian Consolidated Society skillfully defend the interests of their members against the onslaughts of the Reds. This is why the latter are so enraged, and why they are now embarking upon a new and greater offensive against our two Russian strongholds in America.</p>
   <p>It is well for every Russian worker, and for every man and woman in America, to understand and keep in mind that the Communist party, or the Third Internationale, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is the most powerful and most dangerous enemy of the working people of the entire world. In the event of a Communist victory, workers would lose their political and personal liberty; they would be deprived of all the gains, the rights and privileges, achieved after many years of difficult struggle. All labor organizations and unions defending the rights of workers would be pronounced illegal and swept out of existence once the Communists came into power. A similar blow would be dealt by a Communist government to the free press, not only to the big capitalistic newspapers but also to labor newspapers. They would all be classed as counter-revolutionary publications. Only the Communist newspapers and magazines would be allowed to continue. All labor leaders would be arrested, thrown into jail, and then "liquidated".</p>
   <p>If the Communist party should seize the government of the United States, it would proceed at once as it did in Russia when it first came into power: it would establish "order" by sanctioning the looting of stores and the residences of the rich, proclaiming this action as a just redistribution of wealth which had been taken from the masses by the capitalists. All higher offices and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>responsible positions in government, as well as in commerce and industry, would be given to front-rank Communists as a reward for their efforts in bringing about a Communistic revolution.</p>
   <p>Its next step of the Communist government would be the disintegration of the national life of the American people, and the destruction of their culture and their religion--hence, an assult upon the three principles that motivate the efforts of an organized democratic society. Then the Red masters would attempt to halt all progress, to kill human individuality, to stifle all higher human instincts, so as to make of free people the more willing and more docile slaves of the Communist commissars.</p>
   <p>The Communists in the United States will probably never realize their dream of raising the Red flag over the White House in Washington, as their comrades raised it over the Kremlin in Moscow. The higher cultural level of American workers, their higher living standards as compared with those of Russian workers, the love of individual freedom, and the free play of individual genius--these will be a <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>sufficient barrier against the Communist advance in this country. However, the Red danger exists, and the American people should not allow themselves to be lulled into a state of false security while the Red agitators roam the country, trying to undo what has been accomplished in one hundred and fifty years of individual liberty and free democratic institutions.</p>
   <p>The workers of the United States and the working people of all countries of the world should always remember the cynicism and the sheer mockery embodied in the official name of Soviet Russia: The Union of Free Socialist Soviet Republics, where hundreds of thousands of free citizens of these republics are rotting in prisons and suffering in exile only because they wanted to live as free people.</p>
   <p>Russians living in America cannot stand idly by while there is danger of Red despotism making its way into free American life. Two Russian organizations--the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society and the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society--are fighting the Communistic element wherever and however they can. Every loyal Russian living in the United States can help us in this great struggle against Communism by joining either one of these two largest Russian mutual aid organizations.</p>
