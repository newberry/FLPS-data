   <p>Last Sunday a concert and a ball were given by the Blagoveshchensk Cathedral Brotherhood which was a great success both morally and financially.</p>
   <p>The quarter of Kuban Cossacks, composed of Miroshnichenko, Grishaev, Yurchenko, and Ponomarev sang a series of Russian and Ukrainian folk songs. They sang them splendidly and were rewarded with thunderous applause after each piece. Several times they were called upon to repeat the songs.</p>
   <p>When one listens to the singing of the Kuban Cossacks, one invariably becomes full of enthusiasm. Their mellow voices blend in a splendid harmony of vocal expression that enchants the entire audience.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>But when the entire quartet is unable to appear, Miroshnichenko or Grishaev is invited to sing solo, and thus these Kuban Cossacks appear on many occasions and at various entertainments. They spread and develop the art of Russian choral singing to a degree unexcelled in the world. The are the real standard-bearers and mouthpieces of the Russian art abroad.</p>
   <p>These Cossacks have none of the snobbishness and self-conceit so characteristic of many artists.</p>
   <p>When they are invited to participate in a concert, with exceptional courtesy and readiness they accept the invitation, and they do not always receive the remuneration which they deserve for their talented singing. They are well aware of the bad financial conditions under which many Russian organizations are compelled to carry on their cultural work, and they often even consent to sing gratis. For this reason the Russian colony holds them in great esteem and values their generous services for the common <span class="page-break">\3</span>good. We Russians may properly say that our Kuban Cossacks are the pride of our Russian colony in Chicago, for they spread the Russian art of singing not only among their compatriots but among people of other nationalities as well.</p>
   <p>The concert program was made complete by the appearance of Mme. Lialush in a series of classical and popular dances. This talented young Russian woman began her stage career with appearances before the Russian colony and since then has developed into a full-grown exponent of the terpsichorean art of expression, for she is well known not only among foreign communities but in American circles as well. A. Lialush is the daughter of a humble Russian worker, an old immigrant who came to this country prior to the World War.</p>
   <p>The concert program undoubtedly left a deep impression on all those who appreciate art, and of course it satisfied those who came just to enjoy the evening.</p>
