   <p>The Soviet government stooge, Novyi Mir [Russian communist newspaper published in New York], printed on the first page of its August 10 issue a communication from the Soviet consul general containing the rules and regulations to be followed by those who desire to become citizens of the Soviet Union. Here are some of them:</p>
   <p>If the petitioner was born in Russia, he must specify in his application his occupation in Russia before his departure to the United States; under what name and for what reasons he left Russia; his American port of entry and the date of debarkation; the kinds of employment he has held from the time of his arrival in America to the day of his filing the application for Soviet citizenship. He must state whether he has ever attempted to obtain United States citizenship; and if so, with what results. The candidate desiring to become a subject of Dictator Stalin, besides submitting two copies of a petition containing his full <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>life history, must fill out three different questionnaires, for which he must pay seventy-five cents; he must attach three small photographs; and he must answer all questions in a brief yet concise manner--in a word, as in a police detective bureau....</p>
   <p>The most interesting part of this official communication, however, is the paragraph which speaks of passports. The statement is made that it is necessary for the petitioner to attach to his petition the passport which serves at the time of application as his permit for residence and as his means of identification in the United States. Then the candidate pays a consulate tax of $9.68 or $19.36 as the case may be. After his petition is accepted, he is asked to wait six to eight months for the final decision of the Soviet authorities in Moscow.</p>
   <p>One thing, at least, is clear from this Soviet document--the fact that Soviet officials are so imbued with the Stalin spirit of dictatorship and strong-arm government that they cannot imagine the petitioner living, even in a free America, without a passport, the inseparable companion of every man, woman, and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>child living in that "great, free socialist state," the Soviet Republic. It appears that Stalin socialism is inconceivable without a passport. The whole world knows that in Soviet Russia it is impossible to make a single step without showing a passport. The Soviet wiseacres probably to this day do not know that in America people live and have always lived without passports, and that nobody asks you if you have a passport.</p>
   <p>In America, in capitalistic America, in order to become a citizen, it is not necessary to submit autobiographies, to fill out lengthy questionnaires, or to attach or present passports together with your petition for citizenship. But in our mother country, in the country of dictator Stalin, where everything is now socialized, including your body, your soul, and your last pair of breeches, they do not look upon a man as a human being, but as a thing attached to a passport. He may be a scoundrel of scoundrels, like ninety-nine per cent of the membership of the Lenin communist or Bolshevik party; yet, if his passport is in good order, he is an important person, a loyal subject of the red dictator, Joe Stalin.</p>
