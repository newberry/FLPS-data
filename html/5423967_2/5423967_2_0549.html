   <p>The Russian-American Democratic League of the state of Illinois at its last meeting, held May 6, decided to take upon itself the task of calling a conference of all Russian organizations, parishes, brotherhoods, sisterhoods, and press of the city of Chicago and its vicinity, for the purpose of arranging a celebration in honor of the centenary anniversary of the death of Pushkin, and in order to celebrate the Day of Russian Culture, which is annually fixed for June 9.</p>
   <p>The Day of Russian Culture is celebrated wherever there are Russian immigrants. It would be desirable if our Russian colony in Chicago would join other Russians in this celebration.</p>
   <p>The centenary anniversary of Pushkin's death falls on February 11. All over the world, preparations are being made for the memorial.</p>
   <p>The conference is scheduled for May 13, 7:30 P. M., at 1902 West Division Street.</p>
