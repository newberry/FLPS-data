   <p>The author of this editorial, commenting the Communist parades in Berlin and the Fascist demonstrations in Dusseldorf, points out that the presence of many Russian "guests" from Moscow proves that the Communist parade had been organized and financed from Moscow. He concludes the editorial thus:</p>
   <p>"Both Fascists and Communists parade in the streets and shake their fists. Both do not consider anybody or anything except their own ambitious aims and their lust for power. Both parties are ready to torture the country - the Fascists for the sake of restoring monarchy, the Communists for instituting party rule and red kaiserism. It is to be believed that the German people do not want either of these uncalled-for 'saviors.'"</p>
