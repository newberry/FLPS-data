   <p>In the West Side quarters of the Republican Party in Chicago there has been formed a Russian Executive Organization, supporting the candidacy of Herbert Hoover for United States President.</p>
   <p>Among the eight persons who were declared leaders of the organization are two White Russians: Archimandrite Timon (Mulyar) and Vladimir Sabinsky, the one time chairman of the Russian National Orthodox Society in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Of course, there is no White Russian cause for this organization, despite the fact that it operates chiefly amongst Americans who migrated from White Russia.</p>
