   <p>During the last weeks we have received from various places communications telling that more men are employed now in the factories.</p>
   <p>The firm Stewart-Warner, corner Diversey and Lincoln, employing several thousand men (among them several hundred Russians) had laid off many workmen several months ago.</p>
   <p>At that time among those who had lost their jobs there were many Russians.</p>
   <p>Now this firm is again hiring workmen.......</p>
