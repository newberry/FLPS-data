   <p>Rassviet printed an article under my name about the settlement of Russians in Texas. I had[previously]mailed a comprehensive article on this subject to the editor. I myself am opposed to having Russians settle in sandy, arid Texas, whereas the article, as revised and printed in the paper, gives the reader the impression that I am in favor of Russians migrating down South.</p>
   <p>The impression thus created is entirely erroneous. I am against such a move, for I know that the chances are that the settlers down there will fail rather than succeed.</p>
   <p>I consider it my duty to warn all prospective Russian settlers to this effect, so that in the event of failure they will not blame me.</p>
