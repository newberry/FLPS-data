   <p>Last Wednesday Congress passed two very important bills. The Washington correspondent of the Chicago Tribune considers the bills "the most revolutionary in the history of the United States". These bills, as a matter of fact, constitute the most essential part of the program of social legislation which was worked out under the sponsorship of Frances Perkins, the Secretary of Labor.</p>
   <p>The first of the new bills is known as the Social Security Bill, and the second, as the Bill on Labor Relations.</p>
   <p>The prompt passage of these bills by Congress serves obviously as an answer to the recent abrogation of the NRA law by the Supreme Court. The latest decision of the highest judicial body in the country, as is well known, has produced <span class="page-break">\2</span>a general jubilation among industrialists and in conservative political circles which still defend the principle of "unrestricted individualism".</p>
   <p>Among the workers this decision of the Supreme Court has met with a great deal of dissatisfaction.</p>
   <p>Industrialists and bankers, as we know, have continually claimed that the NRA does not ameliorate the conditions and only retards the natural process of improvement in the country. In reality they were dissatisfied with the NRA mainly because this legislative measure had limited their egotism and protected workers' interests.</p>
   <p>A New York Weekly, The New Republic, has commented critically and very often on the Roosevelt administration, and yet this periodical finds itself in disagreement with the Supreme Court decision when it declares that the conditions in the country can never improve without government interference, and that the State will have to adopt some emergency measures in order to improve the <span class="page-break">\3</span>general situation.</p>
   <p>Pointing to the positive features of the NRA Act, The New Republic, in one of its latest issues, wrote that "despite the lowering of income of the farming population as a result of boosting prices on industrial products, the purchasing power of the farmers has increased to almost double that of the year 1932.</p>
   <p>"On the other hand, we observe a diminution in unemployment due to restrictions on hours of labor, construction of public works, and the support given by the federal government to all measures designed to relieve idleness.</p>
   <p>"To discontinue operation of all legislative enactments meant to improve the conditions, would signify losing at once all the benefits that had been fought for and gained. It would be vain to hope that private initiative alone could manage the situation. Take the building industry, for example. The workers in that particular trade base all their hopes on the development of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>government-sponsored building program, which anticipates an expenditure of four billion dollars for various construction jobs. What will happen if the appropriations are withheld? Thoughts and actions of the opponents of the NRA are just as senseless as they are detrimental."</p>
   <p>It is true that Congress recently has re-established the NRA but in a modified form. Formerly the signing of codes and the observance of their provisions was compulsory for many industrial and commercial organizations; now everything depends on the free consent of the employer involved.</p>
   <p>For that reason Roosevelt's administration at present is driving hard for an immediate adoption by Congress of a broad program on social security, and organized labor is striving for passage of the Wagner bill which provides for settling industrial conflicts and regulates labor relations with employers.</p>
   <p>However, American industrialists and the conservative newspapers are very much alarmed, not so much by the two bills as by President Roosevelt's <span class="page-break">\5</span>message in which he proposed to increase taxes on large incomes and industrial corporations, and to boost the inheritance taxes.</p>
   <p>Even now many newspapers sound the alarm just because, as they see it, Roosevelt is about ready to divide the wealth. These newspapers think that if President Roosevelt's proposals go through, the economic life of the country will be entirely paralyzed and all people will become paupers.</p>
   <p>What the fate of the two bills just passed will be it is difficult to predict. It is possible that when the President signs them they, like the NRA legislation, will be found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In such a case the Roosevelt administration probably will propose a new amendment to the Constitution which would limit the prerogatives of the Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>All this goes to show that, despite all obstacles, the government and Congress are intent on continuing the New Deal policies.</p>
