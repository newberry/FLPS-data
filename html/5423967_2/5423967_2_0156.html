   <p>There is no truth in the world. Force and falsehood are firmly entrenched. Everywhere one looks, falsehood and violence prevail. Let us take Russia for example. Over there, for the past seventeen years, the bolsheviks have spoken constantly to the people about the unemployment, hunger and privation in the capitalist countries. While they raise these howls against the capitalists, the bolsheviks crawl on their knees before them, pleading for recognition and professing friendship. As the champagne glasses are raised in a toast, at the expense of the starving Russian people, the red tyrants find points of contact with capitalists of all description. And why shouldn't these points of contact be found? They are common to both, for both have the same general plan of exploitation, in which the bolsheviks play a primary role.</p>
   <p>"You must understand" says Litvinov and others of his ilk, "that even you <span class="page-break">\2</span>capitalists cannot exploit the workers as efficiently as we have for the past seventeen years, and, therefore, you should be afraid of us. The longer we rule Russia, the more perfect will become our methods of exploitation. Even your own communists are less dangerous now than they were ten or twelve years ago, when they did not know much about what was going on in Soviet Russia. You can safely, without any misgivings, send your unemployed over to us in order to cure them of any bolshevik influence, as one of the English millionaires did with his own unemployed. As far as our agitation against capitalism in your own countries is concerned, you shouldn't pay any attention to it, because it is only our gesture for the sake of the slaves at home. It will be worse for you if we start to fight. With the arms given to them for war purposes, the people will turn against us and will establish economic equality. Such an example will be so contagious that no sophistry or force will be able to stop this movement. Of course, all we say here, should remain a secret between us."</p>
   <p>For this very reason, just because of the open frankness of the bolsheviks, <span class="page-break">\3</span>the bourgeois governments shake hands joyfully with the representatives of the executioners of the Russian people.</p>
   <p>In order to get into the good graces of some of the bourgeoisie and their friends in the same camp, "liquidators from the Kremlin" have issued official orders to their watchdogs in France, England, Rumania, and other countries, to cease barking at the respective governments because "we have supposedly established friendly relations with such governments. As long as we toast the friendship of the peoples over which we rule, you, the small fry, should keep quiet until we give the signal to start barking again." Such are the orders of the red executioners to their ambassadors and other representatives abroad. And, of course, they then become silent.</p>
   <p>Now, let us consider the capitalist countries. Here we hear about the famine in Russia. Archbishops of various countries call upon the people to donate money to save the hungry people of Russia from death. Germans call upon other <span class="page-break">\4</span>Germans to save from starvation their blood brothers in Russia. This is done not to help the starving Russian people, but to distract the attention of other peoples from their own suffering, because, in spite of surpluses of wheat, coffee, meat and other products, which are being destroyed in order to raise the prices [of these products], millions of people need food. In countries such as the Argentine, where the unemployed receive no help, thousands of people feed themselves out of garbage cans.</p>
   <p>Falsehood and violence mask the evils of the present society. Everywhere tears are shed. Starving people are slowly driven to their premature graves.</p>
   <p>Others live with a vague hope of a better future. By use of this mask of falsehood and violence, everything seems to be all right. But when this cover falls off, it is very difficult to prophesy what will happen as a result of the popular wrath. One can only say that both the French and the Russian Revolutions will fade into insignificance in comparison with the approaching social upheaval which will shake the entire world.</p>
