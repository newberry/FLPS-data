   <p>America does not know what Bolshevism really is; America does not know its true face, not as it is painted and powdered by various lovers of communism. Even our Russian "comrades" know Bolshevism only by hearsay, not from real life, as it actually is in one country in the world--in the unfortunate country of workers and peasants.</p>
   <p>One can bet any sum of money that no American communist--as few of them as there are--not even our own "communists" from Division Street, would be able to live, even for a short while, in the U. S. S. R.; they would fly back in a hurry to the bourgeois hell.</p>
   <p>"You servants of capitalism and counterrevolutionaries, you want to turn back the wheel of history," shout various friends and defenders of Bolshevism in the U. S. S. R.</p>
   <p>Do they know the truth about Bolshevism? Do they know what and whom they are defending? No, they do not know, and yet the truth is becoming evident. It has come to the surface and is opening the eyes of even the gullible American public. Not so long ago, in the Moscow newspaper Pravda, there appeared an article written by the well-known journalist and newspaper reporter of the New York Times, Walter Duranty, on the subject of Stalin's "accomplishments". He reported joyfully that the Bolsheviks had dug one line of tunnel for a section of the subway, which is far from being completed, and to the astonishment of the public, have run several trains over the newly laid track. This "achievement" so stirred Mr. Duranty that he forgot about scores of subway lines in New York and made a mountain out of a molehill. He fell on his knees before Stalin and proclaimed to America that Moscow is destined to become the capital of the Bolshevik world empire of the future.</p>
   <p>Take notice of the fact that a prominent American journalist plays the role of a lackey to Stalin. It is difficult, of course, to believe that Duranty is playing his servile role before Stalin without remuneration, out of love of Bolshevism. Does the truth about Bolshevism reach the American public? Of course, it does.</p>
   <p>A year ago W. H. Chamberlain, also a well-known and talented American journalist, returned to the United States after a twelve-year sojourn in the U. S. S. R. in the capacity of a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, an influential paper in Boston. Mr. Chamberlain learned Russian and traveled extensively all over Russia. He is considered the best-informed man on present-day Russia.</p>
   <p>Upon his arrival in the United States, he wrote a series of articles under the title "Russia without a Censor," which were printed in The Monitor; some of the articles were translated and reprinted in Rassviet. Since then, from time to time, Chamberlain returns to the subject he knows so well and introduces the American public to Bolshevism in practice.</p>
   
   <p>In the supplement to the newspaper issue of March 27, his new article appears, entitled "Postscript to Russia"; once more he raises the curtain and shows the horrible Bolshevik reality.</p>
   <p>One must admit, however, that Chamberlain, while he does not accept Bolshevism, does not idealize or approve czarism, because the latter, in his opinion by its reactionary policy, was responsible for the triumph of Bolshevism. Chamberlain is not a counterrevolutionary; he is a supporter of that "rotten democracy," which withstood the hard blows of the World War and the social upheavals incident to it in England, the United States, and France. But all this is beside the point. What, then, does Chamberlain report with regard to Stalin's Bolshevism?</p>
   <p>After the horrible famine of 1932-1933, Chamberlain visited a Ukrainian village named Cherkasi, located eight miles from the town of Belaya Tserkov, in the province of Kiev. In this village, which had suffered a great deal from the famine, six hundred had died, out of a population of two thousand, according to the testimony of the secretary of the county committee himself. Chamberlain recollects a conversation he had with one village woman.</p>
   <p>"That woman," says Chamberlain, "represented only one atom in a boundless sea of suffering; but from such atoms, from such personalities, one can learn the truth about the real situation. These atoms make up the anonymous millions of victims of the famine."</p>
   <p>This woman told the American journalist the simple story of her life. She was a poor peasant woman; she was illiterate, she had no chance to go to school. She had three children. They all attended school and were "very learned," but then the food gave out, and all three starved to death.</p>
   <p>"These three kids whom I never saw," writes Chamberlain, "were for me the most convincing argument in favor of democracy and against Bolshevism and dictatorship. For these children were only symbols of countless victims of the famine, which could have been easily prevented, if the Soviet authority had not decided 'to teach the peasants a lesson,' and permitted several millions of villagers to starve to death. The famine arose not as the result of some elemental catastrophe, but as the result of the merciless [grain] requisitions and the absolute refusal [of the government] to render any help."</p>
   <p>"The democratic governments," remarks Chamberlain, "are not perfect, but there has never been a case in their history when, as a method of reprisal, they deliberately resorted to the extermination of the dissatisfied population by means of famine artificially organized by the state. The Ukrainian children that perished in the famine are only an insignificant part of the immense number of people, whose lives were destroyed by the merciless application of the Bolshevik dogma, which is very logical in theory and very senseless and inhuman in practice."</p>
   <p>The American journalist cannot forget the unfortunate wives and children of the kulaks, in Magnitogorsk doing forced labor. These people subsisted on rations which were very scanty, even as compared with the allowances of food received by the people on relief in this country. He still remembered the professors and scientists who were put to death or exiled to the concentration camps after they were accused of sabotage, or simply because they refused to give false testimony against their colleagues.</p>
   <p>Bolsheviks boast of their accomplishments. Chamberlain does not deny them. "But in the noise of blast furnaces and the hum of turbines in the power stations, it is impossible to drown the anquished cries of the countless victims sacrificed on the altar of industrialization. Four millions of deliberately extinguished lives outweigh, in my opinion, ten million tons of steel, which Russia produced for the first time in her history in 1934." Further on Chamberlain discusses the following "accomplishments":</p>
   <p>1). Industrialization in Russia has not resulted in a flow of workers from the bourgeois countries into the Soviet land; on the contrary, American and Russian workers who formerly lived in America and had found employment in Russia, are besieging the American consulates in the U. S. S. R., begging for permission or visas to enter the United States; they are even willing to accept the conditions of the unemployed, while millions of Soviet citizens would gladly escape abroad if the Bolshevik guards did not watch the boundaries.</p>
   <p>2). If prosperity has spread its benevolent wings over the U. S. S. R., how can we explain the fact that during the last few years, tens of millions of dollars, mostly in the form of parcels of food and clothing, have been shipped from the bourgeois countries to relatives and friends in Russia. We know of no case where someone from the U. S. S. R. sent a food parcel to a relative or friend starving to death in the bourgeois countries.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. Chamberlain warns Americans to be on guard against any form of dictatorship. In his opinion, people should fight against war and for social justice.</p>
   
   <p>"The U. S. S. R.," says Chamberlain, "does not present any danger to the western countries; it serves as a warning of what may happen in other countries under the double pressure of war, extreme poverty, and the insecurity of the great mass of the population."</p>
