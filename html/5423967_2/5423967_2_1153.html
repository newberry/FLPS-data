   <p>The performance of the talented pianist Miss Ina Rublev at the literary evening arranged by Mr. Gusev-Orenburgsky at the Auditorium Recital Hall was a great success.</p>
   <p>The public greeted enthusiastically the gifted pianist, and she had to play several encores.</p>
   <p>Every time the pianist-composer played with great spirit, and, as usually, her selection of musical pieces was excellent.</p>
