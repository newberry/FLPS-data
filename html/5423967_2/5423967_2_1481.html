   <p>The White Russian National Union in Chicago received from the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D. C., a large consignment of White Russian Belles-Lettres from Minsk. Among the editions are the works of famous White Russian writers and poets. It is a pity that the senders failed to give to the White Russian National Union the latest White Russian literature, also those "thick" journals and books on science in the White Russian tongue, all of which one cannot get in Chicago. The Chicago libraries do not have a single White Russian book.</p>
