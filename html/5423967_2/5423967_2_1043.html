   <p>In the new year number of the Chicago Tribune there appeared an article concerning the most prominent scientists of the University of Chicago. Among the names were those of Professor Compton, who received the Nobel prize in physics; Professor A. Michelson and others. We find in this article also the portrait of the famous Russian Professor Alexandr Alexandrovich Maximov. The celebrated pathologist, Professor Maximov, during the last years has been doing experimental work on living tissues. He has also made an elaborate study of the changes occurring in the blood corpuses and had found the way to convert one kind of cells into another.</p>
   <p>A certain kind of cell is even known as the Uaximov cell. The honor due to the University of Chicago will be thus increased by the fact that within its walls is living and working the great Russian scientist A. A. Maximov.</p>
