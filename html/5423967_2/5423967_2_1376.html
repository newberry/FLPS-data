   <p>The Russian-American Democratic League held a picnic Sunday, July 14, in the state forest preserve. Despite the fact that the place chosen for the picnic was not as suitable as the site of the League's previous picnic, there was a large crowd of people on hand to enjoy the many attractions prepared by the Committee in charge of the arrangements. It is estimated that over two thousand persons participated in the picnic, The day was lovely, not a cloud in the sky; a faint breeze cooled the air. The people began to arrive early to take possession of the shady spots under the trees before others came.</p>
   <p>The most popular person at the picnic was the chief leader of the Russian-American Democratic League, Attorney Alexander Pickel, who was everywhere and talked with everybody, explaining the aims of the League and urging the Russian people to take more interest in the political life of our city, state, and country. Everybody was pleased that the directors of the League recently selected Mr. Pickel, a young and promising attorney, as chief executive and the leader of the organization.</p>
   <p>When the picnic was in full swing, several speakers appeared on the platform. Ivan Staukowitch, the League's financial secretary, presented the speakers. They were: Mr. Novin, chairman of the Russian-American Democratic League; Mr. Olesiuk, chairman of the St. George parish; E. Kopernik, chairman of the Russian-American Democratic Club; Mr. Erin, Mr. Volos, and Mr. F. Mikchailovsky. Dr. L. Pertzov spoke in English, dedicating his talk to the Russian-American Youth, who were well represented at the picnic. The speeches delivered by Mr. Navin and Mr. Olesink were especially interesting and very well received by the public. Both speakers appealed to the entire Russian colony in Chicago to forget the past and join forces with the Russian-American Democratic League to work together for a better future and better political representation of the Russian colony in the city, county, and state administrations.</p>
   <p>The picnic was a big success, and will linger in the memories of those who were present as the most enjoyable day spent in many years.</p>
