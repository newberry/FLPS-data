   <p>Garrett Jones, former adviser to Lloyd George, has been sent by the Manchester Guardian to Soviet Russia to obtain information on the real situation in that country; since Kirov's assassination. In three articles, printed by the Hearst newspapers, Jones makes sensational revelations on the basis of his own observations in the USSR.</p>
   <p>The first time that Jones went to the USSR, in an official capacity, he was received by Mr. Litvinov, by Lenin's widow, Madame Krupskaya, and other high public officials. But later on, since he was anxious to know the truth, Jones decided to see Russia for himself; he began to visit villages and small country towns, covering the distances either on foot or in freight trains. Thus he saw the sufferings and hardships of the Russian people, the growing discontent among the communists themselves, and the indignation among the peasants. He cites verbatim conversations held with the "forgotten <span class="page-break">\2</span>men", as the peasants are beginning to call themselves. Jones declares that the current wave of terror, since Kirov's murder, will be powerless to overcome the growing indignation and consequent riots among the people, even though all the new repressive measures are carried out with full force and cruelty by the GPU agents.</p>
   <p>Jones dined on caviar and champagne, in luxurious palaces, and was told that communism reigns supreme in the villages, but when he happened to drop off trains, secretly, away from the eyes of the political police, around Kharkov and other towns, and met peasants, he heard them cry: "We have no bread". In trains, when he ate white bread, the peasants greedily picked up the crumbs, and even the orange peel. "All the peasants are hungry," he was told. "Communists have taken away both land and grain. We have no bread." "People die from hunger," young communists told Jones.</p>
   <p>Everyone was waiting for the Five Year Plan to end, in the hope that then the people would again get enough to eat. Rank and file communists question <span class="page-break">\3</span>one another, and want to know why there is no improvement in the living conditions. Predictions have been made that the communists themselves are about to stage riots. These dire predictions partially came true in Kirov's murder. Moving from one village to another, in the disguise of a tramp, along railroad tracks, everywhere Jones heard the same complaint: "No bread".</p>
   <p>The absence of cattle and horses was particularly conspicuous. When he asked why, Jones was invariably told that it was due to the lack of fodder, because the peasants themselves had devoured the food that they used to feed to the cattle. As to the horses, most of them were killed and eaten.</p>
   <p>Formerly, the Ukraine fed many countries, but now it too is starving. In other places, Jones was told that when Bolsheviks try to requisition the cattle, the peasants kill them for meat. Women complained that their children were dying from hunger, as though they were flies. They see God's punishment in the calamity because the people have strayed from the paths of their God. When Jones pitied the plight of the people, the villagers <span class="page-break">\4</span>reminded him that further west, toward the Polish frontier, whole villages had been decimated, and starvation had cut the population of some of the towns in half.</p>
   <p>During his wanderings, later on, Jones found out that the communists had made slaves out of the peasants, and had dispossessed the Kulaks (rich peasants) by taking away their land, homes and cattle. The owners had been sent to lumber camps, as political prisoners. In one German colony, Jones was told that all well-to-do members had been sent to concentration camps, and that while they were en route to their place of exile, ninety children died on the trains from hunger and other privations. When Jones told communists about this, they did not deny the expulsions, but insisted that all enemies of the working class must be destroyed.</p>
   <p>"If any man, woman, or child steals even one stalk of grain, he or she may face the firing squad." Murder is a lesser crime than the theft of grain, even though the sole purpose of the theft is to feed a baby. A child who <span class="page-break">\5</span>reports that his mother stole grain from the field, is glorified as a hero, and this fact is announced in all the schools.</p>
   <p>When Jones wanted to know the reason for the famine, the people replied that the Bolsheviks had taken the cattle and grain away from the peasants, and that the famine was not the fault of nature, but of the communists. When peasants resisted the seizure of cattle and grain, regular troops were called upon for help; when these troops refused to intervene and punish the peasants, young communists were brought from the cities for primitive action against the stubborn peasants.</p>
   <p>Jones' travels were ended abruptly when he was caught by a GPU agent during a conversation with some peasants. The agent demanded documents from Mr. Jones, and when he wasn't satisfied with the passport alone, the agent took his quarry to Kharkov. However, on the way to the city, Mr. Jones told the agent so much about his connections with Mr. Litvinov, with Lenin's widow, and even with Stalin himself, that the agent became afraid that he might <span class="page-break">\6</span>embroil his superiors in a tangle of international complications. He brought his prisoner to the very door of the foreign consulate, and left him there.</p>
   <p>While in Kharkov, Jones saw long queues of people waiting vainly for their turn to buy bread, and invariably complaining: "No bread; give us some bread".</p>
   <p>On the streets, Jones saw hundreds of homeless children. He concludes his observations by expressing his conviction that even in the ranks of the Communist party, itself, friction and discontent exist. This accounts for the renewed terror instituted by Stalin.</p>
