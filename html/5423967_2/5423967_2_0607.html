   <p>According to the data in the possession of the Russian-American Democratic Committee during the presidential campaign, during 1924-1927 there have been registered 17,000 Russian voters. Special information received from the Naturalization Department concerning the period 1924 to 1927 shows that in Chicago and the state of Illinois there have been naturalized about 10, 000 Russians. Thus there should be about 25,000 Russian citizens in Chicago. The Russian-American Democratic Committee believes that, owing to the energetic political campaign conducted by it, no less than 15,000 Russians will vote for the head of the Democratic Party, Mr. Alfred Smith, at the presidential election.</p>
