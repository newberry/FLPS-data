   <p>The Central Committee of the Democratic party not long ago created the Russian-American Branch of the Democratic Party in Chicago, under the leadership of the men heading the Russian-American Democratic League. The purpose in organizing a Russian branch was to acquaint Russian-born American citizens with the aims and activities of the Democratic party, headed by the great American leader, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States. To keep the Russian-American public informed about the great work of the President and about the affairs of the country in general, the National Committee of the Democratic party has contracted for space in Rassviet, where from time to time there will be published reports and reviews of the activities of the Federal, state, county, and city administrations, and of the work of the legislative bodies of our city, state, and nation.</p>
   <p>A national election will be held November 6 of this year. The results of <span class="page-break">2</span>this election will be of paramount importance to the entire country. The forthcoming election will decide whether the great work of economic regeneration of the country, so successfully and so boldly begun by President Roosevelt, will be continued. The conservative forces of the Republican party, defeated in the 1932 Presidential election, are now gathering all their might to regain power in the November election. If the Republican party emerges the winner in this election, the social and economic improvements thus far achieved by the Roosevelt Administration may be halted, and the gains obtained by the working classes may be taken away by a Republican Congress. What is really taking place in America in these days of the Roosevelt Administration is a bloodless social revolution.</p>
   <p>The coming election will mark the first encounter between the progressive and the reactionary forces. The battle will be fought not by soldiers armed with rifles but by citizens armed with their ballots.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Americans of Russian birth or descent form a part of this great army of citizens who will join in the battle of votes on November 6. The duty of the Russian press in America is to educate the Russian-American voters as to which political party and which men really stand for social justice for the masses of American people, for the preservation of the rights already gained by the working class, and for further social benefits for the common people of this great republic. The Russian-American voters should likewise be informed what part of American society is opposed to all social reform and wants to conduct the affairs of the nation the way they were conducted a century ago.</p>
   <p>Throughout the coming weeks, readers of Rassviet will find in its pages ample reading material covering all these problems. Until election day Rassviet will publish three times a week special bulletins on current political issues and on candidates for public offices. The Russian-American Democratic League will make an effort to continue publishing these political <span class="page-break">4</span>bulletins in Rassviet even after the election, in order to keep the Russian-American people well informed about all important events taking place in Washington and throughout the nation. In these bulletins the readers will find complete reports of all legislative action in the field of the vast social reforms initiated by President Roosevelt.</p>
