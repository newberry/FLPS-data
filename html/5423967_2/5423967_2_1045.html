   <p>In a short article signed with the initials E. S., it is stated that the Russian Bolsheviki of Chicago, having invaded the membership of the Russian Cooperative Restaurant at 1628 W. Division Street, that had been successfully organized and managed by the non-partisan Russian Workers' Cooperative Society, changed the conditions of work for the employees of the restaurant, not for the better, but for the worse. Thus, the Bolshevik manager of the restaurant made the employees work seven days a week, ten hours daily, without any vacation during the whole year, while in theory the Bolsheviki advocate an eight-hour day and only five days of work every week. The members of the cooperative had agreed that the employees needed a week's vacation, but the Bolshevik manager, acting like a real "commissar", overruled their decision and decreed that no vacation shall be given unless it be much later in the autumn. The author of the article points out that the Bolsheviki, while posing as liberators of the working class, in reality exploit the workers when they become employers of laber themselves.</p>
