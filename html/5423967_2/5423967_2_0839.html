   <p>Individual States begin to play an ever-growing role in the intensive fight against the economic crisis in America. If formerly all hopes were centered on the Federal Government, there is, at present, considerable initiative being manifested by individual States. This fact was clearly revealed in the Survey of the Activities of Legislative Bodies in various States. Already the legislative assemblies in forty-three States are in session.</p>
   <p>The immediate and urgent problem before all States is that of finding ways and means of financing relief. It is true that the Federal Government spends billions for this purpose. But, in conformity with established rules, the Federal Relief Administration demands that every individual State contribute at least as much as it receives from the Federal Government toward relief for the unemployed. This practice involves increases in State budgetary appropriations at a time when both city dwellers and farmers insist on reductions in taxes. Some of the States, in order to comply with the federal requirements, imposed special sales taxes on all articles except foods. Others introduced heavier income taxes, a practice adopted by some of the cities, with the effect that a man with a steady income and in a certain category had to pay a triple income tax--Federal, State and city. A goodly number of States also increased the inheritance tax or introduced special sales taxes on all articles of luxury.</p>
   <p>The tragic situation of small home owners and farmers has drawn the attention of a number of State legislative bodies. Thus, the New York State legislature has extended for another year the moratorium on mortgage payments in those cases where owners continue to pay taxes and interest on their obligations. The same steps were taken in Kansas and Louisiana, which, while going through a series-of political upheavals, declared a two-year moratorium on all debt obligations. The State legislature of Minnesota advanced a plan of paying debts in kind from the crops of each year, and the forced sales of farm property were banned entirely. All these measures were designed only to supplement those of the Federal Government in the attempt to relieve the small real-estate owners.</p>
   
   <p>Considerable interest has been attracted by Social Security bills introduced in different States, whose assemblies have over three hundred such measures under consideration. The governors of seven States have recommended immediate passage of Old-Age Pension legislation. The States of Illinois and Massachusetts are ready to pass such legislation in co-operation with the Federal Government. Twenty-eight States have already adopted legislation relative to old-age pensions, and sixteen are considering bills to increase the amount of such pensions and to lower the age limits. In this respect, the pensions will continue to be paid only to persons who are citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>Fifteen States are deliberating in an effort to introduce State unemployment insurance. It is worth noticing that such bills were introduced both in Republican and Democratic States, which indicates that the problem of social insurance is no longer a football of politics.</p>
   <p>For Further characteristics of the new tendencies in state legislation, let us mention several plans which were advanced in different States. In Texas it was proposed to create a special State council for the purpose of finding ways and means for a rational exploitation of the State's natural resources for public benefit. During a recent conference of governors from the New England States, three of the executives recommended the introduction of national planning of public work and exploitation of State natural resources. The governor of Oklahoma advanced a public-works plan which included the erection of power stations, electrification of rural districts, and the building of "industrial homesteads" for the unemployed and those farmers who had lost their property. The elimination of "sweatshops" and a strict supervision of private electric and gas companies, figure prominently as the cardinal points in the program of the new governor of Pennsylvania. A program of social legislation has been introduced in the State legislature of Rhode Island, which includes State unemployment insurance, pensioning of aged persons, establishment of minimum wages, etc. Among bills introduced in the New York legislature, we find one proposing the raising of the age limit for child labor from fourteen to sixteen years. In Alabama, on the initiative of the chief executive, a bill was introduced which proposed a recall of all State officials who do not live up to the expectations of the voters.</p>
