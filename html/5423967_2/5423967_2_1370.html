   <p>The school of Russian dancing is making preparations for the dance festival which is being arranged for the coming summer at Soldier Field. The school with every passing day is attracting more and more children and young people, particularly the children of Russians who in some way or other are connected with R.I.M.A.S. The classes are held each Wednesday from eight to ten o'clock in the evening in the new field house [in Humboldt Park] and twice a month at 917 Wood Street (the parish auditorium), every second and fourth Thursday. So far the school has enjoyed great success, and if in the future the interest does not slacken, the large auditorium of the field house will not be able to accommodate all those who desire to learn dancing.</p>
   <p>The classes are conducted under the direction of Mr. A. Komiakov, one of the best Russian ballet instructors in the city.</p>
