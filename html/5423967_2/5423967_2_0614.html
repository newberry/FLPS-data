   <p>This editorial tells the story of the election by the Republican Party in Pennsylvania of a candidate to represent the state of Pennsylvania in the senate. After the election there were disclosures proving that one of the committees of the Republican Party had spent very large sums of money for the election of its candidate. The author of the editorial says that such methods make a mockery out of the democratic system of elections, as the candidate in reality is elected not by the people, but by a group of capitalists who provide the money for the engineering of such elections.</p>
