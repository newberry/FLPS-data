   <p>American progressives, collaborating with the magazine Common Sense, in its May issue published their plan of change from capitalism to a co-operative social order.</p>
   <p>Substitution of the new system for decaying capitalism, in their opinion, should be carried out gradually by constitutional means without "destruction of everything that we have now". The plan proposes adoption of reforms designed to end unemployment and raise the material well-being of the population with certain guarantees of social security.</p>
   <p>Let us consider certain points of their co-operative plan. How, for instance, do they propose to end unemployment? During one year, they say, the state will be able to put all unemployed to work in factories, mills, and other undertakings <span class="page-break">2</span>which will produce for use and not for profit. The idle men and women so employed will be both producers and consumers at the same time.</p>
   <p>But the factories and mills will be left in private hands. Under such conditions the state will lease the idle plants from the private owners, paying to them as rental five per cent of the appraised value of the property annually. Insofar as it is possible, it is proposed to retain, in all such undertakings, old technical and managerial personnel.</p>
   <p>According to the plan the undertakings most urgently required for this purpose and the first ones to be called upon to perform the social service, will be grain elevators, flour mills, bakeries, slaughterhouses and stockyards, canneries, dairies, textile, shoe, clothing, furniture and other factories.</p>
   <p>Not all the plant equipment and space is to be rented, but only about ten per cent of their capacity. The total annual rental, according to the estimates made by the authors of this plan, will not exceed one billion dollars. Every <span class="page-break">3</span>month workers placed by the government in leased undertakings will receive, instead of money, a certificate which will be nontransferable and will be valid only for one month. On presentation of this certificate the workers will receive from a co-operative store a certain quantity of goods. The quantity of goods allowed will depend on the number in the family, on the skill and efficiency of the worker, and the degree of responsibility carried by the employee.</p>
   <p>The quantity of goods, however, never should be less than the minimum required to sustain the family, and should in no case exceed twice the amount so fixed by the government. Exceptions to this rule are allowed only in cases when remuneration of technical and managerial personnel is involved.</p>
   <p>According to the plan for agriculture, the land will remain in private hands. Large co-operative farms will be organized only for experimental purposes. Settling of accounts with farmers will be carried on by means of special receipts--in about the same way as with the workers. Private undertakings may disappear only in case the government-leased mills and factories prove their <span class="page-break">4</span>superiority in economy and operation over privately run establishments.</p>
   <p>The plan anticipates nationalization of all banks with payment annually of five per cent on the capital invested to the shareholders during a period of twenty years. The plan also foresees the levying of increased taxes on personal incomes and inherited property, which should yield an income of not less than two billion dollars to the government. All incomes above one hundred thousand dollars will be confiscated.</p>
   <p>The authors of the co-operative plan assert that if idle hands, technical skill, natural wealth, and machines are fully utilized the entire population of the country would be assured of an abundant life, and that in the course of a few years each worker would be guaranteed an income of not less than five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>If, the authors claim, the entire industrial plant is made to work at its full capacity, within ten years there will not be a man in the United States who will <span class="page-break">5</span>suffer need in food, clothing, and other things necessary in life, and it would be possible for each family to build a home of six rooms with all modern conveniences, to possess a radio, an automobile, decent furniture, a library, and have enough free time to spare for travels, self-education and enjoyment of life.</p>
   <p>Under the term "sufficiency" the authors of the plan understand full material security during one's entire life; the possibility for each child to receive even higher education; security of work for all able-bodied men and women, and security for old age which at present is possible only for well-to-do people.</p>
   <p>Authors of the plan declare that they have no intention of reforming existing political institutions and only want "to democratize economic institutions in order to realize the promise of freedom contained in the Declaration of Independence".</p>
   <p>With such a program the proponents of the plan will appear during the presidential <span class="page-break">6</span>election campaign and they will call themselves "The Party of Social Welfare," or "The Commonwealth Party".</p>
