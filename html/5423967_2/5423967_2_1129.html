   <p>Miss Evghaniya Murey was born in America. At present she is 14 years old. This is already the sixth year since she started to study music, the piano, at the Chicago Musical College, 64 E. Van Buren St. The talented young pianist has been playing during the last two years not only at many entertainments given in the Russian Colony, but also before American audiences. One of her most remarkable performances was down town at the Central Theater.</p>
   <p>Among the teachers of the Musical College are Mr. Herbert Witherspoon, president, our compatriot Mr. M. Boguslawsky and many others.</p>
   <p>(Note: As far as I know Miss Evgheniya Murey was rewarded with a gold mdeal for excellent progress in her study of the piano at the Chicago Musical College. About two years ago she was appointed teacher of music in a school of one of the suburbs of Chicago, and is still teaching there. N. K.)</p>
