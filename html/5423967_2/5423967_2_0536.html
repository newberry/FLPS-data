   <p>"We have recently received inquiries as to the purpose and activities of the Russian-American Organization in Douglas Park.</p>
   <p>The purpose of our organization is the defense of the political interests of all Russian-Americans in Cook County, also of those, who would like to become members of our organization.</p>
   <p>The organization also is engaged in opening Schools in the Russian language for the youth, helps in obtaining citizenship papers, gives all possible advice, all of which is done free of charge.</p>
   <p>Our organization is also interested in the sickness and death of its members. We are chartered under the name, Russian-American Citizens Organization of Cook County, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Further information may be obtained from the President of the organization at 1628 So. Washtenaw Ave.</p>
   
   <p>Our organization is independent of other political organizations. It has its own dramatic circle and will soon have two branches under the charter.</p>
   <p>Our meetings are held on the first Friday of each month at 2736 W. Ogden Avenue.</p>
   <p>President,</p>
   <p>K. Tanashook.</p>
