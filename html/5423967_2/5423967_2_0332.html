   <p>A few months ago a person active in Russian politics warned the population against too great jumps to the left. "If you strike the pendulum with great force to the left, it strikes out with as much force to the right," he cautioned. Sad as this may be it must be conceded that the warnings of this political veteran proved true, with respect to certain Russian sections in Russia proper, and abroad as well.</p>
   <p>In the wake of the overthrow of the Russian autocracy came a fierce swinging of the political pendulum to the left in a certain part of the Russian population who, not content with a provisional coalition government, raised very high demands. Only the pendulum frequently, and with equal impetus, swung back to the right. Many disappointed bolshevik adepts began to strike out to the right. As a corollary of this, came pogroms, rows, and monarchistic propaganda in this city or in that, from the day of the bolshevic reign in the country.</p>
   <p>At this time, with the bolshevik rule growing weaker continuously, many of the recent extreme leftists begin to be transformed into extreme rightists.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Instead of at last finding the right path, so as not to keep throwing about, now to the right, now to the left, many of the bolsheviks begin to pass over to monarchism.</p>
   <p>Observing this phenomenon among the masses, the black ravens of Russia, and the jackals begin to lift their heads. In one city and another people begin to talk about the re-establishing of monarchism. In Kiev, for example, the black gang is convening under the leadership of Radzianko, and this gang openly speaks of its ambition of re-establishing monarchism. Prior to the execution of Nikolai, some kind of a black gang intended to get him out by stealing him, hoped to seat him on the throne again. A small part of the Russian population began to talk about re-establishing monarchism.</p>
   <p>This black hundred monarchistic wave projected itself also to us here. Here, too, all sorts of jackals and black ravens are lifting their heads. Under one pretext or another, they are beginning to agitate the colony, exciting it to discontent, not alone with extreme ideas as to what would be the proper thing to do, but fostering discontent also with everything that is good and sensible. They wander about, these jackals, and by word of mouth, and through <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the press, denounce and decry the entire Russian revolution. One could understand if they did it only with respect to the ruling bolsheviks. But no, they attack everything that the nation has gained, and they attack the best representatives of the masses. They attack everything that is new. Many of them praise the beauty of monarchy.</p>
   <p>The newspaper Svyet (Light) published in America, featured a large portrait of Nikolai Romanov on its pages, hailed him as a martyr for Slavism, spoke with profound grief of his death, and altogether, the nostalgia for a monarchy was very evident, yet notwithstanding this, a craftily concocted article appeared elsewhere in the paper on equality. The newspaper Novaya Rossiya (New Russia) has been busily engaged, preaching nationality hatreds for the past several months, and it is clear that it, too, is nostalgic about the same thing as the newspaper Svyet is.</p>
   <p>It is a common occurrence to hear a veiled speech or read a shady article by masked black hundreds, whose words are sweetly flowing. Once more <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the time has come when class conscious workers and peasants must be on the alert. It is dangerous, and the jackals must be given a serious set back. Russian democracy in Russia and abroad, now more than ever, must choose for itself a line cleared alike of extreme left and extreme right thrills. For one extremism inescapably induces another. The black ravens of our native land realize this, and they begin proudly to lift their heads. Class-conscious workers and peasants must combat these with like energy against anarchism as much as against monarchism, or the preaching of nationality hatreds. Only then will the conquests of the revolution remain with us. Only thus will the masses consolidate their rights for land and liberty.</p>
