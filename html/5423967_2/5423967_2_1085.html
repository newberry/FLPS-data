   <p>From 1921 till the present time I have been living chiefly in Chicago and in the small towns in the neighborhood of Chicago, and have had the opportunity to become well acquainted with the life of Russian workmen residing in these places. I think my observations may be of some interest to the readers of the Russian Herald.</p>
   <p>As almost 50% of all the Russians are employed in the foundries of Chicago, I shall start by desorbing the life of such Russians. Chicago is the industrial center of America, and also the central market for all kinds of goods, from needles to various kinds of hardware.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are several enormous plants of the Crane Company, of which the largest is situated on Kedzie Avenue, where a great many Russians work. They are all forced even now to work nine or ten hours instead of eight hours.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Of course they do not get paid time and a half for overtime and have to content themselves with what the Crane Company gives them. The Russians who are working in the plants of the Crane Company are mostly laborers, working on the most fatiguing, dirty jobs, paying very little money. Among the hundreds of Russians who are employed by the Crane Company, there are several score who during the last few years, because they happened to know the English language, have suceeded in getting better positions and higher wages. In the plants of the Crane Company there are several foremen who are Russians, and also Russian engineers and machinists who specialize in disjointing and reassembling machinery, etc. There is one Russian electrotechnician who has several Russian assistants.</p>
   <p>Besides Crane's plants there are in Chicago many other similar plants. There is for example a foundry on the outskirts of the city, in Cicero, belonging to the National Malleable Castings Company, in the quarter of 48th and 14th streets. In that foundry most of the workmen are Lithuanians; yet there are also many Russians living and working there. Unfortunately, most of these Russians have to do piece work because this foundry is producing mostly various kinds of materials for the railroads. Piece work <span class="page-break">\3</span>means that one man must do the work of two men, if he wants to earn more than the ordinary laborer does. With such piece work the worker has to exert himself so, that the "back splits." And our Russian workers deem themselves to be very lucky if by doing such work they can earn from $80 to $90 in two weeks. Still, the Russians who work in iron works and foundries can, more or less, make both ends meet; they are much better off than those who are employed by Armour, Swift and Morris in the stinking, "smelly" stockyards.</p>
   <p>In the slaughter houses of the stock yards' kings we find innumerable Russians from all districts of Chicago. The pay these Russians - like all Russians in general - receive is very small. The workers employed in Chicago stockyards are exploited by their employers even worse than those who are working in textile mills in the celebrated American town of Passaic, in New Jersey. You can always and everywhere know a Russian working in the stockyards from every other Russian; come as close to him as fifty steps and you will feel a stench emanating from him. No baths, no changing of clothes and underwear can eradicate this odor. Such is the life of our Russians in the stockyards; the wages which they get from their employers, from Armour, Swift and Morris - are so scanty that it <span class="page-break">\4</span>is utterly impossible for the Russian workers to make a decent living. A few days ago at a Russian meeting I met a friend and learned from him a few things about the life of the Russians in the stockyards. As soon as my friend approached me I knew right away by the smell emanating from him that he was working in the stockyards. We started immediately to talk about his work.</p>
   <p>I asked him what kind of work he was doing. He answered: "I am working at Swift's and transport pigs in a truck."</p>
   <p>After a long conversation my friend took out of his pocket a check to the amount of $26.81. "Look here," he said, "this is what I have earned in six days, including the pay for overtime."</p>
   <p>"How many hours did you work," I asked him, "in order to get that check?" "I have been working from an early hour in the morning till as late as eight or nine o'clock in the evening, so that I could hardly stand on my feet when I had to go home."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Do you think that only this countryman of mine is in such a miserable condition? Oh no, there are thousands of such people in Chicago. Fortunately, my friend has only a small family; a wife and two children. It would be interesting to know how the other Russians live who are working in the stockyards and have wives and six or more children. Only think of it! $26.81 to spend on a family of five or six persons when you have to pay the rent to the landlord, pay for gas, electric light, coal, clothes, to the butcher so that he would not starve you! What will be left of this money? Only the wind in your pocket and an empty purse. From all this you must see that a good half of the Russian workmen in Chicago live in conditions which cannot be regarded as normal.</p>
   <p>Not all Russians residing in Chicago are working in Crane's plants or in the stockyards; many work in other places. One of these days I shall tell you about them.</p>
