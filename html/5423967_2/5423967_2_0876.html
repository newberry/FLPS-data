   <p>The question about the knights of the Invisible Empire has again come to the surface of American political life.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows pretty well how powerful this organization is and how arch-reactionary are its purposes.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, politicians - with the exception of those who came forward with a raised visor, keep silent or make declarations of such an indefinite hazy character that it is hard to define whether their attitude towards the klan is a negative one or a thoroughly friendly one favoring these ostentatious ultra patriots.</p>
   <p>Only yesterday we have published a communication about the attitude of the commander of the troops in the state of Michigan towards these <span class="page-break">\2</span>knights of the dark night. General Moseley, like the soldier he is, gave an exact and pithy characterization of these irresponsible citizens, who deal summarily with all those who do not please them, using against such persons methods belonging to the darkest period of long-gone-by medieval times.</p>
   <p>In the military camp where the soldiers of General Moseley's division have their quarters there have been put up today machine guns, and the members of the klan will be greeted with some real shooting if they will try again to arrange in this camp their fantastic Jesuitical gatherings.</p>
   <p>The military have received orders to open fire immediately if the klansmen make any attempt to penetrate surreptitiously into camp.</p>
   <p>The American Fascists of our days will, of course, call General Moseley a Roman-Catholic or a Jew, or they may declare him to be the representative of some other alien tribe and religion hateful to them, but that will not <span class="page-break">\3</span>help them any and the poor klansmen will have to give vent to their anger in some inconspicuous way. For General Moseley cannot be kidnaped and taken to some out-of-the-way place where they could brand him with a red-hot iron with the ominous letters K. K. K. The American Fascists are the worst enemies of the great American people and of all the other nationalities which have found in this country their second fatherland.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Democratic candidate J. Davis has attacked the klansmen does not mean at all that he is a sincere anti-klannist. It was just a tactical move made in order to find out his antagonist's (in this case the latter was Coolidge) attitude towards the klan.</p>
   <p>In these our days all workmen should also remember that, while the truly progressive Senator La Follette has in a quite outspoken manner declared his disapprobation of the klansmen who are masquerading in <span class="page-break">\4</span>Democratic togas, Henry Ford, arch-capitalist and at the same time a friend of both Coolidge and Davis, when he was interviewed last time remarked that "the klan is a healthy patriotic organization"; that "a malicious propaganda has calumniated too much these loyal sons of our country." Thus at the moment when the elucidation of the attitude of all American political circles to the Ku Klux Klan has become necessary, the workmen will be able to find out who will be on their side in the struggle for a better future for the proletariat and who will be opposing them.</p>
