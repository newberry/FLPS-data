   <p>American political parties have already started the pre-election campaign, and each one of them while assailing the others proclaims its own formulas for regaining prosperity for the American people. Former President Hoover, who appeared in the role of a leader of the Republican party at a meeting held by the Ohio Society in the Hotel Astor in New York, at which fifteen hundred people were present, both Republicans and persons who do not belong to any party, subjected to a very severe criticism the new economic moves initiated by the Roosevelt administration for the purpose of relieving the crisis, and he ridiculed some of the acts of the New Deal. He told his hearers that only three letters in the entire English alphabet remain unused as initials for the innumerable new organizations that are being created by the New Deal bureaucrats, and that all the new branches of the Government <span class="page-break">\2</span>so far created have not in the least improved the conditions of the people or made poor people rich.</p>
   <p>While approving of some of the measures passed and enforced by the New Deal sponsors as beneficial social reforms, Hoover laid down his own program, which in its essentials consists of drastic reduction in expenditures for unnecessary public work and the entire suspension of some of it. The adminstration of relief should be handed over to municipalities and to other local authorities, [said he]. Spending money for un-American experiments should be altogether discontinued, and the hordes of political bureaucrats should be eliminated. Money appropriated for specific purposes, as required by the Constitution, should be used for those purposes and for no other. The federal budget should be balanced by chopping off some of the expenditures now being made for the upkeep of the greatly overstaffed federal department, not by the imposition of additional burdensome taxes. The purchase of silver from abroad should be discontinued, and the gold standard should be re-established with free circulation of gold. The act [which legalizes] inflation <span class="page-break">\3</span>should be repealed, and all tinkering with the currency should be stopped.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt in responding to his critics declares that the economic maladjustment and the consequent crisis which he found on entering the White House compelled his administration to take the necessary steps for the liquidation of the causes producing industrial stagnation and the consequent suffering of the great mass of the people. He states that the main and major expenditures for the liquidation of the economic crisis have already been made, and that in future the expenses for this purpose will be gradually reduced. In his administration, the President states, the federal indebtedness has increased only from 21 billion to 30 billion dollars, and out of the total increase six billion dollars are considered by the Treasury recoverable assets; the public works give employment to three million people who during their idleness were supported by relief, and three million more have obtained employment in private industry; the credit of the United States is better than that of any other country; and in the last two and a half years the economic condition of the country has greatly improved with prospects of still <span class="page-break">\4</span>greater improvement in the future.</p>
   <p>At the farmers' convention in Chicago President Roosevelt appeared with a fighting speech before a crowd of eighteen thousand people. He spoke with passion and bluntness and called his opponents speculators and wreckers who for personal gain incite city dwellers against the farming population. Defending all phases of the New Deal, Roosevelt touched upon the AAA and said that the farm program has one main purpose--"to stop exploiters in their rule, which has led farmers to bankruptcy and made them slaves". Roosevelt's reforms were designed to improve the condition of the working people, and yet they have been found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and thus almost entirely abrogated.</p>
   <p>It is quite interesting to note that the appeal addressed by American clergymen, scientists, and public men in a letter to President Roosevelt advises him to keep to the left course. The signers consider that within the scheme of the capitalist order restoration of firm and permanent prosperity is impossible, <span class="page-break">\5</span>but still they are convinced that Roosevelt has done more good for the working people than any of his predecessors. For that reason they advise him to encourage the co-operative movement, to support the unions, and to strive for the nationalization of the basic branches of industry.</p>
   <p>Governor Olson of Minnesota, advocating the creation of a third party (the Farmer-Labor party) because neither the Republican party with its rugged individualism nor the Democratic party with its half-baked reforms can replace capitalism with a more perfect co-operative order, asserts that under capitalism good, orderly life is impossible, and that it is also impossible [under capitalism] to attain a high standard of living for the great mass of the people.</p>
   <p>In the forthcoming political struggle for seats in Congress the Townsend plan will be a very potent factor; it is already being exploited by the Republicans, who see in it the means of attracting votes. Townsend's followers everywhere <span class="page-break">\6</span>are meeting with notable success, and they can, it seems, tip the scales in the direction desired.</p>
