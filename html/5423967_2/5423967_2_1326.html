   <p>On Sunday, November 8, 1936, the Brotherhood of St. George (the 1st branch of the Russian Independent Society for Mutual Help) arranged an entertainment in the large hall of the Douglas Park Auditorium. This entertainment was attended by a large crowd of Russians and, owing to the interesting program, was very successful. The great attraction was an original comedy in the Ukrainian language, entitled "Protect your home", being a witty satire on the bolshevist regime in the Ukraine. The public enjoyed the performance very much. Mrs. White and Mr. Bakalets played two of the important roles. After the comedy, there was an interesting musical program. Speeches were made by the Rev. P. Nervana, Mr. A. Dyedoshko and Mr. V. Olesyuk.</p>
