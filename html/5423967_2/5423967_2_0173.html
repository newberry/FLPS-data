   <p>Thinkers, philosophers, and reformers from ancient times to the close of the last century have described in most enchanting terms the life of the human race in the future. All these prophecies have emphasized the same dominant conception: that the day will come when life on our earth will be one resplendent paradise; that want and disease will disappear; that men will work only four to six hours a day, and yet will be provided with all the comforts and luxuries of life; that machines will do all the work, and that men will merely control and supervise them; that people will have much leisure, and will have the opportunity to create new and significant cultural values.</p>
   <p>These prognostications--even those of comparatively recent years--did not anticipate that such changes would occur soon; they were changes looked for in the distant future. The fact, however, is that the technical progress of our modern society has been so tremendous during the last two score years that it <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>seems almost unbelievable. The machine has become so universal that even today it should be possible to establish a four-hour work day without endangering our present standard of living. Modern economists and technologists agree that our entire heavy industry could safely adopt a four-hour work day without decreasing production.</p>
   <p>In agriculture also, veritable miracles have taken place. The latest technical and biological achievements in the field of agriculture were fully described and explained by Professor William Hoppe, director of the Agricultural Experimental Laboratory of the State of Iowa, in his book just published in Boston, Massachusetts. In one chapter, Professor Hoppe declares that the present decade will witness a genuine revolution in the life and habits of the entire population of the United States. The possibilities of modern scientific exploitation of the soil will be so enhanced, according to Professor Hoppe, that all the big cities of this country will become depopulated as a result of a reverse wave of migration from the great industrial centers to the country.</p>

   <p>Even today the human race stands at the threshold of the golden age, of the new social paradise; only it has not yet found the way to open the door to this coveted bliss. No other reason can explain the present general unemployment, hunger, and want experienced by millions of American people. Sooner or later, however, people will discover the key which will open the social and economic Eden for all generations to come. Everything in this world changes, dies out, and makes way for the new. The present social system will yield to new forms of society and to a new social structure.</p>
   <p>This utopia will fail of realization only in case the human masses turn to Bolshevism and embrace the communist version of a social paradise. The social and economic heaven promised by the communists would soon turn into terror, brutality, hunger, and death.</p>
   <p>We are witnessing now in America a wave of unemployment, followed by the shortening of working hours. In Soviet Russia, the people are in chains, doing forced <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>labor for the Red czar. They have no bread, no shoes, no clothing, and no houses to live in. These things should interest those among our group who, through ignorance, still regard the Bolshevik hell as a social paradise.</p>
