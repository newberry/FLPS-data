   <p>I do not pretend to retract my Socialistic beliefs. I write what I think and think what I write. The American government is not frightful to me because I like it for its democracy, regardless of the fact that my democratism is radical.</p>
   <p>The American nation and its government are organized in such a way that it would make no difference which party may turn out in the majority. Since the law is the will of the nation - it being enacted by representatives of the people - that will of the nation is considered, and the whole nation, without contradiction, submits to it.</p>
   <p>Although I may differ regarding the ruling of this country, yet with all my faith I sustain it. If there is anything that does not agree <span class="page-break">\2</span>with me, there comes an election in which I have the right to vote for whoever and whatever I choose as best.</p>
   <p>American laborers are grumbling over the unrighteous attitude toward them by one or another party. This is absolutely correct. But how should this unrighteousness be corrected? The only way out is to bring the matter up before the people for improvement of such laws as do not satisfy their needs. In this country the will of the people is everything. Let us assume that the nation after having made a mistake does not always make laws for its correction. This is equivalent to the child who tries to walk without another's help - it must fall down several times. As the child, in due time, begins to walk without falling down, so the great country gradually will improve its social and industrial life.</p>

   <p>All the defects and grumblings gradually make room for improvements. There is no value in a man's life if it does not leave any traces of his work for the improvement of humanity. We may say that everything progresses by way of evolution whenever the way is open and free, but when such a way is thorny and there is lack of democracy, there, of course, revolution is due.</p>
   <p>Revolution in the autocracy and evolution in the democracy.</p>
   <p>We shall support democratic America in all actions in the name of democracy of all the world.</p>
