   <p>When we were living in the old country, many of us thought it rather bold to affirm that among the people there, who were walking behind the plough, there were some who were possessed of infinite latent possibilities. But now we can see that such a statement would have been quite true. Mr. N. Gumenuke, though he has studied music only a comparatively short time, has been so successful that he was able to join the Chicago Civic Orchestra. And this promises to open to him ultimately the doors of the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra, the best orchestra of Chicago. Mr. Gumenuke prepares his son also for a musical career. He is also conducting a musical school of his own where about 25 pupils are studying very successfully.</p>
