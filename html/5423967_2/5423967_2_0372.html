   <p>When the first telegrams received here brought the sad news that "a rising of the Bolsheviki had taken place in Petrograd" we supposed that Kerensky would know how to duly thwart their insolent endeavors.</p>
   <p>When later the extras proclaimed that the Bolsheviki had occupied the Mariinsky Palace where the session of the Provisional parliament were taking place; that they had seized the telephone stations, the offices of telegraphic agencies; that a detachment of armed women guards the Winter Palace; that Trotsky is in power and issues orders about pogroms, - we had faith in the good sense of the population; we were still hoping that the people would not allow any ugly occurrences and that Kerensky would be victorious; that with his iron hand he would crush all resistance. But day after day and hour after hour the events are becoming more and more alarming, the character of the rising has become more dangerous, and the forces of the black ravens get more and more threatening.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The American press, which usually prints all sensational news on the first page, this time, when the news about the rising in Russia came, has been withholding them for four or five days. Whether it has been done intentionally or not, public opinion in this country has been thoroughly prepared for various serious complications over there, in Russia.</p>
   <p>With a devilish dispatch the Bolsheviki seized power, put under arrest four ministers, and Kerensky was forced to hide himself.</p>
   <p>Lenin and Trotsky, who were under the ban of the government, become the heroes of the day and make the utmost efforts to fan the flame of civil war into as big and dangerous a fire as possible.</p>
   <p>The capital and cities and towns, responsible statesmen and ordinary citizens are disturbed and do not know what to do.</p>
   <p>The slogan of the Bolsheviki, i. e., the slogan given by Lenin and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>dictated from Berlin, an immediate peace, makes the population wonder; and herein in this slogan lies the whole trouble of the present moment, the whole sadness of present events.</p>
   <p>We Russians living in the United States were consoled by the fact that during the first days of the rising the provincial Soviets of workmen's and soldiers' deputies declared themselves against the tactics of the Central Petrograd Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies. The provincial Soviets of this large organization were siding with Kerensky and his Provisional government. But to protest is one thing and to be robbed is quite another matter. It is one thing to tell that one is against some policy or regime, but what are you going to do when armored automobiles with guns attack the women's battalion, and a cruiser moving along the Neva fires volleys at the Winter Palace? The provincial committees did protest, but the hard boiled Lenin and Trotsky dictated to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>them something different and declared relentlessly their decrees: to obliterate all that is living, to destroy, to rob. And that which Kerensky and the friends of Russia have been building for many months is being destroyed.</p>
   <p>And now the people not only sheds blood on the battlefields, fighting the foreign enemy, but bleeds to death in battling with the internal enemy, that new type of plundering ruffians now in full force. There was a time when we were cursing the Krushevans, the Stolypins, Nicholas II, the Purishkevichs, the Markovs, Shcheglovitovs, etc. And now we have to curse the Lenins, Trotskys and their ilk.</p>
   <p>Once we knew that there is in existence a "black hundred," and we had to take that into consideration; and now Lenin, Trotsky and their helpers, parading as protectors of the "welfare of the country," undermine the foundations of the Russian revolution still worse than <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the worst reactionaries. There was a time when one could see the nagaika (A kind of whip used by the Cossacks) protruding from the pocket of a tail-coat; now one sees daggers and revolvers stuck under the belts girding Russian shirts.</p>
   <p>What is the difference?</p>
   <p>During the days of reaction, under the tsaristic regime, the Russian shirt was regarded as a noble article of clothing, for it used to cover the noble chests of the noble sons of the noble Russian country; and for scores of years the best elements of the country suffering under the curse of tsarism were proud to wear the Russian shirt. And now this same Russian shirt covers the flabby chest of Lenin, hiding the shame of his prostitution.</p>
   <p>Let Lenin publish new lists of "ministers" selected from his followers; <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>let him issue a decree about the arrest of the best sons of the country and about the necessity of murdering Kerensky; let him proclaim that the Provisional government is not in power any more, that he, Lenin, is now at the head of the country. Let it be so! Let it be so! - yet nobody will be able to prove that Lenin and Trotsky, these international traveling salesmen, are right in acting the way they do.</p>
   <p>Lenin and Trotsky were severed from Russia a long time ago; the interests of Russia are foreign to them; they do not know the needs of the country, of the people. They are rather Swiss, Germans, Frenchmen, but certainly not Russians. To them the welfare of the country is just a meaningless sound; all their tactics, all their endeavors are based on robbery, on seizure of other people's property.</p>
   <p>Russia is not ready for those changes which they are going to preach.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Russia has been liberated only a few months ago from tsarism which had entangled that country in a war. Russia has not had the time yet to recuperate from the days of the upheaval it has experienced. Russia has passed through enough trouble during the days of Kornilov and other insurrections caused by leaders, and here is where we get one more surprise: "Lenin's campaign!"</p>
   <p>It would be difficult of course to tell now what will be the end of it all; it is difficult to philosophize when one does not know the true state of affairs; but one thing is certain, it is that now in Russia the people are passing through great sufferings.</p>
   <p>It is possible that Lenin will be victorious, just like the reactionaries were victorious under tsarism, in the days when the Russian people had become conscious of their bad plight. But in the soul of any sensible man there is sown the seed of hatred towards Lenin, and one can <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>only wish that the country would awaken as soon as possible and would take at its true value the services rendered to it by its "friends," Lenin, Trotsky and the like.</p>
   <p>And to them - to these international hooligans who are doing their best to demoralize our country - we send from afar our curse and our wish that they would fail in their undertaking. And failure will be the end of it - we are sure of that.</p>
   <p>If Kerensky has not been able until now to do for the country, for its people, more than what he has achieved; if Kerensky's popularity, his genuine devotion, his enthusiasm have not yet led the country to a victory over its foe, we don't blame him, for we know that what has been subject to destruction during many years is hard to build up again. It cannot be done in a few days. If Kerensky with his noble soul, his heartfelt enthusiasm for his work, and his intense devotion <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>to the people has not been able to get Russia out of her plight, how could a handful of "insurrectionists" stop the war immediately and distribute the land? Nobody is able to solve these problems so suddenly; neither will our international leaders be able to give the right answer to these questions when the debauch is over and the people ask them: "Where are your promises?"</p>
