   <p>Honorable A. J. Sabath</p>
   <p>Chairman Roosevelt for President National Campaign Committee</p>
   <p>139 North Clark Street</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>I hereby submit my report on the campaign by the Russian group in the campaign for the re-election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
   <p>With best personal wishes, I remain,</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>A. J. Pikiel, Chairman</p>
   <p>Russian Division</p>
   
   <p>The campaign has been started about the beginning of September of 1936. Most of the committees, such as States of Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois, have been formed before that time. It became necessary for me to go in person to organize committees for the States of Indiana and Wisconsin, and thus I have traveled to Gary where I attended a meeting of the Russian-American Organization, to which I explained the aims of this committee and the importance of the re-election of the President for the new term. I was fortunate to form a committee of five men, placing on the same only outstanding members of Russian voters in the State of Indiana.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Nalin is the chairman for the State of Indiana of our organization and he is the leader of the Russian-American political and social life in the State of Indiana. He is the chairman of the Russian-American Citizens' Organization for the State of Indiana.</p>
   <p>It became necessary for me to go to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to organize a committee for the State of Wisconsin. Dr. Joseph Jankowski was placed as chairman of that committee and Dr. Serge A. Hartmann and Dr. Alexander S. Hartmann to act as members on the same committee. Mr. Steve Lagoy and Felix Kretch, former newspaper men, also are members of the committee.</p>
   <p>It was possible to form a fully representative committee of leading citizens of the State of Wisconsin in Russian life.</p>
   <p>I was fortunate in forming a committee in the State of Iowa, and Attorney Wm. A. Shuminsky was placed in charge of our committee for the State of Iowa. He is an active member of Russian social and political life in Iowa and through his influence I was able to obtain services of Gus Bogdanow and John Levich on the committee.</p>
   <p>Through my friendship with Mr. Alexander Pristupa of Cleveland, Ohio, I obtained his cooperation and a committee was formed in the State of Iowa. Mr. Pristupa is an outstanding member in fraternal organizations there and he is the deacon of our church in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
   <p>The Russian population in the Middle West is grouped in Chicago and Cook County, and especial care was given to the forming of the committee for the state of Illinois. Dr. George L. Percy, associate professor of medicine in the medical school at the University of Illinois, was made the honorary chairman of our group for the Middle West. As a chairman of a Russian-American Citizens' Organization of Illinois I have been given the honor of appointment as president of this organization. George Wallace, president of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, was made first vice-president. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the largest fraternal order that we have west of the Allegheny Mountains. Phillip Michajlowsky is the deacon of the Russian-Greek Orthodox Trinity Church of Chicago, and he is the chairman of a string of fraternal orders, some of them extending to Pennsylvania. Mrs. Paula Griboff was placed as chairman of the women's division. She is well known and active in the leadership of the Russian women of Chicago. Roman Homko, the secretary of our organization, is the president of the Russian Officers' Association of Chicago. Anton Bernoff, the treasurer of our organization, is the president of the Russian School Board of Chicago, which has a chain of about twenty Russian schools in and around Chicago.</p>
   <p>Activity began by explaining the importance of the campaign to various state chairmen and outlining the trend of the campaign and subject of speeches from time to time as supplied to us by Hon. A. J. Sabath.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago is the cultural, fraternal, and political heart of the Russian population in the Middle West. We have two Russian papers located here: Russian Daily News, a daily paper, having a circulation of about twenty thousand, and Russian Review, a weekly paper, having a circulation of about sixteen thousand. These two papers reach not only Chicago, but the entire area of thirteen Middle Western states and up to the Rocky Mountains, so that the publicity for the Middle West was carried out in Chicago. Our Chicago office, without additional costs to the headquarters, has published or caused it to be published an article, an item, or some news furthering our cause, from day to day in our Russian Daily News, and the same news appeared weekly in the Russian Weekly. Through the graces of His Eminence Bishop Leontiy, Russian Greek-Orthodox bishop for the Middle West, we were fortunate in obtaining some space in his magazine, Our Way. His Eminence has been heartily in accord with the principles advocated by our great President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His Eminence allowed us to appear at the churches with our campaign literature and he allowed numerous priests to actively participate in the Democratic cause.</p>
   <p>Fifty thousand Russian pamphlets were printed in our headquarters in Chicago and about twenty thousand of the same were distributed in the state of Illinois by hand; about four thousand by mail and by distribution through various clubs and ward organizations. About fifteen thousand pamphlets were distributed in the state of Indiana.</p>
   
   <p>The reason for such a large distribution in the state of Indiana was that in Gary, in October of 1936, was held a twenty-five year jubilee of the priest and foundation of the church, and it was connected with the celebration of Russian Day, so that more than fifteen thousand attended the celebration and the parade in connection therewith. The people came from neighborhood states to participate in the said celebration. About three thousand pamphlets were distributed in the state of Michigan through the assistance of a postmaster in Benton Harbor and three congressmen from Detroit, Mich. Two thousand pamphlets were distributed in the state of Iowa by our chairman, Attorney Wm. A. Shuminsky; about three thousand pamphlets were distributed in the state of Ohio. Some pamphlets were distributed in the state of Nebraska. Due to the shortage of our own pamphlets we distributed a number of pamphlets printed in New York. Although the popularity of our pamphlets printed in Chicago was such that we had to turn down numerous requests for our pamphlets as a number of them had to be sent to New York and we were distributing the pamphlets from New York which we fortunately received in time.</p>
   <p>The main office in Chicago supplied speakers to the state of Wisconsin on two occasions, and to the state of Indiana on two occasions. We have sent speakers to Berwyn, Maywood, Waukegan, and Cicero, Ill. Our speakers attended about six large social gatherings at which they were allowed to speak on behalf of the President. A luncheon was served for the various delegates to the convention of the Russian Mutual Aid Society, under the auspices of our organization. Our organization has given a concert and ball in behalf of the Democratic Party in the state of Illinois. Five meetings were held by our organization in Chicago, at which the Democratic ticket was endorsed from top to bottom.</p>
   <p>Through the efoorts of our headquarters, speakers were sent from Gary, Ind., to Hammond, Ind., and nearby towns. Speakers were sent from Milwaukee to Racine and Kenosha.</p>
   
   <p>It is my duty to note here the splendid work of Attorney Wm. A. Shuminsky who has held a Democratic rally under the leadership of our organization in Sioux City, Iowa, which was attended to by a great number of people and twelve local candidates were present at the same. A meeting was held in Cleveland, Ohio, on behalf of our great President.</p>
   <p>A radio program was given on behalf of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Chicago on three different occasions, and Dr. George L. Percy, honorary chairman of our organization, addressed the listeners twice. Mrs. Paula Griboff, our vice-chairman and chairman of the women's division, addressed once, and myself also on one occasion.</p>
   <p>Our office in Chicago has mailed out over one thousand personal letters throughout the State of Illinois and nearby states with an appeal for the support for President Roosevelt to outstanding men and women in our community. We have received a warm response to our personal communications as well as numerous and hearty responses to our radio speeches. I am enclosing with the within report my scrap-book containing fifty-three articles, items of interests to our cause, published in the Chicago papers during this campaign. I regret to say that this is the only complete record of the entire publicity campaign for President Roosevelt. Another article on behalf of the entire Democratic ticket will appear on Monday, November 2, which is not enclosed with the report, as it is impossible to get the same at this time. The last page contains our pamphlet published in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In conclusion I beg to state that the sentiment of the voters of Russian extraction is for President Roosevelt, Governor Henry Horner, and the entire Democratic ticket. I give my positive assurance that the Russian voters will vote almost one hundred per cent for the Democratic ticket. I take this oppor tunity to express my deep appreciation for the real cooperation that I have received from our chairman, Congressman A. J. Sabath, from Judge Joseph Drucker, and from Mr. Harry Rosendal, secretary to Congressman Sabath.</p>
   
   <p>The success of the Democratic ticket among our Russian people could not have been so great as I anticipated but for the capable instructions received by me and by our group from Honorable A. J. Sabath.</p>
   <p>On behalf of our group I take the liberty to express our gratitude to Congressman Sabath for the pleasant campaign, and we are certain that if not for the aid and assistance of Congressman A. J. Sabath, this campaign could not have been so successfully carried out.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>A. J. Pikiel, Chairman</p>
   <p>Russian Group.</p>
