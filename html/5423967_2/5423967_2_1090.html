   <p>A Short Description. The clock shows how the sun illumines the earth and <span class="page-break">\2</span>the moon, how the earth rotates on its axis in twenty-four hours, causing the change of day and night; how the earth moves around the sun, and how this causes the change of the four seasons(spring, summer, autumn, and winter); how the moon rotates around the earth, and how the changes (phases) of the moon are caused thereby. It shows how the earth and the moon rotate together around the sun and how solar and lunar eclipses are caused.
