   <p>This editorial commends America for recalling its troops from Germany as a good example to other powers. As a result, the editorial points out, there is now a strong sentiment in England that she withdrew hers; particularly are the English workingmen urging this step. A resolution passed by the Mechanics' Union says: "For the good of the working class and of all mankind it is imperative to do everything possible to prevent war between Germany and France, or between other nations."</p>
   <p>The editorial sees in this resolution an indication of the fact that England has realized, at last, the danger to itself and other governments from participating in the invasion of Germany.</p>
   <p>According to this editorial the workingmen in France proper are staging <span class="page-break">2</span>demonstrations of protest against invading Germany; and although the French intend now to remain on German soil for the next four years, they may soon have to think better of it.</p>
