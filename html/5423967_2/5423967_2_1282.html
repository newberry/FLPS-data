   <p>During the past few years, the Ukrainian choir in Chicago, organized by Mr. Beinecki, has enjoyed great popularity. Unfortunately, we Russians have not had a single decent choir which could compete with the Ukrainian choir.</p>
   <p>Many Russians who have beautiful voices live in Chicago; some of them sang for many years in churches and choirs in Russia. Several years ago, there used to be a good Russian choir maintained by the Russian society Znanie (Knowledge), under the direction of Mr. Paul Zaychenks, an instructor at a conservatory of music. But when the society fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks, the choir broke up.</p>
   <p>At the present time, Mr. Theodore Gontzov is living in Chicago. He graduated from a theological seminary in Kiev, and from a Moscow conservatory; then he <span class="page-break">2</span>was called to the Imperial Theater in Moscow. In Moscow, Mr. Gontzov was also professor at the Moscow conservatory.</p>
   <p>With the advent of the Bolshevik regime, he went to Paris, where he became a professor of music and voice at the Paris Conservatory. In Chicago, Mr. Gontzov has a position as music professor in a Chicago conservatory. He also has his private studio at 42 East Cedar Street.</p>
   <p>On February 26, of this year, Mr. Gontzov and his wife, the singer Maria Kurenko, gave a concert at International House. The concert was a great success.</p>
   <p>Some of our singers have asked Mr. Gontzov to organize a Russian choir in Chicago, and he has agreed to undertake the task. Since he wishes to put the <span class="page-break">3</span>choir on a professional level, and to make it one of the finest in Chicago, Mr. Gontzov has decided to test the voices of the choral applicants very carefully. The singing exercises and rehearsals will be conducted in his private studio after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gontzov has been kind enough to ask all those who are seriously interested in joining the choir to come to his private studio at 42 East Cedar Street, telephone: Delaware 3419, on Wednesday, May 31. After the choir is organized, Mr. Gontzov intends to conduct it on business principles, so that every member of the choir will receive at least some remuneration for his efforts, as well as transportation to and from the studio.</p>
   <p>Those people who wish to discuss the matter in person may see Mr. Gontzov any day at his studio, or may call him on the telephone.</p>
   <p>We extend to Mr. Theodore Gontzov our heartfelt wish for the success of this <span class="page-break">4</span>new choir, and we hope that the whole local Russian colony will give its full support to this splendid project.</p>
