   <p>On Augst 4, 1917, the Russian colony of Chicago met face to face the representatives of free, new, revolutionary Russia. The massmeeting which was arranged by the conference of all Russian organizations of Chicago in honor of the reception of our dear guests was solemn. We Chicagoans proved to be men of better breeding than the New Yorkers; there were no scandals at our meeting and there was not found any place for the uncontrolled passions of the ignorant crowd. A long time before the beginning of the meeting, the public crowded the galleries, balconies and other places within reach of the workers of the Russian colony. The parterre, with its two-dollar seats, which were reserved for the Russian aristocracy - falsely so-called, - was almost empty. The magnificent orchestra of forty persons could not control the incresing enthusiasm and impatience of the public.</p>
   <p>Finally, at 8:30 P. M., the mission was invited by the representatives <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the local Russian press, A. Pokatilov and N. Klekner, and accompanied by them, it went to the stage of the big Auditorium Theatre. It seemed that there would be no end to the thunder of applause and the roaring of the crowd.</p>
   <p>Speeches by the Representatives of the Colony.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the secretary of the conference, Dr. H. Krasnow.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berg, the chairman of the evening, was the first to greet the ambassadors of revolutionary Russia on behalf of the Russian organizations of all nationalities of the city of Chicago; Mr. Khinoy spoke on behalf of the group of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party; K. Mill gave a speech of welcome on behalf of the Jewish organization "Bund"; K. Jurgelonis made a welcoming talk on behalf <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the Lithuanian Socialist and Workers organizations.</p>
   <p>Reception of the Special Russian Mission.</p>
   <p>I. Erin delivered an address on behalf of the non-partisan progressive organizations; D. Orlovsky spoke on behalf of the church organizations.</p>
   <p>Speeches by the Members of the Mission.</p>
   <p>The orchestra plays the "Marseillaise." The walls are shaken by stormy ovations. Ambassador V. A. Bakhmetyev greets and congratulates the new, free Russia on behalf of revolutionary Russia. The orchestra plays Gymn Svobodnoy Possii (Hymn of Free Russia; words by the Russian poet K. Balmont). Further, the ambassador recalls our never-to-be forgotten dreams, which are now realized. "The thorny way is passed and we have reached a republican Russia, and we are on the eve of elections to <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the Constituent Assembly. Only a few months from now, and we will have a Constituent Assembly. We do not have to fight now for what we have already obtained, but to protect it. We should keep and protect the democracy which we have obtained by shedding our blood. We especially must remember it now, when Russia is on the verge of destruction. Remember that we will be responsible for not keeping and protecting our conquests - the conquests of democracy - not only before Russia, but before the whole world."</p>
   <p>Further, the ambassador points out that free Russia should be founded upon the will of the people; should create through its will, and be a strong and organized republic, with the audacity to protect its rights and its country, and should have no place for chaos and disorganization. For that purpose it is necessary to have a revolutionary army, by no means for conquests, but for the protection of liberty. "Let us believe," concludes the ambassador, "in the reasonable organized work of Russia, which will lead the world to liberty and everlasting peace."</p>

   <p>After that the ambassador presents his comrade of the mission, Prof. U. Lomonosov. "Thanks for the touching reception," begins Professor Lomonosov, "not we, but you, are the first representatives of new Russia. All Russians who are present here and others who are scattered in the cities of America - first representatives, untouched source of creative powers for Russia - I bow to you." The speech of this talented orator was beautiful and confident. The orator warns about the danger threatening Russia, owing to the disagreements and strife between various kinds of partisan movements. "From Purishkevich to Lenin all were agreed on this point: that the den of Tsarskaye Selo must be destroyed. Now, when it is necessary to construct a great democracy; when it is necessary to concentrate all our powers on the process of building Russia, we commit a crime by bringing in disorganization and chaos." The speaker reminds that "history is not waiting, that time is going on, that stoppage and confusion in the building of Russia cannot be tolerated."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"The irrevocable is like death!" The speaker insists on the immediate elimination of discords which ruin Russia. Each and everyone cannot put forth his opinions and his demands. Compromises are necessary. It is impossible to satisfy the ideal of each Russian, i. e., of all the 180 millions of the population. Only the former autocracy dreamed about the unity of the ideal of 180 millions of persons. But the autocracy did not recognize the "living spirit of the human thought: its ideal is the unanimity of the grave!" Lomonosov compares the fate of present Russia with a ship from which a part of the treasures should be thrown overboard in order to save the ship with the passengers and most of the treasures. "The time of discussion has passed," says Professor Lomonosov, "the specter of civil war threatens us! The fate of Russia is in our own hands. Let us prove it to the whole world, that we are citizens, but not slaves!" On account of the great fatigue of the members of the mission and due to lack of time, the meeting was adjourned about 11 P. M.</p>

   <p>Note: The aim of the Special Russian Mission was to bring together economically Russia and the United States; to establish commercial relations with the Provisional government of Kerensky, and to conclude new treaties with them in place of the tsarist treaties. N. K.</p>
