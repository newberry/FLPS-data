   <p>The other day Rassviet published a letter signed by our well-known dancing master, Mr. A. Andriev, in which he proposes that all the Russian dancing masters in the city form an organization that will permit professional Russian dancers to co-ordinate their efforts on all occasions, such as dance festivals and the opening of dancing schools.</p>
   <p>I subscribe to the idea that such an organization would promote our Russian art and would benefit those who joined it.</p>
