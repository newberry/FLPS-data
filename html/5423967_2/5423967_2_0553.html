   <p>After a period of persistent effort and hard work, the Russian-American Democratic League has succeeded in achieving rather remarkable results. The organization now has over eight hundred members. It has a network of branches all over the great city of Chicago and in many of its suburbs. The League has two permanent offices: one downtown, at 155 North Clark Street, and one on the West Side, at 1902 West Division Street. Several hundred people visit the League offices every month.</p>
   <p>The Russian-American League helps the Russian people of Chicago in many ways. Its officers give free legal aid to those who seek it; they help Russian people acquire American citizenship; they intervene with the proper authorities in behalf of those who are unable to speak English and who are in need of aid and advice. The League has given several entertainments and picnics <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which have been great successes.</p>
   <p>As a result of the broad activities of the Russian-American Democratic League, the Russian people of Chicago have achieved equality with other national groups of the city. Like other foreign-language groups in Chicago, we have been given space in the Morrison Hotel, where the Democratic party has its headquarters for the Chicago area.</p>
   <p>The Russian-American Democratic League is the only Russian-American political organization in Chicago. Every Russian living in this city should strive, first, to become a citizen of the United States, and then to join the Russian-American Democratic League. This organization does not attempt to interfere with the activities of clubs, mutual aid societies, or other Russian organizations. On the contrary, it works in complete harmony and co-operation with all other Russian organizations. The Carpatho-Ruthenians, our blood brothers, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>are also joining the League in order to facilitate common political action of the two groups.</p>
   <p>The downtown office of the League is open every day from ten o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon. The West Side office, located at the headquarters of the Russian-American Democratic Club, 1902 West Division Street, is open every day from four o'clock in the afternoon until midnight.</p>
