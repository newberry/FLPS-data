   <p>The Slavonic Club, in conjunction with the University of Chicago, wants to remind the Russian colony that on February 22 and 23 every Russian who values Russian art is invited to come and receive an artistic treat, for the stage production under the guidance of Mary Astrov-Lazareva is really an artistic accomplishment.</p>
   <p>To our question as to the difference between the Russian method and others, Madame Lazareva replied by taking us into secret spheres of artistic stage production. The Russian method differs markedly in its approach to the study of the characters involved in the play as compared to the method employed by the American theater. Our method is that of creation, of re-embodying the character into the role so that the actor repossesses the character to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish between the actor and the character he represents; in other words, the actor lives in the role of the character.</p>

   <p>Only by such a method and by such acting it is possible to captivate the spectator and make him get the feel of the character; only such a method can compel the public to live and feel the roles with the cast. This fire of creation--this warmth that breathes from the stage during the presentation and welds every one together in the theater--makes the actors and spectators indivisible during the play. Candor, simplicity and artistic truthfulness on the stage--this is the method employed by the Moscow Art Theater. This method is practiced by all its studies as well as by the Theater of Maxim Gorky which was founded by Mr. [I.V.] Lazareva with the co-operation of Mr. Gorky. Thanks to this method the theater was put on the same level with the other academic theaters (the Moscow Art Theater, the Imperial Grand and the Imperial Small theaters). The government granted a subsidy to this theater one year after its foundation.</p>
   <p>Exactly one hundred years ago the best actors of the Russian stage fought against everything that was false and ostentatious. The actor-genius, Mikhail Semenovich Schepkin, contemporary and close friend of Nikolay Vasilievich Gogol, was one of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the first and most ardent fighters for the introduction of this method of character study on the stage. Gogol in his letters to Schepkin writes: "Only you can understand my works and help other actors to utilize the characters." Schepkin started his career as an actor when he was 17 years old. For several years he toured the provincial towns with stock companies and saved money in order to free himself from the bonds of his employer. Later, he was invited to go on the Moscow stage, where he spent about thirty years. Having exerted great influence on his contemporaries, Schepkin left deep impressions on the Russian theater of later days. Only the Moscow Art Theater has developed this method to a degree of perfection and has thereby acquired for itself world renown.</p>
   <p>The American Guild Theater at its banquet on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Moscow Art Theater paid tribute to the cultural influence exerted by the Moscow stage on the entire world, and established a fund from which American students may receive money for their studies of stage-art in Moscow. This Theater Guild is aware that there is only one place where one may learn <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>everything that is of value to the stage. Madame Lazareva employed the same method for nearly two years with her troupe at Hull House, and "Marriage" by Gogol which will be staged on February 22 and 23 at International House, 1414 East 59th Street, will give you an excellent example of the work done by this Theater.</p>
