   <p>A band of bandits, under the mask of benefactors of humanity, seized power in Russia in 1917 and began to outrage all the Russian people. They seized authority by the use of deceit and violence, and retain it by the same means.</p>
   <p>Kirov's assassination cannot be considered a casual affair. On the contrary, on close examination of the whole incident, it becomes clear that his murder was premeditated. Trotsky's followers could not possibly discontinue their struggle for seizure of the supreme authority after Lenin's death. The followers of Trotsky deceived Lenin's followers by false promises and disclaimers in order to get an opportunity to revenge themselves upon their enemies. They are just as treacherous, and as set on revenge as Stalin's followers. By Kirov's assassination, they frightened Stalin to such a degree that this tyrant is ready to jump out of his own hide. Consequently, he puts to death not only <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the guilty ones, but their kin as well--women and children. Stalin's GPU put to death everyone whose name was blacklisted. They did it because they consider as guilty not only the persons involved in the plot, but innocent individuals as well; thus they can intimidate others, otherwise the band of bandits might be threatened with serious trouble. By such means, they attempt to continue to hold the whole Russian people in slavery. The heart of Russia shrinks at every blow of the Bolshevik tyranny, although those who killed Kirov have not even been touched.</p>
   <p>But how about Mr. Schkliar and his band of sycophants; he discusses this event in his seditious Novy; Mir [Translator's note: name of Bolshevik newspaper in New York]. He rages, and claims that Kirov's murderers crossed the boundaries of Russia from Latvia and Poland, and organized the terrorist acts against the Soviet government. All of them, according to Mr. Schkliar, are supporters of the czarist regime. He also rages against all class-conscious workers, against all members of ROOV, RNzOV and the newspaper Rassviet. He accuses all class-conscious workers [of complicity], in Kirov's assassination.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>These traders in human souls call mass meetings in order to instigate peasants' sons against class-conscious workers and against their mothers and fathers who still live across the ocean. Typical speculators, under the mask of people's friends, they deny every evidence of the suffering endured by the Russian people, They try to comfort illiterate individuals by claiming that the hardships and sufferings of the Russian people are not at all serious.</p>
   <p>The Russian people, hungry and deprived of all rights, have not even the right to tell the rest of the world about their own misfortune, and to ask for help and protection. We, residents of the United States, are, however, very well aware of the blood-curdling tragedy that is being perpetrated on the Russian people. We hear their groans.</p>
   <p>Therefore, enough of silence! We should all unite, arrange mass meetings and proclaim to the entire world: the Russian people have suffered enough! We <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>should tell the Bolshevik traders: stop degrading our peasant name and spitting on justice. I call on all peasant sons in Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, and other cities: enough of silence. We must raise our voices, as one man, in protest against the Bolshevik murderers, in defense of our brothers in Russia.</p>
