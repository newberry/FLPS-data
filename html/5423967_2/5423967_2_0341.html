   <p>We often read that in Eastern Siberia a young Russian, General Semenov, is leading a campaign against the Bolsheviks. We feel it is necessary for us to explain the essential aim of this anti-Bolshevist campaign. But how shall we explain it? Someone affirms that Semenov's aim is to assist in the restoration of monarchy in Russia; others say that he is a revolutionist; that he is a partisan of the organized colleagues. Still others assert that he is an adventurer, that he adheres to the established government, etc. All this does not explain anything definitely and so, to our regret, we cannot refer to his campaign either positively or negatively. We shall only limit ourselves to the following: If General Semenov is fighting for the sovereignty of the people, that is, if he and his army are in opposition to tsarism and Bolshevism, we from the depth of our souls wish him victory and are ready to help with whatever we can and whenever the help is needed. But if he is one wishing to see any little king on the throne for his own benefit, we can say only this: The war is not for life, but to death.</p>
   <p>The readers will be pleased to help us get the right idea of his person.</p>
