   <p>Lately among Russians in Chicago one can notice a tendency to buy farms and houses. Russians who settled down in America eagerly desire to possess land and homes of their own. In the Russian colony several agents have appeared who are buying and selling lots. In a few days the well known colonist Stephan Surin will move to his farm, which he bought in the state of Michigan. The fruit farm he bought is near Benton Harbor. In the vicinity of that city there are many Russian farms. Our farmers are doing pretty well there.</p>
