   <p>The concert and ball arranged by the Chicago branch of the Russian Emigrees' Children Aid Society on May 20 was a great success, both artistically and financially. The appeal of the committee found a worthy response in the hearts of our Chicago Russians, who are always alive to the needs of our orphans. Our especial gratitude is due to the Russian professional artists and entertainers, some of whom had to cancel or postpone their appearances in other places so that they might give of their time and their talents for the worthy cause of helping the Russian children.</p>
   <p>In spite of the oppressive heat, the hall of the Russian-American Democratic Club was filled to overflowing. Our artists were at their best, and the enchanted public applauded their efforts ardently. The tunes of Russian music and the motifs of our folk songs, rendered with simplicity and inspiration, created a quaint and charming atmosphere. Everybody forgot his daily worries and admired the performance on the stage--the performance that <span class="page-break">\2</span>represented the better side of life in the Russia of bygone days. Many spectators had tears in their eyes, tears of emotion awakened by the memories of the past. Nothing can so inspire and stir the human emotions so much as music, song and dance. All praise and honor to you servants of the Russian arts, for your loyalty and devotion to your higher callings, and for spreading appreciation of the Russian arts in America even when your economic condition is very difficult and your lives are filled with obstacles of all kinds.</p>
