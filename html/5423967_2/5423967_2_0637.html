   <p>On the basis of several months' observation of the Italian military action in Abyssinia the military observer of the Journal de la Nation in Geneva proves that the "motorized war" has failed completely. The author of the article comments as follows:</p>
   <p>"The most important tactical lesson which so far can be derived of the Italian military operations in Abyssinia is the total failure of aviation and tanks to act successfully against the crudest and most primitive methods of war employed by the natives."</p>
   <p>Indeed, at the very beginning of the war, according to this observer, even the foreigners residing in the Abyssinian capital doubted very much whether the Abyssinians could resist more than a month the Italian air armada and the tanks.</p>

   <p>However, this quick victory for the Italian motorized troops did not materialize. Although in the first raids Italian fliers inflicted considerable losses on the native troops, at present Abyssinian losses from air bombardments are much less important and are insignificant in comparison with the ammunition used. This is explained by the fact that the natives, whenever enemy aircraft approach, scamper around and seek some kind of protection.</p>
   <p>The same insignificant success falls to the share of the tanks. Every time that tanks start an attack on Abyssinian positions, the results prove to be negligible.</p>
   <p>"On the southern front," writes the observer, "this lack of success is due to the intolerable heat which the tank motors generate in the steel boxes occupied by the crews. On the northern front the failure is due to peculiarities of the soil which even an experienced mule cannot overcome."</p>
   <p>Tanks do not produce any panic among the native troops. This is attested by the fact that since the war began, Abyssinian warriors have captured numerous tanks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>For instance, last week they succeeded in capturing thirty. In attacking the tanks the native soldiers pour kerosene over them and set them on fire.</p>
   <p>The Italian Fascists obviously thought that the war in Abyssinia would be only a pleasant hike for them to the capital of the country, but this promenade has proved to be a very arduous one despite the fact that the natives have neither airplanes nor tanks. According to the advance plans the Italians by this time should already have captured the Abyssinian capital, but up to now they have succeeded in occupying only a small part of the country.</p>
   <p>The latest information coming from Addis Ababa informs us that in the last few days the Italians have met with several reverses and as a result of their failures have been forced to retreat and evacuate some occupied territory on both fronts.</p>
   <p>But even if we assume that the Italians will continue to deal heavy blows to the Abyssinians, it will take them several years to subjugate the entire country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>A prolonged war will mean ruin for Italy, for to carry on the war, the Italian government needs money and raw materials which Italy lacks even at the present time.</p>
   <p>Moreover, if the League of Nations decides to ban the export of oil, steel, and coal to Italy, the position of the country will become desperate, and the Italian motorized columns may suffer the same fate that befell the Italian army in the first Italo-Abyssinian war.</p>
