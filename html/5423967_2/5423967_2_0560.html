   <p>The Russian-American Democratic League in Chicago expresses its profound gratitude to all Russians in Chicago and vicinity who were present at the Russian picnic last Sunday, August 19. We also extend our thanks to all the members of the League and to all our friends who helped to organize the picnic and were instrumental in making it a great success.</p>
   <p>Let us remark, first of all, that in the entire history of our group in Chicago we have never witnessed such a great public demonstration of our unity and of our power. More than five thousand persons took part in the picnic, and thus showed the Americans that we Russians are not behind other national groups when it comes to displaying our group solidarity or giving general support to any undertaking in which our national honor is involved.</p>
   <p>Many prominent persons in Chicago's political life were present at the picnic.</p>

   <p>Many thanks to you Russian people in Chicago and its suburbs. By your presence at the picnic you have strengthened our political position in Chicago, and you have enabled the Russian-American Democratic League to help you and your children in the future. The American political leaders attending our picnic have obtained a strong impression of our unity and potential political power. They will judge us accordingly, and will treat us according to our merits. Thus the Russian-American Democratic League feels that its efforts expended in organizing the picnic have not been wasted. Our young generation will be the chief beneficiary of all our broadly planned and well-executed actions on behalf of the Russian group in Chicago.</p>
