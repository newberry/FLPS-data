   <p>Thirty million American farmers had full right to consider themselves beneficiaries of the industrial development of the country and of its industrial prosperity. After the war, overproduction of agricultural products lowered their prices so much that the farmer could hardly meet expenses connected with raising his crops. He could not pay interest on bank mortgages and was unable to buy any of the industrial products on which the prices, had gone up considerably. A scissor-like situation in respect to prices appeared between agriculture and industry--the kind of situation with which we of Russia are well acquainted and through which we lived during the Revolution. Then the village suffered while the city noisily prospered.</p>
   <p>Gradually the distress of the farmer also became vocal. He began to cry out and demand a share in the prosperity of America. How could he attain it?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The fields from year to year yielded bountiful crops. To order a rise in prices would be ineffectual. Price regulations or suggestions would be disobeyed. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover tackled the puzzling problem. They devised all kinds of palliatives, established farmers' banks, etc.; but the baffling problem remained unsolved. Finally the farmers' distress spilled over the rim and drowned American prosperity itself. Forty million people ceased to consume their proportionate share of industrial products. A great crisis arose.</p>
   <p>This crisis brought Roosevelt to the White House. He was the first president to approach the farm problem with a firm determination to change the situation of the American farmer for the better. In the spirit of his general economic policy he "took the bull by the horns". The production is too great. Reduce it. Let the farmers reduce the acreage and sow less. The prices will rise. Besides, the city should share part of the farmer's distress. On all transactions involving agricultural products was imposed a tax, the proceeds from which were to be paid to the farmers in the form of <span class="page-break">3</span>premiums. The basis of this measure was the thought that agricultural activity is a socially-useful state business, and the entire nation should assist it to prosperity.</p>
   <p>In the series of legislative enactments most effective were measures passed to relieve agriculture. The situation of the farming population has been greatly improved, and the purchasing power of one third of the country's population enhanced. This improvement has reacted favorably upon the city. However, to this improved state of things a hard blow was dealt by the latest decision of the Supreme Court, which declared unconstitutional the measures passed by Congress upon Roosevelt's urgent request.</p>
   <p>Unconstitutional? What is the matter? The matter is that the Court by a vote of 6 to 3 has decided that the Federal Government, which is represented by Roosevelt has exceeded its authority by infringing on the rights of individual states. To regulate the conditions under which farming is carried on is, as it were, the business of local authorities, and Washington has no right to <span class="page-break">4</span>decide for Boston or Detroit.</p>
   <p>Three members of the Supreme Court uphold the farm policies of Roosevelt and, therefore, it means that this judicial view is not indisputable. But, regardless of this consideration, the decision of the Court is in sharp contradiction with the basic facts of the American situation.</p>
   <p>The Constitution of the United States was drafted and adopted nearly one hundred and fifty years ago, when the United States did not represent a one truly unified state. Each of the component states had its own peculiar character, and had a right to consider itself a sovereign unit, separate from others and almost entirely independent. Local legislative powers at that time had their factual as well as their psychological justification. The Federal authority was in its embryonic stage and very weak. And there was no particular harm in that peculiar state of things as far as the people were concerned.</p>
   <p>Now, envisage present-day America with its network of railroads and highways, <span class="page-break">5</span>with its telegraph and telephone communications and air lines, with its industries built on a national scale, and with its solid sense of national unity! The interests of the individual states since then have become so interwoven that the country now presents a strongly developed organic unit. One must cut through living flesh in order to sever the organic interdependence existing among the states. The attempt to turn America back to the conditions prevailing at the end of the eighteenth century is a dangerous and harmful Utopian dream. The opinion is general that the question of revising the Constitution and adapting its basic concepts to the factual state of the new America will become the main issue in the forthcoming presidential election.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Court decision in circles close to Roosevelt and in the press supporting the President is regarded as an act of opposition to the general policies of the Roosevelt administration. Trusts, stock exchanges, conservative large-scale industries--all the combined forces which frustrated Roosevelt's plans in the sphere of industrial reclamation--are very gleeful in connection <span class="page-break">6</span>with the reverse which the President has suffered in trying to solve the agricultural problem, and congratulate themselves in anticipation of the general crash of the entire structure of economic reforms inaugurated by the Roosevelt administration, and of everything classified under the head of the "New Deal". But one who knows the character and temperament of the present President of the United States will not be carried to the extreme of rejoicing over the American social reaction. Roosevelt will continue the fight; and this, by the way, he promised in his latest speech, to do. Behind him stands the solid mass of the American people. One or another special measure pressed by Roosevelt may be disputable; but there is no doubt that this President by all that is in him serves the interests of a great majority of the American people, serves the interests of the men who work with their hands or intellect, and fights against the powers of banking and industrial feudalism. Therein lies his strength.</p>
