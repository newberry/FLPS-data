   <p>I. Okuntsov has written a description of the future Slavonic farm. He, however, regrets that the first settlers are not experienced farmers but are the new immigrants, the intellectuals who were driven from their homeland by the Russian Revolution.</p>
   <p>However, I extend my hearty greetings to those white-collar men, our former enemies and our present friends. I wish them courage and success in their new start in life. American truck farming is in every way far superior to Russian gardening. Excellent roads and good motor transportation facilities guarantee timely delivery of produce to good markets. Besides, we always have at our disposal the services of a well-trained government agriculturist.</p>
   <p>For twenty years I have been earning my livelihood from irrigated land, and I consider irrigation to be the best means of improving the lot of those farmers <span class="page-break">\2</span>who have to eke out their existence on land which otherwise would not produce. Irrigation saves us from vainly praying to heaven and constantly scanning the skies for clouds.</p>
