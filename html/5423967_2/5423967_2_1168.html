   <p>Reader, if you are not visiting the "Russian Musical Fridays" you are surely losing very much thereby. If some one of you, readers, is complaining about the spiritual weariness reigning in our colony, it is sufficient to point out to such a person the gratifying fact that these "Fridays" are establishing themselves more and more firmly and have become now a permanent institution in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Last week I visited such a "Friday" -- it was the seventh according to the schedule- and now I shall try to relate to you what I have seen and heard there.</p>
   <p>First of all you sense there the atmosphere of the Russian Opera, which has left us recently. You see the same familiar faces of habitues, attending all the Russian artistic performances; you hear the same kind of talk <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>all around during the intermissions: talk about the way some artist played his or role or sang a song, or some talk about recent events. But the chief thing that strikes your eye is the celebrated "Jacques" who is conspicuous everywhere. You see him at the box-office; then you see him again going behind the side scenes, or among the public where he is stopped by somebody almost at every step.... As we know, he was assistant manager of the Russian Opera Company which has visited us recently under the management of Federov. It happened that this Company was stuck for several months in New York because of financial difficulties; it was ultimately forced to disband.</p>
   <p>Jacques arranged two or three private concerts in New York with the participation of some of the opera singers of the Company. These concerts proved a success, and this induced Jacques to transfer these concerts to Chicago. As a result of this there arose another not less successful enterprise: a permanent Russian center with very comfortable headquarters at the Douglas Park Auditorium which have been hired for the whole winter season, the contract providing for the use of these headquarters on every Friday. The charge for admission <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is the same for all seats, and it is only fair to point out that if these concerts with the participation of renowned and talented artists had been given downtown, where one has to pay two or three dollars, they could not have been as interesting as they have been at the Douglas Park Auditorium.</p>
   <p>On the program of this interesting enterprise we find the names of such well known artists as Mmes. Isayev, Feighin, Obraztsov (singers); Mm. Kitayev (cello), Miller, (violinist), Karlash Khrzhanovsky, Yakobox (singers). Besides these artists there have come this week from New York to Chicago, Svetlov (tenor) and his wife, Mme. Daen (soprano) who are well known because of their appearances on the stage of the Russian Opera. They will join our local talent and will help thereby the realization of the plan to produce here in the future parts of operas with all the appropriate scenery, decorations and costumes.</p>
   <p>Last week the program was performed in a matchless way. It would be difficult <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to tell who among the artists deserves the highest praise. First of all, there was Kitayev playing on the cello. He played some classical music and also some popular melodies. The public was especially pleased by his performance of a pot-pourri of Russian folksongs.</p>
   <p>Next came Mile. Nita Obraztsov who has come from Russia to this country only recently, but has already acquired sincere and devoted admirers. She certainly possesses of voice of rare strength and beauty. It will not be an exaggeration if I say that neither in the Russian Opera that has visited us, nor in the Chicago Opera, could one find another singer except Galli- Curci who possesses a colorata trill of such purity as Mille. Nita Obraztsov. She sang some very interesting arias and songs. Among them "Whether the day reigns" (Dyen li tsarit ) by Tchaikovsky, an aria from the "Barber of Seville" by Rossini, "Do not sing, beautiful maiden". ("Nye poy krasavitsa") by Rakhmaninov, and an aria from "Rigoletto" by Verdi. The public was especially impressed by the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>way she sang this last aria. There was no end to the applause after she had finished it....</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Karlash, who is so much appreciated by all of us, also sang this time. As usual his "threatening" voice sounded admirably. One would like to listen to him the whole evening... He sang such well known songs as "La Bandiera" by Rotoli; "The Goat" ("Kozel") by Mussorgsky; "The Titular Councilor" (Titularniy Sovyetnik") by Dargomyzhsky, "Zashumyela, razgulyalas" by Slonov and that most lovely and -- so it seems to me-- most amusing and interesting song "The little Italian girl" (Talianochka") by Rechkunov. There is where you can see real talent....Here you have the right kind of voice, of acting, of artistic performance -- all the lovely things, you can possibly wish for. Mr. Karlash was at his best on that evening, and the public showed by endless applause its gratitude for those precious moments of true delight which he had given to his audience...</p>
   <p>On the whole it was a very interesting evening. And the following evenings <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>promise to be just as interesting, if not more so. And if you, my readers, suspect me of being over-enthusiastic in my praise, come to the concert on any Friday, and you will see whether I am right or not .....</p>
