The financial secretary's report shows that the conference had $89.68 in cash.</p>
   <p>The conference decided to send the $89.68 to Germany for the Russian prisoners of war and to inquire whether the Swiss committee for the aid of Russian prisoners of war is in existence, and whether the way for sending money to Switzerland is blocked; and if the committee exists and the way is clear, to send the money to this committee to be forwarded <span class="page-break">2</span>to its destination. If the money cannot be sent to Switzerland, then to send it to Russia, to the Soviet of Soldiers and Workers Deputies, to be forwarded to its destination.</p>
