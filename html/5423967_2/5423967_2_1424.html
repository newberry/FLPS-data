   <p>My dear Grigory Romanovich:</p>
   <p>Do not judge me severly. The cares of tomorrow, the wreched nerves and the aching soul finally got me. I cannot live any longer. I am tired. Good-bye. Forgive me.</p>

   <p>My Epitaph</p>
   <p>Good-bye beautiful created world.</p>
   <p>The Sun, bright and blue skys,</p>
   <p>Earthly paradise and fragrance of spring</p>
   <p>And all the beauty of mother nature,</p>
   <p>I leave you voluntarily</p>
   <p>For the deep darkness and endless cold.</p>
   <p>The time is here and the verdict of my fate</p>
   <p>That the eternal sleep should close my eyes.</p>
