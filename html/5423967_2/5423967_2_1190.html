   <p>Many attempts to found an art studio were made in our Russian colony, but most of these undertakings had no sound economical basis and had to be liquidated before any considerable results were achieved.</p>
   <p>On the whole the entertainments, lectures, etc., organized by the Russian people benefited and strengthened only such societies as the mutual aid, loan credit associations and consumer's cooperatives, so that these organizations were not lacking a solid economical foundation. We do not deny the fact that it is useful for everyone to learn some art, such as, singing, music, dancing, drama etc.</p>
   <p>This is a necessity of our social life. It ennobles our souls, enriches our life and enables us to maintain a contact with the traditions of the past. But in our machine age, when the whole life is built on a materialistic foundation and arts and literature sink into the background, art has also become mechanized. Most of the best actors, poets and artists are threatened by starvation and lead a miserable existence. It is a pitiful situation, but it cannot be remedied. Such is the state of our social life in the present time, and we must conform our personal life to the demands of the surrounding conditions.</p>
   <p>One of our esteemed compatriots, a Russian artist, A. A. Pikarev, suffered much while living in exile in foreign countries, but having now attained a high possition, he has set his mind on creating something new for the Russian colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>His enterprise, besides being a valuable cultural contribution, will also have a sound economical foundation.</p>
   <p>A. A. Pikarev is not only a prominent artist, but at the same time he is an inventor of a new chemical colour for which he has patented and for which there is a great demand on the American market. A. A. Pikarev has contracts with large American wholesale firms, from which he draws considerable profit.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to make known here the artist, A. A. Pikarev, but I want to acquaint our Russian people with Mr. A. A. Pikarev's plans for the Russian colony. Mr. Pikarev's plan is as follows: To create an art studio, where Russian people could learn, by newest methods and in a short period of about two or three months, enough of the fine arts to become practical workers. At the present time there is a great demand for artists in America. A course taken at Mr. A. A. Pikarev's studio would enable one to easily find profitable employment. The courses at Mr. Pikarev's art studio are moderately priced. The initial fee is $3.00, and 25 cents per lesson thereafter.</p>
   <p>Members of the Russian American Club are not obliged to pay for their lessons. Mr. Pikarev's services as teacher, will not receive any remuneration. The opening of the art studio has already taken place on February 15, the day of the fiftieth anniversary of F. Dostoyevsky's death, when a commemoration of this event was held by the Russian American Club. A. A. Pikarev organized there, a small exhibition of his own paintings. Many Russians and all others who attended the exhibition admired A. A. Pikarev's work, and on that evening twelve students enrolled. Mr. Pikarev had hoped to register fifty students. In a short time a special meeting will be called, when Mr. Pikarev will make a speech, after which the classes in the studio will begin.....</p>
   <p>It is to be desired all Russians take note and appreciate this worthy undertaking and be willing to give their support.</p>
