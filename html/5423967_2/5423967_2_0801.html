   <p>The president of the American Federation of Labor, William Green, appearing at a union meeting in New York, declared that the organized labor of America will carry on the fight for the continuation of the N.R.A. According to Green, American workers will not hesitate to call a general strike if Congress and the Supreme Court decide to abolish N.R.A.</p>
   <p>It is well known that President Roosevelt also favors the continuation of the N.R.A. In his opinion the law on national rehabilitation should remain in force for another year, while a majority of the senators wish to continue this law for only nine months.</p>
   <p>As a general rule, it is the industrialists who are insisting upon the abolition of N.R.A. They claim that N.R.A. has not brought about any <span class="page-break">\2</span>improvement in the economic situation of the country and has simply slowed down the normal course of industrial life.</p>
   <p>The government and labor organizations do not agree. Neither the government nor the leaders of organized workers claim that N.R.A. has produced any great results, but, in their opinion, it has made some improvement in the general situation.</p>
   <p>The American Federation of Labor defends the law largely on the ground that it establishes a minimum wage scale, permits workers to organize and defend their interests, forbids child labor, and reduces the working hours. If this law is voided workers will find themselves under the old intolerable conditions. In such a case, the industrialists will be free to establish their own order; to fix the working hours, determine the wages, reintroduce child labor, and once more establish sweat-shop conditions in certain industries. Such conditions of course, are very advantageous to the opponents <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the law, and, therefore, they claim that N.R.A. does not improve the business conditions and only retards the industrial development.</p>
   <p>For the workers the abolition of this law will be most detrimental. They will not gain anything by its repeal; on the contrary, workers will lose those rights and privileges which they enjoy now.</p>
   <p>Whatever the industrialists may say about N.R.A. as a law which did not reduce unemployment, their objections are not based on facts. During the existence of N.R.A. the number of unemployed has been greatly reduced and this process is still continuing. Thus, for instance, prior to the approach of the crisis, the number of unemployed during April usually increased, and yet during last April, according to the data made public by the department of commerce, the number of unemployed had decreased. During the current month the number of people employed has already increased by 120,000. In comparison with the corresponding month of last year, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>number of employed workers increased by 5.1 per cent.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why American organized labor fights to preserve the N.R.A. for at least another year.</p>
