   <p>(Note: - A "bandura" is an ancient Ukrainian stringed instrument that was used until recently by the Ukrainian and Galician peasants. D. S.)</p>
   <p>Previously in the Russian colony, when entertainments were given, the string band Lira (Lira means "lyre") was the only one that participated on such occasions. It had no competitors.</p>
   <p>This band enjoyed a good reputation which was well deserved.</p>
   <p>The demand for popular Russian music is so great that the need was felt of having another similar band.</p>
   <p>Lately on many occasions there has appeared at Russian entertainments the workmen's mandolin orchestra Bandura. This band consists of twenty-three persons. Mr. Gheerghy Tatarov is the conductor. He is training the band for several appearances at Russian evening entertainments.</p>
