   <p>Madame Lazareff, the head of the Lazareff Theater Group, located at 818 West Gilpin Place, related her experiences and hardships in conducting the above mentioned school. Madame Lazareff and her husband, now dead, organized their first dramatic (Maxim Gorky) school in Moscow, in the year 1916. It was founded exclusively for gifted children of Russian peasants and two years later in 1918, when Gorki came to Moscow to visit this school, he was pleasantly astonished at the remarkable progress which Mr. and Mrs. Lazareff had made. Both Madame and Mr. Lazareff were connected for years with the Moscow Art Theatre. In 1924 they opened the Reingard show in New York with Mr. Lazareff in the title role of the play "Mad Emperor." In 1926 they came to Chicago and developed the Chicago Art Theater into a company traveling through the Middle West and to the Pacific Coast. With the death of Mr. Lazareff in 1929 Madame Lazareff continued with the work which lasted till 1933; Madame Lazareff, being unable to fight her way further, accepted the invitation of the late Miss Jane Addams to come to Hull House. This Madame Lazareff did, opening its present school under the name of the Lazareff Theater Group. This school is a dramatic school. Here are taught all the arts as practiced by the Moscow Art Theater. Many of the present professors and teachers of dramatic art in the Middle West and all through the Pacific Coast and Canada were at one time or another pupils of this school of art.</p>
