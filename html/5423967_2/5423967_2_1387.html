   <p>All the national groups in the city of Chicago--German, Polish, French, English, Swedish, Belgian, Norwegian, Lithuanian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, Hindu, and even Armenian, of whom there are only a handfull in Chicago, not more than three thousand--have been preparing for the past three or four years, to participate in the great Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. They elected special exposition committees. These committees have been gathering funds for the erection of their own pavilions. All the societies and organizations of the various national groups have been collecting funds, assembling different samples of the art of their countries, preparing costumes, training their choirs and orchestras, in short, they have been doing everything they can to make their participation in the Exposition a success. For the time being, they have forgotten their social and political differences and have concentrated all their efforts upon one thing--the appeasement of their national pride by displaying, at the Exposition, the different cultural and technical achievements of their native lands, in the best possible light.</p>

   <p>On May 27, of this year, the door of this historic world exposition will be thrown open, and thousands upon thousands of people will rush in to see the latest cultural and technical achievements of the human mind. The visitors, while they delight in this magnificent panorama of wonders, will search for their own national exhibits--where they can see the accomplishments, in various fields, of their native land, and where they can hear their native melodies, as well as folk songs sung by their native choirs.</p>
   <p>Members of each national group will joyfully gather near their own national corner at the exposition, around their own pavilion, where they can admire the various exhibits of their own native land.</p>
   <p>All the nations [of the world] will be represented at the Century of Progress Exposition, except one, Russia. Russia, one of the great nations of the world, the country which is our native land, will not, I regret to say, be represented. It is painful and disgraceful to admit that we Russians, the sons of a nation with a great culture, have fallen so low as to allow our place at this great <span class="page-break">\3</span>exposition to remain vacant. We Russians, especially those of us who live in Chicago, should be ashamed of the fact that we carelessly neglected to pay the debt we owe our country. History will not forgive our disgraceful behavior.</p>
   <p>There are many representatives of Russian art in Chicago, but where are they? They did not take the trouble to get together at the proper time and organize efficiently, as the other national groups did, so that they could participate in the exposition. Only now, a few days before the opening of the exposition, have they asked our organizations, churches, and clubs: "What kind of an exhibit are we Russians going to have at the exposition?" And, after being told that we are not going to be represented at the exposition, they wring their hands, and ask: "How come?" Now they are angry with us for not having prepared anyting for the exposition.</p>
   <p>I am reminded of [the statement of] our noted writer Nekrasov, who wrote: "Why do you sleep, my little peasant? Look, the spring is in the field, and your neighbors have been long at work." That is exactly what has happened to us <span class="page-break">\4</span>Russians in Chicago. We have been sleeping while other national groups have been at work, preparing to participate in the exposition. By our carelessness we have committed a crime against our country because we have not presented to the world the proof of our achievements and accomplishments.</p>
   <p>According to our Russian (sic) proverb which says, "Better late than never," we should start something even at this late date. It is true that it is rather late, but we have certain things almost ready. For instance, here in Chicago we have five Russian choirs. All that would be needed would be to have the directors get together, work out a plan, and immediately start rehearsals. Musicians and dancers could follow this example. In any case, it is still possible for us to join other national groups at the exposition. And in this connection there is only one thing to be desired: that each of us should force himself to work, and to forget his personal ego, for the sake of this great all-Russian undertaking.</p>
   <p>Here is my personal advice and appeal to my countrymen who represent Russian <span class="page-break">\5</span>Art: Lay aside your personal selfishness, your political and other differences, and in the name of the debt you owe to your country, unite; prepare yourselves and participate in the Century of Progress Exposition. In this way we will be able, even if in a small measure, to fill the place assigned to us among the other national groups in Chicago, and thus pay our sacred debt to our country.</p>
   <p>But since every activity of this kind must have financial backing, I suggest that this magnificent undertaking should receive financial aid from our well-to-do Russians who live in Chicago, as well as other cities.</p>
   <p>It is too late simply to think--now we must act.</p>
