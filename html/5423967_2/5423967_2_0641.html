   <p>The League of Nations recently published statistical data pertaining to armaments in various countries. From these data it can be seen that expenditures for armaments in all countries are growing from year to year. Thus, for instance, according to the information gathered by the League of Nations, during the year 1925 all countries of the world spent three and a half billion dollars; during the year 1933, 4 billion 400 million dollars; and in 1934, 4 billion 900 million dollars. Thus, from year to year, the expenditures for armaments have been increasing at the rate of half a billion dollars a year.</p>
   <p>During this year these expenditures will increase still further. This is seen from the rivalry in armaments on land, sea, and air which has just begun between the principal countries of the world.</p>
   <p>It may seem strange, but the first place in armament expenditures is occupied by the "peace-loving" U. S. S. R. This country alone, during the current year, according to official data, will spend six and a half billion rubles, and, actually, the expenditures for this purpose in all probability will amount to a great deal more.</p>
   <p>The United States, during the coming fiscal year, intends to spend 808 million dollars. The American program of rearmament anticipates construction of twenty-four naval vessels and over a thousand military airplanes. In comparison with the current year, American expenditures for armament during the next year will increase by almost 376 million dollars.</p>
   <p>During the next year, first place in expenditures for rearmaments will be taken by the principal sea powers of the world. The keen rivalry in armaments on the sea was made inevitable by the Anglo-German naval agreement, and by the fact that the world tonnage of naval vessels at present is smaller than that of the prewar days. In 1913, on the eve of the World War, this tonnage exceeded 6,900,000 tons, whereas last year it was estimated at only 5,830,000 tons.</p>
   <p>[Sir Samuel] British Hoare, Minister of Foreign Affairs, characterizes the Anglo-German agreement in the following manner:</p>
   <p>"Future forces of the German fleet in relation to the British fleet will constitute a ratio of 35 to 100. The English government considers that the agreement recently reached is a permanent and final measure which in the future will facilitate limitation of the armament race in general among all great sea powers.</p>
   <p>The ratio of 35 per cent covers all tonnage of the German fleet excepting the submarines, for which the agreement provides no limitations. But the German government undertakes that its submarine fleet should at no time exceed 45 per cent of the British undersea tonnage. In case circumstances should compel Germany to increase the tonnage, as provided in the agreement, she undertakes to advise the British government in advance of taking this step, and to enter into deliberations on this point with His Majesty's government.</p>
   <p>France is very much dissatisfied with this agreement. The French consider that Great Britain, by concluding her naval agreement with Germany, brings to life spirits with which later on it will be unable to deal. Therefore, as the Journal de Debats states, "in the face of the new mortal danger that our British friends could not prevent appearing, we must reserve for ourselves complete liberty of action, and must strive to see that our superiority in sea power over the German fleet will permit us at any time to mobilize our naval forces. The essential question is whether the British admiralty will find it necessary to increase its naval tonnage, which automatically would lead to an increase in the German fleet."</p>
   <p>All this indicates that beginning next year such races in armaments will start as have not been witnessed in the history of humanity.</p>
