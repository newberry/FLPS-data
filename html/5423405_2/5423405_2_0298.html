   <p>The fifth of May has passed. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> united Mexican Clubs, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Victory of Puebla. On May 5th, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> more like a full-fight than a patriotic celebration.</p>
   <p>The 6th of May participants were <span class="gap">[gap]</span> received, they were offered fish and actually given rabbit instead. This affair took place in the well known "Temple Hall," with the intention to commemorate our heroes. We feel sorry for such disappointment, the case is over and there is nothing we can do about it. Of course this will not be the last time that such incident may occur, the 16th of September is coming and our supposed patriots have grown hardened and unscruplous. Who cares? Our heroes cannot speak.</p>
