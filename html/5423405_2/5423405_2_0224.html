   <p>Mr. Jose R. Vega, leader of the Sociedad Mutualista Obreros Libres Mexicanos de South Chicago (Mutual Society of Free Mexican Workers), sends the following letter:</p>
   <p>"To the honorable Ladies of the Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago, Chicago Mexican Consul, and gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"Allow me these few words to refer to that memorable night of May 4, which has marked a forward step in our social amelioration. It is now evident that the effort of the Mexican Blue Cross represents the crystallization of its noble work in aiding the needy and creating a great cooperative spirit among the members of o r colony, a spirit which the proper leadership can bring out of the human heart as God, the Great Master, would have it. Its effort is symbolical of the spirit born on the fields of Texas, its sacrifices, symbolical of the suffering of our race.</p>

   <p>"These women have made themselves the idols of men. Each one of the member of this benevolent institution will encounter a supporting hand and heart, eager to help them glorify the dignity of the Mexican woman, thru their cultural and social work.</p>
   <p>"I wish to stress the fact that the women of this worthy organization, have the backing of the Mexican workers.</p>
   <p>"The efforts of this institution are endorsed by our Honorable Consul, who is grateful for the support given it by worthy men who, together with our colony as a whole, do homage to it."</p>
   <p>Jose R. Vega.</p>
