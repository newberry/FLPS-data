   <p>The social event carried out by the Sportive Club Monterrey in Duffy Hall, was very splendid. The following societies were represented:</p>
   <p>Mutual Society Benito Juarez of Indiana Harbor. The Spanish Union of Gary, Indiana, The Mutual Society Obreros Libres Mexicanos (Mexican Free Workers), the newspaper La Lucha, by Mr. Quintero, and La Sociedad Mutualista Fraternal Mexicana (The Mexican Fraternal Mutual Society) of South Deering by Mr. Negrete.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen Nieto, Quintero, Barbosa and Cuellar, were noted for the fine speeches. The Misses Hernandez were applauded for their artistic work.</p>
   <p>Some beautiful girls were generously lauded for their talents, but we are sorry that we are unable to give their names.</p>
   <p>It is a pity that some societies were not represented.</p>
