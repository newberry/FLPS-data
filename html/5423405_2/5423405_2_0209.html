   <p>The Latin-American Cultural Club will celebrate the third anniversary of its formation during the 9th and 10th of this month at the University of Chicago Settlement, 4630 Gross Avenue. On the 9th a brilliant ball will be given and on the 10th a grand theatrical function will take place in which the Cuadro Artistico, an auxiliary of the above mentioned Club, will take part.</p>
   <p>Judging by the efforts which have always characterized organizers of the social affairs of this popular group and taking into consideration the great enthusiasm which the youth of our colony has for festivals of this kind, it is hoped that both functions might offer the eager public a chance to amuse itself.</p>
   <p>May we extend our most cordial felicitatious to the Cultural Club for the splendid social events which have increased markedly during the last three years.</p>
