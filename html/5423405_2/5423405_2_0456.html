   <p>Invitations and programs for a beautiful ball which Mr. J. Terrones, has actively organized, have begun to be extended to the select element of our colony. The affair is to be given in celebration of the highly important Saturday of Glory on March 26th.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that an old custom, which although now prevails in some Spanish speaking countries, will be preformed for the first time in our colony. The custom in question is the burning of Judas, (a Lenten Street demonstration.) It is not known to what extent the celebration will be carried out. We only know that it will be a surprise.</p>
   <p>The dance will be made lively by the very popular Red Devil Orchestra, which will feature "Martinez" of the Gary orchestra.</p>
   <p>The affair will be given in one of the halls of the well known Amalgamated Building. (On the corner of Ashland and Van Buren.)</p>
