   <p>The Spanish society is organizing a play entitled a "Night in Sevilla" to be staged next Saturday March 3, at the Palmer House. This musical and literary event will be followed by a dance in which the orchestra of Don Pablo shall stimulate the audience with sensational tangos and rhumbas. As we understand the program has been prepared by the Commission, although, it has not been known in its entirity, we can judge it by the propaganda already on circulation, it is going to be a great surprise for the crowd.</p>
   <p>The admission is the same as usual and of course, the commission shall keep a secret of the many surprises which will be an extraordinary attraction for the public that patronizes the monthly festivals of the Spanish Society.</p>
