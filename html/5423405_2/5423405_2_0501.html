   <p>Two agents of the United States Department of Immigration, entered the residence of Mr. Ignacio Romero Jr., Thursday, August 11th, in the morning without any warrant. The agents without first determining whether or not Mr. Romero was legally in this country, began upsetting the whole house. When as a matter of fact Mr. Romero is a naturalized citizen and has complied with all the rules and regulations of the Immigration Department.</p>
   <p>Mr. Romero, was summoned to the office of the Immigration Department for a thorough examination which lasted for one half hour and then released without there being any further question as to his naturalization. The rough treatment to which the Romero family was subjected is to be condemned.</p>
   <p>The Romero family lives in a luxurious North Side apartment.</p>
