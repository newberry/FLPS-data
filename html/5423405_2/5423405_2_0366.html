   <p>The concert given by the Mexican Band of Chicago at Pilsen Park was one of the greatest musical triumps in the history of the Mexican Colony. The program was a selected one and was concluded with a splendid "Ball."</p>
   <p>At a very early hour families began to arrive. At eight o'clock the Park was packed and enthusiasm prevailed everywhere. The "Ball" was enjoyed by the participants. The artistic numbers of the Morales group were executed admirably. The public applauded very heartily. Among those who attended, were: Mrs. Eva G. de Rocha, Secretary of Alianza Hispano Americana, Lodge 170, of this city; Mr. Ignacio Valle, owner of El Arte Mexicano, and many other highly esteemed persons, such as Mr. Reyes Mata and family; Mr. Enrique Rosas a well known sportsman and his wife; Mr. Araiza an ex-secretary of the Alianza Hispano-Americana; many women members of the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana; also members of the Club Cuauhtemoc; Mr. Salines and family, etc., etc.</p>
