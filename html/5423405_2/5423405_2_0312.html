   <p>The program prepared for the celebration on this occasion is extraordinary. Participants in this program, in addition to the Morales musical band, will be the celebrated "Los Mayas" Orchestra which will play the overture and the Orchestra of Paul Merceles. The official address will be given by our highly esteemed friend Dr. S. G. Meixueiro, who with his power of expression will give us a picture of the greatness and the heroism of those who gave us our land and liberty. A hymn will be sung in honor of those martyrs who fell wounded while fulfilling a sacred duty.</p>
   <p>Magnificient programs and colored posters have been printed for this most worthy affair. In spite of the critical situation which confronts us a great success is anticipated, is as much as the inborn patriotism of all the Mexicans is a sufficient reason for each one of them to accept any sacrifice in order to honor the Fatherland.</p>

   <p>It is unquestionable that the success of this festival is assured if we take into consideration the purpose for which it is given.</p>
