   <p>In view of the fact that in the Summer season, the heat is almost intolerable, many of the Mexican Societies are organizing picnics instead of dances. For next Sunday, the young women's orchestra, "Las Musas Latinas," will give a picnic at the Park called "Dam" No. 2. The people will meet at 4629 Gross Avenue and at 1250 South Peoria Street before leaving.</p>
   <p>The Sociedad Espanola de Chicago is also making all the necessary arrangements for a picnic which will take place Sunday 23rd, and undoubtedly it will be as successful as those organized in the past by this progressive society.</p>
