   <p>To-night at 8 P.M. La Sociedad Espanola will give a ball, in honor of the ladies who are at the head of the society's recreation committee and who have merited this tribute because of their enthusiastic and constructive work.</p>
   <p>The dance will take place in the beautiful hall of Mirrors on the fourth floor of the Capitol Building. We hope that the dance will be well attended.</p>
   <p>The well known Los Valencians will furnish the music. Their entertaining ability is already known to our public.</p>
   <p>The price of admission, according to custom, is the same for the ladies as for the gentlemen. Children will be admitted free.</p>
