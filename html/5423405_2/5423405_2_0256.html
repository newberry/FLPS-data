   <p>The Sociedad Femenil Mexicana sent us the following communication for publication.</p>
   <p>TO THE COLONY</p>
   <p>This organization wishes to give notice that beginning to-day its offices will be located at 1122 South Halsted, second floor. At the same time we give notice to our followers that we should like them to visit us there at our next meeting which will be held on the twenty second of this month. This meeting will be for the purpose of planning the functions which this Society usually gives.</p>
   <p>In the near future it will announce the date on which it will celebrate its second anniversary. At this time it will make public the work which the active members of this group have accomplished the last year.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Our effort has been not only to honor and to pay homage to the Sociedad Femenil, but also to the Mexican Colony which will, without a doubt, feel proud of having given its support to this group at various times.</p>
   <p>You might arrange to secure some articles of art from which you will be able to make beautiful Christmas gifts.</p>
   <p>Do not forget that they will be put on sale after the soiree.</p>
   <p>Education and Mutualism</p>
   <p>F. G. de Barron, Secretary.</p>
