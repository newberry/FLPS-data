For years its open-air markets, with wares displayed on the curbs of its narrow street, formed the hub of Jewish immigrant settlements. But the westward movement of nationalities sweeps over the erstwhile Jewish section, and now the Ghetto feels the sifting in of Mexicans and Negroes. Dark-skin ed customers are more numerous, and a few have even taken their posts behind wagons next to the gray-bearded old timers. As the customers go through the crowded street a shrewd salesman calls out as he blocks the passage, pretending to recognize an old customer. "You are the one I sold shoes before.

Should the hat be too small just a few pulls and twists over the heated form and the hat comes out the right size. The visitor extricates herself when a more affable customer arrives actually looking for a headgear. A large transparent orange hat is pulled down to shade the dark skin of the Mexican woman's smile and the visitor hears on leaving, "That surely is a becoming color for you."</p>
