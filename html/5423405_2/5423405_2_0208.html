   <p>Last Saturday the members of the Mexican Aerial Club celebrated with a welcoming feast the return of Rafael Diaz, a leading member of the Club.</p>
   <p>The affair which took place in the elegant home of Mr. J. Terrones, was an outstanding function, having continued until six o'clock next morning.</p>
   <p>Allow us to mention here that the proposed flight of the aviators of the Mexican Aerial Club to the state of Arizona was postponed temporarily, due to the fact that Mr. Herrera actually formed a Aerial Club in Kansas City, Missouri, which is a subsidiary of the Mexican Aerial Club of Chicago.</p>
