   <p>The Patriotic celebration of September is getting near, as we understand a committee has been formed with one representative from each society, Our congratulation to the Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla who in past occasions has shown sufficient initiative and capacity for these kind of enterprises. We wish to recommend equanimity unification, firmness and perseverance, so that the patriotic celebration of September be a splendid presentation. We propose the following: 1. To rent an adequate hall, large and elegant where many thousands of our countrymen can assemble. 2. That this hall have a good scenery in order to be easily decorated and modestly deserving of the glory and honor that we are to render to our heroes on that day. 3. That the admission be not more than 25c. 4. That the civic ceremony be completely separated from the artistic, for we must understand that the object of this celebration is not merely to go and see the dancers, but to honor the memory our father Hidalgo, and the other patriots who gave their lives for the liberty of our people.</p>
