   <p>Under the initiative of the Society Miguel Hidalgo Y Costilla various persons met to discuss the formation of a Mexican Confederation of societies. The meeting was held the evening of July 15, 1936, at which time and place a provisional council was elected and authorized to call upon the various societies to participate in such a work. On July 23rd, the second meeting was held with the representation of nine societies, of which three were not authorized by their respective groups to accept the undertaking. The board of directors was elected from the delegates representing six organizations.</p>
   <p>The officers are as follows: Jose Valdez - Chairman, J.V. Herrera -Vice-Chairman, Louis Acosta - Secretary, Francisco Cabrera - Sub-secretary, Epigmenio Prado - Treasurer, Mrs. B. de Blanquete - Sub-treasurer. We hope that the other existing groups may follow our example in order to arrive at the complete unity of the Mexican groups and thereby become the representative nucleus of the Mexican Colony in Chicago. Let us unite and respect each other.</p>
