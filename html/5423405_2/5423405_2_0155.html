   <p>Tomorrow, Sunday, La Sociedad Espanola de Chicago, will celebrate its first picnic of the Summer season in the well known Natoma Park, located at Milwaukee and Devon Avenues.</p>
   <p>There will be different kinds of games and various races; we believe also that prizes will be awarded to the winners.</p>
   <p>The dance music will be provided by the well known orchestra, "Los Mayas." The Spanish-Mexican music as well as the Cuban music, which the orchestra will play will no doubt be appreciated by the public.</p>
   <p>The admission prices are fifty cents for gentlemen and twenty-five cents for ladies. Children free. The dance hall and the refresment room afford shelter in case of rain.</p>
