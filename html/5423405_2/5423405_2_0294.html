   <p>The persons who comprise this club are preparing festivities, in order to celebrate the 5th of May, because this is a date of glorious remembrances in Mexican history.</p>
   <p>It commemorates the day that the Mexican people fought for their liberty.</p>
   <p>We congratulate this group heartily for its good intentions in honoring our old country.</p>
