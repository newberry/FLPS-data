   <p>The only way our colony can be strong, respected and well represented is that we make it worthy and respected by respecting it ourselves. Within ourselves lies the secret, if we want to do it. We must unite ourselves and listen to the experiences of the old people, those who have learned how to live and may be able to guide us. We should not pay much attention to their beliefs if we are to realize that no one in this world is perfect. In order to make our colony strong and properly represented, we must protect each other. To patronize the stores of our people since their products are as good or better than those sold by others. We must buy our groceries and other articles of first class necessity from our countrymen, even in cases when they are employed by foreign enterprises we must cooperate with them because they receive a salary for services rendered to our people.</p>
   
   <p>In the different establishments of the colony we have tailors, barbers, printers, photographers, musicians, shoemakers, carpenters and every kind of artisans, as well as many door to door salesmen who earn their living as agents. By protecting our people the colony will prosper, our people will have better representation simply because, Money Rules the World.</p>
   <p>When our business men should become prosperous, money will circulate with more abundance and our people can have more representation morally and commercially. With whom can we have better understanding if not with our people? Besides the language, our business men knows what we want and what we prefer. The more we protect our commerce and salesmen a better country we shall build.</p>
