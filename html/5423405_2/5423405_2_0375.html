   <p>It is not prohibited to anyone to devote a moments time to amusements during the holidays, if it is done with discretion. It would be wrong to dedicate too many hours to festivities and pass times. On these days, close attention must be attached to our efforts to avoid sin, which in itself is worse than to be servile. We must therefore escape the tempting occasions often occurring in saloons, dances, love affairs, gambling places and other exhibtions. The holidays have not been instituted merely for gayety but rather for sanctity. We must observe them as demanded by God.</p>
