   <p>Those Mexicans whom we now find scattered all over the land of Uncle Sam, and who work honestly to gain their daily bread,-those Mexicans who by the struggle of their hands and the sweat of their brow <span class="gap">[gap]</span>each day the bare necessities for their families in factories, shops, and on railroad tracks,-are not outlaws or wandering loafers. They are honest and conscientious workers with the right and privilege to go to and from their mother country any time that they might desire to do so. The free medical care which the industrial exploiters have set up, and behind which they mask as humanitarians, is absolutely unnecesary, is entirely superfluous, and borders on a disgrace.</p>
   <p>No one need tell you that so and so can induce you to return to your beloved country. Repatriation exists only for those who have offended Mexico, perhaps for those same exploiters who endeavor to repatriate us.</p>
   <p>These gentlemen should learn that repatriation is for the outcasts and that the honest workers who live in this country are not exiles or outcasts, neither do we have unsettled accounts with the government which might have put us in a position where we should have to solicit clemency.</p>
   <p>Those who need repatriation are the ones who, because of some reason, were driven out of Mexico. The good, honest Mexicans,-the ones who work peacefully, -are able to return to their home land whenever they may desire. It is not necessary for them to ask favors or be subjected to ill-founded "humanitarianism."</p>
   <p>The Mexicans, who day after day clinch in their hands the heavy hammer with which they drive spikes into cross-ties in order to earn a living for their children and wives, cannot and should not accept the most absurd propositions with which they are confronted. Down with the hypocrites and exploiters! Do not allow the abuse of our good faith! Denounce with words hypocrites and mannerisms. For prestige and good grace be cautious of all of them.</p>
   
   <p>There is plenty of room in the home land to which they may be repatriated! Down with bribers!</p>
   <p>Many of these gentlemen are completely ignorant of what the word repatriation signifies. The majority of our Mexicans are not exiles, nor are we shiftless wanderers. The word repatriation is used in this connection to indicate half-breeds of lamb appearance as a pretext for exploiting us one at a time.</p>
   <p>The Mexicans of Chicago, and in general all those who live in these hospitable lands of Uncle Sam, find no need of foreign mediation in order to return to their home lands. We should not get it into our heads that it is necessary to seek foreign aid in order to return to Mexico. Mexico is for Mexicans and it is known that our country has never expelled one of its sons without justifiable cause. The motto of all Mexicans who are living away from home is our honor and our ineffaceable love for our mother country and its institutions. For these sons who know how to honor Mexico, the country extends wide open arms. These gentlemen, humanitarians of hypocrisy, know that with the honorable Mexican there is no compromise. An emigrant is not an exile or an outcast, and he may return to his country whenever he might see fit, without it being necessary for him to negotiate with any one.</p>
