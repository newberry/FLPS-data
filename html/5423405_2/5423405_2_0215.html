   <p>Those who were fortunate enough to be invited to the picnic given last Sunday by the Chicago Spanish Society, passed an afternoon of pleasure. The number of families attending, constituted a record crowd and from beginning to end, there reigned a spirit of joyfulness over the picnic grounds. This outing, which was the last of two given by the above mentioned society, was the success which we all had hoped for. We extend our felicitations to those who promoted the affair.</p>
