   <p>Last Saturday, late in the afternoon, an impressive demonstration of protest arranged by the proletarians of Chicago, Milwaukee, Racine and near by cities, took place in Kenosha, Wis. The purpose of this mass meeting was to protest against the assassination of the proletarian leader, Julio Antonio Mella, which occurred in Mexico City, not very long ago, and for which the governor of Cuba and his Wall Street advisers have been held responsible.</p>
   <p>Early Saturday morning the promoters of the demonstration began distributing circulars among the citizens.</p>
   <p>The demonstrators, who were on foot, in automobiles and in trucks, displayed many banners and signs carrying words and phrases condemning Yankee Imperialism. They marched through various streets where the people shouted their approval all along the line of the parade.</p>
   <p>This demonstration had more effect and better luck than the last one, not having been interfered with by the local authorities.</p>
