   <p>A squadron of aeroplanes piloted by aviators from the Mexican army will be a feature in the May Fifth celebration. They will fly over Chicago Friday, May 5th between twelve and one o'clock, especially over the area where the Mexican Colony resides.</p>
   <p>For several months, Mexican aeroplanes have been on Chanute Field, at Rantoull, Illinois, an aeroplane base for the United States Army. These planes are piloted by Mexican aviators from our army and their names are: Francisco Xavier Gonzeles and Ricardo Castaneda Leon. They are commissioned by the Mexican Diplomatic Service, Department of War and Navy and are making radio communication studies under the supervision of the Mexican Embassy in Washington.</p>
   <p>By special request the lieutenant-pilots have agreed to fly over the City between 12 and 1 o'clock the afternoon of the fifth, thus taking a part in the festival.</p>

   <p>The planes will be identified, particularly for the benefit of our Colony, by large flags unfurled beneath their wings. Once the flight, which will last for an hour, is terminated the flyers will take part in the civil ceremonies which will be carried out on the night of May 5th, in the "McCormick Hall located at 2536 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Mexican Consul of this City, Don Carlos Palacios Roja, who has cooperated officially in the commemoration of the glorious battle of May 5th, in which the armies of our Motherland triumphed, will be the official speaker during the civil ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The Benevolent Society, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, is in charge of all the arrangements. It has made special arrangements with the principal and most outstanding artists of our Colony who will take part in the fine program which will take place after the civil ceremony. This program has already been fully advertised in our Colony and can also be found on display cards in the show windows of Mexican and other foreign commercial houses.</p>

   <p>At first our aviators were to fly in only one plane. But because of the plans of the high authorities at the Chanute Field, there will be three units which will fly over the City. As has been mentioned two of the units will be piloted by the Mexican flyers. The third plane will be flown by an aviator from the United States Army. Up to this time the name of this pilot has not been given to us.</p>
   <p>Great enthusiasm has been aroused among the Mexican residents of Chicago and Gary, in connection with the celebration of this great day. This is also true for those of other neighboring towns who will rejoice at the sight of the sacred flag of our Motherland flying above,this great day.</p>
