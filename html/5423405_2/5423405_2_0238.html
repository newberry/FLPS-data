   <p>Late, but not too late, the contents of an article maliciously published in a sheet that very fittingly is called El Humo, (The Smoke), has come to the attention of Lodge No. 170 of the A. H. A., Alianza Hispano-Americana. Reading the false statements contained therein, people not acquainted with Mr. Santiagosa or his work in favor of Mexico may think that these reports were prompted by jealousy or bad faith. The article is signed by Mexicans who do not know the injustice of their assertions. It is impossible to explain for instance, how his work could be considered anti-Mexican.</p>
   <p>Mr. Santiagosa, as a worthy ex-president of this Lodge is supported by thousands of Mexicans belonging to almost two hundred and fifty Lodges in Mexico and in the United States. Often he has given all the proceeds of his dramatic plays to Mexican societies and families. In his repertoire he has some plays by Mexican authors such as Manuel Mayo whose play was copyrighted by Mr. Santiagosa. He uses Mexican actors and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>has greatly contributed to the organization of patriotic celebrations. At the present time he is lending his cooperation to a Mexican exposition which will take place in the United States. We could mention many other points but our purpose is not to praise the gentleman, Mr. Santiagosa. We simply want to inform the Mexicans who do not know him that he is worthy of the esteem of all the Mexicans and that El Humo with its poisonous pen cannot tarnish his clean record. Although the sheet referred to criticized the artistic work of the Arte Musical, we do not wish to discuss this point now. We all know that persons who lack good taste are unable to appreciate goods of fine material. Our Lodge very much regrets that the Mexican Gazette of Detroit, Michigan, which ought to give an example of dignity should select such an able person for the topic of its column, "Fairy Tales." Large societies with branches all over the world have supported and honored Mr. Santiagosa. It is a pity that the defamation of an honest person should give pleasure to some people.</p>
