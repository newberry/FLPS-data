   <p>The Mexican champions of the National Basket Ball League of Mexico, who played various games in this city on January 27, 28 and 29th, were defeated in all three of them. The first game was played, on the 27th, against Loyola University, the score being 39 to 23 in Loyola's favor. The second game played was against the Y.M.C.A. of Oak Park, Illinois. The score was 52 to 26 in favor of the Y.M.C.A. But we must take into consideration the fact that the boys of Coach Ochoa have played since the year of 1927. On the night they played against Loyola, they were tired out, because on the previous night they had played in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and had arrived here at 3 o'clock in the morning. For this reason they were unable to attend the dance that the Club Atletico Cuauhtemoc, had organized in their honor, for the night of the 27th.</p>
