   <p>The young dancers who belong to the Spanish-American colony will be highly pleased to learn that the distinguished Sociedad Espanola has planned the "Dance of the Flowers."</p>
   <p>The mentioned ball will take place in the spacious and well ventilated dance hall on the fourth floor of the Capitol Building, 159 N. State Street.</p>
   <p>The program is to be highly interesting, featuring "Siboney" and the "Mama Ines" which will be performed by fashionably dressed dancers.</p>
   <p>The affair will begin at 8:30 P.M. and continue until the early hours of the next morning. There will be four and one half hours of enjoyable music, during which time free favors will be given to the dancers. The musical part of the program will be furnished by "The Valencian Serenaders," who are well known for their good music.</p>
   <p>The price of admission will be fifty cents for the gentlemen and twenty five cents for the ladies.</p>
   
   <p>If the past dances given by this Society are to be used to judge the one referred to, then it will be, without doubt, something very extraordinary.</p>
   <p>We congratualte the president, Mr. Jose Gonzales, and the members of his organization for another "success," and extend many thanks for the invitation which we received.</p>
