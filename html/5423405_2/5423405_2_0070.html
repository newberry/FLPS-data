   <p>In a special meeting held last Sunday in the Hall of La Alianza Fraternal Mexicana 808 West Roosevelt Road, a large number of its members and some prominent persons of the colony were present. They elected a committee to organize a Christmas festival for the benefit of the Mexican children. The above-mentioned committee has begun its activities, by preparing a Bunco Party, where prizes will be given to the winners. The Bunco Party will be the first of a series towards that noble aim, and will take place at 808 West Roosevelt Road. Admission is 10 cents.</p>
