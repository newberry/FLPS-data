   <p>Senator Harris, Democrat, and Senator Blane, Republican made a protest against what they call the flux of Mexican immigration to the United States. Senator Blane asked for prohibitionist forces to regulate the entry of Mexicans. Senator Reed said there will be opposition to Mr. Hoover's initiative which stipulates in his Immigration Bill that only 1,500 are to immigrate a year. At the present time from 3,000 to 6,000 are coming in every month.</p>
   <p>The recommendations from the land holders of Texas and California has been worthless, for the Senate is anxious to regulate the entry of the Mexican, because they say that the Mexican is taking the jobs of thousands of Americans.</p>
   <p>Should President Coolidge "veto" this Bill, it is feared Mr. Hoover and Mr. Curtis will make it part of their program.</p>
   
   <p>It is now affirmed that Congress does not authorize an Immigration "quota". The restriction on Mexican immigrants is not yet in effect and there are some possibilities that <span class="gap">[gap]</span>its doors open to all Mexicans wishing to come into this country.</p>
   <p>The Senate approved the Harris Bill yesterday, but this Bill has to be discussed in the House of Representatives and it is assured that it will not take place during this session. The bill will be postponed till after December, though, there are certain <span class="gap">[gap]</span>its complete approval.</p>
   <p>Political observers in the capital say that in case of its passage by Congress, the President is empowered to "veto" this Bill, this will not be difficult, since the State Department's criterium is well known.</p>
   
   <p>Secretary of State Kellog has declared that such restriction would tend to injure the relations which now exist with Mexico. In other circles it is said that the Mexican Government would be satisfied with this action since the Mexican Government is doing everything possible to minimize the immigration of the Mexican into the United States.</p>
