   <p>About 80 adults attend the classes. Also, we teach the following: Singing, music, sewing, drawing, handicraft, arithmetic, physics, sociology, popular science an flower making.I cannot say how many people attend each class, however the attendance varies, because the people work different shifts, most every member attends to some of the classes above mentioned. All of the 8,020 Mexicans are catholics, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> this Church, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> non-catholics do not interest us. We have a school for <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, five days a week <span class="gap">[gap]</span> about 140 attending <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. We have catholic charities. I can say that we benefit the City of Chicago by educating the people and making them good citizens; socially as well as morally, to be good workers and faithful to their jobs.</p>
