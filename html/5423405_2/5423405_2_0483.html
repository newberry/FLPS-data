   <p>The Methodist Youth League gave a dinner which in reality was a success. All those who were present had very enjoyable time. The affair took place at 1335 South Newberry Avenue and there were many Americans who also joined with our countrymen. My intention is not to propagandize this religious denomination but simply tell what I saw there. Of course I unconditionally approve the establishment of closer intimacy with the American people. In doing so much can be gained towards the good understanding between the two nations who in some instances due to the movies or to some other unfair propaganda has cause some disturbances in the good understanding of the two nations.</p>
