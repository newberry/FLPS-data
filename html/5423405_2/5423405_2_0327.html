   <p>"To The Mexican Colony of Chicago and Vicinity".</p>
   <p>The Ideal and Mexican Aerial Clubs of Chicago, moved by the spirit of patriotism have begun to organize the activities for the commemoration of the historic battle of the Fifth of May.</p>
   <p>With the approval of the Honorable Mexican Consul, the Clubs mentioned above extend a cordial invitation to all factions of our Colony, especially to the organized groups who should like to lend their moral  cooperation in celebrating the most important date in our history.</p>
