   <p>The great day is approaching, a day of entertainment and pleasure for those who wish to have a good time. This coming Saturday is the day on which the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana will give its soiree and a masquerade ball which it has so carefully arranged.</p>
   <p>The function will take place in the West Side Auditorium, a place well known to Chicago Mexicans who we are sure know its location. The anticipation of this occasion in our colony is great and the idea of having this masquerade ball is magnificent. It has been quite some time since we have been favored with this kind of entertainment.</p>
   <p>The preparations for the festival are of the most elaborate kind. The lighting and color scheme through the hall gives the place an oriental appearance. The pen of the writer cannot describe it.</p>

   <p>This festival which has been planned for the celebration of the Society's second anniversary promises to be the marvel of 1928. No other festival has been organized with such a care and enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The group of women who make up the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana de Chicago, deserves our admiration. Mrs. Barron and those who have helped her in securing funds with which to care for the poor Mexican children have made use of all imaginable means to make this function an outstanding success.</p>
   <p>Consequently the cooperation of the public in behalf of this worthy project is most essential.</p>
