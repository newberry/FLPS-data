Bishop Rober L Paddock is not a catholic. "Tell me with whom you associate and I shall tell you who you are". The fact he is with Father Sarasola clearly shows our readers what kind of a "little jewel" he is. "Tell me with whom you associate and I shall tell you who you are". To attend his lecture is entirely prohibited, and at the same time useless if an impartial and serene information is to be expected about Spain. Conscientiously no one should attend.</p>
