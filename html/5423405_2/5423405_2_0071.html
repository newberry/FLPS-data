   <p>The festival that was organized by the "Alianza Fraternal Mexicana" in honor of the Mexican Typical Orchestra of Maestro Mercado, that visited us last week, took place in the Cameo Hall of the Morrison Hotel, and turned out to be a successful gathering. We had the pleasure to see the best elements of the Mexican colony and the Latin American countries there and also a great number of Americans.</p>
