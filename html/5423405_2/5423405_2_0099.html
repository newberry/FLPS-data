   <p>Have you received your invitation? The Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Club is organizing a dance, and it is expected to be one of the best for two reasons: one is that our new elected officers will take possession of their offices, and the other is because of the good cooperation received by our membership in all of the dances effected during the year.</p>
   <p>This festival will take place the last day of the year. If you have not your invitation yet, please send for it to the offices of this newspaper, 1232 S. Wood St. You should do it today because we have very few left.</p>
