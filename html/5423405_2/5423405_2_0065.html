   <p>Our society was founded April 18, 1933, we have now 25 active members. We give financial aid in case of sickness, or accident, they receive six dollars a week for a period of six weeks. The fee paid by each member is twenty-five cents per week. We also try to help our members in cases of ill fortune. When any one who is not a member of our organization happens to be in need of help, we are willing to assist them in whatever is possible within the limits of our economic strength.</p>
   <p>We have social activities, such as dances about three times a year. Since our members work different shifts the time does not permit us to have many activities. We meet every Sunday at 7: P. M. at 10827 Besly Avenue. The officers are: Aureliano Guerra, Chairman; Catarino Moreno, Vice-Chairman; Refugio Moreno, Secretary; Octaviano Hernandez, Assistant Secretary; Pedro Cuellar, Treasurer; Graciano Carrillo, Auxiliary; Sabino Hernandez, Supervisor; Pedro Blanco, Health Commissioner.</p>
