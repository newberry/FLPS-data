   <p>No effort is so worthy of praise as that which one is able to put forth as a result of his training. To educate one's self, to learn something, to be useful in one way or another to our mother country and to our fellowmen should be the height of our aspirations.</p>
   <p>As an example of what our young people can do, let us look at the Mexican Aerial Club - an organization directed by a group of enthusiastic and ambitious young men. Not any thing nor any one has been able to suppress them in their efforts to do something tangible and beneficial. Young men of this calibre are the ones who succeed because they are promoters and because their efforts are not limited to a routine life like some who only dream of the future and because this profession is one of those which offer unusual opportunity to the student. There is an additional reason, in fact real reason, that is, the Mother Country, if they love it. These young Mexicans who are studying aviation in this country are doing it with a view of returning to the Mother Country qualified and ready to serve her in whatever manner they may be able.</p>

   <p>The growth of commercial aviation in Mexico has assumed such proportions that it requires the care of competent persons, with preference being given to pilots and mechanics, still this is not all. Mexico is destined to have one of the most powerful aerial fleets in Spanish America. She needs this because of her lines of communication and the growth of the country.</p>
   <p>The motto "Aviation for Mexico" which the Mexican Aerial Club of this city has is a living example of what causes the courageous young men of the Mother Country to devote themselves to the land of their birth, not with festivals, but with deeds, such as preparing themselves to serve her.</p>
