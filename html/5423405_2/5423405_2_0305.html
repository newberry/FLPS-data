   <p>The celebration of the second anniversary of SPANISH</p>
   <p>Republic by the SPANISH</p>
   <p>Society of Chicago last Saturday, in the Capitol Building was a great success.</p>
   <p>The very interesting program, was well performed. The main number was the speech of the guest of honor Sebastian de Romero, Consul of Spain. He was warmly applauded by all those present. The dance which took place at the end of the program was one of the best. But we wish to say that the recreation committee should have obtained a larger hall. The number of people who attended this celebration was too large for the hall.</p>
   <p>The recreation committee is preparing another affair for next month to be called "Flower's Dance" about which we shall inform you in our next issue.</p>
