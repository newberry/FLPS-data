   <p>We are informed by the Church of the Good-Shepherd that Rev. Guillermo B. O'Neil, has been appointed as superintendent of the Mexican Methodist Church. Many Mexicans are attending this Church which is located at 1851 W. 22nd Street. Most of the Mexicans of the congregation are employed by the International Harvester Company. We also understand that the place here mentioned is sufficiently large to celebrate religious and social reunions well. In accord with the desires of Rev. O'Neil we make this known to the Spanish speaking colony. Religious services are held on Sunday at 2:00 P.M. and anyone wishing to attend will be brotherly welcomed.</p>
