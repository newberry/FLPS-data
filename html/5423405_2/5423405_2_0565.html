   <p>The talk of the day, is the departure of two well-known men of our colony, who left to join the ranks of the ex-revolutionist General Escobar.</p>
   <p>It is evident that these gentlemen may choose whichever side they think to be the best. But in our opinion they have chosen the wrong side, as the movement headed by General Escobar is nothing but the product of treachery.</p>
   <p>We believe that every Mexican will side with the party advocating justice. In this case justice is on the side of the government presided over by President Portes Gil.</p>
   <p>We all should support him. Whatever the faults of the present administration may be we must defend it against the rebels. For this movement has been investigated by the greed of some generals. We all know moreover that no revolution can win without the support of the government of this country.</p>
