   <p>The image now presented on this issue to our readers represents "Christ the King". It has been ordered for the Mexican Church of Indiana, Harbor Ind. We ask our readers to send their contributions to Father Jose H. Lara. We remind our friends that this Mexican Catholic Church is under the leadership of a Mexican priest who wishes that we the Mexicans here give authentic proof of fidelity to Christ the King. Are we to deny our small contribution for the soleanization and benediction of the image of Christ our King? Dear reader, any donation will help.</p>
