   <p>No Christian has a right to be merely passive. Let no one say; I am Catholic but I do not care for the Catholic press, its books or pamphlet. The pathetic language used in their pastoral and the long encyclical of the Pope are impassable. Such is the language used by those who we called passive. The times we now live, demand active action.</p>
   <p>The enemies of the Church are not passive nor apathetic. They are well organized. They have cells of which each one consist of a nucleus whose members are firm and active. Their objective is to penetrate every where and spread their poisonous ideas. This is what Archbishop Hinley of West minster, London, said in his last Pastoral.</p>
