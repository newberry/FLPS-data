   <p>Many times the Church has been accused of getting mixed in politics and the accusation is very easily believed by simple-minded people and fools. The fact is very plain, and once more has come to demonstrate that the Church as such intends to orientate its members so they may be an aid in the application of doctrines in which they see the happiness of their country.</p>
   <p>There is a serious dilemma in regard to religion and politics that is taking great interest in the civic activities of its members, and if so it is running the risk of getting mixed in politics. And if it does not assume this position, its influence in favor of the affected majority would be lost.</p>
   
   <p>The Rev. Charles E. Coughlin entered actively in the last presidential campaign, and a great part of the Catholic people supported him in the exposition of the moral principles. Many Catholics were of the opinion that the best way to subdue him from such political aims was to attack him, for his political participation. We lament very much the attitude of the latter, because one deviation cannot be cured with another. The remedy in such case would be to proceed with serenity to the examination of principles, and at the same time the conduct of its exponent. What the Church officially did was to censure his deviations concerning the principles and freedom of Father Coughlin.</p>
