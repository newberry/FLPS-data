   <p>One feature of this function will be a dance which will start at 2:30 P.M. in the afternoon on the above mentioned date. In order to make this dance a success the popular and well known Valencion Serenaders, have been engaged. This orchestra is a group of musicians who have received great ovations ever since they made their first public appearance.</p>
   <p>The ball is dedicated to the friends and sympathizers of the Sociedad Espanola. All the members of the Sociedad are requested to do everything in their power to make the affair worthy of the Sociedad's good name.</p>
