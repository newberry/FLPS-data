   <p>This celebration was in commenoration of the victory of the Mexican Army on May 5th, 1862. It was a complete success in every sense of the word. The festival was organized by the permanent Patriotic Committee with the supervision of the Mexican Consulate. It was effected on May 2nd at Pilsen Park Hall, and was attended by a large number of people. The admission was 10 cents, but we do not know yet what the profits were although we believe it will be considerable.</p>
