   <p>The Mexican Social Center (Iglesia Methodista del Buen Pastor) which made it a practice to celebrate the September Feasts in former years, will again have a special affair September 18th, at 7:30 p.m. in the Halsted Institution Center, located at 1935 South Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>The program includes great artists so as to make it a great success. The Honorable Mexican Consul will deliver the official address. Miss Mercedes Figueroa will play a violin number. The Juventino Ramas Orchestra will play native pieces and there will be other musical and literary numbers of much artistic value.</p>
   <p>The Colony is invited to take part in this splendid function which will be headed by Reverend William B. O'Neill. There will be no admission charge.</p>
