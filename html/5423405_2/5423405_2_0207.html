   <p>After flying over several States of the Union, on the 23rd of this month, we will find the young aviator Mr. Luis G. Herrera, leading member of the Mexican Aviation Club of this city, with us again.</p>
   <p>He is to return from Kansas City, Missouri, where he finally organized a subsidiary of the Chicago Club in that city.</p>
   <p>He has our best wishes for a safe arrival.</p>
