   <p>I know that some of the readers who have honored me by reading my articles in the Press, lately have criticised me as being too radical concerning religious matters, at this time I shall try to banish that error. It lives within me a profound religious sentiment. But in my way, it is natural. Being educated by the maternal side in the most fervent religious practices and in the paternal side by great liberals of vanguard, such as the Diaz, Cobarrubias, Gabino Barreda, my father, etc. At the head of my bed I kept the picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe together with that of Benito Juarez.</p>
   <p>In the youth of men, the maternal influence is greater that the paternal. That is why I believed in such marked tendencies towards a mysticism that almost could be called a morbid mysticism for I did have something like extasis. I knew by heart the "rite of the mass" in Latin, and without understanding it.</p>
   
   <p>I had the supreme aspiration to become a saint. But as in my home, when the male were present, the great liberalism was also dominant, my father, my uncle and my god-father the Archbishop Labastida played a "trio game", my religious mystical tendencies were given proper compensation and followed the philosophical teachings of these men who by respecting the belief of others, made others respect their own.</p>
