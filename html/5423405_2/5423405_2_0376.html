   <p>The memory to the departed, the veneration to their graves and ashes, has been all through the ages of humanity a distinction, a profound practice of religious and philosopnic expression.Men who rendered homage to the dead, have practically affirmed, with such perseverance that no contrary effort has made them change. However, this eloquence reaches even to the most intimate feelings of the heart, and induce us to believe that we have a spirit which escapes the havoc of time and destruction of matter. There is another life we must expect and the sweet tides of terrestrial love are not completely destroyed. In the far beyond there is something which will unite us again with our dear ones, whom we remember with tears of love.</p>
   
   <p>The memory of the dead is much more dignifying and consoling when it is inspired by the teachings of Christ. How much meaning is added to their reminiscence when you place a cross upon their graves, which also represent our hopes and pains in the presence of He, who said: "I am the resurrection and life, and whosoever believes in Me, even in death he shall live".</p>
