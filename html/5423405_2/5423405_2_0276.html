   <p>With the formation of the "Patriotic Committee", it has been demonstrated what was said in many occasions: That in order to do something useful and have all the societies to participate without the appearance of discordant voices that there should be something materially important to all the groups involved and based upon mutual cooperation. To obtain such foundation and the goodwill it was imperative to secure the assistance of those who thought that actions could guided by good faith alone. This is what we would call a solid and constructive <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   
   <p>The argument brought to the front was the failures of the past. And to this, they called experiments in spite of the fact that some of these experts at no time participated <span class="gap">[gap]</span>of the fact that some of these for them know that <span class="gap">[gap]</span>impossibility of success of any coordinated social work. Even though they admitted the importance of such enterprises and its usefulness should it be possible to effect a practicable materialization. The beginning of their chorus said: "The Colony <span class="gap">[gap]</span> answer". Now it seems very clear that it was through <span class="gap">[gap]</span>that they <span class="gap">[gap]</span>the colony has given answer <span class="gap">[gap]</span>general interest. Unfortunately, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>the promises <span class="gap">[gap]</span>necessary funds have been appropriated.</p>
   
   <p>This <span class="gap">[gap]</span>exploited indefinitely. We are subject to evolution and we shall improve gradually in our social relations until we have reached a maximum degree in organizational development and be able to solve our problem mutually in a coordinated manner.</p>
