To obtain such foundation and the goodwill it was imperative to secure the assistance of those who thought that actions could guided by good faith alone.

   <p>This has happened so many times that faith has been completely lost. But let us show with faith that our promises will be fulfilled and then we shall notice the change. If we are in need of honest leaders and hard workers this is no sound reason to believe that we are destined to become a conglomeration of indifferent beingd ready to be exploited indefinitely. We are subject to evolution and we shall improve gradually in our social relations until we have reached a maximum degree in organizational development and be able to solve our problem mutually in a coordinated manner.</p>
