   <p>This organization has informed us, that next Saturday, the installation of new officers will take place. For that occasion they have prepared a sumptuous festival which will consist of dances, songs and a variety of numbers performed by children, all of them from the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana.</p>
   <p>A play entitled "Against Arrogance. Humility," will be enacted. Undoubtedly it is going to be well presented as the players have been practiced much. The program is long and at its conclusion there will be an interesting "Ball" which will last untill 1:00 o'clock in the morning.</p>
