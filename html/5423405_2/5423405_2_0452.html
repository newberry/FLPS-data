   <p>During all of the services, Reverend William B. O'Neill will be in charge of the special programs. Our friend Reverend O'Neill, who is the head of the Good Pastor Church, was instrumental in having the Mexican Bishop come to our city for these special Church services.</p>
   <p>The American and Mexican Methodist Churches, will entertain our noble prelate with an elaborate banquet which will be given in the Grand Ball Room of the Lawson Memorial Y.M.C.A., Chicago Avenue and Dearborn Streets, Saturday, June 4th at 6:30 P.M. Admission to the banquet will be one dollar per plate.</p>
   <p>Members of the United Mexican Artist Club, as well as others will take part in the magnificient program which will be given at the conclusion of the banquet.</p>
   <p>Considering the number of friends which Reverend O'Neill has and the keen interest which our methodist element has shown in Bishop Poscoe, the banquet should turn out to be one of the outstanding social events of this season.</p>
