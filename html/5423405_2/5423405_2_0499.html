   <p>The popular actor, A. B. Moreno, a competent and very worthy gentleman, is conducting with remarkable success the Pro-Arte Mexicano youth group which made its debut last Saturday at the West Side Auditorium. Moreno is one of the few actors who does not like publicity. In spite of his continued success his modesty appears to be the same, he is against much noise and few facts. His performance last Saturday adds another entry to his long career of successes.</p>
