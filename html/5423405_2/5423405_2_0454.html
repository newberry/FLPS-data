   <p>Last Saturday, April 30th, the Methodist Church gave a splendid dinner for some University Students and professors at the Mexican Social Center, which is located on the corner of Maxwell and Newberry Streets.</p>
   <p>Without fear of being wrong, we believe that this social event was, without any doubt, one of the best cultural events ever given by the Mexican Colony for the benefit of the American people.</p>
   <p>Reverend William B. O'Neill in cooperation with members of his church planned and carried out this function. It had all the characteristics of a native Latin-American festival. Almost two hundred persons were seated at the table and ate with much gusto, all the delicious native dishes which were carefully prepared. There was a frank and united comradeship among all present.</p>
   
   <p>Among those present from the Mexican Colony, was the journalist Mr. J. X. Mondragon. The program was splendid and was carried out in the following manner:</p>
   <p>The Morales Sisters sang beautifully and received a loud ovation; Mr. Vallanta was well received for his artistic dance numbers; Mr. Jose O. Velasco gave an address in Spanish and English, speaking upon the progress of Mexico; Mr. F. Ortega, Director of the United Artist group sang a solo which greatly pleased the audience and many other artists entertained the crowd with numbers of various kinds.</p>
   <p>Doctors J. Z. Cailles and F. D. Figueroa, attended the function as guests of honor. The festival ended at 10 P. M. The Methodist Church together with its Pastor are more than worthy of our cordial felicitations for the cultural efforts which they put forth in the interest of our people.</p>
