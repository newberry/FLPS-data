   <p>The Cordi-Mariano Catholic Center wishes to inform the persons who bought tickets for the diamond ring raffle that the reason why it hasn't been carried out is that the stubs have not been turned in by the persons who sold the tickets. We wish to ask these persons to turn them in as soon as possible. The date we have set aside to effect the raffle is Palm Sunday, March 21, of this year. However, we wish to make clear to the persons in charge of the tickets, to sell, if possible, whatever tickets they may have left. In order to carry out the raffle, the stubs of the tickets sold must be returned to the Cordi-Mariano Center immediately.</p>
