   <p>La Sociedad Femenil Mexicana (The Mexican Feminine Society) invites the Mexican colony to the dance which will be given tonight at Hull House, 800 So. Halsted Street. This affair is held in the interest of the colony's needy ones.</p>
   <p>In order to make the affair a success Los Diablos Rojos (The Red Devils) Orchestra has been engaged to furnish the music.</p>
   <p>Another feature of the affair will be the raffling of two beautiful pillows. Do not forget that Femenil has always lent its assistance to countrymen who, being far away from the motherland, are in need. There will be favors, confetti and flowers for those attending. Admission will be fifty cents for gentlemen. There will be no charge for the ladies.</p>
