   <p>The Recreational Mexican Club celebrated its third anniversary on February 8th with a brilliant program given at the Hull House. The hall was crowded with people who really enjoyed the astonishing conviviality which seldom have been seen in the past, and there were no disturbances registered like those taken place on festival previous effected in the Mexican colony. Everything was orderly. Credit must be given to all the members of this group, and may be taken as an example by other clubs who often organize festivals in the colony.</p>
