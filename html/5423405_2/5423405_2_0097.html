   <p>Extract: According to a Directory obtained by us after a considerable effort, it shows that there are only thirteen clubs and organizations organized by Mexicans in Chicago. How many members each one has is something we have not discovered yet, but our object is to analyze our activities. Let us imagine that each group constitutes 200 members on this basis; the amount would be 1,600, which is less than 20 per cent of the existing population, and none of these organizations can be the typical representative of the Mexican colony in Chicago.</p>
