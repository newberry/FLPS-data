   <p>The Necaxa Sport Club will give a dance party to-night in the beautiful dance hall of the Mc Cormick Auditorium, located at 2536 Blue Island Avenue. This dance is for the benefit of a very popular and well known young man of our Colony endearingly known as "Juanillo" whose real name is Juan Ramirez. He is a star of the Mecaxa Foot Ball Team and received a double fracture of the left leg in a game with the powerful "Roma" team.</p>
   <p>It is greatly desired that the Colony will respond to the call of the young men of the Necaxa Club and make the affair a big success.</p>
   <p>The Red Devil Orchestra, conducted by Frank Rodriguez, will furnish the music for the dance. Special songs featured by outstanding artists of the Colony will be an added attraction on the night of the affair.</p>
