   <p>We were officially notified that at the last meeting of the Board of Directors, of the Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago, it was agreed to ask the permission of the Mexican Consulate to officially celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Fifth of May.</p>
   <p>Once the consent of the authorites is obtained, The Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago can direct the various Mexican Societies of that locality to cooperate with similar groups and the whole community can proceed to make preparations for the holiday, which we hope will be a success.</p>
   <p>The distinct and worthy artists who have taken part and who have distinguished themselves in other social undertakings of the Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago, have already offered their cooperation. Likewise, we have been informed that the Cuadro Tipico "Nuestro Mexico" which, under the direction of our excellent soprano Mrs. Milla Dominguez, has been so well received in the past, will prepare new and various numbers for the festival of May Fifth.</p>

   <p>One of the things which the Blue Cross of Chicago proposes, is that the celebrabration of the Fifth of May in South Chicago will feature this year, a Velada Literario- Musical of a Patriotic character. The dance, as we have been informed, will be eliminated entirely from the program, and admission will be free. The purpose of this is to suppress mercantilism which has characterized the festivals given up to this day.</p>
   <p>Although it has not been decided where the festival will take place, it will be without a doubt, the most outstanding of festivals given by our countrymen, in Chicago</p>
