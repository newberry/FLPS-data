The spacious hall in Pilsen Park, with its wide windows providing plenty of ventilation is one of the halls most favored by our colony.</p>
   
   <p>In the Bar Room eats and refreshments will be served. During the dance, a shower of confetti will take place which will add brilliance and splendor to the festival.</p>
