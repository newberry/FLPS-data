   <p>The dance which was announced recently was presented with great ceremony last Saturday. The Mamerto Club gave this dance in celebration of its new location where all future activities will take place. The hall was beautifully decorated and the music was most pleasing. The dance extended into the late hours of the night, in the midst of an air of gaiety and great pleasure to those who formed part of a select group of very lovely ladies.</p>
