   <p>The Blue Cross of South Chicago will commemorate The 5th of May with a great evening entertainment at the Thorp School.</p>
   <p>The entertainment will take place next Tuesday, May 5th, at 8 o'clock P. M., in The Thorp School, 89th Street and Buffalo Avenue. This amusement will be an official celebration in South Chicago, since the Honorable Mexican Consul, Mr. Rafael Avelyra, will be present.</p>
   <p>It is for the first time, as we know, that is celebrated, in this form a Mexican national holiday, and this act is very interesting, because all Mexican societies in South Chicago are cooperating with the The Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago. The Mexican societies which cooperate with The Blue Cross, are as follows:</p>
   <p>"Sociedad de Obreros Libres," (Free Workers Society), "Club Deportivo Excelsior," (Sporting Club Excelsior), "Campo 'Emilio Carranza' de los Lenadores del Mundo", (World's Woodmen, field Emilio Carranza)and "Sociedad de los Caballeros de Guadalupe," (Knights Society of Guadalupe).</p>

   <p>The expenditures will be supported by these societies and every one of them will play a part in the program.</p>
   <p>The Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago will present on the stage "Nuestro Mexico", (Our Mexico) which is a great creation of our compatriot Mrs. Milla Dominguez, noted soprano.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dominguez creation is played by Mexican ladies and gentlemen and always had reached a great success. Now, this "Cuadro Plastico" has been embellished by the beautiful Misses Navarro's cooperation, and it is expected more brilliancy, than in the two preceding performances.</p>
   <p>The Mexican Blue Cross of South Chicago invites from this column all Mexican societies of this city.</p>
