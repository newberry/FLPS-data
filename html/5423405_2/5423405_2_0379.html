   <p>A sumptuous dance is being prepared for Easter Sunday, April 1st, under the auspices of our distinguished friend and a Chicago resident Tiburcio Gomez. The well liked orchestra "Los Mayas" will delight us as they know how, which of course anticipates a phenomenal success for that night.</p>
   <p>The place for this celebration will be the Emporium Hall, 1000 So. Halsted Street. The prices will be the most popular and undoubtedly this alone shall make the large attendance possible on that night. In our next issue of El Nacional we shall give a complete detail about this affair.</p>
