   <p>The respectable Masonic Lodge "Lux in Umbra", No. 50, that has worked very actively for over one year in South Chicago, wishes to inform all its members and Masons of Chicago that it will re-assume its work on the 15th of this month at its new Temple, 1010 South Halsted Street. Please attend our services every Friday, at 8:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>We wish to appeal to all the Mexican Masons who may not be active at the present time that they can now make out their application and send it to "Lux in Umbra", No. 50. Therefore, we are ready to receive you with the same featernal kindness that you deserve.</p>
