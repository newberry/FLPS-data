   <p>A few days ago our very cultured and outstanding friend, Mr. J. Terronen, who was member of the Mexican Colony of Chicago, took advantage of an offer which made it possible for his to join his family beyond The Bravo, after a prolonged stay in this city.</p>
   <p>Young Terronen, had won great renown and popularity here, having been a very competent promoter of different kinds of native festivals.</p>
   <p>Our best wishes go out to this good friend.</p>
