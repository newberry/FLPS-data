   <p>The Rev. Serapio Gonzalez, a Gallego and member of "Mercedaria Order" who is the director of the Mexican Church in Milwaukee, Wis., is here with us. His purpose is to participate in some spiritual exercise during Lent. El Ideal Mexicano wishes Father Gonzalez a permanent stay, and abundant blessings from the Lora in the course of such exercise.</p>
   <p>Father Gonzalez has explained to us the magnificent and generous response from his congregation when he exhorted them to the financial support of the Church. Since we believe of great importance the reasons he presented to his faithful supporters, and because we consider them applicable to the Catholics of each and every Church where they are taken care of spiritually, we reproduce his argument in part and it is hoped that our countrymen reconsider the facts with dignity and serenity, so as to adjust their conduct accordingly.</p>

   <p>With half of the money ill-spent by the Mexicans, which causes much misery and determinant to their families and themselves both corporeal and spiritually, we could have a church built of gold. Supposing that in every locality where 500 workers are employed at an average wage of $18.00 a week, or $36.00 every two weeks, the wages received in the two weeks by the 500 workers would amount to $18,000.00. We are very sure that at least $8,000.000.00 of these earning are being spent for drinking, gambling and on every other kind of vice that we can think of.Half of the $8,000.00 spent on vice in one year would total $104.000.00 and in ten years $1,040.000.00. But really there are many colonies where the population is not 500, but 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 and even more, whose earnings are not $3.00 a day but $4.00, $5.00 and more.</p>

   <p>The Mexicans in Milwaukee have fully realized this fact and that is why everyone is contributing with 2,3, and 5 percent of their wages for the support of their Church. This is how Father Gonzalez has been able to introduce many improvements on the Church and make it appear beautiful.</p>
