   <p>The Alianza Fraternal Mexicana tries to unite the Mexican societies of Chicago, and are set to work so that the lively forces of the colony may have more impulsion in the development of a social program. A reunion has taken place, the main object was a banquet, but no one suspected the outcome. Most of the guests spoke without making the least effort to find a particular topic. In the meantime a subject was brought foward, although it was an old one, whenever it is on discussion it provokes a heated debate. And it compromises those who tackle it especially if they are representatives of social groups, who are ready to undertake their part justly. Those present at the reunion were mostly members of the Alianza Fraternal Mexicana who in adapting the most appropriate method, as societies usually do, to meet periodically in a place where no formality is demanded with the purpose to intimate their friendship and prepare themselves for the social activities in harmony with the needs of their group.</p>

   <p>Those who have some experience in directing societies approve this sort of reunions because they have come to realize that in such a manner, they will get to know their members better when they express their feelings without the selection of terms for their speech as it occurs at the meeting hall. After finishing the fancy food, which was accompanied with beer, that is, when I happen to come into the place. Then the discourses began and turned out to be very compromising though apparently did not seem, but, automatically they were obliged to initiate the work pertaining to the confederation of the Mexican societies of Chicago, a task that these societies pursued without any results.</p>
   <p>The president of La Alianza Sr. Jesus Maldonade, in answering to the exhortation of this writer, he said that he would do all that was in his power to carry out the consumation of the work on unification which until this date, has been one of the major problems in our colony. Sr. Maldonado said, that he was sure to count upon the support of the members of La Alianza for such objective, and I believed he is right, if the other members who approved the presidents view spoke with sincerity.</p>

   <p>For my part, I sincerely wish that something good may come out and what was said Friday night at the banquet, be not merely an inspiration of the beer. No one can deny the urgent need for the Mexican colony to be justly represented. And if that representation cannot be obtained through the social groups, I can not see a more adequate form. Certainly this is difficult for we know that many of our social leaders do nothing gratis and others accept nothing except a place in office to dominate others.</p>
   <p>We must begin by doing something let us commence by cutting the bad weeds out and give everybody the proper place. The opportunity to do anything in favor of this cause has been available to all the societies, now the field is open to the Alianza Fraternal Mexicana.</p>
