   <p>To-night the Mexican Colony of Chicago and South Chicago, will assemble for the celebration of the one hundred and twenty second anniversary of Mexico's Independence. The affair will take place in Pilsen Park, a place where many other national festivals have taken place. The great hall has been decorated with flowers and with the national colors of both Mexico and the United States.</p>
   <p>The program which will begin at 8:00 p.m. is made up of numbers which will give those attending, the finest type of amusement. After the overturs by the "Los Mayas" orchestra Dr. S. G. Meixueiro will give a patriotic and forceful lecture which will recall to us the significance of the movement initiated by Don Meguel Hidalgony Costilla, on that historic night when he sounded the rally for Independence. The well known doctor always cooperative and pleasing, made no objection to delivering the official address, as he has done in former years.</p>

   <p>The patriotism of the Mexicon Colony will also be manifested to-night. The well known and popular Morales sisters, who in cooperation with El Nacional arranged the festival, will feature the event with a saxophone quartet, aided by two other artists. The "Las Latinas" orchestra, which made its debut some time ago at the Auditorium Hotel, will furnish the music. Another feature of the program will be the celebrated international dance master, Paco Perafan, who will dance "Alme Andaluza." The audience will also be pleased with the number of the artist, Herlinda Rodriquez. Miss LaLa Morales will sing the beautiful number entitled "Borrachita." The quartet already mentioned will play various Mexican airs and there will be many other interesting attractions.</p>
   <p>The function will conclude with a public dance, admission will be fifty cents for gentlemen and twenty cents for ladies --- children will be admitted free. There will also be a wonderful service of Mexican dishes at the restaurant.</p>
   <p>In our last edition we erroneously announced that Jose O. Velasco would be Master of Ceremonies. Reverend William O'Neill will have this position. The affair will be a success.</p>
