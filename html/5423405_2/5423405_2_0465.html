   <p>On Sunday, September 21st, a musical - literary program will take place at the Theatre of Hull House at 8:00 o'clock. This is being organized by a group of men and women of our colony with the purpose of aiding San Marcos Church. The drama entitled: "Malditas Sean Las Mujeres" (Cursed Be The Women) will be presented by an amateur group of fellow countrymen. The main role will be played by Miss Julia Escamilla, whose picture can be seen in another part of this paper as those of Miss Esperanza Caballero and Mrs. Pola Villacana.</p>
   <p>The male leads are Cresencio Guevara, Enrique Lopez, Manuel Garcia, Jose Estrada and Jose Paz, Agapito Rodriguez will act as a scene director and Antonio Padilla, as observer.
