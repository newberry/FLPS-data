   <p>It gives us great pleasure in being the first to present to the Spanish-American colony the personnel of the Mexican Aerial Club of Chicago. This organization was first founded in 1929 and finally incorporated under the Laws of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The iron will which these young men have demonstrated on all occasions in maintaining the club and seeing that the organization continued to function in the face of its difficulties, has made these eagles of the future actually the object of much praise by those who are interested in the future of aviation in Mexico. The motto of this organization is Aviation for Mexico". This motto clearly demonstrates that the patriotism of our young men never dies in spite of the forced absence which some. for one reason or another, seem to suffer in a foreign country.</p>

   <p>The President of the Aerial Club, the aviator pilot, Captain B. J. Venegas is a courageous young man with unusual ability. Our particular friend, the aviator pilot, L. G. Herrera is a very affable and well educated young man. He is the Vice-President. Herrera was the first to suggest the idea of a Club fro Mexican students of aviation. This idea was pushed forward by Captain Venegas, sub-treasurer J. J. Martinez, and the pilot aviator A. Garcia. Since then until now all have been seen working unceasingly to realize the plan.</p>
