   <p>Last July 15, there was a meeting of the different societies in this city with the object of forming a Federation, sponsored by the Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Society. This Federation was formed July 23. The officers were elected as follows: Iose Valdez, president, club local #6; J. V. Heirera, vice-president, Miguel Heidalgo Society; Luis Acosta, secretary, Miguel Heidalgo Society; E. Prado, treasurer, club local #36. This Federation is composed of six clubs and societies. It would be of advantage if the other three would join the Federation.</p>
