   <p>We have in our possession a communication, given us by the Ideal and Mexican Aerial Clubs, which invites us to take part in the holiday commemorating the Battle of May Fifth. It is felt that all groups in Chicago will take part.</p>
   <p>We are grateful to the above mentioned Clubs for having extended this invitation to us and we are disposed to cooperate with them in every way possible.</p>
   <p>We take this opportunity to thank the said Clubs for their splendid courtesy.</p>
