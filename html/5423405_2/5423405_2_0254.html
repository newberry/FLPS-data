   <p>This group of noble an charitable women who know how to safe-guard the welfare of the Mexican children, sacrifice themselves with pleasure for everything that may benefit the children.

   <p>The Auditoriam hall and theatre has for some time been converted into a Mecca for the Mexicans who reside in Chicago and vicinity. December 13th is the second anniversary of the Socieded Femenil, and for this reason a superb program is being prepared, something extraordinary and worthwhile.</p>
   <p>The masquerade dance and awards that we announce for that date, are going to be something sensational and destined to be a prodigy of gayety. Another attraction is the exhibition of paintings at the termination of the dance. At this exhibition there will be an opportunity to obtain a precious piece of work at a very low price and with the assurance that the money paid for it, will be used for a very deserving and humanitarian cause: to aid the Mexican children. Mexico from its columns, calls its readers to cooperate in one from or another to the aggrandizement of this society who with so much ardor is working for the interest of the Mexican. With such groups as the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana, the colony is destined to progress.</p>
