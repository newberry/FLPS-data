   <p>They eeem to be backward, I guess that is due to the lack of education and development. They have altruist spirit, in what concerns to their groups. They lack experience in regards to the American life. Their standards are lower than the American's. They are sociable, but not very dependable except those who belong to the Church. They need political and social orientation. I would say that they are contributing as much as any other group to the general welfare of the community. Economically they are not making it. Need more leadership, resources, time and patience, and only through education, education, and more education they can be brought to the American social standard of life. They are willing to learn, although they are little slow in adapting themselves to the new American customs.</p>
