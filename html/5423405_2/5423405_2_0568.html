   <p>Gallito, the famous Mexican paintor, left this city today for Mexico City. We have been informed that he was called by the Mexican Secretary of War. Although we do not have sufficient information to make a positive statement, but we believe that the skillful caricaturist will take a commission with the Federal forces.</p>
   <p>In our next issue we will give a true picture of the situation as it was outlined to us by Gallito two days before he left.</p>
   <p>We wish him a safe journey.</p>
