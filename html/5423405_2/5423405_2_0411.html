   <p>To all those able to read the American papers we wish to most highly recommend Our Sunday Visitor a Catholic weekly, entirely dedicated to instruct, inform and direct Catholic people. Special attention is called to the fact that not long ago it was suggested in the pages of Our Sunday Visitor that a statue of Christ be erected in the capital city of Washington as a bulwark against Communism.</p>
   <p>The idea caught a quick response from every part of the country. A fund was begun with the spontaneous offerings of readers of Our Sunday Visitor anxious to give a start to a project so worthy and so long neglected.</p>

   <p>Judging by the nation-wide response to the plan, one is almost led to believe that the Saviour Himself has chosen this particular moment when Christianity is attack in so many countries and when Communism is crucifying him again in Spain, Russia, France and Mexico, to inspire the American people to carry out this noble undertaking. Briefly, the plan is to erect in Washington a statue of colossal size like the "Christ of the Andes" in South America, to be known as the light of the world.</p>
