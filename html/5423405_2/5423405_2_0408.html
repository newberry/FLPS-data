   <p>The festivity of Christ the King, must and should have a special significance this year. He has been dethroned as King in many nations, all his followers must rally around and show their loyalty in a more effective form, it can be done if every Catholic receives the Sacred communion on October 25th. This should be done so that our enemies may be defied all over the world and thus the course of events can be totally changed.</p>
