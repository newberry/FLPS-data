   <p>With the object to make known the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Proclamation of Christ the King a leaflet was reprinted by the Mexican Youth of Chicago. It seemed as an act of destiny that one of these leaflets came into my hands. The original was printed on Dec. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by the Mexican Liberty League for the rights of Man. It was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> under the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Proclamation of Christ the King in order to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> insult the Mexican Government. This is a very ridiculous thing <span class="gap">[gap]</span> tolerated. In view of this fact, I am going to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> myself to point out some of the mistakes contained in the above mentioned. I shall begin by asking <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Liga Libertad de los Derechos del Hombre, <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
