   <p>The Mexican Aero Club of Chicago, an educational institution founded by a group of studious natives, has had such success that they have actually extended their activities to the Mexican youth of Gary and Indiana Harbor. They have now formed another club, the leadership of which has been placed in the hands of the following: President, Capt. B. J. Venegas; Vice-president, Luis G. Herrera; Secretary, Jose Rivera; Sub-secretary, Rafael Perez; Treasurer, Rafael Diez; and officer Jose Martinez, all young men of pleasant manners and far advanced in aviation. As a matter of fact, a great number of young Mexicans are studying aviation in this city, with the intention of being some time of use to their mother country, and of taking the place occupied today by foreign aviators in Mexico. Capt. Venegas and Mr. Luis G. Herrera have done their utmost in the past to recruit a large number of young enthusiasts desiring to study aviation. Their efforts have been crowned with success, judging by this new club.</p>
