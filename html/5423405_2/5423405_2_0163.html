   <p>It is with pleasure that we submit herewith a letter which we have just received from the institution, Benevolent Society, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.</p>
   <p>To the Editor of El Nacional:</p>
   <p>Our very dear Sir;</p>
   <p>The undersigned are active members of the Benevolent Society, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, which has its office in the Henry Booth House, 702 West 14th Place, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>This Institution has formed an orphans' committee. The members of this committee are: Francisco Avilez, President; Louis A. Acosta, Secretary; and Jose B. Flores, Treasurer.</p>
   
   <p>We ask you for the cooperation of El Nacional, by publishing some of the work which we shall be carrying on hereafter.</p>
   <p>We ask this favor because we propose to notify all Mexicans throughout the American Union of the urgent need of providing homes for dependent children. We trust that our plan meets with your approval and that you will give it your fullest cooperation.</p>
   <p>Your attentive servants,</p>
   <p>Louis A. Acosta, Secretary,</p>
   <p>Francisco Avilez, President,</p>
   <p>Jose B. Flores, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>(From the Committee for Orphans)</p>
