   <p>Last Sunday April 16th, at 7:30 P.M. a splendid festival took place in the School Hall of San Francisco de Asis, located at Newberry and Roosevelt Road.</p>
   <p>The proceeds will be used for charitable purposes. The artists who took part in this affair received a frantic ovation, because of the good presentation of a "moralistic play".</p>
   <p>Those who interpreted the play were very natural and it was very clear that they had studied their part conscientiously. After this, a variation followed in which the couple"Juarez- Ortega", danced the "Chichicuilotes" (a tiny bird of Mexico.) The Rocha children danced Las Espuelas (the spurs). Mrs. Huesca Hernandez sang and many other interesting numbers were witnessed by those present.</p>
