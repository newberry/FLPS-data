   <p>The drama "La Santa Inquisicion" which was played last week by the Cuadro Floreal in the Spanish Castillo of the Spanish Union of Gary, was truly an outstanding success.</p>
   <p>All the actors played their parts with natural ability and masterfulness. The drama which has its plot made up around one of the fanatic criminal organizations, the Inguisition, unrolled scene after scene which impressed the public for its realism.</p>
   <p>The members of the Cuadro Floreal should feel proud for having brought to the stage a drama of this character in such an artistic manner.</p>
