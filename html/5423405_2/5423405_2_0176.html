   <p>Last Saturday, the well known, Sociedad Espanola, gave its first Autumn dance in the spacious Ball Room of the Capitol Building, 4th floor, 159 North State Street.</p>
   <p>The orchestra, "Valencian Serenaders," furnished the music for the dance. Among the musicians was our little friend Juanito Pineda.</p>
   <p>The program included, the well known Navarro sisters, the pretty Morales sisters, Conchita and Margot Islas, the tenor, Paco Tortolero and the dance team Jorge Quintas and Alicia Villalvazo. The dance music was under the direction of Pat Nagar and his famous Hollywood Orchestra.</p>
   <p>The celebration began at 9:00 P.M. and ended at 1:00 A. M. As usual the fair sex excelled in loveliness, while the opposite sex was equally well represented.</p>
   
   <p>The members of the Society were very pleased with the successful performance of their first Autumn Dance. The second Autumn Dance, will take place in the same hall, December the third.</p>
