   <p>The Mexican colony views with disgust the following facts: It is rumored that Mr. Rafael Aveleyra, Mexican Consul has invited "some prominent Mexican citizens", who form a distinguished group of dealers, professional, and directors of societies, to discuss at the Mexican Consulate, financial support for the celebration of Mexico's Independence anniversary. A Mexican fiesta will be given September 15th.</p>
   <p>Mr. Aveleyra published a letter last year in El Nacional (formerly Mexico), in which he said: "I will not give my support to nor will I recognize officially any festival held by a Mexican Club or Society, unless a dance open to the public is given as a grand finale. If I should attend a festival in which there is dancing, I shall do so without official representation.</p>
   <p>Obviously, Mr. Aveleyra intended to abolish the business made by some unscrupulous people who prosper by the patriotism of the Mexicans.</p>
   
   <p>But the idea is to hold the Mexican festival of September 15th, for all Mexican people, and with the support of Mexicans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Aveleyra forgot to invite all the Mexicans thru the newspapers, he invited instead a select group of them. Hadn't this been the case the Cooperation would have been more effective.</p>
   <p>Nobody knew that there was going to be an official festival and everybody made plans accordingly. The Mexican Colony in Chicago always has cooperated and I do not understand how on this occasion it has not been taken into consideration</p>
   <p>We are Mexicans, both the intellectual and the humble workers; therefore, we must sooperate with our presence and money on this great anniversary. I an talking in the name of the working class, and I protest against this discrimination.</p>
   
   <p>We can be strong thru mutual aid. In the present case our country's representative is working against our interests.</p>
   <p>It is true the Machiavellian's apothegm: "Divide and reign".</p>
