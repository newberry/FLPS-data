   <p>We sincerely invite Cardenas and all his government, the governors and Military chiefs, Senators and Congressmen, to the Minister of Education with all his agents and teachers of Socialist and Sexual education. We extend this invitation to Calles, Garrido and other assassins of Catholics, so that they might meditate in their solitude and exile the real meaning of the Act, and its signification to the Mexican.</p>
