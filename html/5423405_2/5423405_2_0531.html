   <p>In the same manner a president in power cannot be a good neighbor if he overlooks the most detestable crimes committed in neighboring Country.

We pledge our vote so that Mexico may have a sensible government and spiritual innovation in the country. We urge the American Catholics to cease the invention of capital in Mexico, through <span class="gap">[gap]</span>of tourism and commerce, until that country becomes as good a neighbor as the United States."</p>
