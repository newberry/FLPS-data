   <p>The second picnic organized by the well known Sociedad Espanola de Chicago, took place last Sunday at Brighton Park.</p>
   <p>It was very well attended especially by the young women, but it did not surpass the previous one.</p>
   <p>It had been expected that the outcome would be a greater success, in view of the efforts spent in its preparation. It was nevertheless a credit to the well known Society.</p>
   <p>The music was much complimented and each dance number highly appreciated by the dancers. The "Valeneian Serenaders," did not live up to their usual high standard. Everything was fine, deserving only praise.</p>
   
   <p>A delicious dish "Powder with Rice," was served. The seasoning of the dish referred to had a very delicious flavor, made by the well known Chef Mr. Barcena, who was very much pleased by the compliments he received.</p>
   <p>The next event that the Society has in view is the celebration of the"Independence Feast," of the colony. The Honorable Consuls of Spain, Cuba, Honduras, Argentina, Mexico, and Costa Rica will all be present at this celebration.</p>
