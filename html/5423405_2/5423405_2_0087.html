   <p>The Mutual Society Miguel Hidalgo Y Costilla wishes to extend from this column a cordial and frank invitation to every member of the colony to join our society. Our principal aspiration is to better the intellectual, moral, and economic condition of those, who for some reason or another are away from our country. In our society all will find a group of people always willing to impart their good will whether in hardships or in prosperity with those seeking comfort and happiness. Our meetings are held every Friday at 8:00 o'clock P.M. at Henry Booth House 701 W. 14th Place.</p>
