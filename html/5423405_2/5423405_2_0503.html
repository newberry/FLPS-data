   <p>We publish here a very important letter sent to us by the Mexican Consul, the tenth of this month, which we believe will be of great interest to the members of our Colony, desiring to return to their homeland.</p>
   <p>Editor of El Nacional,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>We hope that you will be able to publish in your paper the following so that it may reach the Mexican Colony.</p>
   <p>With pleasure I inform you that through the efforts of the Secretary of Foreign Relations, it is now possible for all Mexican families who find themselves in economical straits to return to Mexico at the cost of $15.00 by way of the Missiouri Pacific Railroad Lines.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We hope that you will take matter up as soon as possible because the Consulate wants to organize the first train for emigrants at the above mentioned rate.</p>
   <p>In regard to the journey to Laredo, and other places of destination, the Nacional Railroads of Mexico, have also arranged to charge only one cent a mile to any point beyond Laredo. With a small additional cost the passengers will thus reach their points of destination.</p>
   <p>Thanks you for publishing this information.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>(Sign) Rafael Aveleyra,</p>
   <p>Consul of Mexico.</p>
