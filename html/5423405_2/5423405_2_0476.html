   <p>On Friday night of last week a magnificent banquet was held in the elegant "La Gardenia" Restaurant, located at 90th Street and Burley Avenue, in South Chicago. This affair was given under the auspices of the "Lux In Umbra" (Light in the Shade), a lodge recently founded as a branch of the Masonic Order.</p>
   <p>This banguet was given in honor of Messrs. Enrique Rincon, Ernesto Uribe and Salvador Galvan, whose initiation as members of this lodge took place that night. The following were present: Luis Alvarez del Castillo, Ven.; Ruben Flores, Pv.; Lisandro Diaz, SV.; Yalesio Espinosa, Sec.; Ignanio Guerrero, Tres.; Jose Reyes, M. de S. They, together with other members of the lodge conversed as true comrades until past midnight.</p>
   <p>We sincerely congratulate this group of men of advanced ideas for having formed a Masonic Lodge in this district. This is especially true since masonry is one of the most advanced and beneficial orders known to man. It is called the redeemer and teacher of mankind.</p>
