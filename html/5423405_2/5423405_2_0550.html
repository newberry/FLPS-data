   <p>In the Puento de Veracruz, well known Mexican restaurant, a group of friends gathered last Wednesday evening. The purpose was to honor Mr. Francisco Lona, representative of the Mexican National Railroad. The dinner at which many Mexican dishes were served, turned out to be a pleasure for each and every one present. Many were close friends of Mr. Lona. We wish to congratulate him for his pro-Mexican activities in the colony.</p>
