   <p>The purpose at this present moment is to have the members of our colony to become better acquainted with each other. To see that the tides of friendship, comradeship and national brotherhood is strengthened. For this reason we have welcomed with enthusiasm this initiative of Professor Ortega Rodriguez who has persistently worked toward the unity of our people during the long period that he has been in the United States.</p>
   <p>According to the initiative, El Liberal has sent mail to all the representative elements of our colony to meet Friday August 11th, at 8:30 P. M. in El Puerto de Veracruz, 811 So. Halsted St. We have denominated these meetings "Popular Dinners", for the simple reason that there will be no other ceremony, except that which the rules in etiquette deem necessary. In the first place we have already extended an invitation to Don. Carlos, Palacios Roji, and Don. Tomas Morlet, Consul and Vice-Consul representing our government in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The Mexican colony must be well identified with our consular representatives, and the latter should also be identified with the people. All the Mexican people regardless of class distinction, or social sphere should become acquainted with each other in order to be able to assist those who may be in precarious circumstances.</p>
