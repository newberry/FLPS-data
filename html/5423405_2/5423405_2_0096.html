   <p>We have received an invitation from the women's society, Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, which is preparing, for the night of March 14th, a Festival and Dance. The proceeds will be dedicated to help the sick, who have no relatives. This affair will be held at the F'arrara Hall, 722 So. Halsted St., the admission will be 30 cents for gentlemen and 15 cents for ladies. We have no doubt that the Festival will be a complete success, due to the altruistic aim for which it is intended.</p>
