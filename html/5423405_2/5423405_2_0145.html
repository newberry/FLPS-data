   <p>A dinner was given at the Mexicali Restaurant last Thursday by the Necaxa Club as an expression of friendship to the "Alas Rojas Club". The atmosphere was purely Mexican. All the members of the Necaxa Club. Alas Rojas, the C. A. M. and many South-Americans enjoyed the exquisite Mexican dishes in the midst of great cordiality. There were many improvished perorations in honor to the Alas Rojas. Luis Maya, Xavier Mondragon, E. Garces, and the gentlemen of the C. A. M. spoke in a very patriotic manner. Cuca Delgado and Lencha Alcala, gave expression of gratitude in the name of the Alas Rojas Club, and gave us the impression that everything in life is laughable but it is also necessary to be serious even though it may take a glass of wine or two, to reach the point.</p>
   <p>Tonight Misses Margot and Carolina Maldonado who are members of the "Alas Rojas", have also organized a party in their residence as a reception to the new elected officers of this Club.</p>
