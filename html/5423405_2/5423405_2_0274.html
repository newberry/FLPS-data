   <p>Very fervently we have celebrated the anniversary of the battle of Pueblo, May 5th 1862. Bearing in mind the double personality of the great hero, General Ignacio Zaragoza, the intrepid warrior who knew how to lead the army in defense of justice and freedom, and made a fact the living words of our National Anthem: "Should a foreign enemy dare to profane your soil with his foot, think, Oh dear Country, that the heavens gave you a soldier in each one of your sons."</p>
   <p>In various places the 5th of May was commemorated. In the Pilsen Park in So. Chicago, Indiana Harbor, Gary, Indiana, Waukegan and in every place where there is the palpitation of a Mexican heart, in every place beautiful, civic and artistic programs were given; all sang the National Anthem in chorus. Our national flag with its colors, waved upon the heads of the little children and seemed to say "I am the mantle that protects you, my little sons; I am the insignia that will watch you wherever you may be. But do not forget my dear son: respect me, give me all the honor your heart may emanate, that, by watching my colors, you will be defending the country of your fore-fathers".</p>
