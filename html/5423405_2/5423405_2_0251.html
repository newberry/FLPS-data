   <p>The gigantic fiesta which the "Femenil Mexicana" has announced for Saturday December 15th, at the West Side Auditorium, has awakened an unprecedented enthusiasm in the colony. The program is promised to be as pleasant as it will be in length. The main attraction will be a masquerade dance and a award will be given to the person wearing the most original costume. A jury has been appointed to select the winner.</p>
   <p>Another thing of importance in the program is the presentation of two famous comedies entitled "The Duquesa del Baltabarin" in which a group of gracious young ladies will take part and "El Sueno Dorado" a well known play, to those people who love the theatre,</p>

   <p>The Femenil Society who is free from every idea of exploitation will require only a wardrobe tax from every attendant. It would be idle to say that this festival is to be crowned with a great success, because the attractions being offered will corroborate this assertion. Moreover, the aim pursued by this benefit society is very noble for the colony not to listen to such disinterested call from this group; which has the sole purpose of accentuating the unity of the Mexican people on this side of the Rio Grande. Festivals of this kind should be supported by every Mexican.</p>
