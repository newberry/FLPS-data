   <p>Much has been said and will continue to be said before the Mexican wakes up to the real situation with which he is confronted. He will sooner or later be forced by circumstances to seek his advancement in personal and collective action.</p>
   <p>I rejoice in the fact that there are individuals who work indefatigably for the advancement of their race. However, there are too many who practice low methods in order to sit in soft chairs, while acquiring wealth. Why do we make no effort to correct this evil?</p>
   <p>The answer is simple. It is because we do not know ourselves nor what material values we possess. We take too much stock in things fostered by those who take advantage of our ignorance to exploit us. As C. Espinosa has said, we all should know what constitute true patriotism and what makes real citizen. Each one of us is a force for our own advancement. What difficulties and problems we now face are only incidental.</p>
   
   <p>But unfortunately, fellowmen, the true idealistics, the ones who desire grandeur, who are not selfish, and not necessarily a countryman, those who are sympathetic towards those who struck with misfortune, may be counted with the fingers of one hand. In spite of their efforts, their words are lost in hope, and what is more, they soon acquire the title of "Locos" (Fools). They are scoffed at without any effort to distinguish them from those who are really fools.</p>
   <p>What can these spiritual forces accomplish in this troubled society of mankind? Are they no more than a drop of water in the sea?</p>
   <p>I should like to say that these human sympathizers, because of their venerable character, are superficially set off from the main body of humanity. However, we should follow their leadership to the end that all our vice and imperfection may be brought vividly before our eyes.</p>
   
   <p>How many Mexicans read the newspapers with more or less regularity? How many take up a book, even by chance? How many of us get together for the purpose of working out plans to promote cultural and financial advancement? From what we have been able to see, five or less out of each hundred are active in the advancement of our society. What, then, can we do about it? The approach is easy. Let us start by investigating billard parlors, drinking, and other vice dens where we will find the other 95 per cent.</p>
   <p>In my desire for my personal advancement, and later for that of my fellow-citizens, I tried to push the cause of the Cruz Azul Mexicans de Chicago (Mexican Blue Cross of Chicago) and the Confederacion de Sociedades Mexicanas (Confederation of Mexican Societies).</p>
   <p>I do not wish to refer to detail, but simply mention that on this occasion I made pointed reference to the terrible moral and intellectual situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
   
   <p>The newspaper Mexico and other local papers have been giving publicity to the work of the Cruz Azul and the C. of S. M. In the face of our effort to get at the root of the evils which affect our society, we have been critized by many of our colony, who feel that we are treating the matter as if to indicate ridicule, when as a matter of fact our motives is only for social advancement......</p>
   <p>We hope that some good may come from our effort to build up the morale of the members of our colony and further its social advancement.</p>
