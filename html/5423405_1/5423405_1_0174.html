   <p>I have been here one year and two months. My business is worth about two hundred dollars. I pay fifteen dollars a year for license and eighteen dollars a month rent. Business is very slow. I am just barely existing. I have been in Chicago 12 years, and lived in the State of Texas, about 15 years. I have two sons in San Antonio, Texas and a married daughter.</p>
