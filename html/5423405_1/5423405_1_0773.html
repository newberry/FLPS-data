   <p>With the object of celebrating the birthday anniversary of Miss Mary Mc Dowell, the prominent sociologist, whose philanthropic qualities were widely know among the foreign elements that reside in the Stock Yards district, a literary and musical program has been arranged for tomorrow at 2:30 P.M. at the University of Chicago Settlement 4630 Gross Ave. The program will consist of songs, musical numbers, and expressions of gratitude. It will be in charge of the different foreign groups among whom the elderly sociologist was so dear. Invitations of honor have been sent to the Consulates of Poland, Lithuania, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico. The Mexican numbers will be presented by the elements which are known in our colony by their artistic abilities, and have been selected by the Frente Popular Mexicano Section 1 and the Mexican Mothers Club of the University of Chicago settlement. Due to the great sentiment of gratitude which was well earned by Miss McDowell's social activities for the interest of the unfortunate, we have no doubt, that there will be a great attendance at this interesting celebration. The admission will be free to everybody.</p>
