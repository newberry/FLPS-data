   <p>The rosary devotee must bear in mind the following. According to St. Francis de Sales, the best prayer to be dedicated during the Mass is the rosary, and we claim a double gain. The merit of the Mass and of the rosary. It is permissible to announce in a loud voice before beginning each tenth, but it is not of an absolute necessity when it is prayed in privacy. It is more valuable to pray with pause, once, than one thousand times in haste. He who wishes to secure his salvation must commend himself to the sacred Mary through the rosary devotion. She has clearly stated: "The soul that is commended through the rosary shall not perish".</p>
