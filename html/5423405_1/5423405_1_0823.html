   <p>Not long ago we witnessed an incident which took place in one of our municipal courts of Chicago. A married woman whose charge is not fit to mention, claimed to be from a Latin-American Country, and Mexican by Marriage, was taken before a judge. She was a woman of no physical or moral character that could distinguish her from an anonymous accumulation. She had little, or no education. Slow in thinking, and slower in expressing her thoughts. Awkward in her language, and with no knowledge of English. Her accusation was as one who is a prostitute professionally. She was represented by a lawyer who frankly confessed to have no knowledge of Spanish. The state's attorney basing the charge upon the declarations, which was said to have been made to the police officers, at the time of the arrest, asked for the maximum punishment which the law stipulates in similar offenses. The attorney for the defendant made a motion to postpone the case because his client could not speak English, and the interpreter who was to act in the case was not present for some unknown reason. The Judge refused to grant the delay in <span class="page-break">\2</span>view of the fact, that the defendant had been arrested four times, on the same charges. About two hours later a colored person was brought in to interpret for her. The judge asked: "How many years have you been in this country?" "Ten years," she answered. This answer caused a reaction of ire upon the magistrate. He then imposed a heavy fine upon the woman. The conviction of a common charge of that nature made the defendant eligible for deportation. The convicted woman, without any funds, could not have her case appealed to a higher count. After a long period of incarceration she was deported and this of course caused considerable expenses to the Immigration Department. The magistrate was extemporaneous in his decision, and therefore unjust because he based his justification solely upon the version presented by the police. If the case had been appealed to the Superior Court perhaps the decision would have been reversed. The defendant was a victim of her own economic condition. Every story has two sides, so before we blame the judge let us consider his side also.</p>
