   <p>A colossal success, never before attained by our colony, was last Saturday's festival at the West Side Auditorium, in which Paco Perafan showed his talent both as organizer and dancer. Again Paco lived up to his promise, and after each number he was clamorously applauded by the audience. Paco Perafan is preparing another festival which will probably take place about the middle of next March. It is nothing less than a fiesta in honor of the Mexican woman, in which the outstanding artists of our colony will participate.
