   <p>Mexicans beware! Our editing offices have received information about some individuals who have appeared as agents of the Gas Company and have introduced themselves into the Mexican homes, particularly, asking for the names and addresses of those who live there, with some vague excuse. After they obtain such information, they return the following day with a suspicious package that they intend to sell them future victims. Although, a warning of this nature seems out of question, "Mexico" being faithful to its principle' of safe-guarding the interest of its readers, wish all those who are not aware of this fact, to abstain themselves from purchasing any article unless it is guaranteed by a reliable company and well known agent.</p>
