   <p>Senorita Blanca Rivera and Josefina Garcia are candidates for Queen in the festival of September. Blanca Rivera represents the Club of Mexican Workers Local 32. Josefina Garcia represents the Club Cultural Latino Americano, both Clubs meet at the University of Chicago. "Personify Kindness" this much can be said of Blanca Rivera. I am not pretending on this occasion to make a panegyrical with all its colors of grace and plenitude, or to adulate her in these lines, it can only be said, and with justification that she is called, "The Angel of Kindness". Josefina Garcia candidate of the Latino Americano is one of our Mexican beauties, of soft and clear complexion, white silky hands, her collar and shoulders are show-like, firm and polished. Juvenile enchantment that invites to romance.</p>
