   <p>Mr. Robert C. Jones, assistant director of The Old Town Boys' Club, and noted sociologist, last Sunday at John Woolman Hall, spoke to a group from the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The theme of his lecture was the Mexicans' immigration to the United States. Mr. Jones has many friends among the Mexican people and knows perfectly their customs. He is identified with the 'Mexican' ideas, probably because he was reared in a Spanish environment. He was born in Gibara, Cuba, when his parents visited The Pearl of Antilles.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jones visited Mexico and Central America and studied sociology at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jones is a good friend of the Mexican people.</p>
