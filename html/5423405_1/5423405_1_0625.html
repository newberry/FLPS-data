   <p>The rector of the National University of Mexico, Garcia Tellez,LL.D., has been visiting our city for several days.</p>
   <p>Although we ignore the purpose of his visit, there is no doubt he has come to this country with the object of studying the methodology of the universities of the United States.</p>
   <p>Our distinguished visitor was a guest speaker at the conference campaign that took place at Hull House last Sunday.</p>
   
   <p>He expressed his admiration for the progress he noticed in our colony, saying that this progress was manifested by the large attendance to the lecture, and that he was very proud to see that the hall was crowded with his compatriots, a clear evidence of the cultured spirit that encourages us.</p>
