   <p>Next Sunday, September 6th, a grand function will be held at the Hull House, located at 800 S. Halsted Street. The United Artists Company of light opera and musical comedy, which has accomplished so much in the colony, is promoting the affair.</p>
   <p>In addition to the ten actors who will appear in different roles, and who will no doubt be the delight of the audience, the delightful and very funny comedy "Comicos en Apuros" will be presented. The chief players are Paco Perafan, Tina Noriega, Ortega Rodriguez, Gurtrudis Morales and Rosa Dorante.</p>
   <p>The organizers of this function cordially invite the whole colony, with the well founded belief that all will be satisfied with the program.</p>
