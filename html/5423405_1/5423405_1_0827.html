   <p>A week ago Monday, Juan Garcia, 39 years, of 1100 West Harrison Street, was wounded on the head during a quarrel with Mr. Rafael Muro, Proprietor of "La Favorita" store, 1009 West Polk Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Garcia, said that he had gone into the store to buy a newspaper, but that he first paused to read some articles on the front page. Mr. Muro thought probably that he was not going to purchase the paper. He thus told him in an offensive way to get out of the store. Thereupon a quarrel ensued. The proprietor attacked him with an empty bottle, wounding his head. Realizing that he was badly hurt, Mr. Garcia summoned the police and was taken in an ambulance to the Cook County Hospital, where he received first aid treatment.</p>
   <p>The merchant told one of our reporters, that Garcia was leaving the store, without paying for the paper and that on being discovered he began to throw things at him. So he, in self defense threw a bottle at Garcia, to intimidate him.</p>
   <p>Judge Bonelli, of the Disciplinary Court, on hearing the charges of Garcia, issued a warrant for the arrest of the well known merchant, Mr. Muro.</p>
