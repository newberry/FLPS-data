   <p>On Thursday, November 5th, will take place the final computing of the coupons which have been sent to our office applying for the courses that Prof. Ramon Alcazar, and Mr. Sahagun dela Mora, are offering free of charge to the colony. Prof. Alcazar says that the only requisite he asks of young men and women is to be very punctual. After the courses have been started, no one will be permitted to enroll. Any student who may be absent from class two times in succession, will be automatically out of the class. The place and hour selected for the classes, will be indicated through the mail to those who have subscribed for the courses. The classes of shorthand in Spanish, will be once a week. The Spanish classes, given by Sahagun dela Mora, will be held in Hull House, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 7 to 9 in the evening.</p>
