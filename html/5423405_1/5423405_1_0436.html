   <p>The Junior Association of Commerce has organized a series of festivals entitled "International Nights." The first of the festivals was dedicated to Mexico, and took place in the "Cameo Room" of the luxurious Morrison Hotel, last Thursday evening having had, as a guest of honor, Mr. Antonio L. Schmidt, consul of Mexico. The music in its entirety was composed of typical Mexican melodies, under the management "A Mexican Night or ganized by the Association of Commerce" of "Los Charros". The artistic program was presented by "Chiquita Rangel," and one of the leading numbers was that of the Mexican dancers. As it is customary of Chiquita Rangel, among the numbers she presented was that of the incompariable Mexican Tap Dance which is never omitted and was cheerfully executed by a group of young people dressed in "Charros and Chinas Poblanas" costumes that were applauded very much.</p>
   <p>The sweet voice of the popular and sympathetic "Chiquita" who sang <span class="page-break">2</span>"El Rancho Grande" "Cielito Lendo" and many of our popular songs was admired very much and justly applauded by many attendants, almost totally composed of Americans who sincerely rewarded the presentation with prolonged ovations.</p>
