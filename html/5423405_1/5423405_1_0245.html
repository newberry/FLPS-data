In 1925 went to the University of Strasbourg, France, on an endowment fellowship for two years and to the Courtauld Institute of London for two years also. During these four years he was in the bio-chemistry department. At the termination of his work in Europe came to America on the Rockefeller Foundation to the Johns Hopkins University. Was a fellow in 1927 and 1928. In 1929 was instructor in medicine at the same University. In 1930 came to the University of Chicago as a research associate in the Department of Medicine. In 1931 was made assistant professor of bio-chemistry.</p>
   <p>In 1932 attended the Physiological Congress in Rome, Italy. In 1935 went to study the physiological effects of higher altitude in Chile. He has worked in jaundice, cell metabolism, and biological oxidation.</p>
