   <p>A great theatrical performance is to take place at the West Side Auditorium, Saturday, February 15, 1930. On this day and at the hour that you already know, the Mexican colony will have the opportunity to see a great operetta, and when we say great it is because it is so, since we are well acquainted with the players that will take part on this monumental program, now in preparation. The main attraction is the presentation of the noted operetta, "Marina," which will be under the skillful direction of the renowned Mexican artist, Mr. Silvano Ramos, In order to present this operetta properly, the best talent of the colony has been selected, all of then members of the group recently formed under the name of "Artistas Unidos Mexicanos Dechicago" (United Mexican Artists or Chicago). Due to the talent of Mr. Ramos and the great enthusiasm that reigns among his fellow-artists for presenting a really sensational program we venture to assure that the performance will be of great artistic value. Do not forget the date and place where this great entertainment will be given, if you wish to witness something worthwhile.</p>
