   <p>In connection with our plans to form a base-ball team for the 1932 season, which will be entered in the semi-professional league, we have the pleasure to announce that Mr. Henry Rosas will cooperate with us. He will take active part in the formation of the team. And, for the sport of it, he has voluntarily offered his services as coach. Mr. Rosas is well trained in all phases of the sport, and for several years managed the Mexican team with much success.</p>
   <p>All who are interested may report to him in order to sign up for the team. Happy New Year.</p>
