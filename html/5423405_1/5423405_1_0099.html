   <p>Thru a communication received from the Honorable Mexican Consul, Mr. Rafael Aveleyra, we were informed that the Chicago authorities have recently taken charge of Genaro Arias, 15 year old Mexican youth, who was found sleeping in a railroad car.</p>
   <p>Since the parents of this boy, Julio and Maria Arias, have not been located in spite of many efforts, it is urgently requested that if anyone should know the whereabouts of these people he should as soon as possible get in touch with the Consulate of this newspaper.</p>
