   <p>No matter if there is a reason or not, the North-Americans assume an air of superiority toward the other nationalities, but in particular toward the Mexicans.</p>
   <p>Such stupid manifestation of self-esteem evoke only laughter from us.</p>
   <p>Among the Mexican immigrants-we are referring to some of the working class people-there are certain individuals whose pedantry is most obvious.</p>
   <p>They affect an air of superiority, because they can read, and possess a certain amount of money, or because they wear expensive clothes,though they may not have a bit of decency.</p>
   <p>They may want you to believe that in their home town they were persons of influence; that they once possessed a large capital which they lost during the revolution.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>They will recite a litany of absurdities, to give themselves an air of superiority.</p>
   <p>It may seem strange, but this is characteristic of the Mexicans,-I am still referring to some of the working classes here. They do not behave like that in their own country. In crossing the United States boundary they acquire talents and an importance that exist only in their feverish imagination.</p>
   <p>But their pretensions crumble as soon as they begin to speak. They will say: "truje," instead of "traje," "estogamo" for "estomago", etc.</p>
   <p>But let us come back to the North-American gentlemen who are the object of this article. They also suffer from this extravagant affliction which exposes one to ridicule.</p>
   <p>Every one knows that the sons of "Uncle Sam," consider themselves superior to the whole world; and they do not waste any opportunity to voice their belief.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>They do not realize that they make themselves the butt of ridicule. Even among themselves they look down on each other because each one considers himself superior.</p>
   <p>"In every community,-"Quillen" tells us in one of his recent articles-there is a family which considers its self to be better than common clay. "Whether this be on account of wealth or because of distinguished ancestry this family treats every other human being with contempt."</p>
   <p>Some years ago family superiority was recognized, but not so at the present time; today that superiority has become a sham and family lineage has lost its brilliancy. Either a son has been convicted of robbery, or a daughter has become a habitue of billiard rooms and taverns.</p>
   <p>Thus, in no way the members of this family are superior to those they scorn.</p>
   <p>These considerations apply also to those individuals, who look down on us with such contempt, because they consider us inferior.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>They believe that we are still uncivilized beings and because their color is white, they classify us as "colored people." They are proud because they are rich, and because in their country there is so much freedom. But they forget, that freedom has turned into license and that as a result the youth of this country are turning to crime.</p>
   <p>They forget that this license is the cause of prostitution and of the many divorces.</p>
   <p>"They forget, that the native Mexican as a "Saturday Evening Post" writer says-has a history of which any one could be proud. The 'Aztecs,' 'Joltees,' and 'Mayas' were powerful races in their time. The 'Mayas,' whose empires covered great parts of Mexico and Central America, have built the most majestic cities which are now being discovered.</p>
   <p>"These people were agriculturists, astronomers, artists and architects.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"Their civilization as proved by discoveries lasted two thousand years. We would not dare to say that our British ancestors were superior. The cultural past of Mexico and of Central America, is an object of pride for the entire human race. An appreciation of such facts, should help to establish good relationship. Even if the Latin-American countries are poorer than we, they have so much to offer us that we should not dare to underestimate them." But, unfortunately, persons who hold such opinions of the Mexicans are few, many treat us as slaves and do not realize that their conduct labels them as hypocrites and puts them on the level of the clowns of any circus.</p>
   <p>They also reproach us for our illiteracy. This certainly is an undeniable fact. But, besides that, in this country illiterate people also abound; those who have some education use their knowledge to indulge in crimes.</p>
   <p>Of what good is knowledge to them, if they use it to commit crimes, instead of helping humanity?</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Is it not preferable to have illiterate honest workers, rather than to have a phalanx of "cultured" people who worry the authorities and are a bane to society? "They call us bandits, and forget that this species is more abundant here. A comparison of the criminal records of both countries will bear us out.</p>
   <p>"Quillen," the above mentioned writer says: "The people violate the laws knowingly, and justify their actions by claiming that such violations are not illegal, because they consider themselves superior to the ordinary bandit." "This is not sinful- "Beecher" said to one of his victims-because I am a preacher, and you are a good virtuous woman."</p>
   <p>"This is not robbery-says the son of a good family-because I shall pay it back when my ship comes home."</p>
   <p>We do as we please, even though it may be dishonorable, and we believe that such acts are righted through our social standing. We are becoming a nation of hypocrites, paying lip tribute to decency in order to conceal our corruption.</p>
