   <p>The Mexican baseball team "Morelos" will play a doubleheader tomorrow afternoon with an American team at Elmhurst. There is a great deal of enthusiasm among the elements who are interested in such sport and have not lost interest in the "Morelos" even though they were defeated in a doubleheader last Sunday, by the Palmer House Indians. The scores of last Sunday's games were 9 to 6 and 5 to O. We wish better luck to our countrymen for tomorrow and and less errors.</p>
