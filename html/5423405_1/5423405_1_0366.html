   <p>It has been announced for several days that the Orchestra Tipica Torreblanca will give a concert in this city for the benefit of the Bonemerita Cruz Azul Mexicana of Chicago. The funds of this Institution are being used to relieve the distressing and critical situationof many destitute Mexican families. A great number of the men are out of work and winter is approaching.</p>
   <p>We have not been able to publish any details relative to this affair, not having been fully informed. However, we do know that the preparations are progressing so as to make it a success. Up to the time that this paper went to press we did not know exactly, the date nor the place of the concert.</p>
   <p>It is supposed, however, that it will be given in the spacious hall of the Ashland Auditorium. We will give further information to our readers concerning this affair which means so much to our Colony.</p>
