   <p>Accepting the invitation of Mr. John R. Palandech to the editors of foreign language (publications) of Chicago, Sebastian K. Kivera, a lawyer, attended as a representative of our newspaper, Mexico. The banquet was given in the "Red Room" of the La Salle Hotel on October 15. S. K. Rivera writes the following:</p>
   <p>The banquet had the largest attendance of any as yet given by the Foreign Language Newspaper of Chicago. The appeal made by the Political Action Committee was carried out, it was mainly to interest the foreign editors in the support of the candidates nominated by the Republican Party for the coming elections next November.</p>
   <p>We shook hands with Judge John A. Swanson, candidate for the office of State Attorney in Chicago, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Hull, nominee to the office of United States Senator; Mr. Jaranowski, nominee to the civil service</p>

   <p>registeration and many other important politicians. Judge Swanson was the official speaker of the evening. He spoke for half an hour on the importance of the States Attorneys office and the "Crinimal-political alliance that has prevailed in Chicago during the present administration. The experience that Judge Swanson had had, first as a representative at the Illinois Legislature, then, as Municipal Judge of Chicago, and lastly as a Judge of the Circuit Court qualified him to be elected to the States Attorneys office. Judge Swanson was applauded very much. Mr. Hull and Mr. Jaranowski also made political speeches. In general the banquet was a success. The most important part for us, is the influence the foreign language press has in Chicago. When politicians of this caliber solicit the support of the foreign press on such occasions as at this banquet, it is because the press is being recognized as an important factor in the community.</p>
   <p>The newspaper Mexico rejoices of being one of the foreign language publications in Chicago.</p>
