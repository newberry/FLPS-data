   <p>Last Sunday a game was played between the Mexican and Aztecas Nines. The result of the game was highly satisfactory to the Mexicans. From the very beginning it could be seen that the Mexican boys had the advantage over their opponents. This does not mean, however, that the Aztecas did not put forth their best efforts to win. It was simply that the Mexicans were determined, at any cost, to win their first game with the Aztecas. The score was seven to five in favor of the Mexicans.</p>
   <p>This coming Sunday the Mexicans will meet the Reyes from 26th Street. We feel that the game will be a hard fought battle because of the power of the Reyes. The game will take place in Washington Park, at 1 P.M.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Spanish speaking Colony will turn out in crowds, thus showing its interest in base-ball and at the same time cheer both Nines.</p>
