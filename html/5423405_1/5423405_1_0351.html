   <p>During the celebration of the centenary foundation of So. Chicago last week it was possible for us to present a series of typical artistic numbers which were liked and applauded very much by the listeners. It would be too extensive to explain in detail the complete program; in consequence we shall just mention that which awaked the most interest. The third day of the celebration a number of Mexican amateur boys presented artistic series, among whom the Rocha brothers, acted as dancers, Rivera and Rodarte as players. Manuel Guardado, a boy, sang two American songs, and were much liked by the numerous attendance. Miss Angelina Ascencion delighted the audience too with her Spanish dances. Mr. Federico Castellanos, and Miss Margarita Hermandez danced the typical "Jarabe Tapatio" (Mexican tap-dance) which was one of the numbers best liked and repeated to satisfy the demands of the public who after its repetition wanted it again to be presented. On the Day for all Nations we had the pleasure to see Maria Luisa Rangel with a group of her "Mexican Review" in a series of Artistic presentations, among which the outstanding were the songs by Chiquita. The music was sponsored by the orchestras "Los Cubanos" and "Los Charros" both well known among our people who also received great ovations from the numerous spectators; special mention must be accorded to Fernando Castellanos for his artists qualities as a violinist and dancer.</p>
