He was caught in the cross-fire when he found himself in front of a pool-room located at 1609 Madison Street.

   <p>In the under-world of Gary, Gonzales gained the reputation of being a stool-pigeon for the police, telling them what he knew,of the many secret hiding places of the "bootleggers" of the neighboring city.</p>
   <p>The theory prevails that the assailant was Joseph Montano, chief of a gang of "bootleggers" who marauds thru the northern part of Illinois. Traficamp told the police that he seemed to have recognized Montano as being the man who walked thru a small passage-way a few moments before the tragedy.</p>
   <p>On the theory that Montano is the murderer, the police have begun to search for him, hoping for his apprehension.</p>
