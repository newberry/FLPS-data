   <p>Your paper is in need and expected your help. A long time ago and on many occasions we have repeatedly stated that El Ideal Mexicano needed your financial aid and now we are soliciting from our readers a demonstration of gratitude towards the paper which has been distributed free. You have always closed your ears to our petitions, and if El Ideal were made for business it would have disappeared shortly after its inception. At the beginning we thought that the misery all of us were in, made it impossible to cooperate but today it is not so because now all the families have money. Now you can contribute if you wish to do so, and we expect all of our readers to help us.</p>

   <p>MAY DISAPPEAR</p>
   <p>The actual necessities of our paper are serious and if you fail with your cooperation the publication may become impossible.</p>
   <p>WORTHWHILE TO MENTION</p>
   <p>Two persons who now reside in Indiana Harbor, donated one dollar each about a year ago, a member of the catholic society who now resides in Chicago, sent in fifteen dollars as a Christmas gift, three weeks ago a person from South Chicago gave four dollars and a family from Indiana sent in one dollar. We do not mention their names because the modesty of these people is well known to us and we wouldn't like to hurt their feelings.</p>

   <p>All our friends who wish to help us to support El Ideal send in your contributions either by money orders, postal stamps, or personal delivery. Should any of our contributors wish his, or her name published please notify us in your letter. But send your name and address so as to keep them in our files. The five thousand homes reached by our paper every week could easily give us the sum of $500.00 if they only sent 10c a week each. We expect those who have never helped us to send 10c, at least, but if they can, send us 50c or $1.00. Dear readers send us your contribution. Be generous. Send us a Dollar.</p>
