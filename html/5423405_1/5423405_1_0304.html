   <p>The International Composers Society, will hold to-day, at Debs Hall in this city, a musical festival commemorating the final consecration of an American-centre, also to pay homage to a young composer, who after a long and hard struggle amidst strange environments has completed his course in art.</p>
   <p>This artist is Gerardo Castillo, who for many years has been a brilliant figure in the principal musical centres of the Mexican Colony, and now he has published"The Ideal Valse" and the beautiful "Cancion de la Vida" (Song of Life) which was so generously acclaimed by the Spanish element.</p>
   <p>The International Composers Society, is well acquainted with Castillo's great musical work and has determined to publish the "Ideal Valse" and to hold this musical festival to-night.</p>
