   <p>The Henry Booth House and Mercy Center will present a great Mexican Fiesta on the grounds of the Worlds Fair today at 6:30 P.M. Several tap dancers will take part, sixty Mexican children will sing and a great orchestra will play. The admission price is 10 and of course it should be very interesting for all those persons who are able to attend and visit the Fair.</p>
