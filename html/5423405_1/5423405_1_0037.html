   <p>About 50 Mexicans attend now this school. In the past many graduated, a few went to college. Their behavior is a little troublesome and many are called to the office for different offenses. Compared with other students they lack ambition and are not perseverant in their tasks. This school has three classes in Spanish language and a literary Club that meets every Friday.</p>
