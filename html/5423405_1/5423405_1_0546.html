   <p>The popularity of this newspaper in the Spanish-speaking colony, especially among the Mexican group, was in evidence last Saturday. The occasion was the celebration of its sixth anniversary at the West Side Auditorium. In spite of the size of the Hall, it could not accommodate the crowd.</p>
   <p>Our artists gave a meritorious demonstration of their talent, as we expected. The affair was given to show our appreciation for the splendid cooperation of our readers during the six years of our existence. It was made all the more timely because we could celebrate at the same time the glorious national holiday, the Fifth of May.</p>
