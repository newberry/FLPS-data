   <p>I have been in business 2 years and four months, and a resident in Chicago for 14 years. I am working for the Illinoes Steel Company, because business is not profitable. If it were not for what I invest from my check I would not be able to support the business. I have been about 26 years in the United States. When I am at work my family attends the store. My store is worth about $200.00.</p>
