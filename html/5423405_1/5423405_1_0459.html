   <p>The Henry Booth Settlement and "Mercy Center" of Chicago will hold a great festival on the grounds of the Chicago World's Fair to-day, Saturday, June 10, at 6:30 P. M. Sixty Mexican children will take part in the affair and will dance the Tapatio to the tune of a large orchestra.</p>
   <p>The price of admission will be only ten cents. It will be worth while for all those persons who can visit the Enchanted Island, where the function will be held to see this great show and at the same time to visit the grounds of the Great World's Fair.</p>
