   <p>We have just been informed by our Consul, Mr. Rafael Aveleyra, that hereafter Mexicans will not be molested any longer on our beaches.</p>
   <p>This decision is the result of a protest lodged by all the Mexicans against an ordinance refusing them admission to the Twelfth Street beach. Such an ordinance was an insult to the people of our race as well as to the Colored and the Filipino people, who also were denied admission.</p>
   <p>The company which had exploited the beach illegally has now lost its concession. The beaches belong to the public and not to any individual, who has the audacity to charge a ten cent admission fee.</p>
   <p>We have now free beaches and there is no further discrimination against any race. At last the matter has been settled.</p>
