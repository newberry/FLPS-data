   <p>As we are in the middle of the Summer and owing to the intolerable heat we have dropped in-door amusements. For this reason the various Mexican societies have arranged a series of out-door activities which will be held on the banks of the beautiful lakes and rivers on the outskirts of this city.</p>
   <p>An outing has been arranged for next Sunday, July 16th. Music will be furnished by the ladies orchestra known as "Los Musas Latinas." The affair will be held in "Dam No. 2." park, 4629 Gross Avenue and 1250 South Peoria Street, beginning at 7 A.M.</p>
   <p>On the same day the members of the Spanish Societies of Gary, Indiana, have also planned an outing and will be entertained by the music of excellent Mexican Orchestras.</p>
   <p>The Sociedad Espanola of Chicago, will have its outing on Sunday, the twenty-third of this month.</p>
