   <p>Ignacio Ramirez, 48 years old who was accused of conducting a disorderly house, and arrested with four men and two women was sentenced to six months in the House of Correction. The State appointed a lawyer to represent Ramirez, and the sentence was suspended. Then the Immigration Department subjected the defendant to an examination and found that Ramirez could not produce a passport and confined him to the County Jail subject to deportation. While in jail, Ramirez suffered an attack of pneumonia, and died. The Immigration Department, estimated Ramirez's case to cost the State about $700.00 besides the oxygen administered during his illness, which cost about $34.00 a day. The other persons arrested with Ramirez, are still in jail, waiting for a decision from Washington to be deported.</p>
