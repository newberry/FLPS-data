   <p>The affair promoted by Mr. Sabino Maldonado, as a feature of the Fifth of May celebration, was an artistic and financial success. It was held in the Eagle Hall, last Monday, and was attended by a large enthusiastic crowd from The Colony.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabino Maldonado willingly offered to give thirty per cent of the receipts from his project to the Mexican Blue Cross of Chicago, an auxiliary unit recently formed by the untiring efforts of Dr. Oscar Carrera. As a result of Mr. Maldonado's kindness, The Blue Cross received $51.30.</p>
   <p>The action of Mr. Maldonado created a very favorable impression in our colony. This is especially true because this support came at a time when the colony is trying to help this new and very worthy auxiliary of the Mexican Blue Cross of Chicago which aids the poor.</p>
