   <p>The progressive young people of the Excelsior Club of South Chicago, are also filled with dramatic aspirations, and have decided to put on a play in three acts, entitled "Those Men".</p>
   <p>The enthusiastic young people have taken their parts very seriously and rehearse every evening under the skillful direction of Professor Rosa, artistic painter and dramatist.</p>
   <p>So determined are the "Excelsiors" to show their abilities as actors that many of them have been seen in the street making gestures and repeating their parts ( which they already know perfectly), in order to get ready, as they say, to present themselves in public.</p>
   <p>The function will be, Friday April 10th, in the elegant auditorium of Thorp School at Buffalo Avenue and 89th Streets. The arrangements for those taking part in this enthusiastic affair have been fully completed.</p>
