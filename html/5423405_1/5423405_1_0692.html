   <p>Yesterday afternoon we had the pleasure of meeting a Mexican athlete, Mr. Gilberto Martinez Larrea. This was at the time of his pleasant visit to the offices of this semi-weekly, for the purpose of identifying himself with the Mexican Colony of Chicago, to which, thru the columns of El Nacional is extended an affectionate and fraternal salute.</p>
   <p>Martinez Larrea is a well known fighter, who in his professional bouts has gained victories and fame in all the countries of the world. Martinez Larrea, after his celebrated bout last night at the Coliseum, about which we will give a brief review in our next number, left today, for New York City where he hopes to fulfill other contracts which have been offered him.</p>
