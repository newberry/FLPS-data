   <p>The latest happenings related through the cable, inform us that the march of the nationalists upon Madrid is rather slow, but to a great extent very firm. The desperate efforts made by the Reds have resulted in a complete failure. The Azana government feeling the temper of the sword, has offered to enter a parley towards an armistice of peace. But the Generalissimo Franco has decidedly rejected Azana's proposal, which if granted would mean the violation of the great aspirations of all the Spanish people, who have gladly accepted the greatest of sacrifices. The Spanish people wish to see themselves liberated from the Bolsheviks degradation, which is aided by the powerful soviet dictator, and the ridiculous help from the "Chicharronero". "One who prepares fried pork". meaning (Cardenas.)</p>
