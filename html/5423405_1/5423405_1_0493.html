   <p>The hands of the clock pointed 7, that night and the large Olympia Hall was almost empty; in spite of this circumstance, the orchestra who was cautiously directed by Mateo Cortez Espinoza made the instruments produce such sweet notes, that gradually the atmosphere changed. The affluence of people coming in was becoming larger each time and at 8:00 o'clock the hall was completely full, and then the joy began, because the memory, while listening an observing things which made us burst with joy.</p>

   <p>THE POLICE</p>
   <p>The well formed pair of females commissioned to keep order, were none others than Misses Maria Hernandez and Augustina Noriega always ready to make the people obey the law. Guadalupe Sanchez was the first to be arrested on charges of disobedience and taken before the Citizen Judge who found the defendant guilty and after a severe reprimand imposed a fine of ten cents and pronounced him "free".</p>
   <p>OUR PRESIDENT IN JAIL</p>
   <p>When the police found out that Mr. Fraga was there with Salvador Alaniz drinking some "Coca Cola", they immediately arrested them for infringement of the famous "Dry Law", the defendants alleged their innocence and the Judge let them go.</p>

   <p>DIVORCES</p>
   <p>Divorces and more of it, this is the word in style not only in Hollywood, but everywhere, generally speaking. During the celebration of this bazaar I witnessed the unusual case of Miss Anna Maria Reyes, a beauty who asked the Judge to give her a divorce, the case was difficult to decide, as she was not married, therefore the Judge decided to send her to an asylum.</p>
   <p>THE RED CROSS</p>
   <p>Nurses who were in charge of aiding the sick were a failure because all were dancing and missed not a single tune, this of course became contagious and afterwhile everybody followed their example.</p>

   <p>THE DANCE</p>
   <p>What shall I say? Well, it was not so bad after all, for we had the curiosity to counting 99 couples dancing at one particular time. The tax system which was employed, was not very effective, for I danced at least once and did not pay, what about the rest?</p>
   <p>THE SERENADES</p>
   <p>Misses Juanita and Florentina Hernandez, were graciously dressed with costumes of Pierrot and Colombina,Misses Helaria Morales conception Rivera, Maria de la Luz and Lola Morales and few others who delighted us with their songs, these being "Purely Mexican" which were greatly applauded while they also distributed some savoury candy to the attendants, I imagine it, I didn't taste it.</p>

   <p>A FLOWER</p>
   <p>A flower selling flowers. To explain this I shall try to. Miss Guadalupe Carrillo, who was in charge of selling flowers demonstrated a very agreeable appearance; she was adorning gentlemen coat lapels beside, her aspect seemed like a beautiful little flower. She satisifed those who felt the urgent need of obtaining a flower from the tiny hands of another.</p>
   <p>FORTUNE TELLERS</p>
   <p>Fortune tellers and not, that was the least faculty of these two graceful girls Misses Juanita Lopez and Esperanza Barron who told my fortune. They said; that there were two very light complexted beauties who were dying, for me, and that from a far distant land the wealth I was longing for would come.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Many other things they told, that only if I were crazy I would believe. "Go on your way", I said, so as to end this idolatrized thought.</p>
   <p>JERRY CASTILL'S ORCHESTRA</p>
   <p>This well organized orchestra composed of young people made its appearance in the in the midst of general support from the attendants, playing delightful pieces alternating them with those of the "Espinoza Orchestra".</p>
   <p>SOCIETAS FEMINIL</p>

G. de Barron, Mrs. Maria Jimenez, Mrs. Virjinia Chavez, Antonia Aquilar, Elena Flores de Lovera and many others collecting funds to buy Christmas presents for the poor Mexican children.</p>
