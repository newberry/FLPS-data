   <p>These films are of extreme importance and no doubt will make you feel for a moment us though you were in the land of the 'Aztecs'. Miss Dolores Garcia and Miss Iris Houck have been preparing a very selected artistic and literary program. Many articles of valuable art will be exhibited by Senoe Cortes, a distinguished merchant of the colony.</p>
