   <p>As we promised in the last Edition, it is a great pleasure to inform you of the sons and daughters, of the Spanish speaking parents who have received high school diplomas this year. Thirty-one names have been received, of which fourteen of them are boys and seventeen are girls. It is difficult to know how many of them finished a four year term, and how many just a two year term. Graduates! The world is here, the opportunities have not diminished, follow them with all the energy within your soul.</p>
