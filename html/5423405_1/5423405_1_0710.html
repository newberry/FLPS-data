   <p>Deering celebrated the first anniversary of its founding in a brilliant manner.</p>
   <p>The festival was not well attended, and we feel it was because the other social groups of this vicinity were not invited.</p>
   <p>This was an omission on the part of the new executive board.</p>
   <p>We hope that in the next event, this error will be corrected.</p>
