   <p>A reception was given to Miss Luisa Silva at the Mercy Center on Maxwell and Newberry. This was given in recognition of her recent graduation from High School by the members of the Ignacio Altamirano Educational Club. They presented her with a very modest program in which the Rocha children took part with songs, dances, and some recitations. Miss Silva spoke a few words, thanking the people for their courtesy. After the program a dance took place.</p>
