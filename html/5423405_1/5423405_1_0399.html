   <p>The Mexican artistic club "Olimpia", will play for the first time, tonight, at the West Side Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The dramatic comedy called "Esos Hombres" (Those men) which was written originally by the Mexican wroter Catalina D'Erzell in prose, divided into three acts, will be played.</p>
   <p>The well know orchestra "Los Mayas" will play the overture of the program. This orchestra was hired in order to present a great attraction to the people who like to dance.</p>
   <p>We hope it will be a great success because the comedians had been practicing for long time and the comedy has plenty of emotionalism.</p>
