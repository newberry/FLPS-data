   <p>By the Providence of God we have with us our Brother Filemon Sanchez Hernandez, who will preach and teach the Gospel to the Latin-American colony of Chicago and suburbs every Sunday, at 3 P.M. in our church at 1246 W. Adams St.</p>
   <p>He has just finished with success his first evangelist campaign and we know he is a great orator.</p>
   <p>You are cordially invited to attend; tell your friends.</p>
   <p>L. Simms, Pastor.</p>
