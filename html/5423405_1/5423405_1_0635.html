   <p>I am the Vice-Chairman of the Monterrey Club. We have 30 members, and we were organized June 23, 1932. We play baseball only. We have social festivals about four times a year. There is a benefit for our members, when they are unable to work due to sickness or accident, they get two dollars and fifty cents a week for a period of four weeks. Each member pays ten cents a week as a fee. All our members work for the Wisconsin Steel Corporation. They do not belong to the Industrial Union, because the Company, where they work do not want them to join any union and of course the members do not want to endanger their jobs.</p>
   <p>We work towards the unification of the Mexicans in general. We are benefiting the community materially because we are spending all the money we make in order to live, it takes every bit we earn to get along, we can not save anything. The officers of our club are the following: Isabel Castro, Chairman; Alberto Cueller, Vice-Chairman; Justo M. Alvarado, Treasurer; Rafael Cueller, Secretary; Nicolas Barbosa and Antonio Maravilla, Administration Commission.</p>
