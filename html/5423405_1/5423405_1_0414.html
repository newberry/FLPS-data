   <p>The presentation of the musical comedy, which was to have been played February 15, has been called off. As a substitute for the comedy sketch "Marina," we will have the pleasure of witnessing a splendid theatrical program, which Mr. Paco Perafan has prepared for this same date.</p>
   <p>Much enthusiasm has been aroused in connection with the affair which Mr. Perafan is promoting. This is due to the fact that because of the extent of the preparations and the ability of the artist in charge of them, it is generally believed that something very new and extraordinary will be presented for this occasion.</p>
   <p>We feel quite sure that, as has been the case with all other affairs arranged by Mr. Paco Perafan, those who witness the program will be more than pleased.</p>
