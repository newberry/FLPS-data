   <p>The Comedy Opera Company, which is composed of the United Mexican Artists of Chicago, will, on June 6, make a monumental and first appearance in the immortal work of Miguel Echegaray and M. Fernandez Caballero, entitled Gigantes y Cabezwdos.</p>
   <p>This light opera is typical of Spanish art and reveals the artistic and pleasing spirit of its music, its friendliness, its originality, its Royal Balls and its excellent growth.</p>
   <p>Among the works of the great genuis, this stands out as the best authorities have been able to secure in Spain, Mexico and South America.</p>
   <p>At the same time a play, referring to the uprisings in China will also be given. This is also a Mexican work by the incomparable masters Joseph F. Elizondo, R. Medina and Jorda.</p>
   
   <p>Special costumes have been ordered for these two plays, because Mr. Silvano Ramos, who is the organizer of the Cudaro Artistico Club, has not lessened his efforts or great care in his determination to show these two plays in the very best manner.</p>
