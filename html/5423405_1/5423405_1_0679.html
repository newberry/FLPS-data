   <p>Sunday at 4 P.M., an interesting game of Soccer Foot Ball between the Pan American Team and The Italian Labor Team will be played at Ogden Park, located at Racine and 64th Streets. The Pan American Team is willing, (providing the International Foot Ball League will permit it,) to match its team with some regular American foot-ball team, in order to celebrate the national holidays. If permission is granted, the Spanish speaking colony should give wide publicity to the event as a means of lending its aid to the development of cultural sport in our colony.</p>
