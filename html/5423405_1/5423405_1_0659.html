   <p>Last Sunday the Aztecas Nine obtained a victory over the colored Chicagoans by a score of 9 to 2. Zuniga, distinguished himself by getting three hits out of five times at bat. The hero of the game was the veteran pitcher "Lito", who succeeded in striking out eleven batters of the Chicago Nine and by this feat made himself one of the outstanding "Mexican pitchers", of this locality.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, June 9, the Aztecas Nine will play two teams, the Mexico team at 1:30 P.M. and the Reyes team at 3:00 P. M. These games will be played on diamond number nine, at Washington Park of this city.</p>
   <p>We wish that our Colony be present to witness these two splendid games, played by our boys.</p>
