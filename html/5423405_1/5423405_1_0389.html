   <p>On Sunday night, the sixth of this month a benefit,theatrical performance will be given for Rosita Dorantes in Hull House of this city. A group of actors who are members of the "United Mexican Artists," a Chicago organization, led by Mrs. Dorantes will play the attractions.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dorantes is well known and very highly esteemed among our group and we should show our respects for her by packing the theatre in Hull House for the occasion of this function.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow night Mrs. Dorantes and the other artists will show the public two fine dramas, "Abnegacion y Sacrificio" and "Malditas Suegras." The first is the work of the well known playwright Don Ramon Navarrete, in which Mrs. Dorantes will act the part of Dolores. In the latter play, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which is the original work of the eminent Spanish writer Vital Aza, Dona Amparo, who is the manager of Mrs. Dorantes, will play the leading role.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dorantes has listed as patrons of her benefit performance many well known gentlemen and ladies in high places of society, and we hope that all of those who have been named will do every thing possible to make the benefit a big success and thereby demonstrate our appreciation for Rosita Dorantes' efforts and at the same time show our interest in the theatre. One way of showing the proper interest is for us to come ourselves and bring two others with us.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that immediately after the performance Mrs. Dorantes will leave for San Antonio, Texas, where her family has lived for many years.</p>

   <p>Through these lines we extend to our gifted artist the most sincere wish for a big success of her affair at Hull House tomorrow night.</p>
