   <p>Mexico</p>
   <p>1218 West Madison Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Very timely Mexico has defended through its columns, the Mexican newspaper El Tringuete. This is especially true since in the case which you have defended not only all the interests of Mr. Romero involved, but also those of the whole Chicago Mexican Colony.</p>
   <p>It is already known that Mr. Francisco Betancourt has tried to ruin several Mexican merchants of Chicago by means of his paper La Raza. God knows who this gentleman might pick out next if the Mexican newspapers had not taken the opportunity to defend the Chicago Mexican Colony.</p>
   
   <p>It is left to you the authority of making what use you may see fit of this letter.</p>
   <p>Your faithful servant,</p>
   <p>(Signed) Carlos Budach.</p>
