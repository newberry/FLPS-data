   <p>Decidely, the Mexicans who live in the United States, and specially the young blood, are not asleep. Away from our country, some out of our own volition and others by personal reasons we live in this swarm of human bees, mixed in a conglomeration that proceeds from every part of the world and before whom we must show that the Mexican is not what many have imagined; a turbulent, illiterate and an indolent who is astrayed in the suburbs and in the so-called "Poolrooms", who are simply Winter-quarters of crime, real fomenters of vagrancy and of ill habits.</p>
   
   <p>Chicago and nearby towns shelters a considerable number of Mexican people and if I dare make these calculations, there must be over sixty thousand Mexicans, mostly from the States of Michoacan, Jalisco, and Guanajuato which in fact form the mass unity of our race. And is due to this fact, perhaps, that the local sentimental artistic elements possesses such a clean cut principle.</p>
   <p>An evident proof of this is the Mexican Band of South Chicago, which is conducted by the well known and studious professor and composer, my good friend Cirilo Rodriguez. He is a natural product from one of the States that I have already mentioned, whose worthiness have been manifested in the organization of his modest but studious band of South Chicago.</p>
   <p>When we asked them to what was due such traditional inclination to the musical art among the people from Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato, their answer came foward immediately.</p>
   
   <p>Perhaps it is because our masses liberated themselves from the shameful oppression during that administration so immoral and corrupt which culminated with Madero's revolution, and who tried to keep the people in the most opprobrious ignorance without giving them an opportunity to education. It is well known that a cultured and educated people, well prepared for its civic functions will not tolerate oppression nor tyrannies. Thence being already away from darkness our people have endeavoured to develop its artistic faculties".</p>
   <p>Without going very far, let us briefly, mention the musical organization formed by Professor Gumaro Ortiz who with his thirty-six musicians has given very good concerts which have deserved favorable comments from the American public and foreigners as well. Gumaro Ortiz has built a musical organization that now constitutes a Band beginning with a very small group.</p>
   
   <p>So when, a few days ago we had the pleasure to attend the formal presentation of the Mexican Band of Chicago, which in doing so placed a high mark in the composition of music, we listened to a beautiful concert under the very skillful leadership of Professor Cirilo Rodriguez who recently composed the march "Captain Carranza" and added a victory to those already deservingly won. The formal presentation took place at Hull House, there, we were able to appreciate once more his artistic faculties.</p>
   <p>On that memorable night our artists executed very difficult, selections that only great professors have been able to execute. The applauses abounded in excess and to that Cirilo Rodriguez must be proud because, he has been able to climb one more step in the difficult musical art. Our astonishment, speaking therefore in accordance with the various opinions of the attending public, consisted precisely in that Maestro Rodriguez' Band is composed mostly of young people averaging 20 years of age which is a guarantee for us that our young blood is marching forward.</p>
   
   <p>Probably, the most acclaimed musician of the group was a cornet-player who is thirteen years of age. A more beautiful and deserving act cannot be found anywhere. Music, as well as many other arts is a tonic that fortifies the people, injecting the noble and positive feelings among those who cultivate it and amongst these are our young people who form the various Mexican musical organizations of Chicago and vicinities.</p>
   <p>In this populous ham city as some humorists have denominated Chicago we count with another musical organization which is the sprout of Maestro Francisco Calderon. This great group was formed in not less than three years and its results manifested; in many concerts we have been astonished for they have turned to be real musicians in spite of the fact that they are just beginners in the difficult art of music. But a misfortune made the director slacken and thereby certain economic upsets which I do not wish to mention because of respect I have for Francisco Calderon and his intelligent boys who form the Mexican band of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>It has been spoken of defalcation, a suit was filed and the logic result was the separation of the organizer who worked so hard only to see his hopes failed. Besides these bands, we have also some orchestras who are formed by Mexican elements, among them are Jose Reyes, Ignacio M. Valle, Simon Atilano and Ricardo Valle A, the last one besides being a composer, is also a good photographer. He is the author of that sentimental Waltz, Dolores Del Rio, nothing less than the name of our Lolita, honor and distinction of our country who is honoring us in a foreign land.</p>
   <p>Why should I continue mentioning further, when I already said that our colony is composed of sentimental artists? It would be useless since the whole world is perfectly informed of it.</p>
