   <p>We shall build our library. We are making some preparations in order to install our library. To that effect we have authorized Mr. Xavier Mondragon, to take complete charge of that work. At the present moment we have only a few books to begin with and a much greater effort is needed to accomplish our aim. We ask our members and friends to donate to us all the books they have no use for. In this manner we can form a library that we can be proud. Why not?</p>
