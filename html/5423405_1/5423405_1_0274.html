   <p>Mr. Olay expressed himself as follows: "I was born in Oviedo, Spain in 1893. Came to the United States when I was eleven years old. My education was only elementary. I worked in New York and in Tampa, Florida as a lecturer in the tobacco factories.</p>
   <p>"I will explain this custom to you. While the workers manufactured the cigars I read to them and informed them of current events.</p>
   <p>"I am and have been always interested in what happens around me, in other words, sociology, etc. interests me.</p>
   <p>"Some years ago I wrote a book "Recovery Through Revolution" in 1933.</p>
   <p>"In 1920 I arrived in Chicago as translator for the Export Magazine of the National Manufacturers Association.</p>
   
   <p>"This company went under during the depression of 1921 so I started my own "Bureau." At first I translated Spanish but now I translate any language because I have native translators working under me who are very capable and specialize in this work.</p>
   <p>"I lecture in Spanish affairs and labor problems. Since the Civil war in Spain I am chairman of the Committee for the Defense of Spanish Liberties, I believe in the democratic attitude of the government of Madrid and I have tried to help them with my personal contribution as a lecturer and with funds derived from our dues.</p>
   <p>"Because "Edward" loves "Wally" the newspapers are full of headlines; but it takes a Civil war to bring Spanish news to the newspapers; that will explain why I have always tried to inform my audience of what happens there."</p>
