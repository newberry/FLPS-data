   <p>Decidedly, the Mexicans who live in the United States, the young people especially are not asleep. While in an exile where some of us are of our own free will and others, for personal reasons, we live amongst people of all nations to whom, we must show that the Mexican is not what many imagine: a revolutionist, an illiterate, steeped in vice making pool rooms or so called "recreation rooms," his head quarters. Chicago and the neighboring towns contain a considerable Mexican population. There are over sixty thousand of our countrymen who came from the States of Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato.</p>
   <p>As they are the predominant element, many artists and high principles prevail. A proof of what I have said is, that the great majority of the young people who take part in the musical organizations in our colony, come from the above States. As an illustration we might refer to the Mexican Band of South Chicago, which is conducted by the able composer Professor Cirilo Rodriguez.</p>

   <p>He is a native of one of those States. His valuable and artistic work is revealed through the organization of his modest, but studious band. When we ask why the love for music should be so deeply rooted in the people of Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato, our answer is; because those people were liberated from the shameful oppression they had to endure from petty and spurious administrations as the one which culminated in the Madero's Revolution. People were then kept in the most profound ignorance and no opportunities for education were given them, For it is well known that a cultured people will exercise its civic duties and will not endure oppression or tyranny. From such an environment these people have been brought to a free country where enlightenment prevails and for that reason they are cultivating their artistic talents.</p>
   <p>In order for us not to digress too much let us briefly describe the group of musicians formed by Professor Gumaro Ortiz, who with his thirty musicians has given concerts that have been much appreciated by the American people and other nationalities as well.</p>

   <p>Gumaro Ortiz started out with a little group, A short while ago we had the pleasure of attending a performance by the Mexican Band of Chicago and we listened to the wonderful concert offered by this same group under the skillful leadership of Professor Cirilo Rodriguez.</p>
   <p>He is a genuine musician and recently composed the march "Capitan Carranza." The formal presentation took place at the Hull House of Chicago. On that memorable night the audience showed its appreciation for the work of our modest artists, who played such difficult selections as only outstanding musicians are able to perform. Our astonishment is so much the greater as the band is composed of young men of about 20 years of age. The one who probably received the greatest ovation was the little cornetist who is about 13 years of age.</p>
