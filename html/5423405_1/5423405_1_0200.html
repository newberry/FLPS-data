   <p>We announce with the greatest pleasure that Judge Nuncio J. Bonelli, at present Judge of the Probate Court, has rolled up a substantial majority over his republican opponent in the primary election last Tuesday, thereby becoming Judge of the Municipal Court. Our friend, Judge Bonelli, was warmly supported by the Spanish-American element of Cook County on account of his past kindness for different members of our various colonies. His triumph will benefit us because he is able to speak Spanish and is at the same time a friend of all those who speak this language. Thus this facilitates the handling of our cases in the court over which he will preside.</p>
   <p>El Nacional, by means of these lines, congratulates the distinguished Judge.</p>
