   <p>As we announced in our last editions the first debate of the Latin American Forum took place at the University of Chicago Settlement, Samuel Mora and Refugio Martinez having been the debaters. The subject discussed was: Patriotism. The discussion was very interesting although we lament the reduced attendance. Tomorrow at 2:00 o'clock the second debate will take place at the same location. The topic will be: "What must be the road the Mexican youth must follow in Chicago?" The debaters will be Pedro Vilches, and Jaview Paz, both of them well known in our group which makes us think that the attendance will be greater, than last Sunday.</p>
