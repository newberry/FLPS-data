   <p>The Musical Art Company, about which we have written in another issue of our paper, by its successful showing last Saturday in Indiana Harbor, has added another triumph to its long list of accomplishments.</p>
   <p>Once more the theatres of Indiana Harbor and Gary have had the pleasure of loudly applauding the artistic efforts of those who make up this most worthy company. They have won the good will of all the Latin colonies before which they have appeared.</p>
   <p>On Friday, February 15, this notable company will play at the Croatian Community Center, 9618 Commercial Ave., in So. Chicago. This showing will be a very beautiful four act drama entitled "Santa."</p>
   <p>We do not doubt that the South Chicago Colony will appreciate the opportunity to see this very worthy performance, and that it will turn out in mass to enjoy the sublime emotions of real art.</p>
