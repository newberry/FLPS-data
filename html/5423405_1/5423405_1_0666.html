   <p>Last Sunday, the Atlas Basket-Ball Team defeated the Excelsior Team by a score of 18 to 15. Although the latter is very strong our boys triumphed in a warmly contested game. The Atlas wishes that the gymnasium might be large enough to offer accommodations for the followers of both teams who want to cheer them to victory.</p>
