   <p>We have learned that a band of swindlers, is now operating here in Chicago. Everyone should be on his guard.</p>
   <p>Yesterday for instance a Mexican family became the victims of this band. They paid a large sum of money for a package that was said to contain a very valuable object, but when the package was opened, it was empty.</p>
   <p>Mexico, warns all the members of the colony, because this band shows no mercy whatever.</p>
