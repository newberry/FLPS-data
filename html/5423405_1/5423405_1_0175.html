   <p>I have ran this Billiard Parlor for the last three years. I value the business at seven hundred dollars. I pay $30.00 for the license of four pool tables. My brother and I work here "Pedro Gutierrez", half brother. We pay $60.00 a month rent and business gives us barely enough to live on. I am not married and have been 14 years in the United States, in Chicago about 9 years. I was in the State of Texas before. Since we started in business we have not had any trouble in our place.</p>
   <p>We also own this Restaurant. It is worth about four hundred dollars. We hire two helpers to run the restaurant. We pay $15.00 a year for the license. Before we entered in business,my brother and I worked for the Illinois Steel Corporation for several years. We do not belong to any society. About 40 to 50 Mexicans gather here every day. The restaurant has about 20 regular clients.</p>
