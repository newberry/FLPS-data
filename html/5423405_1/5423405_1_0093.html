   <p>Divorce is a dangerous plague of modern society. It occurs in certain nations where the principles of Christianity were eliminated from the laws that govern the people. If we are to judge the gravity of the ill by the exterior we must accept that the present generation is very much contaminated when it shows such corrupted grounds as those subsequently related to the absolution of divorce. This is the most diabolic attempted directed against the divine family institution whose tides end to be corrupted under the concealed hypothesis of reasonable motives.</p>
   <p>This is just a mask of corruption that gradually takes possession of the souls seeing in it a diffusive medium to satiate the carnal appetites. Find out and see if that is not the reality.</p>
   
   <p>Three-fourths of those soliciting divorce, are prepared to consumate incestuous (?) unions which within a short period of time reveal, if you please, the sensual thirst which drives them to destruction. But in the end, they will sink as the drug addict, into a living flame and if God does not interfere they may continue their existence in a state of constant frenzy, as those who inhabit the lowest ranks of humanity.</p>
   <p>Where are we to stop ? In a dreadful chaos. Even Russia seems to acknowledge the diaster caused by the pleasure she took in establishing the divorce law as a soviet concession. In vain has it tried to put a stop to such inconsistent wave that may drown the last vestiges of personal dignity.</p>
