   <p>The preparation for the festival of the Cruz Azul Mexicano (Mexican Blue Cross) of Chicago continues briskly. The purpose of this affair is to secure funds with which to relieve, in part, the condition of our countrymen who are in need.</p>
   <p>Mr. Velasco, director of publicity for this noble institution,has done everything possible to see that his plans are perfected, and almost every hour we see him going from place to place, arranging their most minute details.</p>
   <p>Thru these columns we send our most sincere wishes to the festival committee of the worthy Cruz Azul Mexicano, and we immediately and unconditionally place our columns at its disposal for the purpose of making public all details concerning the festival, which will be given Saturday, Dec. 13.</p>
   <p>We request, once for always, that you send us detailed information so that we may give publicity to it in our tri-weekly, so that our readers may have complete notice of the exact hour and price of admission to the hall. We hope, naturally, that the major part of our colony might make it a point to be at the great festival, as this is an effort on behalf of charity with which we all are obliged to cooperate.</p>
