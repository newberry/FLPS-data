   <p>We have the pleasure to inform the Mexican colony of Chicago that Mrs. Olga Aid, a teacher, has begun her English classes for the foreign born who may want to take advantage of this opportunity and learn the language of the country where they live. Mrs. Aid, will teach in the Boys' Club, located at 1300 Newberry Avenue, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 6:30 to 8:30 P.M. These classes are for men only. On the same days from 1:00 to 3:00 P.M. at Newberry Center 1335 Newberry Avenue classes for women will be held.</p>
   <p>We are, no doubt, being convinced of the necessity of speaking the lanuage of the country we are living in. Thus we believe that Mrs. Aid's classes will be fully attended by the members of our colony since the place of teaching is located in a center densely inhabited by our nationals.</p>
