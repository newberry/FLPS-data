   <p>I have been in business since June 1935. My wife attends to it. We pay fifteen dollars for the license and twenty-five dollars rent. We live upstairs. Some times my wife hires a lady to help her in the kitchen. The business is not so profitable. We have 3 children and need little help in order to get along better financially. I have been in Chicago since April 1923, and have worked since that time for the Illinois Steel Co. I do not belong to any society, but I do belong to a Union.</p>
