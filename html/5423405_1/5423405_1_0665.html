   <p>This recently reorganized Mexican Base-Ball Team will meet the Azectecas Nine, Sunday, May 22. The game will be played in Washington Park at 3 P. M. It is our hope that the new team will display the same determination and ability to win as has been characteristic of other teams so well known to the Colony.</p>
   <p>The engagement will be the first for the Mexican this season. As a matter of fact, this game will be the first for the Club in more than two years, the activities of the Team having been suspended for the last two seasons. The manager of the team hopes to strengthen it with new players who will arrive in the city this month.</p>
   <p>We do not believe it opportune to mention the names of the players at this time, but we will be pleased to do so when they arrive in this City.</p>
