   <p>The Spanish representatives at the opening of the Chicago Worlds Fair, although a small group, made a great showing.</p>
   <p>The Spanish group consisted only of some sixteen pairs of the most select of the Spanish colony, who were richly dressed. Their costumes were typically Spanish. The group was warmly received by the officials and by the public, in spite of its modest showing. They were particularly distinguished by the genuine Manilian cloaks and the native Cordovian hats which they so graciously wore. This Spanish unit was the admiration of the multitude which was gathered on the shores of the Great Lake. Its main purpose was to represent the young Republic of Mexico and in its name to pay a tribute of admiration to this great metropolis for the gigantic work which it had completed in so short a time.</p>
