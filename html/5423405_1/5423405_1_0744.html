   <p>The Bazaar given by the Cruz Azul Mexicana of Chicago last Saturday was attended by a large number of people. Members of the Mexican colony contributed with their presence, and many gentlemen and young ladies were in charge of the various stands which gave color to the festival. The entertainers guided by a pure humanitarian and patriotic sentiment, discharged their duties marvelously. It can truly be said that this was the greatest Mexican festival that the colony of Chicago ever witnessed. For this reason, we wish very warmly to congratulate the Cruz Azul Mexicana, especially the Festivity Director, Mrs. Milla Dominguez.</p>
