   <p>The most outstanding note of the day, at least for us who speak Spanish and live in Chicago, is the drama and dance announced by the Sociedad Espanola. The performance will take place Saturday, May 18, at the West Side Auditorium, Racine and Taylor Streets. It will consist of a play after which a dance will follow. The drama "Tierra Baja," by D. Angel Guimera', will be presented on the stage. The performance will begin at 8 P.M.; admission prices will be 75 cents for men and 50 cents for women. In view of the good organization of this program and the enthusiasm existing among the youth, it is expected that the Sociedad Espanola will see their efforts crowned by a big success.</p>
