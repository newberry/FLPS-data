   <p>The Mexican youngmen Ricardo Ocana, E. Berlanga, and Alejandro Baldereama, arrived from Mexico last week to attend Northwestern University.</p>
   <p>These students are friends of Mr. Francisco Pedroza, well known dealer in this city, who introduced them to us.</p>
   <p>We give them our welcome.</p>
