   <p>In our last edition, because of lack of information, we were not able to give any details about Bartolo Guerra who was found guilty and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for the murder of his countryman Angel Sandoval.</p>
   <p>The crime was committed at 10 p.m. on the night of September 27, 1927, at an Illinois Central Railroad camp. The assassin who was intoxicated seized a heavy piece of stove iron with which he knocked his companion down after which he beat him to death.</p>
   <p>The superintendent of the place where Guerra was employed informed the police authorities that the crime was without any justification.</p>
   <p>Guerra evaded the police authorities for two years when he was apprehended and brought to trial. He was defended free of charge by Mr. Sebastian Rivera, who was able to save Guerra from the electric chair.</p>

   <p>We congratulate Mr. Rivera, this young lawyer who wished to save a life but wanted also to see justice done.</p>
