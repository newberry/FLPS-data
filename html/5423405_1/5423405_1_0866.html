   <p>Jose Portuguese, 18 years of age and a high school student of the city, was accused of the murder of his sister, Maria, 22 years of age, when he was brought before Judge Francis Allegretti, of the Juvenile Court, who continued the case until the 4th of next month.</p>
   <p>Miss Portuguese was found dying in her bed last Tuesday, with a pistol bullet in her head. Near her was found an unloaded pistol. Investigation by Sergeant Edward Balata, from the Maxwell Police Station, was a basis for his saying that the case had all the earmarks of murder, and not suicide. He found, as evidence of his contention, on the floor of the room the shell of a discharged bullet.</p>
   <p>The accused declared that he had come upon his sister the moment she committed the act; that at this time he rushed towards her in an effort to take the weapon away from her. Later Jose Portuguese confessed to have been the one who inflicted the wounds which the head of his sister gave evidence of. This confession he now openly denies, holding out that the police forced him to confess.</p>
