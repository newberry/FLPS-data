   <p>Sporting events of the Cuauhtemoc Athletic Club for Jan. 6, 1934. The senior Mexican sporting clubs of Chicago, and the Athletic Cuauhtemoc Club are preparing a festival which will be an outstanding event in 1934. The program that has been formulated by the Cuauhtemoc, will consist of Basket Ball games in which the groups Hidalgo, Mayas, Necaxa and Cuauhtemoc will participate on Jan. 6, at the Hull House. After the sporting event has terminated, a sumptuous dance will begin in which the orchestra "Los Aztecac"will render an agreeable enjoyment with their latest repertory. It is hoped that the games will turn out to be very skilled, since the players have been taken such intense preparation. As far as we know, all the young people who compose these teams are of the best we have in the locality. We can no less feel happy for having among the Mexican Youth of Chicago, such splendid elements that devote themselves to sports.</p>

   <p>It makes little or no difference what kind of sports one may follow, just as long as it is sport. We would like to see all the Mexican youth of Chicago to practice some kind of a sport, so that their mind and body would keep healthy and be a pride to our country.</p>
   <p>According to the statistic data from the Health Department of Chicago, many young Mexicans, who are well known in the colony, have been forced to a confinement in the Tubercular Sanatorium of Chicago. For this reason we exceedingly recommend to the Mexican youth of Chicago, not to pass inadvertently this opportunity, for there are many benefits to be gained if only one hour can be spent daily in sports.</p>
   <p>The Cuauhtemoc Athletic Club extends a cordial invitation to all the Mexican young people who may wish to join and help to build the great family of Mexican sports in Chicago. The membership fee is only fifty cents per month and you have the right to use the gymnasium, to use the bath house every day and to take part in all the sporting events during the year of 1934. Our Club expects you to take advantage of this opportunity and become a member.</p>
