   <p>The Vocalion records are made through the process of electricity. Their sound is plain and strong. You may order them directly from the Arte Mexicano for the price of 75c each. We send orders to all parts of the United States to be paid when you receive them, that is, C. O. D. We do not charge for transportation. We only accept orders of three records or more. Send for our Vocalion Catalogue free of charge. El Arte Mexicano is the only real Mexican House of Music in Chicago.</p>
