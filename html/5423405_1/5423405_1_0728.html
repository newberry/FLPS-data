   <p>La Cruz Azul Mexicana (Mexican Blue Cross), indefatigable in its efforts to aid and protect the poor of our colony, has arranged a great festival for Sunday, May 4. This affair will be held at the Ashland Boulevard Auditorium. It has two purposes: to pay homage to the glorious date, May Fifth, and at the same time to raise funds with which to aid the poor.</p>
