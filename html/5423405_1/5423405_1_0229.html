   <p>The campaign which is conducted every year in this city, by the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute is now in progress. The purpose of this campaign is to collect funds to aid the unfortunate people who are suffering with this terrible sickness. We urge you to buy "Christmas Seals", and in this manner you will be helping to combat the disastrous effects of a plague which is causing so many deaths every year.</p>
