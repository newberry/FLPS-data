   <p>Jose Alvarez and Mira Soriano are presenting a program of Spanish dances at the Haven School, Evanston, Monday evening, April 23, at 8:30 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Spain's concert dancers will appear in a program of Spanish dances.</p>
   <p>As the chorographic map of the peninsula is particularly diversified, each province and each town has its own ancestral tradition of the dance, such as the picturesque gypsy dance and the joy of the Aragones Iota.</p>
   <p>The further the dancers go, the more their manner divests itself of all that is accessory and tends towards the pure dance.</p>
   <p>It is not always realized by the critic that Spanish dancing has two distinct types and that, although there are dances embodying elements of both styles, the two differ sharply not only in character but in technique as well.</p>
