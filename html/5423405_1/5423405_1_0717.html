   <p>The situation is becoming more and more serious for those Mexicans who are without employment in the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A great number of families are in great distress and without hope that their suffering will be relieved. A great number of Mexican children who have been living on the charity of their neighbors are now confronted with the coming cold weather, which has already begun to play havoc among those children who suffer from lack of food and clothing.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to assist any family which finds itself in such straitened circumstances. We cannot remain deaf to the cries of anguish from the mothers who ask for bread and for protection against the rigors of the winter.</p>
   <p>We must be a Good Samaritan for one or more distressed families. We must contribute liberally to aid at least one poor Mexican family. If it is not possible for us to give money let us get clothes from our friends.</p>
