   <p>Three of our countrymen are being held in the Cook County Jail, accused of having killed a policeman. They are Maximo Garcia, Alfonso Reyes, and Jose Garcia, who, frightened by the presence of a policeman who wanted to interrogate them killed him, believing he was a robber. Mrs. Regina Villarreal, 3040 E. 92nd., Street, South Chicago, writes us to the effect that we call upon the Mexican colony for assistance, since the accused have no funds to defend themselves of the serious charges brought upon them. Mere is the letter:</p>
   <p>South Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>February 16, 1930</p>
   <p>Editor of Mexico</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>My Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Allow me to inform you, and all the Mexicans scattered in the city of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Chicago and vicinity that I wish to call upon all my countrymen to contribute with a small amount of money for the defense of our countrymen, Maximo Garcia, Jose Garcia, and Alfonso Reyes, who are held in the Cook County Jail of Chicago for the crime of taking the life of a policeman of this locality, on the night of Jan. 17 last. The gentlemen already mentioned are good working men and never had any trouble up to the day of the occurrence. They do not have an attorney because of lack of money and I hope that all the Mexicans will cooperate with me in order to save them from the gallows. I shall ask the Supreme Being, that all of us make an effort in defense of these honest workers. Your contributions may be sent to the newspaper "Mexico," the spokesman of the colony in Chicago. Said funds will be placed in the hands of a prominent attorney, who will be in charge of the defense. For the time being, Mr. Mike Caras, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>855 Buffalo Ave., is the person collecting funds in South Chicago and surroundings. I beg you to take an interest in the matter. The case comes up for trial on March 10th, and the effort must be made now or never. Without any further business, I remain with respect and consideration,</p>
   <p>Your sincere servant,</p>
   <p>Delfina Villarreal</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Those persons who wish to contribute with their donations to the defense of these compatriots, must send the same to the newspaper "Mexico," 121<span class="gap">[gap]</span>West Madison Street. The names of those sending a contribution, together with the amounts thereof, will be published in this paper. The funds collected will be paid to a prominent attorney, as suggested by Mrs. Delfina Villarreal, so that he can take charge of the defense.</p>
