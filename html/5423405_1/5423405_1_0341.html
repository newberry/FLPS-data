   <p>Today we give this whole page to the presentation of portraits of a group of eloquent and well known Mexican artists of our colony. These artists are the ones who have given an admirable interpretation of our theatre and who have not curtailed their efforts to entertain us constructively by means of the stage and the radio.</p>
   <p>All honest effort is worthy of praise and applause, and because of this, apart from their meritorious work, they have been well received by the public.</p>
   <p>The Mexican colony of Chicago feel proud of having in its midst artists of such standing. The central and populous city of the Middlewest has come to be the Mecca of lovers of art who, as in the endless Odyssey, come and go in search of an understanding and appreciation of its wonders.</p>
   <p>They come and go like the swallow, but always return to our midst, because the Chicago Mexican colony is enthusiastic about it and lends its support to the national art.</p>
   
   <p>Every week, either at the theatre or over the radio, our artistic talent exhibit their ability, thus doing honor to Motherland.</p>
   <p>The names of the artists follow: Ana Maria Gonzalez, Miss Esther Gonzalez Lavalle, Florence Joyce, Enrique Islas, Paco Perafan, Silvano R. Ramos, Antonio Lopez Chavez, Linda Rodriguez, and the De la Vega Sisters.</p>
