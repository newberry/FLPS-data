   <p>The Banquet and Dance given last Thursday night in honor of Miss Dora Goff was a complete success. The Atlas Feminine Club, of which Miss Goff is secretary, gave the affair as a celebration of her graduation with honors from high school.</p>
   <p>The popular Atlas Orchestra added a pleasing effect to the function which was enjoyed by all of those who attended.</p>
   <p>We extend our good wishes to gentle Dora.</p>
