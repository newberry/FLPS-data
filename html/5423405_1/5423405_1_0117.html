   <p>On Sunday, February 7, will take place the solemn dedication of the precious Altar of Our Lady of Guadalupe in her sanctuary in South Chicago. All those who may wish to be god-fathers may have the privilege to have their names engraved on a golden placard to be placed in the interior of the Tabernacle. This is one of the utmost privileges because the name will be continually read by Jesus who is confined in the sacred Eucharist.</p>
   <p>The dedication will take place on the day above mentioned at 7:00 P. M. Anyone wishing to become god-father kindly inform the head Rector priest R. P. A. Catalina, C. M. F. We invite all our readers to witness this solemn act and to attend promptly in order to obtain the complete solemnity of our Celebration.</p>
