   <p>Lovers of the Spanish theatre living in this city are delighted to know that the much announced operetta "Marina" will take place tonight. The promoters have overlooked nothing in an effort to present something entirely new. It is said that this is the first time there will be staged in Chicago a play in Spanish by actors of our race.</p>
   <p>The play is none other than the monumental operetta "Marina," by the composer Emilio Arrieta. This is an effort worthy of sincere praise by all of us who proudly carry racial identity with our Mother Spain. A group of artists with indefatigable purpose are the promoters of this theatrical event, and they are hoping that out of their movement the Spanish theatre will become a reality. There has already been comment upon this proposition, since there is a tendency towards converting this desire into a beautiful accomplishment, - into a tangible fact.</p>
   <p>Without any doubt, the population here is sufficiently adequate to maintain, with profit, this desirable theatre. What is needed is an optimist to initiate the undertaking, and it will be seen that the result will be equal to his efforts.</p>
