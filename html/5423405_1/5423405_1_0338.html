   <p>The Spanish Festival recently celebrated in the Maryland Hotel, which was organized by a group of students of languages, customs and Spanish art under the direction of Mrs. Barr and Dolores Garcia, was a complete success. It gave the anticipated results in regards to the attendance and the artistic element who took part in the program as well. The entire second floor of the Maryland Hotel was artistically decorated for the occasion.</p>
   <p>Among the many attendants we were able to take note of the following: The Hon. Charles Peterson, vice-president of the World's Fair, Jose Alba Cejudo and Jose Puente from the Mexican Consulate, F. Brille, B. D. Taylor, Edelmiro Rodriguez, Jose Gonzalez Perez, and A. Smith. There were some representatives from schools of Chicago such as Miss Anna Schueler, teacher of <span class="page-break">2</span>Spanish in the Lewis Institute, Miss Margaret Huling, Rose Miller, June Heintz and Ruth Hettinger.</p>
   <p>In representation of the great local industries; there were, Mr. J. Jayme, Mr. P. Jondeyek, Mr. and Mrs. G. Ahresnburg from the Foreign Department of General Electric. Likewise, it is worth mentioning Mrs. Estelle Coffey and her daughter, and Mr. R. Davenport and many others we could add to the great number of personalities that we cannot mention due to a lack of space.</p>
   <p>The dinner was typically Mexican and Spanish supplemented with Mexican beer, from Orizaba, which was one of the principal delights of the participants. It was prepared recently and one could notice that every person there present rendered good judgement. There were some exhibitions which were presented by the Hull House, under the direction of Miss French of the Art Institute, and also some Mexican products in charge of La Perla Stove of <span class="page-break">3</span>Chicago. The "Clarita School" of dancing was also well represented by its most advanced pupils. This reunion was the first of its kind to be effected with the purpose of bringing together the Spanish speaking who have eagerly cooperated toward the unity and understanding of the Mexican and American people.</p>
