   <p>The concert which Mrs. Milla Dominguez gave at the Civic Theatre, has again endeared to us an outstanding soprano and a great singer. Her voice was clear and gave evidence of the best talent and training.</p>
   <p>The Civic Theatre, subsidiary of the Chicago Civic Opera, was a beautiful sight. All seats were occupied by the elite of American and Latin-American society. Among those were the Consular bodies and outstanding Latin-American and American business men.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dominguez gave special attention to the make up of the program. It was composed of three parts: the first consisted of Spanish songs among which we mention especially "La Gitana" and the operatic aria "La Vida Breve". Mrs. Dominguez was called to sing several encores.</p>

   <p>The second part was made up of a group of Mexican song classics. The third group was Mexican folk songs. In connection with the last group we should like to make special mention of one number. It was our beautiful song "Estrellita" which Mrs. Dominguez is a genuine interpreter, and who sang it as we have never heard it sung before.</p>
   <p>The dancing was done by Clarita Martin and was splendid. In fact after seeing this gentle and beautiful American dancer it is hard to believe that she is not a daughter of old Andalusia.</p>
