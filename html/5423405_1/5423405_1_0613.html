   <p>Tomorrow at 3:00 o'clock the third debate will take place at the Hull House. The Topic to be discussed is: "Which way the Mexican Workers must follow". Mr. Armand Almonte, and Nicolas M. Hermandez are the debaters, and due to the increasing enthusiasm to hear the polemic the tomorrow's crowd will be larger than the first two since it is of great interest to the Mexican workers.</p>
