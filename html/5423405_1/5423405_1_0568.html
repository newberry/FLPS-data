   <p>A very important announcement for the Mexican colony is that the popular Spanish enterprise of New York, Nomarzza-Puerta and Company, is now making plans to provide moving picture entertainment for us. They have informed us that they are at present taking the necessary steps to secure a suitable place to exhibit eight Spanish and Mexican films.</p>
   <p>Among these "Mancha que Limpia", starring Joseph Crespo, Aurora Redendo and Carmen Viance: "Rosario La Cortijera" and others which we cannot mention because of lack of space. The pictures will be shown by powerful modern projecting apparatus.</p>
