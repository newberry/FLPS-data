   <p>With great success the popular dinner was effected. Amongst the enormous enthusiasm and comradeship we celebrated our first "Popular Dinner" on August 11, at the Puerto de Veracruz Restaurant. We began at 8:45 P. M. at which time most of the guests had arrived. During their arrival an increase in traffic was noticed. At the hour here indicated, a few moments before the plates began to be served, the writer of these lines made the presentation of the Mexican Consul Senor Carlos Palacios Roji, the Vice-Consul Senor Tomas Morlet, Prof. F. Ortiga Rodriguez, and other gentlemen who were specially invited to this popular dinner. Having no other object in mind except to bring together periodically the representative elements of our colony and to bring closer relations of friendship and nationalism which must necessarily be impulsed in the Mexican family outside of Mexico.</p>

   <p>The next dinner will be held during the last week of September and is dedicated to the Mexican Societies of Chicago, each group must send at least three delegates. We are making preparations to that extent and will send the invitations on time. We beg all our friends to pardon us for not sending them invitations, but it was due to the limited capacity of the place where the dinner was to be served. From Indiana Harbor we received several letters from some of our country-men who wanted to come to our dinner, but unfortunately could not attend due to brevity of time.</p>
