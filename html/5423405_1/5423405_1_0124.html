   <p>Nicolas Gonzalez and Pedro Pena, well known young men in the Torrence suburb, were assulted last Wednesday, April 25th, at about 7:30 P. M., in front of Mr. Hernandez' store at 108th Street and Torrence Avenue, by two European drunkards, who insulted everybody without consideration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gonzalez was thrown against a window of Mr. Hernandez' store, and miraculously was uninjured, because the glass broke.</p>
   <p>One of the two drunkards was seized and perhaps he will pay for the broken glass. This vagrant was fined $5.00. The offenders were summoned April 26th at 9.00 P. M.</p>
   <p>Among the Mexican residents in South Deering there is some uneasiness, because there is an atmosphere of ill will against the Mexicans. The Mexican people must be prudent and present their complaints to the authorities, in order to avoid more trouble.</p>
