   <p>The Miguel Hidalgo Y. Costilla, and Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez societies are preparing to give a dinner and dance. In honor to the Mexican artists who assisted these societies in the presentation of the program on Labor Day, September 7, at the Soldiers Field. This event will take place at the West End Women's Club, 37 South Ashland Boulevard. In the same building, but in a different hall, the dance will begin at 8:00 P.M. and will continue until 1:00 A.M. The price of the tickets for the dinner must be gotten before December 9, 1936. Those wishing to attend the dance can get their tickets at the entrance. There will be restaurant services, where a variety of Mexican dishes will be served at moderate prices. We shall also have an excellent service at the bar.
