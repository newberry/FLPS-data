   <p>Herbert Hoover's accession to the Presidency according to the press, will herald a period of prosperity. It is forecast that the delicate problem of giving employment to those who actually need it will be relatively easy. This notice is of paramount importance to those who day after day, week after week, go from place to place in search of employment.</p>
   <p>The problem of finding work is to-day a most ungrateful task for those millions of foreigners who live in the United States. Thousands have come to this country in the belief that here it was only necessary to stoop in order to obtain money. Contact with reality has been disastrous for them.</p>
   <p>During the last few years the number of people unemployed has increased considerably. Only the most skilled and able people have succeeded in finding work, and this not without much difficulty. The weak and old persons find no employment. They walk the streets in search of employment that they cannot obtain in the shops.</p>
   
   <p>In this city, for example, there is a multitude of men whose sole occupation is to walk the streets from day to day waiting for the uncertain time when some one might give them a nickel with which to buy a cup of coffee. These men, in the majority of cases, are good workers and they are tired of being told by the superintendents of factories "no jobs today".</p>
   <p>Chicago, because of this state of things, is famous for its crimes. And in the principal cities of the United States the same situation prevails. One robbery succeeds another and the exploitation of the poor and weak continues on a large scale with no apparent move being made to remedy the situation.</p>
   <p>If Hoover has the power to eliminate this suffering, his accession to the Presidency will be a blessing for our countrymen who have come here to barter their labor for an honest living.</p>
