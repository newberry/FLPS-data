   <p>Dr. Eluid Garcia Travino, who had charge of the Monday Clinic, serving especially the Mexican Colony, at Washington Park Hospital, has just informed us that he has resigned as head of the Clinic. At the same time he notified us in his courteous note that he had changed his consulting hours at his private office, located at 6306 Cottage Grove Avenue. Because of this he will be able to give two hours in the morning, from 10 to 12 to Popular Consultations for the benefit of those sick people who formerly went to the Clinic and for those from the Mexican Colony.</p>
   <p>Hereafter, consulting hours will be from 10 to 12 A.M., and from 4 to 7 P.M., except on Sundays and holidays.</p>
