   <p>Extract: When we started our publication, we intended to gather data in regard to the exact Mexican Population, and other Spanish speaking people residing in Chicago, and the Middle west. This has not been possible so far. We have consulted various agencies and the information obtained from them differs considerably.</p>
   <p>Not being satisfied with the figures obtained, we now wish to ask every Spanish speaking person in Chicago and vicinity to fill out the coupon which from now on will appear in all the issues of our newspaper. We wish to render good service to the people. We want them to know us better, and make La Defensa "your paper".</p>
   <p>During the time our paper has been in existence we have found employment for some workers, and not long ago we were asked to furnish 25 laborers for a concern, but we could only send 8 and from those 8 men, just one did not qualify for the job. For this, and many reasons, we insist in your cooperation so we may be able to give better service to the people.</p>
