   <p>In our introduction, we claimed to have accomplished our purpose. We established classes for children, and at the present moment forty-five Mexican boys and girls attend these classes. Our aim is sincere and we hope it will meet with the approval and cooperation of the Mexican people. Mexican children or those from Spanish-American descent may enroll for these classes. The following subjects are taught, Spanish, Geography, and Mexican History. It would be useless to teach these little ones anything else since they are also attending Public or Parochial Schools.</p>
   <p>We have appointed Mr. J. Xavier Mondragon, a well known editor as the official instructor. Mr. Mondragon, is also an honorary member of the Alianza Fraternal Mexicana. The classes take place in our hall 1550 W. Roosevelt Rd., every Thursday from 7 to 9 P. M. Only children from nine to fifteen years of age will be admitted. Under no circumstance shall we permit our children to forget our language. Through this work we can say, we are constructing a country. Books are loaned to the students, or can be bought for twenty-five cents a copy.</p>
