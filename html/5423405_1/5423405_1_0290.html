   <p>J. Velasguez Arteaga is a laborious worker who embodies the prototype of the race imagination and will-power. By employing his time on ingenius craft, he has found the solution to unemployment. The Tribune Tower, that superb architectonic structure which rises high on Michigan Avenue, has been reproduced in miniature. It is made of feather-grass, and cuts of walnut beautifully carved. Velasguez, with studious and intelligent eye reproduced even the most insignificant details. The first floor with its luxurious entrance, itsdepartments and the articles there on, are made of carved wood, as well as the fifty or more stories including the 'cupola' of the edifice which were minutely depicted in the tiny replica from the multi-facetious imagination of this ingenious Mexican. Now he is planning to go out and sell more than twenty dramatic and comedy plays for motion picture purposes.</p>

   <p>Three months ago the crisis deprived him of the means to earn his daily bread for him and his family. It was then that he began his masterpiece, unprovided and without any previous experience on craftsmanship, without any aid but his calm persistence. He worked for twelve hours every day, having at his command the most rudimentary implements which consisted of kitchen-knives, razor-blades, wires, files and scissors etc. In this manner and under such circumstances J. Velasguez Arteaga has accomplished many interesting pieces of valuable art.</p>
