   <p>The Halsted theatre, 330 S. Halsted St., for some time has been a meeting place for our youth, because of its "Talking Pictures." They announced for an early date, perhaps next week, the exhibition of "Romance del Rio Grande," a picture that has many parts spoken in Spanish. This theatre specializes in films that the Mexicans like, and this is the reason why it is patronized by them.</p>
