   <p>The young people of our society gave a very lively party at the elegant residence of Mr. Salvador Esteiro, an outstanding business man, who in this manner celebrated his birthday.</p>
   <p>At the pleasing reunion at which they danced and played, many of his close friends were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Esteiro, who is well liked in the Latin-American colony, and especially by the Mexicans, was taken by surprise. The reunion was a social event, for this reason we have reviewed it.</p>
   <p>We are adding to the many greetings which he received on this day, our sincere wishes.</p>
