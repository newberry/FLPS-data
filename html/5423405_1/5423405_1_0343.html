   <p>Our Editorial Department has received a leaflet which presents the good news announcing a fine artistic presentation by our dear much applauded artist, Paco Perafan, which will take place at the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel, in the heart of the city.</p>
   <p>According to the information on hand, the program will consist of a Spanish-Mexican Nite staged with the quality Paco is accustomed to. The program contains our best artistic talent, such as the Misses Herlinda and Maria de la Vega, Esther Gonzalez LaValle, Florencia Joyce, Linda Rodriguez, Victoria Griffith, Lupe Plaza, Lola Maria Santro and Victoria Rodriguez, as well as the distinguished singers, Enrique Islas, Pedro Espino, Silvano Ramos and the famous orchestra of Antonio Arroyo and his "Jazz Tigers."</p>
   <p>The applauded pianist, Francisco Bustamante, will be in charge of one of the principal numbers in the program with the debut of one of his recent compositions, a Mexican Rhapsody. Because of the whole artistic composition and wise direction of the spectacle, we dare to predict a real victory for the elegant artist, Paco Perafan, and for all his collaborators.</p>
