   <p>The men living here have professions or are employed as clerks in the export departments of Montgomery Ward and Company, Walter Field Company, Bauer &amp; Black, Pepsodent, Wrigley, Hibbard-Spencer-Bartlett Company, or A. Stein Company. According to the estimate of the Mexican Consul's office there are more than four hundred young Mexicans employed as clerks and office assistants with Chicago firms. There is also a class of skilled or Semiskilled workmen employed in the Stewart Electric, the International Harvester Company, the Victor X-Ray Corporation, and the Western Electric Company. There are two Mexican cartoonists on the staff of the Daily News. There are about ten Mexican doctors and dentists practicing in Chicago. There is a Mexican teaching Spanish in Crane College.</p>

   <p>EMPLOYMENT</p>
   <p>With reference to employment it should be said that a great many of the Mexicans who live near Hull-House are recent arrivals and are out of work except at the best season of employment. Many of the Mexican families go to the beet fields of Michigan and Minnesota, and instead of returning to their southern homes at the close of the season, come to Chicago. They seldom have enough for a period of idleness, and work is always scarce in the winter. The first winter here is a hard one.Those already established lend a neighborly hand and do all they can to alleviate the suffering. The cold weather adds to the suffering for the supply of clothing, bedding, and furniture is very meager. The Mexican Consul tried to prevent this suffering during the winter by inserting a notice in the chief Mexican papers warning the people not to come to Chicago in the winter expecting to get work. Many, however, did not see this notice.</p>

   <p>Most of those who have work are at the Illinois Central Freight house, the beading factories on Roosevelt Road, at the Cracker Jack factory, other candy factories, and at the hotels in the Loop. All this work is irregular, and during periods of depression, many of the Mexicans lose their places.</p>
   <p>The Mexicans are establishing accounts at various banks. The Mexicans in the Hull-House neighborhood particularly favor the Atlas State Bank, which opened a Spanish department in October, 1927, with a Mexican from Michoacan in charge. He reports about 600 Mexican depositors, most of whom have savings accounts, and about 400 other Mexican customers who come largely to buy New York drafts to send to Mexico. Depositors are given this service free, but others pay the usual fee for the drafts, and the bank furnishes addressed envelopes in which the drafts may be mailed.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>An employee of the bank reported that one Mexican family returned from the Michigan beet fields last winter and made a deposit of $800, the amount that the mother, father, and three children cleared by their summer's work. This is believed to be the largest Mexican deposit, for generally the savings from the beet work are much less; but average amount of these bank accounts is $600. In another Halsted Street bank there is no Spanish department, and the officers do not think that the Mexican business is sufficient to warrant the establishment of one, but there are several Mexicans in the Christmas Club of this bank. They report several Mexican depositors with balances building accounts, but the great number of their Mexican depositors do not build balances.They sell New York drafts to Mexicans, charging the usual fees. Still another bank on Halsted Street has in charge of its Spanish department a man who came from Argentina two years ago, having been educated in Spanish in the schools of Buenos Aires.</p>

   <p>This bank states that the number of Mexican, accounts reaches eighty during the summer. Many of the Mexican depositors in this bank live in box cars on railroad sidings. These box cars are moved about as work demands; the Mexicans, therefore, have no permanent mail addresses. The bank has established the custom of supplying their customers with envelopes addressed to the bank. The Mexicans write their names on these envelopes and inclosed them when writing to their families and friends in Mexico. These letters are then held at the bank until called for by their owners.</p>
   <p>As to the relations of the Mexicans to business enterprises, it may be noted that there are near Hull-House fourteen restaurants, five pool halls, five grocery stores, one barber-shop, one shoemaker, four bakeries, one meat market, one print shop, two sign painter shops, one photograph gallery, one tailor shop, and one music shop, owned and operated by Mexicans.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>These are all on a small scale. The other neighborhoods have similar business enterprises, but not so numerous as in the Hull-House neighborhoods. South Chicago adds a drug store to the list of business activities.</p>
   <p>In the University of Chicago Settlement district the railroads and Packing Companies furnish work for the Mexicans. When any of these industries reduces labor, it is the Mexican who suffers most. They are the last to arrive and the first to be laid off. The Mexicans who have been here more than one winter have learned to save money for the slack time. The Peoples Stockyards Bank reported more than 1,000 Mexican depositors; and the bank across the street, the Depositors State Bank, reported 150 Mexican depositors. The packing companies hire their own men, as do most of the railroads in the neighborhood.</p>

   <p>There were formerly two labor agencies on Halsted Street, but both went out of business during the industrial depression of the winter of 1928. The South Chicago Mexicans are largely employed by the steel mills. Each mill has its own employment office. Men are employed and given work numbers. The Mexicans have a custom of selling or lending these numbers to other Mexicans when they wish to leave the work. Sometimes they sell the numbers outright, and again they charge a fee for their use while the rightful owner makes a trip to Mexico or tries his luck in other employment. The foremen do not seem to be aware of this practice. Perhaps all the Mexicans look alike to them. When it is necessary to check on the Mexican's work record, his assumed name must be known. When the Mexicans get into trouble, they give the names under which they are employed, and not their own names.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The hours of work in the steel mills are as follows. In the Illinois Steel Mill, laborers work from seven in the morning to five thirty in the afternoon; others work from eleven at night to seven the next morning, seven in the Morning to three in the afternoon, and three in the afternoon to eleven at night. In the Wisconsin Steel Mills all men work eight hours per day. Their shifts are from 2; P. M. to 10: P. M.; 10:P. M. to 6:A.M. and 6: A.M. to 2:P.M. Wages of the Mexicans in the steel industries vary from 42 1/2 cents per hour for a ten-hour day for common laborers to 54 cents per hour for an eight-hour day with a Saturday half-holiday received by molders. When the mills lay off for long periods the men generally ship out for somewhere else. A few who have families provide for unemployment, by saving during employment. Generally the men do not bring their families until they have a regular job.</p>

   <p>The Illinois Steel Mills have what is known as a Good Fellows' Club. The employees pay a small weekly fee which entitles them to borrow money from the club, or to be taken care of in case of necessity. All employees are of course protected by the Workmen's Compensation Act. The Company also fosters a group insurance policy whereby the employees receive a death benefit by the payment of a small weekly premium.</p>
   <p>SCHOOLS AND RECREATIONS</p>
   <p>Reference has already been made to the schools attended by Mexican children, and Table I shows the enrollment of some of the Mexican children in the schools by grades. Not all the schools report their Mexican enrollment by grades, and the table serves only as a general indication of the grade distributing.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Table I shows the locations of the schools enrolling Mexican children and the number of Mexican children enrolled in each. The large number of children in the first grade shows, as has been stated before, that many of the families have only young children and that many others are just beginning their study of English. It is generally the single men or families with one or two children who come to Illinois. The number in the open-window-rooms is possible indication of the poor economic status of the Mexican families here. When pay is low, work irregular, and living quarters poor and crowded with little or no sunshine, it follows that the children's physical condition will suffer. The number of Mexican children in the eighth grade seems quite creditable, since most of these children are well beyond the compulsory educational law requirements as to age, and the economic conditions of many of the families is such that it is a real sacrifice to keep the children in school rather than to allow them to take jobs.</p>

   <p>The number enrolled in Catholic schools is 162, or 9.8 percent of the total enrollment in elementary schools. While the school enrollment shows concentration in the Hull-House, the University of Chicago Settlement and the South Chicago neighborhoods, it is interesting to note that the families are moving west and north into better houses and more desirable neighborhoods. They are in fact found as far north as the three thousand block on Seminary and as far west as Trumbull Avenue.</p>
   <p>Recreation in the Hull-House neighborhood is limited almost entirely to that provided by Hull-House and the Fireman House Settlement.</p>
