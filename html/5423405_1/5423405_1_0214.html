   <p>The popular vote, powerful weapon of free people, redeemed Chicago, last Tuesday from one of the worst administrations which the great City of the Middle West has had since the time of its founding.</p>
   <p>The election of Anton J. Cermak as mayor of the city assures us an adminisstration which will guard the interests of the people and make war on the wretched criminal organizations which, being entangled with politics, have terrified us during the past four years of Thompsonism.</p>
   <p>This newspaper, whose impartial and news policy prevents it from giving opinions and making commentaries on municipal and federal government affairs, other than those of an informative character, feels that the ascension of Anton J. Cermak to the post of Mayor of this city is an advantage for both the people and their city.</p>

   <p>We expect improvements in the general welfare of the honest working citizen, our children and their care in public places and the community as a whole.</p>
   <p>Upon taking office, Mayor Cermak will come face to face with the most trying and difficult problems of his administration; namely: cleaning the city of its criminal elements.</p>
   <p>According to his promisses, as soon as he takes the oath of office the work of bringing the city back to order will begin. This will be done by setting up a completely new working organization which will be fearless in carrying out his policies for the city's betterment.</p>
