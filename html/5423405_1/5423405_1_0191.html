   <p>The Illinois Central Railroad announced yesterday that it has given orders to employ 1500 day laborers who will be used in repairing its track-lines. These will be in addition to the 1100 Maintenance of way men who have been working only three days per week up to this time, and who will now work full time. By this order 2600 men will be affected. This order which goes into effect immediately, covering as it does the entire system of the company, means that more than 300 men in the Chicago area will receive employment.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the order is to double the Maintenance of way force in May as compared with that working in the month of April which has just passed.</p>
   <p>Ninety-nine percent of the day laborers employed by this Railroad Company are of Mexican nationality, therefore this announced plan will benefit many of our countrymen who are now actually without work.</p>
