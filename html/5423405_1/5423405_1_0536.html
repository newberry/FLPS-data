   <p>This is our fourth number since we have been in existence and we are very proud of it. Why not? Each one demonstrates his happiness in his own way, we celebrated it in this manner. Our cultured and estimable readers have received us with open arms, because we have come to fill a space of real necessity and because our colony depends considerably upon a paper that came to fulfill its aspirations and desires. Our patron advertisers' also congratulate us after they have become convinced of the effectiveness of their advertisements in our modest publication. We wish that under any circumstance, El Liberal besides being a tribunitial vehicle, be also of great utility to our colony. Since there has been no other Mexican publication that could really take the interest of our people serious enough, we now present a list of all the Clubs and Societies of Chicago. We hope this may serve as an effective guide to our readers. This directory we shall increase as soon as we receive the new information required.</p>
