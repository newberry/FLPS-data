   <p>Editor of "Mexico," Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>As a member of the Mexican colony of this city, and as I appreciate all those who do something in its behalf I am writing these few lines which I beg you to publish in your newspaper. This is to make known my deep gratitude to Doctor Jose Leo, who was the only doctor, capable of getting my son well. In order that all my countrymen take notice as to where they may find a doctor deserving them confidence, I take pleasure in writing this letter. This is not to benefit the man who with his wisdom saved the life of my son, but simply as a sign of my gratitude which he deserves.</p>
   <p>I beg you to accept my expression of thanks for publishing this letter, and I shall remain,</p>
   <p>Yours faithfull,</p>
   <p>Signed: Luis G. Romero.</p>
