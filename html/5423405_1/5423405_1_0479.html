   <p>All preparations for the carnival ball which the Ideal Club will give next Saturday, March 7, are completed; and all are of the opinion that it will be a brilliant social event.</p>
   <p>The carnival ball will be given in Dels Hall of the Amalgama Center located on the corner of Ashland and Van Buren streets. The festival will begin at 8:00 p. m. Three beautiful prizes will be awarded. There will be a grand march, headed by a Rey Feo and the rest of the program will be the most original that has been seen in our colony.</p>
   <p>The Ideal Club as always, has distinguished itself by its excellent arrangement of this type of festival.</p>
   <p>We hope that Saturday night will be a night of pleasure and that those present will enjoy themselves. We thank in advance the intelligent organizers of this wonderful festival for their splendid efforts.</p>
