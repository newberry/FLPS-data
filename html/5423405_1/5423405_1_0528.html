   <p>We have been obliged, because of economical conditions, despite our good will to publish La Lucha twice a month, but we must explain why this is so.</p>
   <p>Mr Equihua needed a job to cover his expenditures, because the printing business is not enough. As a result of this, he cannot publish our small newspaper every week.</p>
   <p>La Lucha stands in spite of economical conditions, with the same energy with which it began.</p>
   <p>We hope that very soon, we shall be able to publish our newspaper each week. We now ask our readers to please excuse this change. Perhaps we will be excused by the public interested in our cultural work among the Spanish speaking people, because the persons who make La Lucha, work gratis, as it can be proved. Messrs. Juan B Uribe, Alfredo R. Quintero and Enrique Garcia, are working for nothing, and these people expend from their own money street car fare.</p>
