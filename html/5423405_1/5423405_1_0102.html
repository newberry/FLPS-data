   <p>The Illinois Workers Alliance Local No.6 has informed us that arrangements have been made to open an office at 955 W. Grand Ave. which will be at the service of the Mexican Colony on Monday and Thursday of every week. The principal function of the new office is to attend to families who have difficulties in getting help from the relief administration. We are confident of the service that will be rendered to our people by this office.</p>
