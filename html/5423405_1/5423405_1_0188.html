   <p>This Railway Company will carry out new work. According to indications made by the officials of this company the railway construction work probably will commence in the early part of this month. Many hundreds of Mexicans will find employment there, for it is a well known fact that this company has given preference in employment to Mexican workers.</p>
   <p>Senor Enrique Rosas R, and Luis Rincon, are now making the necessary preparations to notify the Mexican workers who may wish to obtain employment with this company. They must be ready by the time the first orders get to the office. They have asked us to make this announcement to the public. These two gentlemen have been known as agents for this company for the last ten years and have an office at 361 West Madison Street, of which Mr. John Generalla is the manager.</p>
