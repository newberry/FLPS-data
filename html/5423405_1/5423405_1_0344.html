   <p>Maria Alvarez, the incomparable Spanish dancer, will make her debut tonight with Paco Perafan, at the West Side Auditorium in a series of classical dances.</p>
   <p>Miss Alvarez is a beauty, she is gentile, gracious and pleasant in a high degree, in such aptitude I found Miss Alvarez, the other day on the occasion of being introduced to her by the popular artist Paco Perafan. Her sculptural body was reclined on a sofa when she acceded to permit me an interview, which left a grateful impression on me. Paco's dancing partner, besides being beautiful is amiable, such attributes are not very often found in many a person. Maria Alvarez is going to dance with Paco Perafan at the West Side Auditorium on the occasion of a spring dance which is being announced to honor the winsome soprano Miss Esther Gonzalez Lavalle. Miss Alvarez is 18 years of age and during her artistic career, she has travelled through most of the largest cities of the globe, having had clamorous successes in New York, where she acted for a considerable length of time before coming to Chicago.</p>

   <p>She dances like a nymph, and is as beautiful as one can be and she is gifted with personal gracefulness which has caused admiration and helped her to win numerous sympathizers. She was born in Santander, of very wealthy parents. When she was only 15 years old, she joined a vaudeville show, travelled through Spain, and then went to Cuba, where she departed after having conquered an enormous success in Mexico and in Central America. After nearly four years of her stage career, Miss Alvarez wishes to return to Spain next year. While in Chicago she stays amongst her countrymen and always ready to continue her career with more tenacity than ever. She and Paco make an ideal team. There is not one dance which these two luminaries of the stage cannot perform, from the Mexican Jarabe tapatio, (Tap Dance) our beautiful national dance, to the "Tetabe," a Bedoine dance which she learned with such a mastery while she was in Moroccan.</p>
