   <p>The Pan-American Club informs the Mexican colony of the inauguration of its new social center where Americans and Spanish-Americans will participate in various activities. The object of this club is to cultivate good relations between the Mexican colony and a large number of Americans who sympathize with the Mexican custom and language. The nature and disposition of this group makes it necessary to admit only persons whose integrity and assets are recognized in the social sphere. Being aware of the great number of respectable persons of which the Mexican colony is composed, we have no doubt of being supported by the majority of the Mexican colony in our great project.</p>
   <p>For details you may communicate with Manuel Garcia, Room 300, 160 N. La Salle street, who will be glad to inform you of the future activities of our club.</p>
