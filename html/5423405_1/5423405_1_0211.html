   <p>"If you have a friend or neighbor who is in need of assistance in adjusting some legal or other problem in Washington, do not feel dismayed," said Congresswoman Mrs. Ruth Hanna McCormick to several leaders of different nationalities last week. "When I was still very young, my occupation in Washington was as private secretary to my father, Mr. Mark Hanna, who was an intimate friend and advisor of President McKinley. My father then organized a department, putting me at the head of it, to care for all the needs of the inhabitants of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The experience which I acquired then was very useful to me in later years when I became the wife of Senator McCormick, under whom I had charge of a similar department.</p>
   <p>When I was elected Congresswoman for Illinois last year (Mrs. McCormick is still a member of Congress) the first thing which I did was to form a department similar <span class="page-break">2</span>to those I had formerly been in charge of, where each and every citizen of Illinois will be able to adjust satisfactorily any type of government problem with which they may be confronted. There are many persons who need small favors which are truly just, such as temporary permission for immigrants to leave home, extension of passports, arranging of taxes and remittances, and many other little things which to mention would be impertinent.</p>
   <p>The claims of those who served in the last war will be given special attention. It has also been possible for us to aid various veterans to secure pensions to which they were entitled or increase those which they already had.</p>
   <p>I have put Mr. Orrin Farr in charge of this department. It is the duty of Mr. Farr to aid you in whatever business you might present to him. This department is for you and you should make use of it. I, personally will see that all problems are duly cared for. Send all your communications to Congresswoman Ruth Hanna McCormick, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C."</p>
