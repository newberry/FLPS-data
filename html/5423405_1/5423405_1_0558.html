   <p>Since last year we had in mind the publication of an official organ, but we postponed it, due to an educational work which required immediate solution. Now that we have seen our efforts crystatized in that field, we shall be in the position to begin our publication. We have definitely established the classes for the Mexican children of our colony, which now are functioning satisfactorily. We now want to continue with the work of our paper because we want it to serve as a guide to our members as well as our friends.</p>
   <p>The Alianza Fraternal Mexicana is proud to have a modest, yet significative voice-transmitter. We come ready to comment only what is in our own house, and to publish that which might affect our institution, or our friends. Why our friends? Because all our members have them by the dozens, and simply because the members of our colony are our friends, and fellow-country-men. We shall publish whatever should be of an utmost interest, abstaining ourselves from politics.</p>

   <p>From time to time we shall comment upon the developments of our Country, which every good Mexican has a right to. Through these lines we send the Mexican societies, and people in this metropolis and suburbs, our warmest salutation.</p>
   <p>"Through my race speaks the spirit."</p>
   <p>!Salud!</p>
