   <p>The home at 7930 Parnell Street was the scene last Friday of a bloody tragedy. Ignacio Panlaqua, 33 years of age and a resident of 7915 Parnell Street, lost his life. The murderer Ildefonso de la Cruz, who lived in the home where the tragedy occured, told the authorities that he committed the murder in self defense when Panlaqua tried to stab him with a dagger. He also mentioned that on repeated occasions Panlaqua had forced his attentions upon his wife, molesting her every day with his repulsed love advances. On Friday, when De la Cruz found him with his wife in his own home the latter tried to escape, not being able to get out he decided to give battle if necessary.</p>
   <p>The result was an exchange of violent words and the appearance of a long dagger in the hands of the abusive Panlaqua, De la Cruz, then gave him a terrible out on the neck with a razor.</p>
