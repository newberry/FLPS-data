   <p>After its wonderful success of last Saturday the Company Art Musical (Musical Art Company) plans to give another affair in Lillian Hall on Buffalo Ave., Friday, March 8. Two outstanding representations will be offered at this function, "Las Rosas de Virgen," a musical comedy and the the winsome comedy, "Tres Mujeres Para Un Hombre." There will also be other attractions.</p>
   <p>After this performance the company will go to Gary and Indiana Harbor where it will stage other plays. We do not doubt that these representations, of the Company Art Musical (Musical Art Company), will be both artistically and financially successful.</p>
