   <p>How to celebrate it? Let us have in mind these words from the Holy Father Pious X: Lent is a period of fast and penitence instituted by the Church as an Apostolic Tradition. It has been set aside to make us understand the obligation of submitting ourselves to a lifetime penitence which Lent symbolizes. Such is the interpretation given by the priests. In order to imitate the severe fasting practiced by Christ in the wilderness for a period of forty days. In preparing ourselves for such holy celebration we must keep very strictly the fast ordeal and if possible the mortification of flesh not only depriving ourselves of illicit things, but of those things that we consider licit as well, by becoming moderate to such attractions as entertainments. To give ourselves more alms giving and to a work of Christian piety toward our fellowmen.</p>

   <p>Preparing ourselves more diligently to receive the confession so as to make fasting more meritorious and become disposed to receive the Holy Communion. Ash-Wednesday indicates the beginning of Lent, also reminds us that we are dust and to dust we shall return through death. We shall be contrite and through penitence redeem ourselves from sin while the opportunity is at hand.</p>
