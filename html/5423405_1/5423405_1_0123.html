   <p>An honest and efficient interpreter can be obtained with facility and without cost in case of death of a member of one of our families. To bury the dead, is one of the deeds of mercy; if they are from our families, it is the last offering we can make to them. The last duty we should perform. Placing their corpses in the hands of undertakers who are not well accepted in the social system of the country we live in, is to make them unworthy of a better funeral. The fact that we decide to save a five or ten dollar bill shows that we hate to make the last offering and sacrifice for our people. For respect, dignity or egotism, let us place our dead in the hands of our own people, the white race. Let us make an effort to elevate our social position as a colony.</p>
