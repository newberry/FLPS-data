   <p>The showing of the Cuadro Artistico Mexicano "Olimpia" at the West Side Auditorium last Saturday was a complete success. This dramatic play was presented with much finery and detail, and in spite of the many functions given Saturday in the Spanish colony, the affair was well attended.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Celia H. Onliveros and Mrs. Rosa Dorantes were generously applauded.</p>
