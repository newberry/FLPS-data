   <p>The Hull House is continuing the English Classes for adults of both sexes. Mrs. Pearle Sutherland, who is an experienced teacher, is conducting these classes from 1:30 to 3:30 P. M. This opportunity will be of a special value to those people who are unemployed, or work nights. However, the method employed will be very simple and effective in meeting the requirements of each student. Students who were unable to finish their high school, will, under the present plan receive the equivalent thereof. These classes will be conducted five days a week, that is, from Monday to Friday.</p>
   <p>Those who see the necessity of learning the English Language may register at once. For further information you may interview Miss. Pearle Sutherland at the Hull House, 800 South Halsted Street.</p>
