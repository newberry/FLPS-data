   <p>At the present time there is in existence "La Cruz Asul Mexicana," a fraternal and charitable organization which was formed some time ago. Since its inception up to this day, this organization has gone through a series of difficulties, because of lack of elements in their ranks who possess financial resources. Although the personnel which composes this society is very competent, they cannot make a front to all the obligations that the institution in itself demands. Because, as I pointed it out before; they need the financial cooperation of the Mexican merchants and the colony in general.</p>
   <p>The doctors, nurses, persons visiting the sick, the president and finally the entire personnel receive no salary, their purpose being to aid our countrymen in distress. But, what can the members of this society do without money? Is it possible to solve all the problems that may arise, with good-will alone? No, because in cases like this, good-will is not enough, for we are living in a world in which money is the support of life.</p>

   <p>And, money is the problem with which a charitable organization is confronted with, and it would be a gross absurdity to think that with good-will alone everything can be done. Especially in these cases the 'will,' demands a prompt appearing of funds on the contrary any aim on this direction will be shattered to pieces upon the stone of failure. The question of raising funds for the support of this society has been carefully studied, and it has come to the conclusion that this can only be done through the organization of festivals, whether these be recreational or in commemoration of the struggle and deeds of our Mexican heroes. Only in this manner can such work be carried out effectively. The idea is very good, magnificent, but, I would add to this, that it is the inevitable duty of all of the Mexican Colony in Chicago and vicinity to contribute freely with its share every time they are solicited.</p>
   <p>Since it is the duty of every good Mexican, to be vigiland over those of our countrymen who are dispossessed and wandering through the streets, nearly begging some bread, not for them, but for their children who cry because of a lack of food, without shelter, or in bed sick, fighting between life and death without any protection or resource than the aid of our charitable institution.</p>

   <p>Let us not forget; all the Mexicans who today enjoy a partial security, that perhaps tomorrow or a day after they may be in their ranks, begging some bread for our children due to unemployment. Then we will have to resort to the above mentioned society and it in gratitude may open the door and give help. Members of this society, must bear in mind that the aggrandizement of the work which they have decided to carry on, depends upon the fulfillment of the sacred duty. that they of their own volition have imposed upon themselves.</p>
