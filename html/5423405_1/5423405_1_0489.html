   <p>It was eight o'clock at night and the West Side Auditorium was full of people. The dance and the incentive of winning a prize had overcome the laziness that many of us feel in attending an affair of this kind. The festive Mexican spirit reigned at its best last Saturday evening. I never saw so much animation and enthusiasm on the part of the audience.</p>
   <p>Mrs. F. S. de Barron displayed an activity which deserves to be mentioned. Her Illustrious ideas and organizing spirit both were very important factors in the success of the program. Miss Esperanza Barron was the whole soul without limit of that festival. Her natural sympathy and grace made the center admiration. Mrs. Antonia Aguirre, was the chairman on arrangements, and to whom a great part of the artistic success is due. The "Moraima" act (Comic act) was splendid. The applauses were so prolonged that the group of girls participating were obliged to appear again so as to recognize the ovation given by the public.</p>

   <p>The comedy "El Sueno Dorado" (The Golden Dream) was also applauded very much. Jose Jimenez became distinguished in the act. And La Duquesa de Baltabarin" (Dutchess of Baltabarin) constituted the climax of the fiesta. Every person in the hall applauded. After a brief interval the dance continued. And what a dance! When I remember it, I feel twenty years younger. When the time came to give out the rewards to the persons wearing the most original costumes, the jury who had met before decided to grant the first prize to Miss Marie Garcia Morales. The costume that won the prize was of Sevillan style with flamant ornaments. When I saw it I felt being transported to old Sevilla. Its description is not within the knowledge of this writer who knows very little about feminine attire. Although, may I say that I never saw a more beautiful costume or a woman with more grace to wear it. The second award was given to Maria Cervantes, who also wore an attractive dress and it seems like I am looking at it now.</p>
