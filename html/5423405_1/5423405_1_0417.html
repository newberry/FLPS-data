   <p>Mr. Jose Jimenez, a well-known comedian, will make his debut on December 21, at 8 P. M., at the West Side Auditorium, Racine and Taylor Sts. The program that the group "Comedia" presents to us on that night is "Que Escandalo!" (What a scandal!) a very humorous comedy capable of splitting a neurasthenic's side with laughter. A group of distinguished comedians will take part in the play. They are Maria Hernandez, Augustina Noriega, Jose Jimenez, Bernardo Velasco, and C. Guevara.</p>
   <p>The comedy will be followed by a dance the music for which will be under the supervision of the orchestra of conductor Jerry Castillo.</p>
