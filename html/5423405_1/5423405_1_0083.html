   <p>Since the organization of the above mentioned institution, the Anti-Alcoholic Committee has been doing splendid work in Chicago. During the mentioned period we have built up organizations in Chicago as well as in Indiana Harbor.</p>
   <p>Credit should be given to Mr. Apolonio Colunga, who is President of the institution and who is highly esteemed in our Colony, for the good work done by the Committee.</p>
   <p>By means of these lines we invite the Spanish speaking Colony to attend an Anti-Alcoholic meeting which is to be given Monday April 25th at the Mexican Social Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, at 7:30 P. M. Distinguished artists and speakers from our Colony will take part in the program. The principal speaker will be the President of the organization.</p>
   
   <p>The Anti-Alcoholic Committee has recently received many letters from Mexico and other Latin countries, praising the institution for the fine work it is carrying on among the Spanish speaking people in Chicago, especially the organizing of the Chicago group.</p>
   <p>Again may we make a general plea that our Colony cooperate fully in making the above mentioned program a success.</p>
   <p>The Spanish American Anti-Alcoholic Committee of Chicago.</p>
