   <p>In the issue of December 5th, of this newspaper, a gentleman whose initials I do not recall mentioned an article written by me for this paper some months ago wherein I advocated the formation of a Mexican Center, which would be a credit to our nationality; to show that we know how to form associations worthy of civilized men. I am very glad that this matter has been brought to the fore so that countrymen of ours with sound ideas and principles might take up such an undertaking. A qualified man for such an enterprise is for instance my good friend Luis Martinez, the organizer of the well known Centro Mutualista Azteca of Chicago.</p>
   <p>I wish that the gentleman who wrote the article about which I am speaking now, be kind enough to give us some ideas and to invite the members of our colony to outline a practical project. No one may deny that we have a considerable number of competent Mexicans besides Luis Martinez. Just to mention a few, we would for instance appreciate the cooperation of the cultured and well known Col. Rafael Trejo, of Nicolas Lara Garcia, and of Efren Torres, as well as of the learned Dr. Juan B. Medina and of many others.</p>

   <p>I had the honor of being the director of propaganda of the worthy Cruz Azul Mexicana which failed and of which at that time Mrs. Refugio Alaniz was president. As at that time no other charitable society was in existence, the no less respectable Sociedad Femenil Mexicana was organized under the leadership of Mrs. Barron. Instead of speaking of union and solidarity, would it not be better to lend complete support, to the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana? Our financial support is the one mostly needed. If we spend one and two dollars for little festivals which only deprive us of sleep, why can't we attend instead the festivals organized by the Femenil Mexicana? In that case more Mexicans would attend the entertainments organized by those charitable women who in many instances put aside their domestic duties in order to give aid to our children, widows and unemployed. By coming to their affairs we improve the financial condition of this benevolent institution. Thus we would not only help financially, but at the same time build up a Mexican institution devoted to charity which would be economically sound.</p>
   <p>Why should we want a Mexican center which might become a center for gossip and breed jeolousies, because Mr. so-and-so was not elected president or secretary and wanted his name to appear in print?</p>

   <p>On the other hand, if we help an institution of charity whether this be the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana or a similar one, we are promoting the formation of good Mexicans, and the education of our helpless children who fortunately or unfortunately speak the English language much better that their own beautiful Spanish. With sufficient funds, we could afford to pay an instructor to teach the Spanish language and Mexicanism as well, not only to our children but also to us adults who need it so much. If on the other hand a Mexican Center is formed, the past shows us how unsuccessful we have been in such undertakings. Having formed such a center, we would have to keep away from groups that indulge in dancing and similar frivolities.</p>
   <p>Two real festivals a year having as object to help the charitable and cultural institutions would be sufficient. There are now one or two groups which have an athletic or social purpose. In the main they devote themselves to dancing and little week-end parties, without any other purpose than to provide a good time for a group of conceited youngsters. Their dances are immoral to their contortions ridiculous and the flappers whom the young men escort have a very doubtful reputation.</p>

   <p>The presence of these young people keeps our decent families away from those places to which all of us would come should order, morality and good manners prevail.</p>
   <p>Let us be contented and help the only charitable institution that we have, the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana, let us give it our complete moral and material support. The society above mentioned within a few days will give an entertainment for the children, let us help them, and forget the "editoriales."</p>
