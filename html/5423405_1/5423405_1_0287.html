   <p>Let us hope that this is not a delusion! A rumor is circulated about the formation of a Mexican Commercial Center in Chicago. The organization of such a center is greatly desired by the merchants of our colony, as it would afford protection to our commerce which is exposed to competition and to many other difficulties. Many merchants whose names we do not wish to mention are anxious to see such a center created.</p>
   <p>To accomplish this the cooperation of all is needed. Otherwise the plan will be a complete failure and we shall be as before with very little influence. The Mexican merchants should realize that cooperation is a needed factor in the success of any business.</p>
   <p>An organization of this kind, besides protecting the interests of all, will give a greater impetus to Mexican business in the colony. In our next issue we shall inform you as to the time and place where the first meeting will be held.</p>
