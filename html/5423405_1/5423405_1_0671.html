   <p>The Atlas Sprot Club is organizing a fine base ball club for the coming season. According to reliable information this worthy club has signed contracts with 18 outstanding players.</p>
   <p>In spite of the existing depression the club has not found insurmountable obstacles in carrying out its plan. This has been due to the fact that all active members worked indefatigally which is characteristic of the Mexican race.</p>
   <p>We anticipate the opening of the season so that the team may show its mettle on the playing fields.</p>
