   <p>It is already of the public's knowledge, through leaflets and posters now circulating in the colony, that the Cruz Azul Mexicana (Mexican Blue Cross) at the present time is busy in the organization of a great concert and dance, intended to commemorate the glorious 5th of May. The affair will take place at the Ashland Auditorium, May 4th at 7 P. M. To judge by the enormous enthusiasm which now reigns among the colony, this festival promises to be a colossal event. It counts on the support of the Mexican Consulate and many of the Mexican societies of Chicago, which on this occasion have united in order to give more splendor to this festival in commemoration of one of the most glorious days in the history of Mexico.</p>
