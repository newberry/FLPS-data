   <p>In the Ample Hall of the Parochial School of Saint Francisco, located on Newberry and Roosevelt Rd., will take place one of the traditionally animated Bazaars organized by the Rectory of Saint Francisco, known as the Colony's Church. On this occasion the Bazaar will last for two days, beginning tonight at 8:00 p.m. and continuing until tomorrow night. There will be typical stands and a number of decent distractions, the proceeds will be destined to complete the expenses of the Catholic Youth Congress that was recently effected in this City.</p>
