   <p>Mr. Alvarez gave the following information: "I was born in Asturias in 1903 and learned to dance in Madrid; while there I danced in the theater Maravillas and in the cabaret Alcazar in the park of El Retiro. Came to the U. S. in the latter part of 1925 and I have danced in the principal cities of the U. S.</p>
   <p>During my stay on the West Coast I worked in some pictures for Paramount in 1929. My work is mostly classical Spanish dancing. I work alone and with a team.</p>
   <p>"I also have regional dances, typical of the different parts of Spain. During the last five years I have resided in Chicago. Here I am a dancing instructor. I live in the Lakeshire Apartment Hotel, 4128 Clarendon Avenue."</p>
