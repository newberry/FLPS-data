   <p>A large crowd saw the foot-ball game last Sunday between the Spanish Union team of Gary, Indiana, and Necaxa team of Chicago. The score was 2 to 1 in favor of the Spanish team and the success made the Spanish team eligible for the trophy, "The Pearl" which they received.</p>
   <p>The boys of the Necaxa team played valiantly and did not surrender as easily as some might believe. The contest, as such, was hard fought and it might have been a tie had it not been for the playing of Mike of the Spanish team, who from the center of the field threw the ball to the carrier with the result that tht Spaniards came out on top, victorious.</p>
   <p>The ball carrier of Necaxa played brilliantly, retaining the ball in all attacks. The Captain of the Necaxa Club presented the trophy to the Captain of the Club, on which occasion all players were present, as well as fans, and friends of the players.</p>
   
   <p>The players from the Spanish team really did not expect the stiff resistance which their opponents displayed, whose playing was lauded by all.</p>
   <p>Among the fans, and there were a large number of them, could be found quite a few young women who belong to our colony, of this group we were able to distinguish the Flores sisters, belles of the colony, also the Alonso and Noriegas girls, and many others.</p>
   <p>The principal thing about the contest was that both teams played magnificently with a fine spirit of sport, and that the fans were well pleased, and everything was satisfactory.</p>
