   <p>The lectures given by the Rev. Reynoso, a Mexican priest, were very interesting and were attended by a large number of people. Many Mexicans, who heard him speak at the Hull House and at the University of Chicago Settlement, also went to South Chicago to listen to his lecture again. In spite of leaflets issued by Ayala and Lopez who warned the Roman Catholics not to attend the lectures because Father Reynoso was a renegade Catholic and therefore he was excommunicated. Even with such subversive propaganda, the people came and heard the priest.</p>
