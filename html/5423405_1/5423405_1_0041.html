   <p>So far we have received the following information about Mexican boys and girls who have completed primary education, which amounts to 26 boys and 33 girls. We do not believe those to be all of the Spanish American descent who have finished the primary school, however, those are all the names we have received.</p>
   <p>In our next edition we shall publish the names of those that have finished High School this year. If you know the name of anyone kindly fill the coupon and send it to us.</p>
