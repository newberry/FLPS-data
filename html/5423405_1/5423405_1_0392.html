   <p>We must congratulate our "Mexican United Artists of Chicago" for their weekly artistic and educational performances.</p>
   <p>There are unfortunately among our compatriots some illiterate persons who know nothing about the productions of the Spanish and Mexican theaters. They are acquainted only with the "Haymarket" indecencies and other vulgar burlesque shows.</p>
   <p>Mexicans who do not know how to write their names correctly, insult our Mexican artists, the work of whom they cannot appreciate.</p>
   <p>Our artists in this city are doing something worthwhile. They reveal to the American public the high standard of the Spanish and Mexican theaters and consequently we should support them.</p>
   <p>The list of our "Mexican United Artists" is as follows: Lupe Plaza, soprano, Licha Villalvazo, Tina Noriega, Tulitas Morales, Rosita Dorantes, Silvano S.Ramos, Fortunato Ortega Rodriguez, Jose Nieto and Antonio Lopez Chavez.</p>
