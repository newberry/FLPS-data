   <p>The football team "Espana" of the Union Benefica Espanola was close to victory last Sunday. Although defeated by the "Gary" team, the Espana fought courageously up to the last moment. Through our paper we extend our most sincere greetings to both teams for their splendid deportment on the playing field.</p>
   <p>The Basques from Jai - Alai who played with the "Espana" team, excelled in this game as well as in other sports and they were loudly applauded. The only Mexican who played with the "Espana" outfit, whose name we regret not to know, revealed himself as a player of outstanding ability. With such players the "Espana" team may anticipate many victories.</p>
