   <p>Masquerade dance tonight in the Spanish society. The dance has been planned for tonight by this society at the Club Room of the Palmer House, beginning at 8:30 P. M. The organizing committee has sheltered the hope of being able to gather a splendid crowd from the various sections of the Spanish speaking colonies of Chicago and surburbs. In order to accomplish such purpose they have decided to give out six prizes and distribute them among the luckiest persons in the audience during the process of the dance.</p>
   <p>The committee who, with such great enthusiasm has undertaken the work for this festival is composed of: Alfonso Bouzo, Basilio Barrerio, Edelmerio Rodriguez and several young women who helped on the decoration of the hall, and other such task that can only be executed by women.</p>
