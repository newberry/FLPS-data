   <p>Those who love the idea of going round and round on the arms of a congenial partner, and those who can do expertly the "Jarabe" and the "Jota," will be happy to hear that on Saturday, December 8, there will be a dancing contest at the West Side Auditorium, with valuable prizes for the winning couples.</p>
   <p>In addition to the dance which will come last, and which promises to be highly entertaining, the debut of the popular and well-known theatrical group, "Pro Arte Hispano-Mexicano," will take place at 8:30. It will present the two beautiful dramas, "El Arcediano de San Gil," and "Los Amores de Ramona." The last one is based on the great moving-picture "Ramona," which is famous through-out the world.</p>
   <p>An orchestra, under the leadership of Mr. Simon Atilano, has been engaged to furnish the music. The famous conductor is well known for his beautiful music.</p>
