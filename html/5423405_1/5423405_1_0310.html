   <p>Mr. Enrique Islas, outstanding Mexican singer, will appear at the festival organized by the Cruz Azul Mexicana of Chicago. Although he has been only a short time in the colony, he is called, - and with a just reason - the "non plus ultra" of the Mexican tenors that have visited us. His voice, that has conquered many applauses in our country, is now in the land of Uncle Sam and may be heard at the Pilson Park Pavilion, 26th St. and Albany Ave., on Nov. 9, 1929. There will be a monumental program presented under the auspices of the Cruz Azul Mexicana, of which Mrs. Milla Dominguez, wife of the Mexican vice-consul, is the executive director. Mr. Enrique Islas is master of his art. The audiences that have heard him sing are of the opinion that our countryman was born with the natural gift for which the public admires him so much.</p>
