   <p>The conferences given under the auspices of El Frente Popular, by the intelligent Miss Angelica Arenal, in different parts of this city were very interesting. Miss Arenal, spoke with a zealous expression, and made known the plans being unfolded by El. Frente Popular in Mexico in favor of the workers. She brought a fraternal salutation from the workers of Mexico to those in the United States.</p>
   <p>Besides Miss Arenal, a distinguished Mexican teacher, Miss Consuelo Garcia Moran, with eloquent phrases addressed the people and explained the progress made in education in Mexico. The magnetic personality of the orator, the ample culture, and the human touch in her expression delighted the numerous listeners. It would be great if the educator would give us more opportunities to hear her in the future. This took place at the University of Chicago Settlement, April 5, 1936.</p>
