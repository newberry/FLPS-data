   <p>According to information which was received from the director of the "Old Town Boys' Club", located at 1300 Newberry Street, a Base-Ball League has been organized as an added sport activity of the Club. We believe that the directors of the Club's Athletic department have succeeded in organizing a Baseball League which, in itself, has added credit to the name of the Club referred to above.</p>
   <p>The number of teams non affiliated with the said League is 17, among which can be found the powerful "Aces" and"Spartons" Nines, composed wholely of Mexican youths.</p>
   <p>The first activities of the League will begin in the early part of June, when six games will be played between teams which have already been selected by the judges.</p>

   <p>These games will begin at 3:30 P. M. and 6:30 P. M. taking place simultaneously on the diamonds of the following schools: Jungman's, Goodrich and Foster. The admission is free. And by means of these lines we invite all members of the Mexican Colony who are lovers of this sport to attend the games.</p>
