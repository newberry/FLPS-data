   <p>The Atlas Base-Ball Nine of South Chicago, will play tomorrow against the Army Jacks of Gary, Indiana, in Gleason Park, at Gary. The Park is located at 4th and Virgina Streets. It is hoped that this event will be an outstanding mark in the base-ball annals of the Colony of Spanish speaking residents of the neighboring towns. This is particularly true since the Atlas is actually the most outstanding Base-Ball Unit in Chicago, composed exclusively of Mexicans.</p>
