   <p>La Lucha is preparing a special issue in order to honor the Mexican women on Mother's Day.</p>
   <p>It will be published next Sunday, April 13th, and in these editions shall appear tender thoughts of those who feel the desire to dedicate these kindly feelings to their mothers. Consequently, if you are fortunate enough to possess this happiness, that is, the caresses of a mother, or if on the other hand this fortune is no longer yours but you still desire to make mention of fond memories of her, you are invited by La Lucha, to dedicate this memory by wearing a flower in your lapel. Usually a rose.</p>
   <p>If you wish La Lucha's staff will help you.</p>
   <p>Our idea is not to have a literary assemblage but a public demonstration of our thankfulness to mothers.</p>
   <p>We ask those who accept this invitation to write briefly and clearly. You must also, give completely your name and address.</p>
