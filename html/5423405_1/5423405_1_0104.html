   <p>The prolonged industrial depression has made of us who compose the foreign element, the principal victims. The Mexican population is perhaps the most affected. The percentage of Mexicans unemployed is higher if we are to compare it with the other foreign groups in Chicago. The causes which made this occur are numerous, but we prefer not to discuss them at present. More than 25 per cent of the Mexicans in Chicago are found unemployed, some for months,and many of them for years have not worked in private industry. To what means they have resorted to make their living, is something we wish not to comment upon at this moment. The truth is that this great number of men and women without income, have much time at their disposal, and have had it for a long time. How do they employ it? What do they do during many whole days with no obligation to go to the shop, or office, as they use to in normal times? This would be something very interesting to know.</p>
