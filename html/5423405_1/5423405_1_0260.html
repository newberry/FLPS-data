   <p>Our company imports green coffee, olive oil, olives, paprika, anchovies, etc., from Spain, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico.</p>
   <p>I founded this company in October, 1922. I am a Cuban citizen and I have been a resident of Chicago since 1917.</p>
   <p>We do business with the principal commercial houses of the United States.</p>
   <p>In 1933 I founded the Spanish Mine Company, of which I am also president. We import the finest wines produced in Spain; Muscatel, Claret, Burgundy, Corona etc.</p>
   <p>In the last few months, due to the civil war in Spain, our business is at a stand-still and we are meeting orders from our warehouses only.</p>
