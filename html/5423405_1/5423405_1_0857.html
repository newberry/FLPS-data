   <p>Last Friday, South Chicago was the center of a bloody tragedy, between tow Mexicans for the favors of a gay young Poilsh woman. The result was death, from gun shot wounds, for one of them, which took place in the presence of the owner of the establishment where the quarrel began.</p>
   <p>Albert Velasco, 8722 Buffalo Avenue, and his friend, Irene Lavonage, young Polish woman, 3221 E. 91st Street, entered Joseph Garcia's meat-market, located at 9022 Burley Avenue, Friday afternoon, where they met Juvencio Horta, 9232 Burley Avenue, who was purchasing meat.</p>
   <p>Velasco, who had been drinking all afternoon, took advantage of Horta's being behind his friend and maintained that he had made some smart remark in the presence of the Polish woman. Joseph Garcia, much alarmed by the words which Velasco uttered and desiring to keep order in his store told him that his establishment was no place for arguments, and that he was not disposed to tolerate disturbances from any drunkard, <span class="page-break">2</span>Velasco paid no attention to this but, on the contrary, grew more boisterous and gave Horta on minute to answer his accusation. Horta did not comply and Velasco drew a revolver which he carried and fired once, killing Horta instantly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Garcia, without thinking of the danger he was in, seized the weapon from the culprit and with the same revolver marched him down the street to the home of Mr. Herberto Sanchez, at 9014 Burley Avenue, from where he called the police. Garcia held Velasco prisoner until the police arrived.</p>
   <p>Velesco, the assasinator, Garcia, Herberto Sanchez and the young woman, Irene Lavonage, friend of the assasinator, were taken to the police station where all made declarations, except the accused. Miss Lavonage who was in the meat-market, said that she did not witness the murder because of having gone to another room when her friend began to quarrel with Horta.</p>

   <p>In an interview with our reporter, Velasco said that he killed Horta because his sweetheart deceived him. He said: "I know that they cannot do anything to me because I am a minor". Velasco was twenty years of age.</p>
   <p>Juvencio Horta was twenty-five years old and had been working for quite some time at the Illinois Steel Company. Not having any relatives or close friends in the city to claim his body it was taken to Murphy's Funeral Parlor, 95th Street and Buffalo Avenue, where an inquest will be held Saturday.</p>
