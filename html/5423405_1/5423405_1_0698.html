   <p>In order to awaken an interest for sports among the members of our colony, the newspaper, Vida Hispano-Americana (Spanish-American Life), at the suggestion of a group of young sport lovers, supports the plan of immediately forming a Sports' Club. The object of the club is to organize the enthusiastic youngsters who are anxious to go into action.</p>
   <p>We are sure that the promoters of this group of physical culture disciples will bring together some very fine young people. Our great hope is that there will be a unanimous response to the cordial invitation which has been extended for our own benefit.</p>
   <p>The plan is to organize the available young people into groups which will engage in baseball, football, basketball, etc.</p>
