   <p>At this very moment the World's Fair is taking place here, which really means a Century of Progress. Have we,the Mexicans of Chicago something to show in regards to the progress, and to the Century? Very likely not. Nevertheless, our government worthily represented by General Abelardo Rodriguez, who in his aim to show the world something of the any good things we have, has sent the famous "Tren Olivo," the presidential train. Let us welcome it in this good hour with all the personnel that will arrive abroad this superb train. We send our congratulations to Dr. Alfonso Caso, and the eighteen persons who are accompanying him, we wish them a happy stay while in Chicago. Let us remind them that when they return to our beloved country on the other side of the "Rio Bravo" to tell our countrymen that we still remain as faithful as ever to our country.</p>
