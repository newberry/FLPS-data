   <p>When we speak of Art there unfolds before our imagination a long, very long line of men and women who are already vested with the arrogance of "triumph" and full of self praise. But all artists of great accomplishments are those who do not proclaim their greatness but merit it by the character of their work.</p>
   <p>With this point of view in mind I come to speak of a group of artists made of persons from both sexes and that have been doing meritorious work.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, at Hull House, they presented the play Alfin Mujer, with great dramatic effect, as was indicated by the resounding applause which they received. Our Colony is to be commended for producing young players of the calibre of those who played their parts in the drama referred to above. They all have in them what it takes to become real artists; namely, natural ability, determination,hard work, and the frequent presentation of plays for public criticism and approval.</p>
