We have 35 members and we meet the first Sunday of each month during the winter, in the summer we meet often. Our Club is an athletic organization, we play baseball, basket-ball, football, and indoor-ball. We have dances about two, or three times a year. There is no educational training, except that which is connected with our line of work. Our Club was founded in 1932.</p>
   <p>We are associated with the Club Deportivo Monterrey, and Sociedad Pro-Mexico. We have no benefit fund in our Club, but we do help our members in case of sickness, or when they get hurt while playing. We are recognized by the Chamber of Commerce of South Chicago, and we are members of the Calumet Region League. We benefit the public, because we give them entertainment without cost. We help Commerce by purchasing all the objects we require in our equipment. Last year in one store alone we spent $237.00 in one occasion. That is doing something, is it not?</p>
