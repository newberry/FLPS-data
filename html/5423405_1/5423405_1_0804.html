   <p>From good sources we are informed that the Sociedad Fraternal Mexicana, Lodge 170 of the Alianza Hispano Americana, is organizing a series of festivals. This is to raise funds to buy clothes, toys and candy in order to distribute them on Christmas to the Mexican children of the colony.</p>
   <p>"El Arte Infantil", the well known group of children who also work on the stage, has seconded this idea and placed its artistic contingent at the disposal of this cause.</p>
   <p>Since the Mexican Consul of Chicago, has supported this idea, and since the aim is commendable we hope that the other groups of Chicago will follow this example to realize such a noble undertaking.</p>
