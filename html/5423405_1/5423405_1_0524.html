   <p>The culture of the people is measured by their number and tendencies of their Newspapers. The Spanish speaking people in Chicago, conservatively estimated at between 22 and 25 thousand inhabitants have not a publication considered worthy of the population. This means our colonies have lacked the Element to stimulate such medium of culure. Many impulses have been made to maintain alive from time to time different Newspapers, to fulfil the great necessity and latent demand of a good publication in the Language of Cervantes, with elevated ideals and with some utility to the people.</p>
   <p>Such efforts have been frustrated and unprofitable because they have been uncapable of satisfying the wishes of those who are anxious to read something which may express clear and elevated thoughts; with well written phrases in our native tongue. The Publishers have failed because of their commercialism and watching after their own interests they have disregarded with great negligence the interest of those who would have supported them if they had forgotten themselves and adopted a different attitude from the viewpoint of those who would not only have been too glad to support them and made them progress morally and economically.</p>
   
   <p>Our predecessors have caused their death with their own hands because they did not adjust themselves to the culture of their readers; and made no effort to give the services expected. Their lives were short because they never looked at the other side of the fence where those who do not edit are placed and expect sometimes too much from the Newspapers. Studing the life of various publications in the past, in this great metropolis, we can see that never existed a Newspaper that has accepted the duty and responsibilities as a News conveyor and defender of the ideals of thousands of representatives of a race whose culture is well known in all the countries of the civilized world. It would be difficult to calculate exactly the number of residents on this region that have been born in Spanish speaking countries. The majority of these publishers have not entered into such discussion, nor what made us come to the country of Uncle Sam, where we find ourselves physically and morally aliens and logically speaking it is difficult to adapt ourselves to new conditions. All of us look for guidance. It is hard for us to be assimilated to the medium, and consequently we live isolated fearing to find antagonism even among our own brothers. We do not say it, but our behavior shows it. The lack of leadership has been manifested by our predecessors in the field of News Publications.</p>
   <p>There has not been one who assumed a pro-race attitude, it is sad to say but many have originated Polemics, instigating controvercies of no interest to anyone except those involved, and in many cases have taken to personal insults.</p>
   <p>We are not making an autopsy, simply relating the facts as seen with resentment by the colonies in general. As an evident disapproval of such conduct; One publication followed the other at brief intervals, victims of inanition which made disappear all the Newspapers that once hoped to live without diffusing news, nor culture only undermining the union and ideals of those who as colonies deserve a place of distinction among the foreign nationalities in this great land of the United States.</p>
   <p>La Defensa, is anxious to be of real value to those who speak the Spanish Language residing in this part of the world. It offers its columns to all who have as a first object the welfare, morally and materially of our brothers and the difusion of Spanish and Ibero-American culture. We understand very well that from the very moment our first issue saw the light, we placed ourselves before our people and know we are far from perfection and might cause various impressions to our readers.</p>
   <p>Those who share our ideas please let us know, and those who may not agree should let us know. At any time, we shall be ready to receive any critisism that may be constructive and can give us an idea how to be of better service to the community. Our personal feelings will disappear completely when confronted with the forces of better ideals and we are anxious to contribute to the progress and the collective welfare of our people.</p>
   <p>La Defensa is yours, of you, and for you. Make use of it in the teachings of noble and elevated ideals.</p>
   <p>"I may not be in accord with your ideas; but with pleasure shall dare my life defending the right you have in expressing them."</p>
