   <p>According to many letters received by this editorial staff from many of our readers asking information concerning "Pen-names" used by some of our workers, we hope the following will be sufficient.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Xavier Mondragon, occasionally uses the pen-name of "Don Verdades" in his articles on festivals and verbal disputes; Don Arturo Vargas Medel, does not use any"nom de plume", that we know of, his articles are carried under his name in this weekly; Dr. S. G. Meirueiro does not use a pen-name; Don Ramon Gonzalez, was known in most of his pass writings under the pen-name, El Principe Azul", now generally his contributions are in his own name.</p>
   <p>Only recently there was published in the social columns of this weekly, some writings by Mr. J. Terrones, under the pen-name - "Yo".</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Ricardo D. Ornelas writes under his own name.</p>
   <p>Since the writers referred to are residents of Chicago, we believe the curiosity of our readers was simply to know the literary activities of the of the persons mentioned, and because of this we believe the information which we have given fulfills the expressed desire. Thank you.</p>
