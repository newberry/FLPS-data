   <p>Preparations for the festivals to be given April 11 and 12, for the benefit of the Chicago University Settlement, were closed with great activity. We have been informed that on April 11 there will be a sumptuous ball and on April 12 a royal social program, in which Mrs. Milla Dominguez and Mrs. Lupe Plaza, well known Mexican sopranos, in our social circles, will take part.</p>
   <p>In addition to this can be counted the cooperation of the congenial and well known actresses Lupe Sandoval and Juanita Gonzalez, the lovely Mrs. Josefina Chavez (who plays the part of an old lady). The leading talented actors Ernesto Dominguez and Simon Flores, and the comic actor Ruben Gonzalez.</p>
   <p>The Cultural and Necoxa Clubs have extended their efforts in order to make the festival the most brilliant. It is because of this that they have obtained the cooperation of the distinguished personalities mentioned. The picture to be shown on the screen Sunday is entitled "El Cabrero" and is directed by its author, Mr. Phillip Palomino.</p>
