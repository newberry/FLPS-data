   <p>The Mexican colony of Chicago will have an opportunity to listen to the well-known lecturer, Edith M. De Rivera, president of the Liga Insular de Temperancia (Insular League of Temperance), now on her way from Mexico. She will give two lectures at the Methodist Temple, at Polk and Sholto. One Lecture will take place at 3:30 p. m. Sunday, and the other at 7 p. m. on Monday, the 17th.</p>
   <p>Miss De Rivera will speak on the topic of Temperance, and her lectures will be illustrated with pictures. We hope the colony will respond en masse to these lectures.</p>
