   <p>The first Spanish paper in Chicago has made its appearance, with the title of El Eco de Chicago. It is a handsome sixteen page sheet, and is issued under the auspices of the Parisian School, No. 24 Adams street. It is, as its name indicates, an echo of the city, but beyond this it aims to and should have an important influence as an organ of communication between the managers of the World's Fair and the Spanish-American nations. It appears at an opportune time, therefore, and as the only Spanish paper in the city it is likely to have a wide sphere of influence.</p>
