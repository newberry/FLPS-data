   <p>We were informed by telephone that the famous Mexican Artist Pedro Rubin had arrived in Chicago. Being always interested in the triumphs of our dear countrymen, we went to the New Bismark Hotel with the object of paying him, a visit of courtesy. We reached the hotel about 11:00 o'clock in the morning and were courteously received by him. It is necessary for us to mention part of his life's career, which has been a path of thorns and at times one of flowers.</p>
   <p>Rubin's life is like a poem. He is a very affable youth, distinguished, and of extreme amiability. Nothing in his person indicates arrogance or haughtiness. He answered with pleasure our interrogations and calmly relates many episodes of his life. Pedro Rubin is a Mexican, he was born in the year of 1900 at San Luis Potosi, from a modest family His first and only vocation was that of a dancer, that is why, when he was very young dedicated himself to the study of it. He made his debut at the "Salon Mexicano" in Mexico City in 1913.</p>
   
   <p>Lydia, his sister was his partner for three years until she got married in Guadalajara. In that same city Pedro Rubin established his first dancing school, then he moved into Mexico City, where he became the favorite of the Mexican Society. In 1918 he worked in the "Teatro Principal" with the famous dancer Fernandita Areu, who at that time was considered as the first dancer in the republic. In a dancing contest held at the "Trianon Palace in the city of Mexico they won the first prize as the best dancers of the dpoch. This was his first real victory. In the year of 1924, Pedro Rubin inauguarated the aristocratic " Winter Garden" in San Antonio, Texas at the termination of his contract, he came to Chicago and worked at the Chez Paree Cabaret, Monin Club, Rouge Cafe and the Little Club. Then he formed a company of Spanish artists and traveled through the United States and Canada with the Keith Abbe Orpheum group. In January 1926, his contract expired and he signed up with Fortune Gallo, the owner of the great San Carlo Opera House. Here, he became a leading figure in the Ballet and as character dancer obtained many triumphs.</p>
   
   <p>In November of 1926, he signed a contract with the king of the Follies in United States, the famous Florenz Siegfeld. He acted as a first class dancer and director of the "Rio Rita Review". Later on he worked at the Roxy Theatre of New York, the largest and most beautiful theatre in the World. Pedro Rubin became a producer and director of 110 artists.</p>
   <p>Rubin's victories are innumerable to mention, a lack of space forbids us to make known every detail relative to his person. Now he is at the Palace Theatre where he is warmly applauded by the public. His manager tells us that Rubin will soon leave Chicago and that at his return will work at the State and Lake Theatre, performing some of his Mexican dances.</p>
