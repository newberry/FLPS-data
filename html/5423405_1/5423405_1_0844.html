   <p>A body was found last Sunday at the break of day in an empty lot at Taylor and Canal Streets. The body was identified as that of a Mexican named "El Veneno" (The poison).</p>
   <p>He had a very bad reputation, because he was aggressive and a thief; consequently he had many enemies.</p>
   <p>The last time he was under police surveillance he was living with a crew of bandits who were plundering homes on the West Side.</p>
   <p>The body had many lesions, but the fatal blow was one which almost severed the head from the body. There is a great deal of conjecture respecting the murderer, but he may be among the many Veneno's rivals.</p>
   <p>"El Veneno"was so named, because of his bad conduct.</p>
