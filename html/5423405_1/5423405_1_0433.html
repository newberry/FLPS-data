   <p>The Spanish Colony of Gary rejoices at the opportunity of being able to attend another of those pleasing dances to be given by the Club of United Spaniards, tomorrow. The dance according to custom will take place in the well known Castillo Espanol, and in order to render it a pleasing affair the popular Gary Orchestra has been engaged to furnish the music. There can be no doubt about the high place which the Club of United Spaniards holds among the Spanish speaking people of our neighboring city. It is an organization of the first order -as it should be.</p>
