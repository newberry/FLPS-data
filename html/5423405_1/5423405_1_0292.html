   <p>On the 20th of this month a group of progressive women agreed to organize the Femenil Excelsior Club in this locality. The purpose of this new organization is to promote different phases of manuel work such as making artificial flowers, needle-work, painting, woodwork and others, and to make an exhibit of these some time in the future.</p>
   <p>The women who make up the Directorate of this Club are: Mrs. P. M. de Cornejo, President; Mrs. H.R. de Cornejo, Vice-president; Miss Elvira Ramirez, secretary; Mrs. Felipe de la Rosa, treasurer.</p>
   <p>We wish this new organization a complete success.</p>
