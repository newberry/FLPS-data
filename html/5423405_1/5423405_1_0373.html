   <p>"South Chicago Serenaders" is the name of an orchestra recently organized in South Chicago. This orchestra will be directed by our friend Cirilo Rodriguez. This, of course, has caused a good impression. This orchestra is coming forward with a large repertoire of the best dancing music. The colony is very happy to have at its disposal an orchestra so promising in our social activities. We wish to congratulate this new group of musicians and at the same time to wish them success.</p>
