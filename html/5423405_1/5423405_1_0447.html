   <p>Great festival for September 7th at Soldiers Field. The committee on arrangments solicited the cooperation of the societies Miguel Hidalgo Costilla, and Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez who unhesitantly accepted. To the effect they have engaged the famous Mexican artist Chiquita Rangel who will organize several artists in order to present the best artistic attractions to the people of Chicago. The Mexican Consul is supporting this enterprise morally, and has offered his whole cooperation.</p>
   <p>We are informed that twelve nationalities are scheduled to participate in this important event. It is estimated that the Mexican group will comprise at least sixty participants. Half of this number will dance various national dances, and the rest will sing our folklore songs. However it is expected that not less than 1,700 persons will appear on the stage on September 7, at the Soldiers Field including the twelve foreign groups taking part in this gigantic celebration.</p>
