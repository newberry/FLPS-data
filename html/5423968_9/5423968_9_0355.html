   <p>Ten years have elapsed since the death of one of the greatest writers in the history of the Polish nation, Henry Sienkiewicz. The city of Warsaw, capital of Poland, paid homage to the memory of this great master of the pen by holding honorary services. But at this time, we must ask, what has been done by the Polish element in America in this direction. It is true, the Polish press in America released notices and lengthy editorials in regard to this very monentous occasion, the anniversary. But it is quite evident that the matter is considered closed at this point.</p>
   <p>Granted, we may be engrossed in the work that current affairs and events of the day bring us; but shall we continue to bury in oblivion, the oncoming anniversaries, as completely as we have buried this tenth anniversary of the death of this great man? Is the Polish-American element sufficiently satisfied to commemorate the memory of this great writer with nothing more than a few newspaper articles, appearing on, or shortly before the anniversary. This simple gesture will not adequately justify this noble cause. Our National sentiment and pride should not allow us to pass up the day marking the death of this great man, as only another calendar day. The time to act is now, by inaugurating an educational movement to stimulate the life of Polish spirit in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This spirit is now in an advanced stage of petrification. It is not interested in Polish literature; and is becoming disinterested in Polish-American life in general. Therefore, it does not lend any importance to the development of Polish culture; but leaves it, instead in a sad state of neglect.</p>
   <p>Old Polish pioneers who were born in Poland, and who brought the love of National spirit, with them, have fond recollections of the heavenly joy they derived from acting the works of Mickiewicz, Slowacki, Krasinski, and Sienkiewicz, great Polish poets and writers; and from time to time they visit and seek out the works of Polish authors in the libraries of the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union and many other public libraries. However, the Polish-American youth does not listen to reason; and he does not see the objective and purpose of these visits to the libraries. The result is that we hear, on many occasions the following questions: "What shall be our fate? "Will we eventually divorce ourselves from our nationality and adopt the language and customs of other?" We are at a loss to find logical answers to the above questions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This, most certainly, is the opportune time for the Polish press in America to start a powerful and nationwide drive to stimulate and create the habit of reading not only the works of authors in the language of America and other foreign nations; but of Sicnkiewicz and many other illustrious writers of Polish origin. We are sure a campaign of this kind would bring about the desired results. In addition to newspaper propaganda let us organize Literary Circles of Polish Art. Favorable American propaganda, advocating literature now holds first place; in second place, we find the English; in third, the German-Jewish; but further search of statistics, reveals little or no propaganda designated to Polish literature. Of course, the reason for this is that during the era when the development of literary works reached its highest peak, Polish literature was suppressed by those nations who dominated Poland namely; Russia, Germany and Austria and who continued to obliterate their literature, speech, and customs until Poland was declared a free and independent nation.</p>
   <p>In 1919, the land regained its indentity and was no longer looked upon as merely a geographic unit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Therefore, in this short time we cannot expect to be ranked on an equal basis with other nations, but we can do much to improve our position. In scanning the many text-books used in public, elementary and highschools and colleges, only a few paragraphs are devoted to matters relative to the Polish nation or its people. Through this proposed constructive literary propaganda, we could expect and would receive more notice, and could place pupils of Polish descent on par with those of other nationalities, building thereby, a National pride and greater prestige.</p>
   <p>The questions of vital importance are: "How can the Polish youth in America become interested in national and international affairs? or, to what source can he turn, to learn how to respect most fervently the land of his people?" To these questions and serious problems there is but one answer, and-that answer is the propagation of Polish literature. This campaign for literary supremacy, will be a test of our influence and interest in national activity. In this hard struggle we have no room for petty differences such as a Political opinion, foreign or domestic. Here in the United States, where freedom of speech is a constitutional right, nothing should stand in the way of progress.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Our shortest route to success is through the introduction of Polish books, particuarly those written by H. Sienkiewicz, to our younger generation. The efforts of only one newspaper to carry on this propaganda would be futile, and to no avail, therefore, we appeal to all of our fellow members of the Polish Press to cooperate. With such a united front we cannot fail. Let this tenth anniversary of the death of Henry Sienkiewicz stand out in full view as a burning cross, to attract the attention of all. And let us, in this same manner, retain this nationwide attention; not only by public manifestations and memorials to this great man; but let us all become throughly familiar with his works which will be here for all time, and shall be considered masterpieces worthy only of the pen of a literary genius. Let us then, in this practical manner, learn to observe to our great advantage, our important National anniversaries.</p>
