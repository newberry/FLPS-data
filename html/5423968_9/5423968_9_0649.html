   <p>The Kosciusko festival to be held on July 4 at Schuetzen Park is gaining momentum.</p>
   <p>In our Monday issue we published a report of a meeting held by the societies in Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The societies' representatives accepted the play enthusiastically and agreed to support it at the next meeting of their organizations.</p>
   <p>It can be truthfully said here that most of the societies in the parish have already declared themselves in favor of the project. In fact, some of them have decided that their members consider it their duty to attend this picnic for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument. Those unable to attend will have to make contribution for the monument.</p>
   <p>This is a good idea. Nobody can be forced to take part in a festival. Members wishing to celebrate the Fourth of July in any other manner may do so without interference, but all of them, without exception, should fulfill their patriotic duty by contributing something for the monument.</p>

   <p>It is time that this monument to the memory of our great Thaddeus Kosciusko was erected in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In order to complete the required amount, the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish societies will no doubt do more than their share, for which they deserve due credit and honor.</p>
