   <p>The Parish of All the Saints Church in Chicago is founded on the West Side and is the first one which withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church. In January of 1895 a very young vicar (assistant) of Rev. Barzynski, Rev. Anton Kozlowski, having adherents and supporters among parishioners, started to organize a free-from-Rome independent parish.</p>
   <p>On May of the same year a small chapel was built, at which Rev. A. Kozlowski began to fulfill he duty as a regular priest. Two years later, that is, in 1897, Rev. A. Kozlowski was elected bishop, and after that he received a bishop's hat from the hands of bishops of the old Catholic Church in Europe.</p>
   <p>With his cordial and truthful devotion to his duty and work for his people, the late Right Rev. Bishop Kozlowski has received the sympathy and acknowledgment of his believers to such an extent that they still keep him in their reverential remembrance. Not very long did he perform <span class="page-break">2</span>his duty as a bishop, because in 1907, on January 14th, he departed from this temporal life. After his death, for two years, the function of pastor was administered by the late Rev. Tomaszewski. After the death of Rev. Tomaszewski, the parish was transferred to the Polish National Catholic Church, under the jurisdiction of Right Rev. Bishop F. Hodura. The first parish priest of the Polish National Catholic Church was Rev. Lawnicki, who officiated as a parish priest for two years. After him the parish priest's duty was performed by Rev. Joseph Plaga for eight years. Rev. Mirek was next till the end of the year 1926, when Right Rev. Bishop Leon Grochowski came to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Societies. At this parish are organized and exist various societies. To the oldest societies belong the sorority, "Society of Sister Workers," which has over 300 members; the Brotherhood of Temperance, the Society of Young Men of St. Stanislau, the Second One of St. John the Baptist. The three societies of Virgins, the Society of God's Mercy to Women, and the Society of God's Mercy to Men, which has about seventy members.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>At the parish exist the three choirs. The choir of Saint Cecilia, composed of over 100 female singers; the younger choir of All the Saints, of female singers, and choir of male singers of Saint Agnes. In the last year there was created at that parish the Christian School of Life, which is attended by over 150 youngsters and children.</p>
   <p>(Next is a picture of Right Rev. Bishop Leon Grochowski). The foundation of the bishop's See, or Cathedral.</p>
   <p>Because of many very important reasons the parishioners decided to build a new cathedral for their bishop. The actual action, which began a year ago, and according to the members is supported with satisfaction materially and financially by all the parishioners. In that short time there has been collected for the above mentioned purpose $44,000, and it is supposed that the sum for that purpose, with all its income and savings, will reach to $50,000. In the spring of the year 1930 the new building will be started. We are convinced that during the next two <span class="page-break">4</span>years the beautiful sanctuary of the National Church will be built and proportionally it will have very few debts.</p>
   <p>Place and Opportunity for Cultural, Social and Religious Work. The city of Chicago possesses an adaptable location, position and conditions for the work to our church. Even the Roman-Catholic clergy in their publications report that in the city of Chicago there are over 100,000 Poles who do not belong to any religion or church at all. It is evident that this group has been offended and imbued with prejudice or aversion to the Roman-Catholic Church, and with all probability will not return again to that church. But it is our duty to get those people again for God, for Jesus Christ. God gave us the orders as a Samaritan mission to heal and cure the wounds and help the injured people. This work has been successful for us. During one year, 1928, we have organized at Chicago two parishes. The Polish people gregariously supported our efforts. The churches were filled to capacity with the believers. We need only zealous and devoted priests, preachers imbued with God's <span class="page-break">5</span>spirit, and our mission work very quickly will fill the rows with the believers of the National Church.</p>
   <p>The founder of the National Church, Right Rev. Bishop Francis Hodur (sic), ought to feel very satisfied with the development of that godly action, to which he has devoted all his life. God has permitted him to see the result of his hard work. Let God bless him with a long life and (enable him) to see the Polish National Catholic Church become the church of the entire Polish nation.</p>
