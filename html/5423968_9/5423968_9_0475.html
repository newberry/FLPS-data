   <p>Commune 80 of the Polish National Alliance and the Adam Mickiewicz Education and Library Society arranged exercises on Sunday, February 4, 1917, at the Adam Mickiewicz hall, 3308-10 South Morgan Street, commemorating the January Insurrection.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Gniatczynski, president of the commune, opened the meeting promptly at 3 P. M., calling upon Mr. Pawlak to act as chairman and the undersigned as secretary.

   <p>1) The orchestra of the Society of King Jan Sobieski's Polish Sharpshooters, under the direction of Mr. A. Jakubowski, played Polish compositions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>2) Speech by Mr. S. Orpiszewski, editor of the Alliance publications. The speaker, in a short and terse address, honored the memory of the heroes who shed their blood for their native land. He discussed the gravity of the present situation, calling upon the Poles to help the starving people in Poland, and expressed strong faith in the resurrection of our homeland. Mr. Orpiszewski's speech was frequently interrupted by enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>3) The Helena Modjeska Singing and Dramatic Society, under the direction of professor J. J. Jokajtis, sang a medley of Polish melodies.</p>
   <p>4) Recitation "Bracia Rocznica" (Brothers Anniversary), by Miss Irene Grzebielski.</p>

   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>6) The orchestra played a medley of Polish songs while a collection was being taken up for Polish relief by Miss F. Okon, Mrs. Mach, and Misses Sawacki and Marczewski. The collection yielded $19.25.</p>
   <p>7) Song, "Hej Lec Ptaku," by the local choir of Raftsmen under the direction of Mr. L. A. Cieszykowski, organist of St. Barbara's Parish.</p>

   <p>9) A second speech by Mr. S. Orpiszewski, who urged the people to join the Polish National Alliance, which protects future generations from losing their national identity and fosters the national spirit. "This Alliance," he said, "has helped one hundred and twenty medical and law students, who are now useful members of our community. The Polish National Alliance has established two hundred and fifty libraries from which the Polish people can gain enlightenment <span class="page-break">4</span>and strengthen their national spirit."</p>

   <p>12) The chairman thanked the audience for attending in such large numbers despite the blizzard and cold.

   <p>13) Everybody joined in the singing of "Boze cos Polske" (God Save Poland), with the orchestra accompanying. All the numbers were excellently performed, <span class="page-break">5</span>as was evidenced by the applause.</p>
