   <p>Long live the League and the patriots who work for the good of the League and the Polish Nation.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, Sunday May 13, we held a parish meeting after vespers at St. Michael Archangel Parish Hall in South Chicago. The hall was filled to capacity by the patriotic parishioners.</p>
   <p>After settling a few matters, concerning only our parish, Reverend A. Nowicki, our pastor, briefly but clearly explained the meaning of the recent Polish mass meeting and the importance and usefulness of the newly founded Polish <span class="page-break">2</span>League. He explained to us the aims, endeavors and needs of the League.</p>
   <p>After the speech those in the audience promised unanimously to join the League. Many promised that they would enlist their children. There was in the audience not a single dissenter, not one "sleeping Thomas" who would promise to join, but probably not until a year from now.</p>
   <p>No! Here in South Chicago we do not have to wait for the conventions to show our patriotism, we do not have to ask somebody's permission to do so. On the contrary, whenever we see a national cause that contributes toward the welfare of the Poles, then we do not hesitate, but with all our heart and all our might we all, like one man, do our duty for the cause.</p>
   <p>Kosciusko set an example of how we should act. Could Kosciusko have gained immortal fame, could he have accomplished so much good for our motherland if he had waited with folded hands instead of acting? No, indeed!</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Kosciusko, seeing an opportunity to help his country, devoted all his efforts toward that end. So our parishioners followed his example.</p>
   <p>Many prominent men from all parts of the United States participated in the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The ideals of the League are praised by everyone, as may be proven by the telegrams received from all over the country and even from Europe. The constitution of the League is exceptionally good, and even those who claim that it is a copy of the constitution adopted by the Polish National Alliance cannot say anything against it. Gentlemen, does not this prove that our League is good even for you?</p>
   <p>Many of our parishioners are members of the Polish National Alliance and also of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. As they are all logical men and good patriots, they understand the importance of the League, and they all <span class="page-break">4</span>joined the League at the meeting yesterday.</p>
   <p>We are not children, hence we do not act like children; we do not allow ourselves to be affected by side issues, but like real men we work for the good of the nation.</p>
   <p>After the meeting our patriots contributed $7.82 for the Polish National Fund. This is a small sum but it is sufficient for these hard times.</p>
   <p>It takes a noble spirit to perform a noble deed. When a pastor is a good patriot his parishioners are full of patriotism. All honor to patriotic priests. All honor to the patriotic parishioners, members of the League.</p>
   <p>One of many.</p>
