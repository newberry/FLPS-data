   <p>Why is it that there are so many beggars in Poland and so few in America? Someone would say that Poland is a poor country, while America still enjoys prosperity. There is some truth in that, yet before the war, as we remember, the number of beggars in Poland was far above the present number.</p>
   <p>We believe that there are more people depending on public support in America than in Poland. But in this beautiful country of ours lives a great majority of Christians who abandoned the Pope and drew nearer to Christ.</p>
   <p>Through this approach to Christ these Christians understood that neither the Pope nor any other mortal can save us; that our salvation depends entirely on our compliance with the teachings of Jesus.</p>
   <p>The clergy in Poland could take the United States as an example, and set up special institutions for the poor; they could organize a great charitable program as it is being done here.</p>

   <p>We are certain that the government in Poland and the Polish society there would greatly assist in an enterprise that helps to restore human dignity to those unfortunate beggars.</p>
   <p>Yet, we are afraid that the papal clergy will not agree to such an action, because they want to make money even on the most unfortunate; we do not believe they would ever consent to public control of the collected donations.</p>
   <p>Here, in the United States, all charitable institutions have been maintained and assisted by all the people regardless of their religion, and that is the reason why there are no beggars in America.</p>
   <p>In Poland the charitable program is conducted by the Roman clergy and the society has no control over the collected money. That is why the convents and other similar institutions in Poland are growing richer, and the army of beggars is becoming bigger and bigger.</p>
