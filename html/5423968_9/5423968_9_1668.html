   <p>Almost in every issue of the Przebudzenie one can find articles stressing the need of the Polish National Church for Poles in America, and revealing the disadvantageous and even injurious attitude of the Papal Church with regard to our Fatherland, nation and language.</p>
   <p>One would think that those articles express personal opinions of the staff of our weekly. In order to convince our readers that all those articles are founded on principles voiced by the most renowned Polish historians and philosophers, we presume to cite an excerpt from the System of National Pedagogy, a work by an eminent Polish novelist, B. F. Trentowski:</p>
   <p>"At the end of the 10th century the Christian faith has been established in Poland. That was our good luck because we have been bound once and for all with Western Europe, whose destiny was higher civilization, education and freedom.</p>

   <p>"But at the same time it was our great misfortune, because it exposed us to the unconditional power of the not always saintly successors of St. Peter. This power through intrigues infected our minds and brought about innumerable disasters. The Pope looked upon Poland as a province of the new Roman state, and offered our country as a fief to the German feudal princes. Hence the numerous wars between the Poles and German princes, until the decisive battle on Psie Pole (Dog's field). Had not Poland won that battle, we would have shared the fate of Bohemia and Moravia.</p>
   <p>"The same Roman-Catholic power was menacing our language, branding it as a 'barbaric' speech. The Polish language has been removed from the church services and instead the dead Latin has been introduced.</p>
   <p>"The Latin language was as injurious to us as the policy of Rome. Already at that time Polish was not a chaotic mixture, but a clear, original and cultivated language.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"In short, we have to admit that what the barbarians were to Old Rome, the New Rome was to us. Rome never ceased to be a rapacious and blood-thirsty monster. For many, many years the Poles hated this religion, which always threatened the integrity of Poland as a nation."</p>
   <p>Referring to the ideals of the Independent National Church, the same author in another work under the title Pantheon of Human Knowledge, says: "An independent nation can create its own moral ideals and develop itself accordingly. The adversaries of any progressive current will certainly hinder the development of the nation; but finally they will have to yield to the most sacred rights of an independent people."</p>
