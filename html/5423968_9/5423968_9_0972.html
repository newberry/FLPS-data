   <p>8. Speech by the pastor, Reverend Fuhrman. He spoke of the valiant <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>deeds of our forefathers, what they achieved, and what we should do today. The reverend speaker exhorted all to unity and peace and added that we should be happy to have found sympathy among the other American citizens. The audience was well satisfied with these [words] by the pastor and applauded him time and again. It was evident then that our pastor, although here only a short time, has already earned the love and respect of all; may Almighty God preserve him for us a long time!</p>
   <p>9. The members of the St. Buszczynski Society sang "Nasza Piesn" (Our Song).</p>

   <p>In conclusion the audience sang "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that the hall was beautifully decorated with transparencies and draperies, for which the committee deserves due credit and thanks.</p>
