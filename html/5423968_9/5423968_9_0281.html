   <p>Divine Services were conducted yesterday, July 8, in the lower church of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, as is done on the first Friday of the month, for the benefit of our suffering Fatherland. Such devotional services are held on the first Friday of every month in accordance with the constitution of the Polish Patriotic Organization. The members of this organization gathered in their regular meeting hall after which they went in pairs to church, where the Reverend O. Kobrzynski was concluding the evening ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Reverend W. Barzynski then ascended the pulpit and began a sermon on the infinite love of God for humanity. He indicated that this love demands on the part of the people as great love of God as they are capable of, aided naturally by Divine grace. Love is adequate and worthy only when it is sanctified by its direction toward God. This direction gives truth, worth and effectiveness to the love of the Fatherland as well. He further talked eloquently of the great and holy obligation of loving our Fatherland, and of the ways and means of fulfilling this obligation.</p>
   
   <p>After this eloquent lesson which was heard with great fervor by the many men and women congregated there--the church was filled to capacity--the blessing of the Holy Eucharist followed.</p>
   <p>As many Poles as possible should attend this service. It is better to lament the misfortune of our Fatherland silently to God once a month than it is to rant daily about its reconstruction without the aid of God.</p>
