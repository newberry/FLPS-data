   <p>The second article in the Lwow Przeglad relative to the Poles in America is devoted to the social and intellectual life of our compatriots in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This life is evident in our Polish societies and organizations. The author refers to the three important organizations which have their headquarters in Chicago: The Polish Roman Catholic Union, under the guidance of the Blessed Heart of Jesus; the Polish Roman Catholic Union, under the guidance of the Holy Mother of Czestochowa; and the Polish National Alliance. He points out the fact that misunderstandings between these institutions tend to create much evil among the Poles.</p>
   <p>The author also deals with these organizations separately and sees much good <span class="page-break">\2</span>in each. The leaders of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, under the guidance of the Blessed Heart of Jesus (The article was written prior to the diet at Manistee--editor's note) are dealt with in the following way:</p>
   <p>"The chairman of the Union is Peter Kiolbassa, City Treasurer, whose name often appears at the head of the list of Polish-American immigrants. Reverend Vincent Barzynski, C. R., is the spiritual councilor. This same P. Kiolbassa and Reverend Barzynski are the organizers of the first Polish parish in Chicago; both have made extraordinary sacrifices in the form of service for the spread of Polish life in Chicago."</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance is also dealt with favorably:</p>
   <p>"This society not only has a noble aim but its activities are widespread. Unfortunately its aim is not carried out scrupulously. Its membership <span class="page-break">\3</span>numbers over four thousand. The highest ranking officer is the Alliance Censor. Only recently this office was given to Mr. Przybyszewski of Bay City, Michigan, who, according to what I have heard, is a young and energetic individual. The Alliance accepts everyone into its fold regardless of his religious belief. This is the major cause of the friction between the Polish National Alliance and the two organizations of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. The founder of the Alliance was Mr. Andrzeykowicz of Philadelphia, one of the most able men of that city."</p>
   <p>Further along in the article the author mentions the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Under the Guidance of the Holy Mother of Czestochowa, but does not deal with the last diet of the organization. It is apparent that the article must have been written before the convention, perhaps in June or the early part of July (the article was published in the early part of August).</p>
   <p>Considering the principles of reciprocity of our Polish organizations, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>author writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"One of the greatest misfortunes of the Polish societies of influence in America is that they are continually at odds with one another. This sets a very bad example, and promotes hate and disunion among individual Poles. The blame lies on both sides, but the greater part of it rests on the Polish National Alliance."</p>
   <p>The author of this article continues to write about the cause of this rift between the Alliance and the Union, contending that it originated from the frauds of Morgenstern and the diet in Buffalo. This matter is erroneously stated. In the first place, the diet at Buffalo did not take place after the abuses of Morgenstern were revealed, but before, Secondly, the break and friction, in a more important form, took place before the diet at Buffalo. This inaccuracy, along with a few others, tends to lessen the value of the article.</p>
   <p>It must, however, be admitted that the article is written with honest intent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It points out humorously the hate of some of the members of the Alliance toward the pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The author states that "whatever has been the gain of Chicago lies directly or indirectly in the deeds of Reverend Vincent Barzynski." In order not to be adjudged guilty of flattery we do not repeat the author's entire comment about this, but we feel that it is our duty to say that the writer highly praises the efforts of Reverend Barzynski and uses them as an example to others.</p>
   <p>That he does not praise the activity of the common clergy in the same manner, is due to the fact that the writer is a clergyman himself. He states in the article that "there are many Polish priests in America who do not carry out their duties to the letter." To clear up the misunderstanding and the unfortunate results of it, the author suggests "the sending of a special apostolic vicar from Rome to Chicago."</p>
   <p>After making an observation relative to the quarrel between the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the author comes to the conclusion that the differences will gradually disappear and peace will result (We <span class="page-break">\6</span>trust to God that this prediction will come true!....).</p>
   <p>The author of "Poles in America," in dealing with the Polish press in Chicago, considers the Gazeta Katulicka (Catholic Gazette) and the Reforma (Reform) to be the best edited. (Undoubtedly this is before the editorship of Mr. Rybakowski who took over the chair during the latter part of August.)</p>
   <p>The following account, which deals with the Chicago schools and working conditions, is interesting to note:</p>
   <p>"In every Polish parish of Chicago there exists a Polish school, where Polish instruction is given the pupils by nuns, either of the Holy Family of Nazareth order or the Felician; older children are given lessons by instructors. The largest school is located in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. In its beautiful building, which would be an asset to any city, are facilities that take care of four thousand children, who receive their training practically free <span class="page-break">\7</span>of charge. A four-year college, the first of its kind in America, is connected with the school; eight teachers are assigned to this division. The parish also has an orphanage where over one hundred orphans are being sheltered. A large Polish hall, containing a stage, a dance floor and seats for five thousand persons, has also been erected in the parish.</p>
   <p>"Several Polish-owned factories are also found in Chicago; only Polish workers are employed. In the Polish communities are found many Polish stores. Many American firms find it to their advantage to hire Polish clerks and salesmen, for otherwise the Polish people would not continue to patronize these stores."</p>
   <p>The author also touches upon the political affairs of the Poles in America and considers their positions rather weak in view of the large number of Polish people. The following statement on this subject is made by the writer:</p>
   <p>"It happens many times that on election day the Polish citizen, instead of <span class="page-break">\8</span>casting his vote for the Polish candidate who is on the ballot, votes for the opposing candidate at the last minute. Because of this an Irish or German candidate invariably wins an office which under normal circumstances would go to a Pole, since the particular district is predominantly Polish."</p>
   <p>In this article, found in the Prezeglad, there are many true comments about our conditions. There also can be found a few inaccuracies, and some things are not mentioned, especially those concerning the Polish National Alliance. Nothing is said about its library, museum and the like. But on the whole the article deals with us impartially and favorably. Apparently the writer of "Poles in America" is an unbiased individual who does not belong to any faction and judges us without any prejudice.</p>
