   <p>All Poles who wish to participate in the erection of the Polish Hall on the Northwest Side of Chicago are requested to attend a mass meeting on monday, May 30, 1892, at Mr. M. Majewski's Hall, 779 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The preparatory work of the committee, chosen from the delegates of various organizations, is finished and the time for action has arrived. The delegates of these organizations decided, at a meeting on May 16, to call a mass meeting of all right-thinking compatriots. A report of the work accomplished thus far by the delegates will then be read. Afterwards an election will take place of "commissioners", who will be empowered legally to sell shares. The erection of a Polish Hall should lie close to the heart of every good Pole, irrespective of whether or not he belongs to the association. Consequently the greatest possible number of our people should meet at the time and place designated.</p>
