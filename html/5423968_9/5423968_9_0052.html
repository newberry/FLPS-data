   <p>The Polish mass meeting has ended and the Polish League has been founded. Now, we should consider the importance of these two occurrences. The founding of the Polish League is undoubtedly of great importance.</p>
   <p>One of the European journals, commenting upon the proposed mass meeting and the League, called it an epochal event in the history of Poland after the partition. In our opinion it is also an event of great importance in the history of our "Polonia" [Polish community in America].</p>
   <p>That the mass meeting was a success cannot be doubted. More than 230 delegates with 280 credentials from 34 Polish settlements in America attended the meeting. If we take into consideration the violent opposition of some of the Polish American newspapers to the mass meeting and to the League, the hostility of some organizations, the storm of personal hatred created by people of ill will, and, finally, the hard times we are now experiencing and the great distances that divide us, then we must admit that the result is very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>It is quite true that a few of the delegates left the mass meeting early. Some of them were from the Polish National Alliance, others were the progressives, but these were in the minority. However, even their departure was orderly, and without any unpleasant incident that would besmirch the first mass meeting of the Polish people in America. So much about the mass meeting. Now we will take up the question of the League.</p>
   <p>The League was founded at the mass meeting, and the Polish people in America will undoubtedly be greatly benefited by it. The League invites all the people in parishes and in settlements, where so far very little has been done for the Polish cause, to idealistic national work.</p>
   
   <p>The League has established a penny tax for the Polish National Fund. Its object is to awaken interest in Polish affairs. It unites almost all Poles in America into one great community and teaches them how to fulfill their duties toward themselves and toward their former country. The already existing organizations will neither be named nor belittled by the League, which is desirous of engaging in national work those hundreds of thousands who do not belong to Polish organizations.</p>
   <p>The founding of the League is a long step forward, if we take into consideration the present-day conditions. Perhaps this League, as it was founded at the mass meeting, deviates a little from the principles originally outlined in our appeal calling the gathering. Perhaps, on account of this, the more progressive element will not participate in it at present, and the radical elements will not participate in it at all. Perhaps this does not harmonize completely with the conception of the League, "Above all organizations". However, we should not be alarmed by this. Such is the will of the majority, to which we must surrender.</p>
   
   <p>Secondly, in the presence of the sentiment and conviction of our people in America, we must admit that only national work with a Christian background will be supported. Finally, the League does not violate anybody's convictions, and does not say anything about not tolerating other religious denominations; it only stipulates that no anti-Christian or anti-Catholic practices should be allowed in the League.</p>
   <p>On such a basis our holy faith will not suffer, and there is room for every person who, regardless of his convitions, will respect the convitions and beliefs of the majority, and will be willing to work with this majority for the national cause.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we hope that, in time to come, as the League unites more and more American Poles, and when in practice it shows its importance and usefulness, other elements which consider that a union is impossible today will join under this or that condition. The address of the censor of the Polish National Alliance at the mass meeting is the best guarantee of that.</p>
   
   <p>That the League has a great future can be proved by the great enthusiasm which it aroused everywhere. Although large organizations did not participate in it officially, yet the most active delegates were members of both Polish Roman Catholic Unions, the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Falcons.</p>
   <p>The League embraces a great field of activities. The one-cent tax will bind all Poles. It will teach all of us to work not only for our own benefit but also for the benefit of Poland. The founding of the League, however, showed that great differences still exist among us. But with the help of God these differences will become smaller and smaller. Some day we will all be united.</p>
