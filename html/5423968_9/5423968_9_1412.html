   <p>The third session of the Polish-American convention of journalists at Buffalo took place on July 5. This meeting was more important than the previous two meetings held yesterday. Many important resolutions were adopted and the articles of the constitution were fixed and put into effect the same day for all members of the new journalistic organization.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order at 9 A. M. After the settlement of the formal business, a long letter from S. Nawrocki of New York was read. Congratulations and sincere hopes for the complete success of the convention was expressed by the New York Pole.</p>
   <p>At this point Mr. Bernolak presented the proposed financial plan of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organization, suggesting that an entrance fee of one dollar be charged each member and a fee of twenty-five cents a month be assessed for administrative purposes. This was adopted.</p>
   <p>A report by the committee which was appointed to work on the regulations and articles of the constitution was the next item of business. The report was read by Henry Nagiel. Its first five articles dealt with the type of journalistic organization to be founded, and the six other articles, containing ten points, dealt with the principles of the organization.</p>
   <p>The text of this report will not be given for it is found in its entirety in a separate article in an adjoining column. We only wished to point out that after the reading of each article it was discussed separately. This open debate resulted in adopting the entire report with only a few changes. Mention must be made, however, that the fifth article, containing the condemnation of personal attacks and journalistic calumny, was unanimously <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>adopted.</p>
   <p>Upon a motion by Mr. Sadowski it was agreed (Article XI): that until the time that a constitution is completed the principles adopted at this convention should go into effect from this day, July 5, and should be binding upon each member of this society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Migdalski made a motion: that the prepared, amended and accepted rules and regulations of the constitution be accepted and confirmed in their entirety; this was seconded and passed. In this way a binding constitution, although temporary, became the law of an organization that was created only on the day before.</p>
   <p>A committee of three; namely, H. Nagiel, F. H. Jablonski and J. I. Migdalski, all of Chicago, was chosen to work out a complete and final constitution for the next convention.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Mr. Sadowski at this stage of the meeting made a motion that this alliance take up the matter of support for the mentioned principles of the Polish-American journalists. After careful deliberations on this matter, the following points were formulated by Messrs. Sadowski and Nagiel:</p>
   <p>1. To authorize the present officers of the society to appeal to the assembly for voluntary help and support in exceptional and urgent matters.</p>
   <p>2. To advise the constitution committee to work out in detail a method of support for the treasury of the organization.</p>
   <p>3. To make a collection at this session for the initial support of the treasury.</p>
   <p>On a motion made by C. Neuman the business dealing with the special matters in journalism was closed.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>This was followed by bringing up general social matters, which could only be adopted by a unanimous vote. Mr. Nagiel touched upon the relation of the Polish-American press towards the labor question.</p>
   <p>Mrs. H. Piotrowska presented the following resolution for consideration:</p>
   <p>"We journalists and publishers of Polish papers in America recognize the interest and aims of the workers as different from the aims and interests of the capitalists, and as journalists, functioning amid the Polish public in this country, we obligate ourselves always and everywhere to come to the support of the worker against the capitalists whenever possible."</p>
   <p>After a lively discussion in which H. Nagiel, C. Neuman, Osada and others took part, the motion was defeated when put to a vote; for only eight were in favor of it.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>However, the following motion made by H. Nagiel and C. Neuman dealing with the labor question was carried:</p>
   <p>"The convention realizes that the public and the Polish press in America ought to take a more active part in the labor question and show more interest in it, and especially recommends that the Polish press protect the interest of the Polish worker who represents the major portion of the Polish element in America."</p>
   <p>Another resolution presented by Mr. Nagiel was unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"The journalists convention considers the matter of establishing on a firm foundation an immigration home for Poles coming to this country as one of the most important needs of our society; and we further ardently urge its support and realization for the good of the Polish public as well as for the Polish press."</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The following resolution also presented by Mr. Nagiel was accepted:</p>
   <p>"The convention, deeming the Polish reading rooms in America as one of the best mediums of fostering Polish culture among our people, urges the press and the public not only to create but to spread the use of Polish reading rooms throughout America, and to give them their most ardent support."</p>
   <p>The final resolution to be adopted was made by J. F. Smulski:</p>
   <p>"The convention recommends that the Polish press and the Polish public of America energetically support the drive for the building of a Kosciusko monument in Chicago, and it further urges all Polish-Americans to make contributions toward this cause."</p>
   <p>Subsequently the resolution made by Mr. Sadowski in regards to racial and religious matters, the resolution made by S. Zahajkiewicz relative to the condemnation of the independent churches by the Polish press, the <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>resolution of Dr. Laskowski which asked for the public support of an institution for the welfare of the Polish people, and another motion made by Mr. Zlotnicki, all met defeat.</p>
   <p>This ended the business on general social matters.</p>
   <p>The collection of fees and contribution for the support of the temporary treasury followed. Mr. Sadowski presented a report of the former convention at Detroit in 1891 when eight dollars was collected, and he turned over the remainder of this money amounting to five dollars. The statement and money was accepted. The collection resulted in getting twelve dollars in entrance fees and four dollars in assessment fees. This money with that remaining from Detroit amounted to twenty-one dollars, which was turned over to the treasury.</p>
   <p>Besides the regular fees, $4.25 in voluntary contributions were also <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>turned over.</p>
   <p>After the settlement of the financial accounts the Polish Journalists Convention at Buffalo for 1895 was closed.</p>
