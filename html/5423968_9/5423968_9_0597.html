   <p>H.H. Cleveland, civil war veteran, sent out an appeal to the Polish people in Chicago to join the Americans in the Grand March, commemorating the 131-st Anniversary of the Birth of the American Flag. The March is sponsored by the Grand Army of the Republic, and is to be held Sunday, June 14, at Humboldt Park. Starting at Wicker Park, and proceeding by North ave., to Fairfield ave. and Division street to the main gate at Humboldt Park, it will pause at the Monument of Kosciuszko, to place wreaths and flowers at his feet. The March will terminate at the newly-erected Pagoda, where the choirs will sing appropriate songs; and speakers will deliver addresses.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cleveland-the old veteran of the civil war, who is acting in the name of his organization-informs us that automobile clubs, businessmen and army regiments from Fort Sheridan will also partake in the in the March. The time to plan is short, therefore, our organizations should act quickly through their respective boards to talk the matter over and, of course comply with the invitation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cleveland asks us to inform all concerned that they may call at 558 W. North Ave. for further details.</p>
