   <p>The delegates gathered early for the second day of the Polish Roman Catholic Union convention at the hall of the Saint Stanislaus Kostka school, and when the marshal sounded the gavel at 9:25 all were present. Before the business of the day was opened, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor at Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, said a prayer.</p>
   <p>The marshal ordered the secretary to read the minutes from the previous session. At the conclusion of the reading, Boleslas Klarkowski moved that the minutes be accepted without change. The motion was carried. Thereupon, at the request of the floor, the roll-call followed.</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski read a letter from Reverend Dominic Majer of Saint Paul, Minnesota, spiritual counsel of the Polish [Roman Catholic] Union of America, who wished that the blessing of God might prevail throughout the session of the convention, and that all difficult problems might be solved with ease.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the marshal asked the committee which had been ordered to look over the additions to the constitution and make alterations to submit its report. Delegate Szopinski read the statement of the committee. The first to be read was Article III, which deals with the aim of the Union.</p>
   <p>Considerable debate took place over this article, and no ready agreement could be reached between Reverend Barzynski, Anthony Rudnicki, Slisz, Lama, Stachowicz, Reich, Czerwinski, Grochowski, Mokwa, Ligman, Swietkowski, and others. In the end various charges were adopted, and the article was accepted in the following form:</p>
   <p>"The aim of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is to be the organization of all Polish Catholics, based as a unit upon the principles of the Roman Catholic faith and the national tradition [of Poland] for the purpose of mutual and material support. By the phrase 'moral support' it is understood 'promotion of friendship, unity, and true brotherly love; promotion of education in the Christian and national spirit, and the protection of Polish honor whenever occasion calls'. By 'material support' it is meant 'to provide such aid, in the form of payments to the family of a deceased member, as stipulated by the convention; as well as other useful and honorable assistance as may help relieve the burden of the members of the Polish Roman Catholic Union--and the payment of certain sums in the event of sickness, as well as the payment of funeral expenses, in part or in whole, depending upon the financial circumstances of the society to which the deceased member belonged."</p>
   <p>The second item to be read was that dealing with the amount of death benefit to be paid. This brought about an enthusiastic discussion, and by 11:30 A.M. one part of it had been agreed upon. It was decided that death benefits for men should vary from $250, $750, and $1,000 as soon as two, three, and four assessments were paid. As to the women the committee suggested a death benefit of $250.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, July 30, 1897.</p>
   <p>After the amounts to be paid for death benefits had been fixed, there was further discussion as to whether these changes should be incorporated in the constitution. Reverend Barzynski, Reverend [F.] Lange, and Delegate Wleklinski went over the matter thoroughly. Suggestions were offered by the president, C. Bielinski, and the marshal. Reverend Barzynski moved that these new changes go into effect thirty-days after the close of the convention. Delegate [P.] Ligman moved that ninety days should elapse, while Delegate [T.] Krolik moved that the change should become effective after January 1, 1898. [A.] Rudnicki and Reich intervened, and in conclusion it was moved to have the new changes become effective beginning January 1, 1898. After a vote, all were in favor, and the change was passed.</p>
   
   <p>Delegate [S.] Klarkowski then moved that, beginning from this convention until January 1, 1898, the Polish Roman Catholic Union pay death benefits of five hundred dollars after the death of a Male member and two hundred and fifty dollars after the death of the wife of a member. After a short discussion this motion was carried.</p>
   <p>The secretary then read the proposition of the committee to revise initiation fees. The proposition reads:</p>
   <p>"Members should pay to the treasury of the Polish Roman Catholic Union as follows: Members 18 to 25 years old,25 cents; 25 to 30 years, 50 cents; 50 to years, 75 cents; 35 to 40 years, $1; and 45 to 50 years, $1.50".</p>
   <p>This motion was carried without debate, and then the committee made another motion that "Women members should pay as follows: Members 20 to 30 years of age, 25 cents; 30 to 40 years, 50 cents; 40 to 45 years, 75 cents." This motion, too, was carried without discussion. This business completed, one of the delegates made a motion that inasmuch as it was 12 noon the meeting be adjourned until 1:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>At 2 P.M. the marshal's gavel called the convention to order. Reverend Szymanowski of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, asked for the floor to discuss two important matters. Having to leave that evening, he requested to be heard before the committees presented their reports. His request granted, the priest took the floor to say that the Immigration Home in New York, which is primarily supported by the Polish clergy was in dire need of help. He beseeched the delegates to propose to their respective societies a tax of one or two cents per month for the support of this Home. He stated that this had nothing to do with the convention, as it was a request for a voluntary contribution on the part of each society. Delegate Rudnicki moved to have this proposition accented, and his motion was carried.</p>
   <p>The second item in the order of the day was the claim of Mrs. Kokosinska, a widow, who asked for payment of death benefits for her husband's death. Her late husband had been a member of the Holy Trinity Society of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, but according to Reverend Szymanowski, he had been suspended by the secretary of the society for failure to pay his dues. The widow had made a plea to be paid, and the collectors of the Society came to her support on the grounds that the deceased had been suspended by error. The priest stated that he had the books of the society.</p>
   <p>Delegate Rudnicki motioned that the marshal appoint a committee of five to study claims of this nature. The motion was carried; the marshal named Reverend Rosinski of Cleveland, A. Rudnicki, P. Ligman, Swiatkowski, and Gliniecki of Bay City to the committee, which, together with the secretary of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and Szymanowski, repaired to another room to find a solution to the problem.</p>
   <p>Reverend V. Barzynski gave several letters that had just arrived to the recording secretary, who in turn handed them over to the marshal. The latter instructed the secretary to read them. The letters were from Reverend C. Rohowski of Bronson, [Michigan], who regretted that ill health had prevented him from coming: from Reverend Dabrowski of Detroit, who expressed his sorrow for not attending because of lack of time; and from the Sacred Heart of Jesus Society of Morris Run, Pennsylvania, appointing Mr. Wleklinski as its representative at the convention.</p>
   <p>When the reading was over, the marshal ordered Delegate Szopinski to continue the perusal of the suggestions of the committee.</p>
   <p>Save for small changes, the following motions were carried:</p>
   <p>"Assessments, or premiums, will be paid according to age.</p>
   <p>"The task of reclassification of assessments and announcement of new rates will be entrusted to a special committee appointed by the floor, which committee is to complete its work not later than sixty days after appointment. The results are to be turned over to the administration of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, which will immediately transfer all matters affecting the organization to the societies, ordering that the payment of the new assessments begin on January 1, 1898.</p>
   <p>"Every member of the Union, or his wife, is to pay one assessment in advance as a deposit and as a guarantee that assessments will be paid regularly.</p>
   <p>"The written assessment, depending upon the membership, is to be paid by the secretary of each society to the secretary of the Polish Roman Catholic Union within thirty days of receiving the order. Societies not abiding by this rule will be suspended and will forfeit their right to any claim against the funds of the parent organization.</p>
   <p>"Suspended societies may be reinstated within thirty days after the date of suspension if they pay their dues, providing that a death does not occur or a member becomes seriously ill in the meantime.</p>
   
   <p>"Every society belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union is to have its own president, secretary, and treasurer. The secretary and the treasurer are to post bonds, which will be kept by the administration of the Union.</p>
   <p>"A member who forty days after the date of his assessment is still in arrears, is to be suspended, and within forty-eight hours the secretary of the society is to send in to the secretary-general a suspension form supplied by the administration of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>"A suspended member can be reinstated within thirty days after the date of suspension if he presents himself in person at the regular meeting of his society, pays his dues, and is in good health. After thirty days,a suspended member, if he desires to be reinstated, must bring a certificate of his health from an approved physician."</p>
   <p>New changes concerning the organization of the Polish youth read as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"The committee urges the assembly to appoint a permanent commission which, with the approval and under orders of the administration of the Union, will be in charge of organizing our Polish youth."</p>
   <p>This motion was enthusiastically supported by several delegates. Delegate Szopinski moved that the commission be composed of five members; Delegate [J.] Mucha moved that seven be appointed; Delegate Lama requested that it be composed of members from various cities; and Reverend V. Barzynski suggested that the commission be authorized to name subcommissions in other cities.</p>
   <p>This gave rise to a heated debate, in which delegates Pyterek, Klarkowski, Mucha Polenz, and others took part. At last, the following motion was carried: "The commission is to be composed of seven members, who are to be appointed by the marshal at tomorrow's session." session."</p>
   <p>The next motion of the committee reads as follows: "To each assessment is to be added a tax of one, two, three, or four cents, depending upon the ability of a member or his wife to pay; which tax is to constitute a fund to be held in reserve against hard times or unexpected incidents."</p>
   <p>This motion was readily supported by several members of the assembly and adopted. Thereupon Delegate Szopinski informed the floor that the committee had no other motions to offer and moved for a thirty-minute recess. The motion was carried, and the marshal ordered the assembly to take it easy for half an hour.</p>
   <p>After recess, the marshal called the assembly to order, and since the Grievance Committee was ready with its report, he ordered its chairman to give it.</p>
   <p>Delegate Rudnicki, acting for the Grievance Committee, gave the following report:</p>
   <p>"Concerning the case of Kokosinski, of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, we have been unable to reach a conclusion because of lack of reliable evidence, since the book [membership book] of the society to which Kokosinski belonged contains doubtful signatures. Because of this we have decided to postpone this matter until more authentic evidence is received by Reverend Szymanowski from the collectors of the society in question. In the meantime the book and receipts of the society will be delivered into the custody of the secretary-general of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. A final decision will be given by the administration."</p>
   <p>This matter was further discussed. Debates followed in which many members took the floor. Delegate Tomasik moved that the report be accepted without changes, while Delegate Jozwik proposed that the collectors should make their reports under oath. Reverend Szymanowski informed the assembly that, pursuant to the wishes of the committee, the collectors would take an oath in the church. Reverend Lange moved that the oath be taken before a notary public and an affidavit to this effect submitted. In conclusion the report was accepted with the addition of Reverend Lange's suggestion.</p>
   <p>After the disposition of this matter, the marshal asked the floor to speak up, inasmuch as the Motions Committee had no more proposals to submit. This brought forth a barrage of motions from various delegates, the more important of which were as follows:</p>
   <p>Delegate Szopinski raised the question as to how the newly suspended societies that wished to be reinstated were going to be treated.</p>
   <p>Delegate Klarkowski moved that the societies in question be given ten days' time to pay their dues for reinstatement: Delegate Mucha suggested that thirty days' time be given. Lama moved in favor of Klarkowski and Tomasik in favor of Mucha. A discussion followed in which Ruszkowski, Tarkowski, Czerwinski, Rudnicki, Slisz, and other participated. Delegate Krolik pointed out that if the societies were to be reinstated, the Polish Roman Catholic Union would be liable for any death that occurred during the interim. In the end the marshal put the motion to a vote. Thirty votes were cast for the thirty-day period and thirty-two for the ten-day period.</p>
   
   <p>A lengthy discussion ensued over a question made by Delegate Armgart, who asked the floor what would happen to a member over 45 and up to date with his payments, if the society to which he belonged should be suspended by the parent organization. This was discussed by Reverend Barzynski, [J.] Arkuszewski, Mucha, Stachowicz, Slisz, and Ligman. Delegate Grochowski suggested that the member in question could try to get a transfer to another society.</p>
   <p>Delegate Wachowski made the following motion: "A member in good standing who leaves the city to reside on a farm where there is no group affiliated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union, should be maintained as a separate member."</p>
   <p>Delegates Bielinski, Banasiewicz, and Armgart took the floor on this matter. Szopinski presented the following motion as a substitute for Armgart's: "In cases of groups loyal to the Polish Roman Catholic Union but not large enough to form a society of their own, the administration of the Union is to issue them transfer cards to the closest society, under condition that they will be entitled to death benefits only, unless the society desires to make special concessions relative to the sick benefit plan. Delegate Bielinski added this: "If such members have their assessments paid to date." This motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Delegate [T.] Krolik asked the floor about the amount of entrance fee that would be charged to members of several years' standing and over 45 years of age in case their societies or they themselves should be suspended, but who desired to be reinstated. Delegate Szopinski informed the floor that the Assessments Committee would undoubtedly include such matters in its report.</p>
   <p>Delegate Slisz inquired as to how much surety should the secretary and treasurer of a society post. The president and marshal took voice on this matter, and Delegate Szopinski moved that the figure should be announced by the administration. This was passed.</p>
   
   <p>Delegate Klarkowski moved to take up the matter of a charter and that a committee be chosen to take care of this business.</p>
   <p>Reverend Barzynski, who apparently felt slighted, informed the floor that such a committee had been chosen at last year's convention in Philadelphia. This committee worked out an addition to the constitution which was presented and deferred until the special session now being held would accent a new constitution. "When this is done," he continued, "the matter of the charter will be taken up." This brought about a debate in which [P.] Kiolbassa, Mucha, Bielinski, Grochowski, and others took part. The result was that Klarkowski's motion was defeated.</p>
   <p>Delegate Smaglinski of Grand Rapids moved to appoint a committee to audit the books of the secretary. This motion was supported by Tomasik, who added that it be composed of five persons. The marshal appointed the following:</p>
   
   <p>Smaglinski, Slisz, Swiatkowski, Ratkowski, and Tomasik.</p>
   <p>Delegate Jozwik moved to appoint a special committee to work out an appeal to all societies not as yet belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union to join the organization under special conditions within thirty or sixty days.</p>
   <p>Delegate Szopinski moved to have the administration take care of this matter, and Delegate Mucha added that both the administration and the organ [Narod Polski] take this up. The motion passed; however, the floor did not permit the concession of special conditions.</p>
   <p>Delegate Slisz made a motion to choose a committee to examine the cost of publishing the organ of the Polish Roman [Catholic Union]. The marshal explained that this matter should be taken over by the committee that is going to examine the books of the secretary. Delegate Klarkowski insisted that a separate committee of three take over this duty. Lama seconded the motion, and the floor passed on it. The marshal appointed the following: Lama, Gasiorowski and Jachimowicz.</p>
   <p>Delegate Szopinski moved to appoint a resolutions committee. Delegate Klarkowski opposed this move on the grounds that it would duplicate the work of the Constitution Committee. As a result, the motion was defeated.</p>
   <p>Because no further motions were presented to the floor, Delegate Rudnicki asked for permission to say a word or two about the organ of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>He claimed that, above all, the form at Narod Polski should be altered considerably, and that this weekly should primarily concern itself with matters of the Union, since there are enough Polish newspapers which deal with conditions in general. Rudnicki then criticized the editing of the weekly during recent months. He asserted that the staff lowers and offends other individuals, editors, and such organizations as the Polish National Alliance, Polish Union, and others. The speaker suggested that these policies be abandoned, and that no insinuations or lies be cast at persons or institutions. Peace and harmony should be its objective, he concluded.</p>
   <p>Long enthusiastic applause was given the speaker as he sat down. His motions were eagerly supported.</p>
   <p>Delegate Manna pointed out that inasmuch as the main administration is going to issue certificates of membership, these certificates should be returned to it at the time of death and payment of insurance.</p>
   <p>Since it was 6 P.M. and no new motions had been presented, Delegate Slisz moved that the session be adjourned until the following morning at 9 o'clock. Reverend V. Barzynski informed the delegates that the next day was Friday and that requiem services for the dead members of the Union would be held at 8 A.M.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned by the marshal, who, before dismissal, asked the spiritual adviser, Reverend Gutowski, to say a prayer.</p>
