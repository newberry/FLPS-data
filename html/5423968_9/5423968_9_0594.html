   <p>Yesterday, under the auspices of the war veterans, who organized the "Grand Army of the Republic," we celebrated the 131st anniversary of the birth of the American flag. Although a strictly American celebration, yet, it became prominently Polish, because of the noticeable absence of Yankees. At the designated hour, about one thousand Poles gathered; probably 25 Americans were present. The parade was headed by divisions of Polish cavalry, followed by a few Poles in private automobiles and by hundreds of Polish people on foot. The chairman, Mr. T. M. Helinski, the most prominent speaker at the festivities, is also a Pole; he proposed staging similar celebrations in the future.</p>
   <p>It was deplorable to observe native born Americans lying on the lawn, unmindful of the near-by celebration, who, at most, upon hearing the stamping of our cavalry, raised their heads and asked in amazement: "What is it?" Our fore-fathers had a more profound respect for the flag, and spared not even their lives in its defense. The present generation seems to have no more regard for our standard than for an ordinary piece of cloth. We esteem and honor the American colors because under it we find security and freedom.</p>

   <p>Yesterday the Poles honored Kosciuszko, their national hero who fought under that banner; willing to sacrifice his life; the monument was decorated with two beautiful wreaths. Then they proceeded to the flagstaff where they did homage to our emblem, the symbol of national liberty; a custom which is followed by all great and patriotic nations.</p>
