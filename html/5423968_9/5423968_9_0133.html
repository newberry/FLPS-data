   <p>Last night's public appearance of the Polish Patriotic Organization at Bradley Street School hall was animated with [that] genuine patriotic spirit which characterizes our organization so beautifully.</p>
   <p>P. Ligman called on Reverend Prochowski to be chairman of the occasion and on Adam Szwajkart to be secretary.</p>
   <p>All numbers of the varied program were performed splendidly.</p>
   <p>Deserving of special mention is young Miss Mary Barzynski, who, notwithstanding the fact that it was her first public appearance, together with S. Szwajkart surprised her listeners delightfully with some artistic piano selections played with perfect calmness.</p>
   <p>P. Ligman spoke to the gathering, as usual very ardently, from a heart filled <span class="page-break">2</span>with patriotism.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecilia Choir thrilled the audience with the melodies of our beloved national songs.</p>
   <p>The young Falcons displayed great skill in the performance of their exercises. For this they are indebted to their leader and instructor, Ignace Kowalski, who later in the program delivered a short speech in which he encouraged the participants to join the proposed Polish League. This is our slogan: "Mass Meeting and Polish League".</p>
   <p>Vincent Jozwiakowski recited a poem about Wawel [Polish stronghold at Cracow] with great emotion.</p>
   <p>The Misses Zukowski and Barwik sang a duet very beautifully, and were rewarded with great applause. Kondziorski, also, thrilled the public with an added feature, a song entitled "It is Different With Us."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Our knights gave a fine show by staging a sham battle. Hey, boys, let us go after the Russians as soon as possible!</p>
   <p>The occasion was closed by Reverend V. Barzynski, who delivered a short address, after which the public sang "God Save Poland". This is another proof that the Polish Patriotic Organization is endeavoring to educate our young generation.</p>
   <p>Adam Szwajkart,</p>
   <p>secretary</p>
