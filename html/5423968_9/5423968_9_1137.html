   <p>New Year's Day was a gala occasion for two hundred members and guests at the special dinner-dance banquet sponsored by the Polonia Citizens' Club at St. Constantia's parish auditorium. During the course of the dinner, Professor M. S. Szymczak, vice-president of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank--a Polish institution--presided as toastmaster. After a short address, depicting the aims and accomplishments of the Club, he called upon the president, Felix Nowaczek, manager of the Noble Printing Company. In his short discourse, he wished every one health and happiness throughout the New Year. He also asked the pastor of St. Constantia's Church, Reverend Alexander Knitter, to organize a like organization among young men and women of the parish. Before dinner was served, Rt. Reverend F. A. Rempe, pastor of St. Clement's Church, lead the entire assemblage in prayer.</p>

   <p>While the guests were feasting sumptuously, the toastmaster related a humorous story. Although he was handicapped by a cold, he managed to get a hearty laugh from everybody. The dinner was prepared and served by the members of St. Constantia's parish.</p>
   <p>After the meal, the superintendent of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, Martin R. Lynn, was called upon as the first speaker of the evening. Mr. Lynn praised the work of the Polish element in the Forty-first Ward, where he is the secretary of the Republican Club. Besides his many official duties, Mr. Lynn manages to play the role of good Samaritan occasionally. At the conclusion of his talk, he wished everyone a Happy New Year.</p>
   <p>Finke's Orchestra played an interlude of English songs, both classical and popular. After the musical pause ended, Attorney Marion G. Kudlick, president of the Jefferson Park Businessmen's Association was called to the stand. His visit to Poland was the theme of his discussion. Some of the highlights of the trip, including a visit to Warsaw, were given. In the final words of his <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>speech, Marion Kudlick spoke about the objectives of the Polonia Club.</p>
   <p>Thomas Knapik was greatly applauded when he paid tribute to Reverend Knitter and Mr. Szymczak. Mr. Knapik is a co-partner in the building and loan firm of Knapik and Erickson.</p>
   <p>A great hand was given to the Commissioner of Portage Park, Albert Groskopf.</p>
   <p>A sign from the toastmaster brought forth more melodic tunes from Finke's Orchestra. At the beginning of a lively tune, a commotion was started at the entrance of the hall. All eyes were turned towards that direction. A vociferous man tried to get past the doorman, but to no avail. He explained loudly that he was invited to this affair by the Superintendent of the Forest Preserves, who also promised him a job. But the doorman would not let him pass. This only brought another tirade of gesticulations.</p>
   <p>"My name is 'Ike Goldblatt,' and I demand an audience with superintendent of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Forests," the intruder demanded. Two men took him by the arm, and he was forcibly thrown out. Immediately afterwards, the stage screen went up, and the same individual made his appearance, much to the surprise of the audience. As it turned out this "Ike Goldblatt" was none other than the popular Walter Bialczak. The entire incident was a part of his act. "Ike Goldblatt" gave a humorous monologue. The audience went wild with applause at his exit.</p>
   <p>Judge Victor P. Arnold was then called upon by Mr. Szymczak. He spoke briefly about his work and on the behalf of his colleague, Leroy Millner, Republican Committeeman of the Forty-first Ward, who could not attend the affair because of illness.</p>
   <p>The speakers' stand thus far seemed to have been occupied by all Republicans. However, the toastmaster broke the 'monopoly' by saying a few words about the Democratic party. He apologized for the absence of Thomas J. Bowler and Commissioner Francis Wilson, both Democrats, who were unable to attend because of unforeseen obstacles.</p>

   <p>Short speeches were made by the following: Fr. Oscar Strehl, assistant at St. Clement's parish, spoke about the work being carried out by the Polish people in the Jefferson Park district. The work of Reverend Knitter was extoled by Rt. Reverend Rempe.</p>
   <p>Reverend Knitter was the last speaker of the evening. He thanked his parishioners for the splendid cooperation they have offered him during the past year. Thanks were also extended to the Polonia Club for its support. Reverend Alexander Knitter promised to work harder during the new year, even more than he has in the past eleven years as pastor at this parish. He informed the audience that he will leave for Detroit, Mich., where he will attend the funeral services of his close friend, John Zynda, immediately after the banquet. He closed the dinner with a prayer, and bid his friends adieu.</p>
   <p>The table and chairs were cleared from the center of the floor and the orchestra, already on the stage, began playing popular dance tunes. The dance lasted until <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>Besides those persons already mentioned, many other prominent guests were present.</p>
