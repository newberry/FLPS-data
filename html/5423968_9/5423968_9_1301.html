   <p>The final session of the Eighth Convention of the Polish Women's Alliance was opened on Saturday, September 24, 1910, by Mrs. P. Tomaszewska, chairman of the Convention. After this formality, the Correspondence Committee was asked to read the letters at hand. The letter of Mrs. Jaworska, in which she proposes a certain location in the vicinity of St. Adalbert's parish as a new site for the headquarters for the Polish Women's Alliance, was left for future consideration. Similar disposal was accorded to letters from the St. Elisabeth's Welfare Society, asking financial assistance for the orphanage under its management. A letter from St. Vincent's Home and Orphan Asylum, requesting a donation for the erection of a chapel, was also left for future discussion.</p>
   <p>Relative to the proposed site for the headquarters of the Alliance, Mrs. Widna made a motion to erect a building on the Northwest Side. This motion accepted, another motion was made and passed, appropriating a sum not to exceed $25,000 <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for the construction of the new permanent headquarters of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>A lengthy resolution of the Eighth Convention of the Polish Women's Alliance was then read. This resolution calls upon all the members to further and put into practice the principles and patriotic ideals of Polish womanhood in America. The primary goal of the organization is to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the Polish women in America and those of the motherland; to perpetuate the language, traditions, customs, literature, art, and other characteristics of Poland, characteristics which have made her the most outstanding cultural nation of the world. The Alliance proposes to do all this by endeavoring to maintain--through the establishing of libraries and the giving of aid to ambitious, but needy, members--a high standard of culture and education among the Polish women in America.</p>
   <p>The resolution further states that the next convention will be held two years from now. Furthermore, the Alliance wishes to express its sincere gratitude <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to the government of this nation for the freedom accorded to all national groups, especially to the Poles, to retain and further the traditions and customs of their ancestors. In return for all this, the Polish Women's Alliance pledges to support the laws of this nation. It also pledges that it will do its best, at all times, to encourage friendly relations between the Poles of America and Poland, maintaining that, through the efforts of both countries, Poland will again rise to her former glory and independence.</p>
   <p>The resolution was then accepted unanimously amid thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Following this, the next business of the Convention was the election of the administration for the ensuing two years. Mrs. A. Neumann was elected president and Mrs. M. Weyna, vice-president. The following were elected as vice-presidents of the Alliance in the various states: Mrs. S. Wawrzon, Indiana; Dr. K. Filipiak, Ohio; Mrs. F. Szymanska, Michigan; Mrs. S. Petrowska, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Wisconsin; and Mrs. A. Budaj, Connecticut.</p>
   <p>The post of General Secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance was given to Mrs. E. Napieralski. Mrs. L. Kadow was elected treasurer of the organization, and Dr. Mary Olgiert-Kaczorowska was appointed chief examining physician.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Alliance are Mesdames Szeszycki, Piotrowicz, Wawrzynski, Szotkowski, and Kuflewski. Mrs. Baranowski declined the office. All the newly elected officials took the oath of office.</p>
   <p>Previous to the election, it was disclosed that the Polish Women's Alliance has 7,813 members, their ages ranging from eighteen to forty-four years. Since the average age of the members is thirty-one years and eight months, they constitute the flower of Polish womanhood in America.</p>
   <p>The Alliance has an insurance department of its own, which is reserved for <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>members. This insurance is based on the same principles followed by other fraternal or sorority associations of this type.</p>
   <p>Serious consideration was given to the question of Polish women immigrants leaving Europe for America. Mrs. E. Napieralska informed those present that the venerable Sisters of Nazareth, in Chicago, are willing to take these immigrants into their Home. Upon a motion by Mrs. Chmielinska, it was decided that the Sisters should receive one hundred dollars to be used for just such emergencies.</p>
   <p>The assembled delegates also decreed that the Polish Women's Alliance should have its own newspaper, to be published every week, under the name of Glos Polek (Voice of Polish Womanhood).</p>
   <p>After completing other miscellaneous business, the Eighth Convention of the Polish Women's Alliance came to a close with the singing of "God, Save Poland," the Polish national anthem.</p>
