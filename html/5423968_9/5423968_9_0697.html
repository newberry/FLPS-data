   <p>A grand celebration to honor the one-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Thaddeus Kosciusko took place yesterday afternoon in the Holy Trinity parish hall, which was filled to overflowing.</p>
   <p>The civilian and military societies were led into the hall by the chief marshal, Mr. Valentine Wleklinski. The president, Mr. A. X. Centella, opened the meeting, and called on Mr. S. Nicki to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>After the singing of "Mazur," by the Chopin and Wanda choruses, Mr. E. Z. Brodowski, the president of the central administration of the Polish National Alliance, spoke of the importance of this celebration, and made a comparison of Kosciusko and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Next, Mr. J. J. Chrzanowski spoke with confidence and vigor. In a lengthy speech, he outlined Kosciusko's activities.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. F. H. Jablonski was the third speaker, and he explained our national duties. The fourth speaker, Mr. John F. Smulski, compared our oppressed fatherland to Christ with a crown of thorns, and prophesied its resurrection. In conclusion, Mr. Casimir Zychlinski spoke.</p>
   <p>Besides these speeches, there were many recitations, vocal and instrumental numbers, etc. The singing of Miss Agnes Wojtalewicz (Nering) was applauded enthusiastically. The Misses Rutkowski, Pachowski, and Gorski also sang. Recitations were rendered by Miss A. Lisztewnik, Mrs. M. Zolkowski, Miss A. Wojtalewicz, and Mr. S. Rembowski. The singing by the girls' choir of the Holy Trinity parish was applauded by everyone.</p>
   <p>The program was quite lengthy, as it embraced twenty-seven numbers, and it was necessary to omit some of the numbers on account of the late hour.</p>
   <p>The audience listened to it all with evident satisfaction, and rewarded the speakers, singers, and reciters with enthusiastic applause.</p>
   
   <p>The three tableaux exhibited on the stage during the celebration created tremendous interest.</p>
   <p>The titles of these tableaux were: "The entrance of Koscuisko into Cracow," "The oath of Kosciusko in the market square in Cracow," and "Kosciusko in prison". The Chopin and Wanda choruses rendered appropriate songs during each tableau. The Polish military societies and the Uhlans under the protection of the Holy Mary of Czestochowa, from the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, directed by Captain Mech, portrayed the figures in the tableaux.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the sum of $61.76 was collected by voluntary contributions. This sum will be turned over to the Kosciusko monument committee in Chicago.</p>
