   <p>In spite of the inclement weather, and the fact that it was the last Sunday before Lent, and people were diverted to other attractions, the St. Hedwig Parish hall was overcrowded last night.</p>
   <p>The advertised Kosciusko Celebration, under the auspices of the Polish young men's societies, was held as scheduled, with a program so extensive and entertaining that it must have satisfied even the most critical. The stage appeared in a new setting, with a beautiful curtain and side scenery. The first row of seats was occupied by the "Krakusi," boys in their colorful uniforms. A portrait of Thaddeus Kosciusko was decorated with festoons and wreaths.</p>
   <p>The pastor, Reverend John Piechowski, opened the celebration with an appropriate speech, and called on Mr. St. Fruzyna to act as chairman and Mr. M. Fijalkowski as secretary.</p>
   
   <p>The schoolchildren sang the beautiful "Kosciusko Cantata"; then Mr. Lipecki spoke, giving a biography of the hero of two hemispheres. His speech was often interrupted by applause.</p>
   <p>Then three children, M. Ruzycki, F. Korzeniewska, and F. Krzywinska, sat down at the piano and played a beautiful composition for six hands with admirable skill. Next the St. Hedwig Choir sang that fervent national prayer, "Patrz Kosciuszko na has z Nieba" (Look, Kosciusko, on us from Heaven), and Mrs. Meissner, in the name of the Polish women, gave an ardent patriotic speech with her usual vigor; she was applauded thunderously by the women and men in the audience.</p>
   <p>A theatrical performance was then given. The young people rendered a two-act drama entitled "Batozek Kosciuszki" (The Whip of Kosciusko), in which John Sobieszczyk was outstanding. In the second play, "Figiel Wiarusa" (The Old-Timer's Joke), Mr. T. Lama acted his difficult role exceedingly well, and was helped by the good acting of Mrs. W. Marciszewski.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. John Sobieszczyk was the third speaker; his speech was to the point and was well understood.</p>
   <p>The following also appeared on the program: The St. Cecelia Choir; the school-childrens Choir; M. Rybicka, Victoria Marciszewski, and M. Pilarski in recitations; Helen Ornat and Martha Pochelska, singers, and Peter Naskrent, young soloist.</p>
   <p>The crowning achievements of the celebration were a tableau, entitled "Wanda," and the expert piano playing of Misses Blanche and Lucy Baczkowski.</p>
   <p>This celebration will leave an indelible impression on the minds of those St. Hedwig parishioners in the audience, especially because it had a practical meaning also. Thanks to the Polish women's societies, and to the young people, the fund for a monument to Kosciusko will be increased by the sum of thirty dollars.</p>
   <p>Is anybody able to do better than the St. Hedwig Parish?</p>
