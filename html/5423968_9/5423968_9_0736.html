   <p>Last night the thirty-third anniversary of the Polish January insurrection was celebrated in the Holy Trinity Parish in a very effective and solemn manner. The celebration was arranged by national and church societies.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. X. Centella opened the celebration by calling on Mr. St. Slominski to act as chairman, and Attorney Frank Koralewski to act as secretary. Mr. Slominski greeted the audience with a very appropriate speech, after which the Chopin and Wanda Choirs entertained the audience. Mr. M. J. Sadowski, the secretary of the Polish National Alliance, then spoke, giving a vivid word picture of the years 1863 and 1864. He concluded his speech by citing the aims and objects of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Miss Anna Wojtalewicz gave a recitation in a very charming manner, and she <span class="page-break">\2</span>was followed by the Wanda Choir.</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Reverend Raczynski, spoke of the patriotic duties of Polish priests. Then followed the delightful singing of Miss Agnes Wojtalewicz, which evoked such thunderous applause that she was forced to sing an encore.</p>
   <p>Next, taking the place of Attorney Drzymala who was absent, the young attorney, Frank Koralewski, spoke in English about the duties of the Polish young people born in this country.</p>
   <p>The eight-year-old Miss M. Majewski recited very nicely and, after a recitation by Miss A. Uczciewek and songs by the Holy Trinity Parish Girls' Choir, Attorney John F. Smulski spoke in Polish. He described the events <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the January insurrection very graphically, and discussed its meaning and its results. He concluded by enumerating the benefits accruing to us from the arrangement of such national celebrations.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Hypczer recited and Miss A. Ruszrowska sang, and then Mr. O'Donnell, an Irishman, spoke in English. He urged the Poles to be faithful to their religion, and then spoke of the patriotism and heroism of the Poles in the January Insurrection, and mentioned especially the brave deeds of the priests Mackiewicz and Brzoska. He was rewarded for his speech with tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>Miss Z. Moszczynski recited, and then Mr. Gatkowski's singing was greeted enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>The last speech of the evening, by Mr. Stan. A. Osada, was very energetic.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Mr. Osada spoke of "active defense" and of the Rapperschwil Fund (a Polish National fund).</p>
   <p>In conclusion the cadets put on a mimic battle with the Russians, whom they, naturally, defeated. This pleased the audience mightily.</p>
   <p>The hall was overcrowded. Mr. Steczynski had decorated the hall and stage very beautifully. The Krakusi soldiers and cadets were present in a body.</p>
   <p>A voluntary collection for the National Educational Department and the Rapperschwil Fund amounted to $29.75.</p>
