   <p>Tomorrow, July 4th, the people of the United States of America will celebrate the 135th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. How sacred and significant is the word "independence," especially to us Poles, for we lost it completely. We have goodwill towards all nations, especially towards free and noble America, our adopted country. On that day we should rejoice with Americans and participate in their festivities. The Polish element in America will fulfill its obligation towards America by taking an active part in tomorrow's festivities, and by rejoicing in the fact that years ago the people of this hospitable land had overthrown the unwelcome lords and become masters of their own destiny.</p>
   <p>In a strict sense, all free and civilized nations should observe the 4th of July as a holiday of the entire humanity. The establishment of a great and independent republic in North America was indeed a forward step for the entire humanity, a gain for all of us, a victory for idealistic principles, recognized and respected by all, and acceptable to the people of all countries.</p>
   <p>On that day, a new member was born in the family of nations; so young yet, so richly endowed by nature that it has a chance to be the head of the whole family in the future. This new member is only an infant, and yet, it outgrew and surpassed many of its older members; is growing and developing continually drawing the sap of life not only from its own land, but from the entire world.</p>
   <p>In addition to the normal increase, a million people come yearly to this country from the old world, and find here room, food, work and opportunities of every kind.</p>
   <p>Our liberal Constitution, framed by wise men, allows all nationalities, all religions, all scientific, social, and political theories to exist and develop here.</p>
   
   <p>No one is questioned here as to what he thinks, what he believes, what he is meditating upon, or what are his aspirations; no one is prevented from being himself, providing he respects the laws of the country.</p>
   <p>No one is compelled to assume the responsibilities of citizenship, yet he receives equal protection. On the contrary, one must wait for a long time and show his abilities before he may become a citizen of this country and assume responsibilities towards it.</p>
   <p>Humanity should be proud of the United States and the rest of the nations should abandon their antiquated systems and follow the example of their youngest member. However, this youngest member is not without fault, because there is no perfection in the world; but if we will consider its merits and faults we shall come to the conclusion that the faults of the United States are less important than those of Europe or Asia.</p>
   
   <p>The Poles should be proud of this country, for they have contributed towards its independence.</p>
   <p>If we read the history of the United States we shall find records of great deeds performed by the Poles.</p>
   <p>All historians admit that the Revolutionary war could not have been won by the United States without the aid of the French. However, France was not willing to declare war on England and send a powerful fleet and army to America until the time when the Americans have proved to be good allies by winning a big battle and defeating General Burgoyne. General Burgoyne was defeated by General Gates; however, according to his own reports, which he had sent to George Washington, victory was due to the strategy of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a Pole, who commanded that army. This was admitted by the Englishmen themselves, twenty years later, at a banquet given by a military club in honor of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, when he was going to America in 1796.</p>
   
   <p>This very important battle had been won with the aid of a Pole. Providence has allowed a Pole to play this important role, establishing thereby eternal friendship between America and Poland.</p>
   <p>Let us all rejoice and celebrate tomorrow as good Americans.</p>
   <p>American people know very little about us, and what they know is not very complimentary, for it was imparted to them by our enemies, Germans and Russians.</p>
   <p>Today our number is large and we may begin to undo that which our enemies have done to us. We may do this by cooperating with the hospitable people whose country we have adopted as our own.</p>
