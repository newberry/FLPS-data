   <p>The seventh anniversary of the Polish Benevolent Association of St. Stanislaus Kostka occurred yesterday. At 1 A.M. a large concourse of our Polish citizens assembled at the church of the society on Milwaukee Ave. near Division St., where appropriate religious services were held. Father Juskeivitz officiated at the altar. A noteworthy feature was the fine orchestral music.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon the society met at the hall, corner of Noble and Bradley Sts., and took action on the organization of a central Polish-American committee. The Polish population of Chicago is quite large and the members are among the most thrifty and orderly of our citizens.</p>
