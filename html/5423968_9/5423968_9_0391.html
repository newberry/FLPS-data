   <p>Each year, a Kosciuszko celebration with a parade to the monument of our hero in Humboldt Park has been held....but never was there such a parade and such a manifestation, involving the participation of so great a mass of Polish people, as on yesterday.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's celebration will long remain in the memory of those who participated, for it was a great occasion for all Poles. In the first place, it was an act of homage to the memory of our great leader, Thaddeus Kosciuszko; secondly, it was a commemoration of the first anniversary of the Polish Army in France, which will probably face the Germans on the battle front in a very short time.</p>
   <p>Chicago Polonia gave one more proof that its one aim is to win freedom for its beloved homeland, that the spirit of Kosciuszko lives within us and spurs <span class="page-break">\2</span>everyone of us to action. By the great numbers in which we participated in the celebration at the Kosciuszko Monument in Humboldt Park yesterday, we veritably vowed that, in emulation of the great leader who fought for freedom so long as his strength lasted, we would fight until we have accomplished our purpose, until we have wrung the neck of the Prussian hydra, thus securing democracy. Until this happens, not only will we remain in slavery, but the whole world will have to bow before Prussian arrogance. Thus it is that almost the whole world, with the exception of the few allies of the Germans, among whom are the members of the K. O. N. [Komitet Obrony Narodowy: National Defense Committee], is struggling against the German hordes with all its strength, in order that Prussian Junkerism and its bloodthirsty Kaiser may be destroyed and a lasting peace established, and in order to insure the existence of democracy.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's celebration was an unusual one in that it was the first anniversary of the decree of the French President, Poincare, calling into existence a Polish army. The actual anniversary date falls on June 4, but because June 2 was set a <span class="page-break">\3</span>long time ago as the date for the Kosciuszko celebration, both these anniversaries were observed in one manifestation.....</p>
   <p>After many years of waiting and of faith in the future, we finally have our own army, formally recognized not only by France and America, but by all the other Allies, who are firm in their decision that Poland must be free and independent, and must embrace all of its former territories. The Polish Army was organized with the purpose of giving Poland an opportunity of fighting on an equal basis with the other Allied countries for its own rights, and for the rights of democracy throughout the entire world, in behalf of which the Allies are fighting.</p>
   <p>In calling into existence a Polish Army, the Allies desired to ascertain whether the national spirit of our forefathers still lived. Are the Poles of today like the Poles of the past, who knew no fear and who went boldly into battle even against the greatest odds? Do these Poles in America still love their homeland?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>And [if so], what sacrifices are they willing to make? Our duty, then, is to prove before the whole democratic world, which is now watching us closely, that we are those same Poles who knew not the meaning of fear, that we love freedom, that we are ready to fight until the German hordes are vanquished. For the spirit of our able forefathers is not dead: it urges us on to fight to avenge our wrongs and the wrongs of others....and, finally, to avenge the destruction of our beautiful land, our beloved Poland.</p>
   <p>To arms, then, Polish youth! Let there remain not one among us able to bear arms, for his place is with the Polish Army, his duty is to fight as others are fighting! Polish youth! Do not permit yourselves to be pointed out and called cowards! Such a term should never apply to Poles, and such a term should not even exist among us. No one should stay at home, thus to deserve the appellation, for Poles never were cowards, but have always and everywhere been ready to fight wherever freedom and right were at stake.</p>
   <p>Let our great leader, Kosciuszko, whose memory we honored yesterday, serve as <span class="page-break">\5</span>an example to every true son of Poland, for when he could no longer fight for the freedom of Poland....he came here to fight for the freedom and rights of the American people. He fought for America's freedom because he loved freedom and justice, because he was a true son of Poland. Let the spirit of our great commander be our leader, let it lead us into this battle for freedom and justice.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's parade to the monument of Kosciuszko, and the subsequent manifestation, were successful in every respect. As early as the noon hour, various societies were gathering at designated points, and the streets were thronged with people from every part of the city and from out of town.</p>
   <p>The Parade</p>
   <p>After the arrival of the Polish Military Commission and the representatives of France at the Polish National Alliance building, the parade started. The time <span class="page-break">\6</span>was a few minutes after two. The order of the parade was as follows:</p>

Majewski, Commissioner of the Polish National Alliance; John F. Smulski, president of the National Department; H. Setmajer, secretary of the National Department; the Reverend Casimir Sztuczko; Charles F. Clyne, federal prosecutor; the Central Administration of the Polish National <span class="page-break">\9</span>Alliance: K. B. Czarnecki, vice-president, J. Magdziarz, treasurer J. Zawilinski, secretary general, and Mrs. M. Milewski, Mrs. M. Sakowski, Messrs. Szymanski, Wrzesinski, Zlotnicki, Pijanowski, and Dr. Balcerzak, chief Physician of the Polish National Alliance, directors. Also, Mrs. A. Neuman and Miss E.

Grochowski, and Leon Nowak; the committee in charge of the manifestation: J. Palczynski, F. P. Sikorski, A. Chonarzewski, B. Kowalewski, P. Krupa, and F. Gorski; Judge [J.] LaBuy and Mrs. LaBuy; J. Smietanka, collector of internal revenue; Mrs. H. Smulski; Peter Rostenkowski, former president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; and many others.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the parade, the Polish Army Band played "The Star-Spangled Banner", the "Marseillaise", and "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland]. The volunteers lined up before the platform, and the Falcons, in field and dress uniforms, took their positions in front of the monument. Around them were <span class="page-break">\10</span>hundreds of American flags and Polish national banners. At the North Avenue entrance to the park hung the enormous Polish play loaned for this occasion by the Central Citizens Committee. Just before the opening of the manifestation, several Falcons climbed upon the monument and decorated it with wreaths.</p>
   <p>The manifestation was opened by A. Majewski, commissioner of Circuit XV, Polish National Alliance, who called upon B. Kowalewski to preside and J. J. Chrzanowski to act as secretary. After a short address by the chairman, the massed choruses, under the direction of Professor Hensel, sang "The Star-Spangled Banner," with orchestral accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The first address was delivered by John F. Smulski, president of the National Department. He said: "Kosciuszko represents our national ideal, the highest expression of Polish national life, a hero who always and everywhere fought in defense of freedom. Motivated by this love of freedom, he offered his <span class="page-break">\11</span>services to the Americans in their struggle for liberty. It was he who gave the Poles in this country a good name and we can never honor him emough for it."</p>
   <p>Following this address in Polish, Smulski spoke in English as follows: "The Poles have gathered here, as they have done every year, to pay homage at the monument of a hero who fought for the freedom of Poland and America. He was the chief engineer of the American Army and the founder of the military academy at West Point. In return for his services, the American government gave him a considerable tract of land. How great was Kosciuszko's love for freedom is testified by the fact that he did not use this gift for personal gain but turned it over to Thomas Jefferson so that the latter might sell it and use the money to buy freedom for negro slaves. As is their custom every year, so today the Poles have gathered here to show that they are following the example set by Kosciuszko, that they are ready at all times to shed their blood, to offer their lives in defense of their own freedom and that of the whole world."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>In the further course of his address, Smulski spoke of the services of President Poincare of France in making possible the formation of a Polish Army in France. He pointed out that the French Government was represented at this manifestation by Colonel James Martin.....Colonel Martin is supervising the formation of the Polish Army. Smulski then called attention to the courage of the men who had volunteered for the Polish Army, for they had gone, not because they were forced to, or for glory, but from a sense of duty: to fight for the liberty they love, even though many of them were classified here as enemy aliens. (Cheers for volunteers.) The defeat of the enemy is near, Smulski said, and the river Marne, which has already held the Germans back once, will hold them back again. In the final defeat of the enemy, our Polish boys will be fighting beside the French, English, and Americans. (Tremendous applause.)</p>
   <p>The chairman of the manifestation then presented Smulski with gold medals such as were sold during the course of yesterday's celebration. One was for the <span class="page-break">\13</span>great president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson; one for Ignace J. Paderewski; and a third for Colonel Martin, who pinned it upon his breast beside numerous decorations for bravery.</p>
   <p>The next address was delivered by Colonel Martin, who began by expressing his thanks for the medal bestowed upon him.</p>
   <p>[Address by Colonel Martin omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of Colonel Martin's address, the Polish Army Band played the "Marseillaise," followed by the massed choruses and orchestra in "Medley of Polish National Anthems".</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Major Joseph Kozlowski, chief of the Polish Military Commission.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>[Speech by Colonel Kozlowski omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>When Colonel Kozlowski had finished his address, the Polish Army Band played "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland Is Not Yet Lost].</p>
   <p>An address by Charles T. Clyne, federal prosecutor, followed.</p>
   <p>[Address by Clyne omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The last address was made by the Reverend Casimir Sztuczko; his address appears in full elsewhere in this issue. Leon Nowak, secretary of the committee in charge of the manifestation, then read the resolution; this, too, appears elsewhere in this issue. The resolution was unanimously accepted. The entire gathering sang "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland] to conclude the manifestation.</p>
   <p>After the manifestation had ended, President Szrojda of the Central Citizens <span class="page-break">\15</span>Committee presented Colonel Martin with a check for a thousand dollars, to be used for the Polish volunteers already in France, on the occasion of the first anniversary of that army. Colonel Martin and Major Kozlowski thanked him on behalf of the soldiers for his generous gift.</p>
