   <p>Last Tuesday the John Kilinski Polish Shoemakers' Society presented a drama and concert at Schoenhofens Hall. The drama, "Two Husbands," was written by Mr. Korzeniewski. After the play the song "Uncle's Song," by Foedoy, and other selections followed.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to capacity, and both the play and the music were enjoyed by all.</p>
   <p>We have organized a society called "Filaretow," which is patterned after the original society of 1819, in Vilno, Poland. This society held its first public meeting here on December 28, 1891, and it will be fitting to tell about the birth of this organization.</p>
   <p>Research in Polish historical data revealed to us that this society was prevalent after the dominance of Poland in European affairs. Who were these people of olden days? They were composed of the younger generation attending the university of Vilno in 1819. This immediately brings out the character and ability of the members. It was a group of young people, in the prime of their lives, level-headed and light-hearted youths who had not as yet faced the grim realities of life or become hardened by its outcome. It was a youth that was interested in the field of education, not children struggling to earn a daily piece of bread. It was an organization of young people whose minds were constantly above the clouds, and whose feet seldom touched the ground. They were free from the toils of the day, enabling them to devote their time to the finer things of life. The fires of their ambitions contended with the cultural limitations of the world. Their lives were more polished and accustomed to good fortune, whereas, the others were brought up amidst slovenly conditions filled with poverty and hard labor.</p>
   <p>The epoch of the struggle of existence brings out the character of the Ideals of the people. Today, when life is composed mostly of daily humdrum occurrences, the working for daily sustenance, and the utilization of the few earned pence leaves very little time for anything else. Consequently, very few ever rise above this existence, very few have an opportunity for higher learning and, therefore, this prosaic condition seems to impregnate itself more into these people. Those who do go ahead are those generally of the younger generation - among the youth. The pursuit for a living takes on for them a different appearance. Not being familiar with this phase of life they try to find it out. They envision new regions of hope; - new horizons for opportunity. The stigma of these outlooks has taken affect. Perhaps this may be only the imagination of youth, or the dominance of a greater driving force, out of reach of the common horde. This is my humble opinion which was formulated through the views of my youthful eyes. This is the idea of the present age. It unfolds laboriously before the eyes of the many, only to quickly disappear again amidst its trifling origin from which it arose. Only a few grasp each meaning. Too few!</p>
   
   <p>The era in which the young students lived, in the early part of the nineteenth century of subdued Poland, was entirely different. They existed in a world of pretentious freedom. This was a result of the forced military government of the despotic and strange rulers who took control of Poland. This subjugation of Poland brought about a yearning in the hearts of all Poles - a yearning for freedom.</p>
   <p>The reign of Napoleon brought renewed hopes to the people. Many of the younger generation participated in the call to arms by Napoleon; the hopes for freedom became greater, and the shackles of submission became a bit looser. As a result each day brought new uprisings followed by violences. Very few fought for their rights of liberty. They took whatever was offered to them in silence, yet they participated in whatever movement was current. At these popular movements they expressed their wants and desires, for they were constantly filled with new hopes of becoming free.</p>
   
   <p>Napoleon's might and power, his visit to Lithuania and Poland, brought a golden glimpse of hope to Poland. This new hope became deeply rooted among the young and old and the cultured and illiterate, for upon this rested the liberation from the relentless Russians. Thousands of lives were lost in Napoleons support. Fathers, brothers, sons sacrificed their lives but in vain; the loss of hope followed. Finally under the reign of Alexander I, temporary resignation and the darkening of the hopes of liberty enveloped the Polish race.</p>
   <p>Such were the conditions under which the students organized, their goal being the restoration of the fight for liberty and the perpetration of their ideals. They wanted to renew and make deeper in the hearts of their people, the feeling of becoming a free nation.</p>
   <p>This body of young students was composed of scholars from the various parts of the country which was once Poland. Among these students existed a number who belonged to the former ruling class. They had no interest in the finer things. Pomp and frivolity filled their former lives and still had held its effect under present conditions. Others were brought up under the influence of the Tsars and were swayed by their policies. Finally there were those who were merely interested in play and very little in education. Yet, a large part of the student body was not dormant, they were familiar with the prevailing conditions. Out of this group arose Thomas Zan who organized the society of "Promienisci" (an organization that radiated hope for the Polish people).</p>
   <p>This order upon seeing the sad condition of the country began to take steps to uplift the general morale of the populace. They became more bold in their defense of rights and in their demands for freedom. Every opportunity that afforded itself was taken advantage.of and put into force, to further their cause. They spread over the entire country to preach their doctrines. The outlook was sad. Poverty was hand in hand with illiteracy throughout the rural sections. Industrial and commerical activity was at a standstill. Selfishness was everywhere evident and unity was sorely needed. Against these barriers this newly organized body pitted itself.</p>
   <p>This noble fraternity was granted permission to organize by the dean and curator of the University of Vilno. It represented six different districts, each being recognized by the colors of the rainbow, and each color represented a district. Each section had its district leader and assistant and other minor officers necessary to carry out the duties of the organization. This entire system was headed by nine men. At the head of this group was Mr. Zan. The origin of the name of this organization is not known, however, there are those the accept it as being the result of Zan's theories. He believed that beauty, tenderness, and innocence were the three outstanding virtues of man and which radiated from God's creation of him. This was the accepted theory of the entire brotherhood.</p>
   
   <p>The central body supervised the operation of the organization, which was not only brotherly but national as well. The rich paid for the poor, the intelligent assisted their friends who were less apt in acquiring constructive learning. To this central group, a department of philology was added. Its aim was to preserve the native tongue, enrichen literary efforts, and preserve the art of typography.</p>
   <p>These pioneers, who took it upon themselves to bolster the spirit of their race, not only promoted its existence in the University proper, but spread out beyond its walls and enrolled private individuals. They all strived with difficulty and enthusiasm to uplift and preserve the ideals of their crumbling nation. They knew that by getting the people familiar with the appalling conditions through proper education, it would be possible to avert the present crisis. They were acquainted with the economical status of each populated province. Through were acquainted with the economical status of each populated province. Through these means they were in a better position to further their cause. Better programs could be easily adopted and put into force for better results.</p>
