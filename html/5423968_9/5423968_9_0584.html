   <p>The international celebration arranged for July 4, 1911, the Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, came off successfully. Among all nationalities the Polish division was best. The crowds standing on the sidewalks gave them a well deserved ovation. An imposing impression was made by Kosynier's detachment upon which people in the windows threw flowers.</p>
   <p>The chariot which was exhibited and decorated by some Polish organizations made a splendid showing. It is too bad that in the Polish division no group carried any signs describing the various groups. In general, the Polish division showed much dignity and magnificence.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians and Czechs earned themselves a good deal of applause. In one word, everybody was thrilled looking at the passing masses dressed in colorful and beautiful costumes of different nationalities. This parade will remain in one's memory for a long time. The weather on that day was very hot; the thermometer reached 102 degrees and unfortunately twenty-four people lost their lives and sixty became sick.</p>
