   <p>Last week we celebrated Abraham Lincoln's birthday. Knowing what a great man he was, knowing his character, his usefulness, his ideals, and the many splendid virtues which he possessed, we pay tribute to this American. We wish that all political leaders would try to follow in Lincoln's footsteps.</p>
