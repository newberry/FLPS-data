   <p>May 30 is a legal holiday dedicated to the memory of American war dead and to the dead in general. It is called Decoration Day or Memorial Day. Last year, for the first time, Polish military societies took part in the Decoration Day parade. These were almost exclusively military societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish [Church societies the members of which wear uniforms while on parades, etc.]. This year, the directors of the Decoration Day parade would like the parade to be more than usually impressive because of the World's Columbian Exposition. The chairman of the committee in charge of the parade has written a letter to Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, expressing the hope that Polish military societies will again participate. He asks also that Mr. Kiolbassa send him a list of all such organizations. Since Mr. Kiolbassa does not know the names and addresses of all the Polish military societies in Chicago, he has asked Dziennik Chicagoski to make this request public. All societies interested are respectfully requested to apply either <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>directly to A. P. Conolly, chairman of the Parade Committee, or to Mr. Kiolbassa. All other Polish newspapers in Chicago please copy.</p>
   <p>The military organizations of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish that wish to participate are requested to apply to Father Vincent Barzynski, who will communicate with the Committee.</p>
   <p>We hope that no Polish military organization will refuse to enter the parade. There is a great number of Polish military societies in the parishes. of Chicago and South Chicago. There are also many independent societies, and all such organizations should respond. We must show that we, this country's adopted sons, know how to honor her defenders when the occasion arises. This is our duty as citizens. We feel certain that all the pastors and leaders of such organizations will lend their support willingly. The more impressive the parade this year, the better for us, for Americans will judge us by what they see of us.</p>
