   <p>In a hall crowded beyond its capacity (one can say that, since the people even filled the aisles) a commemoration of the November Insurrection was held yesterday at the Polish Women's Alliance building. It had been arranged by the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Falcons. This commemoration will no doubt remain an indelible memory in the minds of those who participated in it.</p>
   <p>John Mlotowski greeted those assembled, in the name of the committee on arrangements. Then he called upon Mr. John S. Rybicki, president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, to act as master of ceremonies. Thereupon the richly varied and decidedly successful program was begun.</p>
   <p>The orchestra of Group 192 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, which opened the program, gave proof (not for the first time) of their excellent work in music. After this the master of ceremonies invited the representatives of organizations and the speakers to come up on the platform.</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Warszewski recited "The White Dress," and Miss Lise sang "Sleep Calmly" and "From Beyond the Grave."</p>
   <p>The first speaker, Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance, delivered a short, but good, speech. She spoke to the living--the living, we say, because in her speech she reserved only a few sentences for those who died in the insurrection. She talked about the present and gave a clear picture of the battles now being fought on Polish soil.</p>
   <p>"And if," she ended her speech, "the future generation is not to condemn us, if our progeny are not to remember us with shame, we must act in order that the year 1914 may not pass without benefit for Poland. What is the use of all sorts of speeches. What good can come of the promises made to Poland in the past if they were only empty phrases uttered for false show--which unfortunately we seem so greatly to enjoy. Poland demands work, not words, from us. Poland does not ask for the assurances uttered at celebrations but for help from her daughters and sons. She asks this because she must; no stranger will come to her aid.</p>
   <p>"Belgium, on whose soil battles are being fought, has friends throughout America. Millionaires from other countries contribute funds for Belgium, but for Poland only we Polish men and women will, and should, bring help. Instead of working, we are quarreling among ourselves; instead of uniting our forces we are scattering them by dividing ourselves into camps, parties, and sub-parties. There is hunger and poverty in the homeland. There is no milk in the homeland for mothers to give to their infants. Yet we over here fight with each other for leadership, which should be of such little importance to us. Let us collect funds that we may not regret, when it is too late, that we did nothing for Poland. Let us act and act now."</p>
   <p>Following Miss Napieralski's address the orchestra played a medley of Polish songs while Misses Plucinski, Roth, Kmiecik, Szczuka, Piotrowski, Watorski, Demski, and Peters took up a collection. Miss Napieralski's speech must have had a strong effect on the consciences of the audience because the money flowed freely into the hats of the Falcons. The collection yielded $120.</p>
   <p>After the singing of "Beyond the Niemen" and the "March of the Polish Women's Alliance" by the Polish Women's Alliance choir, our well-known violinist, Miss Constance Krenz, played "Romances" and Wieniawski's "Kujawiak." These numbers were followed by a speech by Mr. Henry Setmajer, vice-president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, who spoke on the subject of quarrels and disagreements among the American Poles when unity is needed. The speaker, condemning those who foment quarrels and disturbances among the Poles, called for harmonious and truly Polish work.</p>
   <p>After Miss Jankowski's piano solo, Misses A. Nowak and Filipczak sang "The Polish Woman Patriot." They were rewarded with enthusiastic applause. Then came an address by Mr. John Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>We believe that this was the first time that the Polish immigrants were told publicly what Mr. Przyprawa told them. Someone said that Mr. Przyprawa was the gall of the celebration. If this is so, the American Poles needed this gall--in fact, it was an absolute necessity.</p>
   <p>The speaker painted a true picture of the lethargy and laziness of the Polish immigrants in their work for Poland and emphasized that for the past forty years they have been reciting their love for the homeland in petty phrases but have done absolutely nothing for it. Then he ended:</p>
   <p>"Today the blush of shame covers our cheeks and we dare not look into each other's eyes, because we know we should slap each other's faces for our indifference, for our arguing, and for our recitations about love of the homeland, for which we have done nothing."</p>
   <p>"Four million emigres--a mass of four million Poles--has collected all of $100,000, for the fight for independence. That is two and one-half cents for each emigre. We are giving the homeland alms, not help. We are giving alms to her whom historical necessity bids rise and proclaim liberty to the world. This is Poland's historic mission. If there are none here in this auditorium who have not done anything, they are elsewhere--and we know about them just as we know about those who from the beginning of this action have not stirred a finger to help Poland. Unfortunately, not many are working or will work. Will the few who are working be enough? Are we not all children of the same mother, Poland? Are we not all brothers of the Polish woman in the homeland who at this moment has nothing with which to feed her children and begs for help? We cannot give it to her because we want to quarrel, not work.</p>
   <p>"But to make up for this, at mass meetings and celebrations we spout phrases and give our homeland assurances and make promises which we do not keep. We are small; we are not only incapable of action, we are even incapable of beginning action. We are midgets compared to those in the homeland beyond the sea who have laid their lives and money on the altar of the homeland.</p>
   <p>"These are sharp words, I know, but they are the bitter truth. I speak in order that when you leave this place you will stir to action those who are not yet working, that you will tell them that they must work and that this work is pleasant because it is for Poland, who is rising from her lethargy, for Poland who must be free!"</p>
   
   <p>The final speech was made by Mr. Rybicki, master of ceremonies. He underlined the fact that certain individuals are trying to undermine the unity of the Falcons and that the second circuit will not permit this to happen.</p>
   <p>After singing the Falcon march, "Lazy and Sleepy," and "Poland Is Not Lost," the people began to disperse toward their homes. They took with them memories of a meeting which undoubtedly was one of the most magnificent nationalistic manifestations of the present time in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Throughout the entire meeting, a Falcon group served as a guard of honor with Chief Gnutkiewicz at its head.</p>
