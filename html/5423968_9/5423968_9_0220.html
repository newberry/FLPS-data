   <p>Love of country, second only to love of God, is one of our most sacred duties and noblest of emotions. It binds men, women, and children alike; it should be the more fervent in that while our mother country groans beneath the heel of oppression, we, living as we do in comparative freedom, are able to work for her with little difficulty.</p>
   <p>Love of country and patriotic dreams are worthless without deeds. One of the most important actions on our part is to organize nationalistically, that is, to form a strong national unit in opposition to our enemies. American Poles, our husbands and brothers, have been gathering together in such organizations for many years. The need for organization makes itself felt more sharply in the face of Russian violence and oppression in Poland, in the face of the fact that the enemy of liberty and of Poland would like to extend his influence to this hemisphere, and finally because the Czar and his henchmen are attempting, with derisive hypocrisy, to delude even our priests by false assurances of tolerance for the Roman Catholic faith. Under such circumstances, we should all prepare for a struggle with the enemy, and the greater our numbers the better.</p>
   <p>Thus far, Polish organizations devoted to patriotic activity have had almost exclusively a male membership. Are Polish women, known in history for their sacrifices and their love of country, to remain in the background? Does not an equally ardent love for Poland glow in their hearts? Are they no longer the daughters of such heroic and saintly women as Kings, Jadwiga, Chrzanowska, Platerowna, and a great many others? No, a hundred times no! We the Polish women of America love our homeland as intensely as do our sisters in Poland. The hearts of Polish women are not so hardened as to fail to tremble and bleed at the very thought of the persecutions and intrigues of the enemies of Poland. We are always ready to take our places beside our brothers and to aid them in the struggle--not with daydreams, but with deeds.</p>
   
   <p>Guided by these thoughts, a group of local Polish women have determined to create the Patriotic Organization of Polish Women in America (Organizacya Patryotyczna Polskich Niewiast w Ameryce), which will work hand in hand with the men's organization for the good of Poland. The general aims of this new organization are as follows: To arouse a spirit of patriotism within the hearts of our sisters, to encourage our husbands and brothers to deeds and sacrifices for Poland, to uphold the Polish spirit in our children, to guard our language and faith against corruption, to glorify our great historic past, and, finally, to stand up with our husbands and brothers when occasion arises--as did our mothers and great-grandmothers, ready always for any sacrifice--for a sacred cause.</p>
   <p>Nicholas I, one of the most vicious oppressors of Poland, once said, "I fear no one so much as I fear Polish women and Polish priests!" In forming this organization, it is our hope that Polish women, both here and in Europe, will continue always to inspire fear in the hearts of tyrants; that the hearts of our sisters will forever be a source of love for God, Poland, and liberty-- a well from which future generations can draw for a supply of these noble emotions. While the hearts of Polish women,filled with patriotic fervor, are with God, Poland will not be lost!</p>
   <p>Such are the general purposes and outline of activity of the organization we are creating; details will be given at a later date. For the present, having explained the matter, we call upon all women whose hearts beat for the Polish cause to join us. Let them all remember Esther and Judith; let them remember that what the men of Israel could not do, God permitted women to accomplish, using them as His tools.</p>
   <p>Let us unite and work together! Let us awaken our brothers to action, for in action there is victory.</p>
   <p>Once again, we invite all Polish women to our first general meeting. It will be held at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School building, hall number one, on Sunday, July 16, at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
