   <p>As the readers of Dziennik Chicagoski know, the Poles of Chicago were well represented in the Columbus Day celebration Thursday, October 20. A large Polish division took part in the parade and was given recognition by both the American press and the public in general.</p>
   <p>This affair, however, was marred by a sad incident, despite statements that unity prevailed. Two of the Polish divisions did not join the Catholic Division as one solid group, and as a result the strength and splendor of the Polish groups was somewhat diminished. It seems that it was impossible to join these two groups by the silver thread of brotherhood. At any rate, the Poles presented themselves in a grand style before the eyes of all--the public at large as well as their own kind. However, by marching separately they created a break internally.</p>

   <p>This has hurt deeply. But the pain guards us from irritating the wound through the penetration into particular causes, and helps us to find the faults of the guilty.....Whatever may be written about this today will not help the situation any. On the contrary, it can only cause unpleasantness.....At present certain scandalous and outrageous voices are being raised again, which tend to create polemics.....We do not wish to take part in this affair.</p>
   <p>Unity and harmony are often mentioned and confirmed verbally, but it seems that the past is not buried. It is hoped that the "Poles in the future, although of various beliefs, will know where to go together in order to attain the common ideals of the entire group."</p>
