   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization held its annual meeting Sunday, December 20, at 4:00 P. M., at the school hall of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The attendance showed that the patriotism in the hearts of the Poles of Chicago is continually increasing.</p>
   <p>The annual financial report was continued until the last Sunday of January. The following committee was chosen to inspect the books: Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, and I. Kowalski. Regulation of the membership is also a part of the duty of this committee.</p>
   <p>A heated debate took place over a suggestion to permit women to become members of the organization. The results will be announced in the near future. It has been decided to have future meetings interspersed with recitations, songs, readings, etc.</p>

   <p>Among other important proposals agreed upon, it was decided to commemorate yearly the January Insurrection [Rising against Russia in 1863].</p>
   <p>After the disposition of the matters concerning the Dramatic Circle and Knights, both part of the Organization, the election of officers was held. P. Ligman was elected president for the fourth consecutive time; his assistant became I. Kowalski; S. Zahajkiewicz was chosen secretary; F. Zagrzebski was elected financial secretary; T. Ostrowski, cashier; P. Ratkowski and J. Kaminski, trustees; J. Tomaszewski, business manager; and J. Dudzik, marshal.</p>
   <p>The initial action of the new administration will be to arrange the program for the commemoration at the January Insurrection, regulate the membership books, amend the constitution, and arrange the additions to the regular meetings, namely, songs, recitations, drills by the Knights and Sokols, etc.</p>

   <p>The separate units of the Polish Patriotic Organization, Parish Choir, Dramatic Circle, Knights, Cadets, and Sokols, are growing steadily and their public demonstrations are the best indications of their growth.</p>
   <p>The children's groups definitely prove the need for the continuance of such an organization. Every patriotic Pole who desires to do his share for the fatherland ought to join this society. In this group he will find the field of work his heart desires.</p>
   <p>S. Zahajkiewicz, secretary</p>
