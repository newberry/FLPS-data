   <p>I, the undersigned, Roman-Catholic priest of the Chicago diocese, declare herewith that I am voluntarily joining the ranks of the National Church.</p>
   <p>The reasons that induced me to take this step were: my conviction that in the National Church I am more certain of attaining salvation, because my mind and will shall not be hampered by the numerous canons of the Roman-Catholic Church; further, injustice and politics, as well as the un-Christian way of the Roman-Catholic Church authorities in dealing with people, have shaken my confidence in said church.</p>
   <p>I sincerely wish to work for the salvation of Polish souls and for the glory of the Polish name.</p>
   <p>Rev. Jan Stoinski.</p>
