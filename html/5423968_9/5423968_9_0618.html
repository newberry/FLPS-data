   <p>A beautiful program in honor of the nine hundredth anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Adalbert was staged, along with tribute to the founding of the Constitution of the Third of May [1791], at the St. Adalbert parish school hall yesterday (Sunday). The rich program comprised twenty-two numbers. Five of these were given by speakers.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Adolph Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael Archangel parish, was the first guest speaker to address the audience. He spoke about the meaning of the clergy in nationalistic life, and also of the significance of true patriotism, which is based upon sound moral principles.</p>
   <p>Casimir Neuman, editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski, spoke about the Constitution of the Third of May. The journalist emphasized the roles the nobility [Szlachta] and the clergy played in bringing about the change of the old Polish <span class="page-break">2</span>constitution.</p>
   <p>"Can A Polish Roman Catholic Priest Be A Patriot?" was the theme of Reverend Sklarzyk's talk. This was given as a retort to some of the liberals who contend that, once a priest takes his oath, he renounces his family, friends, and fatherland. The priest claimed this to be false, and said that those guilty of such assertions are "professional" patriots.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zembaczynski confirmed the opinions of the previous speakers, and Clement Belinski warned against the influences which are trying to undermine the fruits of twenty-five years of effort by the Poles in this community. All speakers were generously applauded.</p>
   <p>The recitations of the school children, the singing of the St. Cecilia Singers' Society, the piano solos, and other numbers held the interest of the audience throughout the program. These numbers were concrete evidence of the educational training and effort exerted among the youth of St. Adalbert parish.</p>
