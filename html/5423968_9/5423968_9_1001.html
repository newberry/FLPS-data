   <p>The Third of May exercises, commemorating the one hundred and second anniversary of the Constitution of the Third of May, were held yesterday in the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish hall. Although the hall was not filled to capacity, the audience was a very appreciative one.</p>
   <p>The exercises were preceded by a parade of Knights [uniformed members of Polish church societies]. The opening number of the program was a prayer sung by the Girls' Choir, following which B. Klarkowski assumed the duties of presiding officer. After another choral number and a medley of Polish national hymns under the able direction of A. Kwasigroch, H. Nagiel arose to speak. He gave a general sketch of Polish history since the partitions, dwelling upon the reasons for the Constitution of May Third. He spoke in detail of the provisions of this constitution and of its value. In conclusion, he asked for a continued observance of national anniversaries and for continued efforts to educate the Polish masses. Toward this end, he urged the organization here in America of an institution <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>similar to Macierz Polska [Polish Alma Mater] in Poland.</p>
   <p>A speech by Mr. A. Czajor followed a very excellent drill by the Cadets [members of church societies]. The speaker considered the status of the Poles in America and declared that even though Poland does not exist on the map of Europe, yet she is assured of existence in the hearts of millions of her children scattered throughout the world. He urged adherence to the Catholic faith and to Polish nationalism, ending his address with the cry, "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela." [Poland's Soul Has Not Departed].</p>
   <p>The second portion of the program was begun with a song by the male chorus. Its singing was applauded tremendously. Special recognition is due the director, A. Kwasigroch, and the two soloists, Kedziorski and Barwig. Then followed a recitation by Mr. Jozwiakowski, a song by the mixed chorus, and an orchestral number.</p>
   <p>An address by Reverend Vincent Barzynski concluded the program. The honorable <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>speaker discussed patriotism and, in rather sharp but justified terms, condemned that pseudo-patriotism which confines itself to words. He declared that he sees signs of this in the action of those people who hamper solidarity in our community by creating discord. He said that patriotism without religion and morality is worthless, lashing the materialistic tendencies of the present day. He urged admission of faults, repentance, and a return to the faith. Finally, he appealed to the women to influence their sons and husbands and brothers not to repudiate their faith and nationalism. He told them that it was their solemn duty to guard this treasure. The priest suggested the organization of a Polish women's patriotic club, concluding his address with the following words: "If, at national exercises, we can have a hall filled with Polish women, then we can be certain that their sons and grandsons will rebuild Poland".</p>
   <p>A general singing of "Boze Cos Polske" [O Lord for Poland] ended the exercises, which in spite of the small attendance were a notable success. We say again that <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the audience, though small, was full of enthusiasm and applauded the speeches and musical numbers generously.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The words "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" are at once the title and the opening words of the Polish national anthem].</p>
