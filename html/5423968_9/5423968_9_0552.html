   <p>Yesterday at the Roman Catholic Union building at Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Street exercises were held commemorating the November Insurrection. They were arranged by the third commune of the Polish National Alliance in Holy Trinity Parish. The auditorium was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>Promptly at 8 p.m.,to the strains of Kontski's march played by Henzel's orchestra, representatives of the board of directors of the Polish National Alliance and the officers of the third commune took their places on the platform. Mr. Joseph Szymanski welcomed those present with a warm speech explaining the purpose of the meeting.</p>
   <p>All parts of the program were well executed. The audience enthusiastically applauded the speakers and the people taking part in the program.</p>
   <p>Chopin choir No. 1 under the direction of Professor Henzel sang Jagiello's <span class="page-break">\2</span>Prayer; Mrs. J. Smulski, our well-known singer, sang with her natural artistry, two songs which greatly pleased the audience; then Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, delivered an address.</p>
   <p>In his long and beautiful speech, Mr. K. Zychlinski clearly described to those gathered there the present predicament of our homeland. He compared the present with the year 1830-31 and exhorted the people to help the homeland.</p>
   <p>This speech was followed by a vocal solo by Mr. Dumanowski and a reading by little Peter Cwalinski; Miss Constance Krenz, accompanied by Mr. Henzel, played Wieniawski's "Romances" and Mlynarski's "Mazurka" as violin solos. Mr. John F. Smulski, President of the Polish bank, [The Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank] addressed the audience with ardent words.</p>

   <p>In his speech Mr. Smulski gave a summary of the history of our nation under all three of our annexer governments. He gave a true picture of the poverty and despair of hundreds of thousands of people, who, deprived of their homes, now wander all over Poland seeking shelter. He appealed to those assembled to work for the homeland in unity, harmony, and understanding. He asked them to forget all quarrels, differences, uncertainties, and misunderstandings.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was "Henzel's Memory" sung by the women's choir, Morning Star.</p>
   <p>The collection yielded the generous sum of $124.49.</p>
   <p>With the singing of "God Save Poland" this inspiring and uplifting commemoration, for which the third commune deserves congratulations, was brought to its close.</p>
