   <p>January Exercises were held last Sunday at Pulaski Hall under the auspices of the National Exercise Committee and the J. I. Kraszewski Library. The Exercises were opened by the committee's president, W. Ziarko, who called upon B. L. Maciejewski to act as chairman and the undersigned as secretary.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was an orchestral selection conducted by J. M. Borowicz. The Paderewski Choir then sang the "Polonaise", for which it was rewarded with liberal applause.</p>
   <p>The third number was an address by S. K. Sass, president of Council II, Polish National Alliance. He opened his address with the words of Byron, translated into Polish by Mickiewicz:</p>
   <p>"For Freedom's battle, once begun,</p>
   <p>Bequeathed by bleeding sire to son."</p>
   <p>He enlarged upon this epigraph to show how our nation, after losing its independence, has been passing on the struggle for freedom from generation to generation, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that this struggle will not cease until we have regained our freedom and independence. In the further course of his address, he showed that in our struggles for freedom, the majority of the people had failed to understand their spiritual leaders and only after many years had given them due recognition. Thus, in the present struggle for freedom, the nation failed to understand its leader, Joseph Pilsudski, who received recognition only after being imprisoned by the Prussians.</p>
   <p>The fourth number on the program was a vocal solo by Mrs. Harriet Zebrowski, to the piano accompaniment of Miss. M. Osmanski. Sustained applause forced her to return for an encore. Her second number was entitled "Hearts and Flowers," which she sang with equal beauty, again calling forth storm of well-deserved applause.</p>
   <p>The next number was a piano solo, Sortzles' "Farewell", played by Miss Osmanski. Her rendition was truly artistic, both in technique and in interpretation, and the public was not sparing with its applause.</p>

   <p>A recitation by Miss A. Baron followed, after which Miss Natalie Jarmulowicz danced Paderewski's "Minuet" and, as an encore, the "Barcarolle". Her piano accompanist was Mrs. Zebrowski.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zebrowski's second appearance on the program, when she sang an aria from Act II of Moniuszko's "Halka," was received by the audience as favorably as the first. Her accompanist was again Miss Osmanski.</p>
   <p>Following this number, the orchestra of Professor J. M. Borowicz played a medley of Polish national songs while a collection for the benefit of the war victims in Poland was taken up. The collection netted nineteen dollars.</p>
   <p>Miss A. Gorecki then recited a monologue, which the audience liked so well that it forced her to return for an encore.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was a patriotic play entitled "Ksiadz Mackiewicz" [Father Mackiewicz], presented by the recently organized Henryk Sienkiewicz <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Society for Enlightenment. All of the roles were played well, and the public applauded the amateur actors liberally.</p>
   <p>As a whole, the exercises turned out well, and thanks are due to all those who helped make them a success. Professor Borowicz deserves acknowledgment for supplying an orchestra free of charge. Acknowledgment is due also to the Henry Sienkiewicz Society for Enlightenment, to Mrs. Zebrowski and Miss Osmanski, and to all others who participated in the program.</p>
   <p>Maximilian Hencel, secretary.</p>
