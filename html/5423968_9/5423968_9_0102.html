   <p>Article I</p>
   <p>1. The Polish League is to represent all Poles in the United States of America. Its purpose is to unite all Poles in the name of Christian love and love for Poland, so that they may uplift themselves by engaging collectively in benevolent, educational, and patriotic work. The Polish League--as a combination of moral and physical forces the purpose of which is to promote an interest in nationalistic work--is to be a fraternal alliance standing above all factions.</p>
   <p>2. The object of the Polish League is to defend, support, and foster the Polish national cause by open and legal means. The expression "Polish national cause" is understood to include the civil, political, and national rights of the Poles and such tasks as teaching the Polish language, educating the Poles, [preserving Polish] customs, promoting unity, teaching the history of our nation, promoting the development of national characteristics, and, finally, working for the prosperity [of the Poles]</p>
   <p>3. The purpose of the Polish League may be summed up as follows:</p>
   <p>a. To look after the interests of American Poles in an honest manner, especially, in the presence of public opinion.</p>
   <p>b. To promote education by means of books, schools, and publications.</p>
   <p>c. To keep the Poles morally united in a brotherly spirit through mutual and moral influences.</p>
   
   <p>d. To keep in contact with the mother country--both economically and intellectually.</p>
   <p>e. To improve our material condition through the organization of all kinds of institutions for mutual help.</p>
   <p>f. To help the weak and the poor.</p>
   <p>g. To collect money in America for the Polish National Fund.</p>
   <p>4. The Polish League shall never engage, either directly or indirectly, in any activity against the Holy Roman Catholic Faith or the principles of Christian morality set forth by the Church.</p>
   <p>5. Polish priests, who, through their calling, are engaged in teaching Christian love toward the mother country among the people, especially the youth, will have the right to voice their opinions at mass meetings and sessions of the League. They also will have the right of representation in its administration.</p>
   <p>6. Persons belonging to secret societies or organizations condemned by the Church cannot belong to the League. Anarchists, communists, and socialists shall be excluded from the League.</p>

   <p>(Editor's note: The foregoing outline of the constitution of the Polish League, which we have the honor of presenting to the Polish public in the United States, is nothing else but the material that will be submitted for consideration at the Kosciusko mass meeting. Whether this outline will be accepted, rejected or changed, wholly or in part, depends on the mass meeting, that is, on the delegates legally chosen by the Polish people in the United States of America.)</p>
