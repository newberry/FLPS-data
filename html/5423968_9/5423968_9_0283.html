   <p>We are all patriots here but usually only by word or in the heart.</p>
   <p>Where is there evidence of this?</p>
   <p>The proof is such that each of us claims to be a "patriot"--but when it comes to action, there are no patriots, or only a mere handfull will come to the fore.</p>
   <p>A mason grasps a trowel and by laying bricks proves that he is a mason, a carpenter holds a plane in his hand, and so forth. Each shows through his action what he is.</p>
   <p>And a patriot?</p>
   <p>More often, one is only so named--but he does not manifest it by deed.</p>
   
   <p>We omit here the thousands of important matters and mention but one, with which we are interested at present.</p>
   <p>The patriots unite in associations, become members of various organizations, but only there, where the dollar attracts them, for insurance purposes.</p>
   <p>From this, one can draw a direct conclusion that not patriotism, but the dollar and aid in the event of illness directs us to unite and belong to some kind of an organization.</p>
   <p>But, some will say, what can we do since all associations have that kind of a constitution? Show us such an association where only patriotism is cultivated and we will belong to it! But there are no such associations.....</p>
   <p>Are there none?..... Well, there are! There is in our parish a Organizacya Patryotyczna (Patriotic Organization), whose members do not receive death benefits or any material aid, because the aim of the Organizacya is work for the welfare of our Fatherland.</p>
   <p>The patriotic organization is occupied with the planning of national exercises and recitals, it is the mother and guardian of our library, our Knighthood and Dramatic Circle--hence it extends its efforts in every possible manner to awaken the patriotic spirit and the language of the Fatherland. The members of the Organizacya Patryotyczna do not covet any benefits for themselves, on the contrary, they themselves make contributions of ten cents per month for patriotic purposes from which fund Organizacya had already on several occasions aided our persecuted brothers in the Fatherland.</p>
   <p>Of those, then, who sincerely belong to the Organizacya we can say that they unite not for some benefit, not for any insurance reasons, but for the purpose of showing their patriotism through deeds, to toil in silence for the welfare of their brothers and Fatherland.</p>
   <p>Consequently, a Pole who states that he is a patriot but does nothing toward spreading Polish ideals is no patriot. In the same way, one is not a cobbler, although he is able to sew a pair of shoes, yet, never sews them.</p>
   <p>Thus, if some one states that he is a patriot, ask him if he belongs to the Organizacya Patryotyczna. If he answers in the negative, then, tell him that.... a cobbler who does not sew shoes is no cobbler.</p>
   <p>A Member of Organizacya Patryotyczna.</p>
