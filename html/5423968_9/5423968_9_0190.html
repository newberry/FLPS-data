   <p>The meeting held the other day (Monday, December 18) by the Circle was a complete success.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that many members had been busily engaged in the political campaign, the program consisted of over twenty numbers. Those taking an active part were Mmes. Chlebowska, Kaczmarek, Gorzynska, Konkowska, Nering, Jeszka, Kowalewska, Pankanin, Szenborska, And Messrs. Oszwaldowski, Nowak, Anderszat, Lewandowski, Reptowski, Kikulski, Jozwiakowski, and [S.] Zahajkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The declamations, mainly patriotic (there were twelve of them), suitable to the occasion, were recited with understanding and enthusiasm and pleased everybody, as evidenced by the continuous applause; the songs, beautifully rendered, brought tears to the eyes, while the humorous verses caused bursts of uncontrolled laughter.</p>

   <p>We haven't the space to single out any particular individual for praise, but we wish to state emphatically that all those who appeared in the program deserve the warmest words of commendation.</p>
   <p>The Circle is doing a lot of good with such entertainments. Keep up the good work! Sow the good seed and the crop will be abundant!</p>
