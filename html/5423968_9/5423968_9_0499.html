   <p>Yesterday the J. Slowacki Library and Group 39 of the Polish National Alliance held a mass meeting to commemorate the fifty-fourth anniversary of the January Insurrection. The exercises were held at Slowacki's hall, 48th and South Paulina Streets, in Town of Lake. In spite of the fact that announcements of this commemoration have been appearing in the Polish press for the past few weeks, the attendance was small and the hall was half empty. Perhaps the inclemency of the weather can be blamed for this.</p>
   <p>At 3 P. M. Mr. Damazy Hojnacki, president of the J. Slowacki Library, opened the meeting with a short speech, calling upon Mr. Vincent Wrzesinski, director of the Polish National Alliance, to act as chairman, and upon Mrs. A. Milasiewicz to act as secretary. The chairman, after delivering a speech explaining the purpose of the meeting, called upon Mr. W. Lagocki's orchestra to play the first number. The orchestra played F. Przybylski's "Echoes of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Our Native Land," or "War Signals". The Wisla Choir under the direction of Mr. Z. Filisiewicz sang R. Hensel's "Battle Trumpets". The third number on the program was a piano solo by Miss Harriet Wrzesinski, who played Chopin's "Funeral March". The Filomeny Men's Choir sang J. Galla's "Medley of Polish Songs" and Beethoven's "Hymn to the Night" as an encore. Miss Mary Wcislo gave a reading, which was followed by a speech by Mr. Henry Lokanski, editor of Dziennik Narodowy. Mr. Lokanski summarized the history of the Insurrection of 1863 and the reasons for its failure. Then he brought his topic up to the present times and with his usual spirit and zeal described the present situation of the Polish people, and explained why we should not believe the promises of any of our oppressors and invaders [Russia, Prussia, and Austria]. In conclusion the speaker appealed for generous contributions for our brethern suffering hunger and cold in Poland, and asked us to stand by our national banner.</p>
   <p>While Mr. Lagocki's orchestra was playing "The Glow Worm," Mesdames M. Wrzesinski, Andrysiak, and J. Skwarczynski, as well as Misses J. Appelt <span class="page-break">\3</span>and J. Drzewiecki, took up a collection for our hungry brethren in Poland which yielded twenty-four dollars. Following the collection, the Druzyna Choir sang E. Walkiewicz's "Medley of Polish Songs," and for an encore the "Kosciusko Polonaise". This was followed by a speech by Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary general of the Polish Women's Alliance, who spoke about the present situation in Poland, the destruction of the entire country, and what steps we should take in order to have a free and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>In closing, Miss Napieralski asked us to give our support to everything Polish and to make the largest possible contributions for the purpose of freeing the homeland and for rescuing thousands of our brothers and sisters from starvation. Following this inspiring patriotic speech, Miss Topolski played an overture on the piano. Little Adel Nowaczeski's recitation was greatly liked by the audience. This was followed by a speech by Mr. F. Janiszewski, well-known Polish attorney. Mr. Janiszewski spoke on the situation here in America and the rearing of the children born here.</p>

   <p>The last number on the program was a recitation by little Martin Belka. Chairman W. Wrzesinski thanked the audience for attending despite the mud and unpleasant weather, and for their contributions for Polish relief. With the singing of "God Save Poland," this national celebration was brought to a close.</p>
   <p>It should be added that the entire program was excellently performed and that the audience applauded enthusiastically.</p>
