   <p>The twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the society of St. Stanislaus was celebrated by the Polish people at St. Stanislaus Hall last evening. This was the first Polish society organized in the United States. The Polish colony in Chicago then numbered forty-five families and Peter Kiobassa brought together a group of twenty-five persons for literary and religious culture. Father Szulak, a Jesuit-priest, was chosen spiritual adviser, and he soon organized a church. The Polish population of the city is now 100,000 and St. Stanislaus Church has 20,000 communicants.</p>
   <p>The exercises began yesterday morning, solemn high mass being celebrated at 10 o'clock, accompanied by an orchestra of seventy-five pieces.</p>
