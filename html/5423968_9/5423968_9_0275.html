   <p>Last night in the hall of the school at Bradley and Noble Streets, a large number of delegates of Polish societies from St. Hedwig and St. Stanislaus Kostka parishes convened to discuss plans for participation in the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who spoke about the reasons for participating in this gala celebration. His proposals were simple, and everyone agreed with him. Many societies already have taken this matter up and their plans were revealed. Great enthusiasm prevailed throughout the meeting.</p>
   <p>The assembled group unanimously agreed to have Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer, act as principal marshal for the Polish division. Mr. Kiolbassa's appointment to this position had been discussed at a previous meeting. He also was given <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the right to choose a number of assistants. Although the city treasurer is not in the city at present, it is believed without doubt that he will accept this position.</p>
   <p>The question of music was brought up by the committee which had been appointed at the previous meeting. This committee, composed of presidents of five Polish societies, informed the delegation that it had already made arrangements to have two bands. Members of St. Hedwig parish said that they had engaged another band. Members of national societies asserted that they had three orchestras.</p>
   <p>Presidents of some of the societies suggested that all the societies on dress parade appear in square caps. This suggestion was taken under consideration by a special committee, among which were Messrs. Mucha, Czekala, and others [first names not given]. A proposal to have some of the members march as soldiers with scythes was defeated.</p>
   <p>The question of how the Polish societies will be arranged in the parade was brought up. After a short discussion it was agreed to have the societies <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>divided into three divisions: military societies, church societies in full regalia, and a group of society members who will wear square caps or some other special head gear.</p>
   <p>It was also agreed to take up all proposals with the Polish marshal, who will compare the proposals with the regulations set up by the central committee of the celebration exercises, under the direction of Gen. Miles and his staff. In this way accurate information will be had and all arrangements can be made to accord with the rules.</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting a motion was made to have a final meeting of all representatives of Polish societies, in order to review all plans. This was accepted. The final meeting was set for October 16, and will be held at 4 P. M. in the hall of the St. Stanislaus Kostka School. In case of urgent necessity the meeting may be held earlier.</p>
   <p>In conclusion it must be pointed out that all societies were well prepared with their plans; their enthusiasm is worthy of mention.</p>
