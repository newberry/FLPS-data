   <p>Dr. C. Midowicz Opens the Meeting; Thirty-four Polish Communities Represented by 233 Delegates; Peter Kiolbassa Acts as Chairman, W. Bardonski, as Vice-chairman, and Dr. Czupka, as Secretary</p>
   <p>The Polish mass meeting opened yesterday at 2:30 P.M. with more than two hundred delegates and a large number of people. The session lasted until 8 P.M. without interruption, except for the checking of credentials. All the business of the day was settled at yesterday's session, and today the delegates will take up the main business of the mass meeting--the organization of the Polish League.</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Midowicz, president of the committee in charge of arrangements, opened the mass meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Speech by Dr. Midowicz</p>
   <p>Although Dr. Midowicz's speech was short, it was very beautiful, created a deep impression, and was interrupted time and again by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>"The spirit of Kosciusko inspires us," he said. "This is proved by this large gathering, which I greet with great pleasure. Nine years ago, Hartman, a socialist, voiced his slogan, 'Ausrotten!' (Root them out!) against the Poles, and since then our countrymen have been persecuted. The year of 1894 stands out in our history by the crimes committed against us by the despots. Polish blood was shed freely [during that year] and oppression is still on. In Europe we have been divided into three parts.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless, we still exist. Here in America, where we are allowed to work in behalf of our freedom, we can raise the banner of the white eagle--here we can live for the good of the people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"This work can be realized through the League, the idea of which originated among our countrymen in 1843. The Teutons suppressed this plan at that time, but it was revived here in America years after. This plan is still young but, like a plant, it will grow and bear fruit.</p>
   <p>"If we wish to have a League or national unity, everyone of us must subordinate his ego. Let every one of us learn how to be, not a commander, but a common soldier.</p>
   <p>"The Committee will present to you a plan which may be changed and improved. Anyhow, this mass meeting will accomplish something. The majority will decide, and the public should approve its decision."</p>
   <p>Finally, the speaker urged the delegates to preserve a cool head, serenity, and dignity, adding that they should be inspired with brotherly love and the welfare of all humanity. The public responded with hearty applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Temporary President Chosen; Credentials Checked</p>
   <p>After his speech, Dr. Midowicz introduced Ignace Czerwinski, temporary president of the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>Although unprepared, Mr. Czerwinski addressed a few words to those present to wish them success in the name of God and our motherland. Ignace F. Dankowski acted as temporary secretary.</p>
   <p>Subsequently, at the suggestion of the assembly, the president appointed a committee of fifteen persons to check the credentials of the delegates. This committee withdrew to another room for a conference, and after one hour and a half read its report to the assembly.</p>
   <p>Reverend H. Gorski, chairman of the committee, read the committee's report; S. Zahajkiewicz, secretary of the committee, road the names of accredited delegates. All credentials were accepted, with the exception of a few, <span class="page-break">\5</span>namely, the ones presented by the members of the Preparatory Committee; that of F. Jablonski, representative of Zwiazek Wychodzcow Polskich w Europie (Polish Emigrants' Alliance in Europe) and that of Mr. Barszczewski, who represented Ameryka, a Toledo newspaper. These credentials, whose acceptance was left to the public, were later accepted at the suggestion of Peter Kiolbassa and Dr. Midowicz. [Translator's note: A long list of delegates follows.]</p>
   <p>There were 233 delegates at yesterday's mass meeting, among whom were twenty-one priests representing 314 Polish parishes in the United States. [Translator's note: Cities listed.]</p>
   <p>After the credentials had been accepted, the following telegrams were read by the chairman:</p>
   <p>"Quarville [sic], France:- Greetings, best wishes. Long live free Poland. Department of Polish Emigrants' Alliance in Europe. Gierszynski."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"San Francisco, California:- We have had enough mistrust and dissension. God bless the Polish League. Dr. Pawlicki, Helen Modrzejewski, Count Chlapowski, A. Katski."</p>
   <p>"Cincinnati, Ohio:- Vive Polish mass meeting. Polish nation realize your power in the League. Rejtans [member of Polish Sejm, who refused to sign the agreement of partition], in your hands lies salvation! Kosciusko Society."</p>
   <p>"Wilmington, Delaware:- St. Hedwig Parish and its five societies are for the League. Liga vivat, crescat, floreat. Reverend Szczepanski."</p>
   <p>Toledo, Ohio:- Success to the mass meeting and the League. Kurjer."</p>
   <p>"Baltimore, Maryland:- God's blessings, peaceful massmeeting. Lasting League; million members; good results for the nation. Reverend M. Barabasz."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Election of President and Vice-President</p>
   <p>After attending to all preliminary formalities, the delegates received their badges, and the task of electing the permanent president and secretary of the mass meeting began.</p>
   <p>However, before proceeding to the election, the assembly had to settle the question of how many votes the delegates with more than one credential were entitled to. After a long and lively discussion it was decided that a delegate should have only one vote and that the choice of president should be made through a secret ballot.</p>
   <p>The temporary president appointed M. A. LaBuy, W. Smulski, W. Bardonski, B. Straszynski, and F. Jablonski to collect and count the votes.</p>
   <p>In the first balloting Peter Kiolbassa received 100 votes; W. Bardonski, 47; Joseph Dudek, 28; K. J. Bielinski, 14; Dr. Midowicz, 14; and a few delegates, <span class="page-break">\8</span>2 or 3 votes each.</p>
   <p>The second and final balloting decided between Peter Kiolbassa and W. Bardonski. The first received 123 votes and the second 99. Peter Kiolbassa was thus elected permanent president. W. Bardonski was elected vice-president by acclamation.</p>
   <p>In a few words, simple but cordial, the president expressed his thanks for the honor, pointed out the importance and dignity of the moment, and promised that he would fulfill his duty according to his conscience--impartially and in such manner that the national cause would be benefited by it.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the speech, Dr. Czupka of Baltimore, Ohio, was elected secretary of the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>As it was already late, the meeting was adjourned until 9 A.M. this morning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Before adjourning, Mr. Kiolbassa appointed two committees consisting of five persons each. The first committee will prepare the program of the mass meeting, and the other will work out the rules. Both will make their reports this morning.</p>
   <p>Second Day of the Mass Meeting</p>
   <p>The second day of the mass meeting began at 8 A.M. with church services at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, with Right Reverend Miskiewicz of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, officiating. Reverend Gulski, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, delivered the sermon which was very beautiful.</p>
   <p>We regret that lack of space does not permit us to publish the text of the sermon in its entirety.</p>
   <p>Reverend Gulski urged the delegates to unite and condemned the dissensions which have divided us until now, pointing out the ruinous results of disunity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>He explained the part the Polish clergy should play in the League and emphasized the fact that the Polish clergy has played an important part in the history of Poland. He laid emphasis on the great benefit with which the Poles in America would be blessed if the League is established, expressed confidence that this great work would be realized, and beseeched God that we may be permitted to weed out dissension from among us--this deadly weed which continues to poison our hopes.</p>
   <p>Reverend Gulski concluded his speech with these beautiful words:</p>
   <p>"I am confident that you will not be influenced by the trivial sarcasm of the people who oppose a good cause, and that you will not heed any remarks concerning old quarrels, but will recall the words spoken by John Paul Weronicz over the grave of Kosciusko: 'Wherever the Lord of Heaven and his servants co-operate, there one person armed only with the jaw of an as will defeat and dispense legions of Philistines.' Bearing in mind these words uttered on the anniversary of the battle of this hero, you should prove that you are <span class="page-break">\11</span>aware of the unworthiness and obduracy of the enemies of unity in our nation. You should prove that you do not belong among these narrow-minded people who, forgetting everything and learning nothing, are forever engaged in old quarrels and disputes. On the contrary, through your good conduct, you will be remembered by your descendants and you will be blessed by the One whom you beseeched for help when this session started. Amen."</p>
   <p>Morning Session</p>
   <p>The morning session was opened at 10 A.M. At the request of the chairman, Reverend Felix Zwiardowski, from Czestochowa, Texas, said a prayer for the mother country. After the prayer, Dr. Midowicz, president of the Program Committee, read the order of the day, which was as follows:</p>
   <p>(1) Reading of correspondence; (2) introduction of new delegates; (3) election of a Resolutions Committee; (4) presentation of the plan of the League by its proponents; (5) discussion of this plan; (6) reports of the <span class="page-break">\12</span>committees; (7) problems [arising from there reports]; and (8) election of officials for the League. The order of the day was accepted unanimously.</p>
   <p>In behalf of the Rules Committee, Mr. Kruszka submitted a report, which was accepted with small changes. Then the secretary read the following correspondence:</p>
   <p>(1) A letter from Reverend Edward Rajnert of Briecefield (sic), Missouri, addressed to Mr. [S.] Zahajkiewicz, with good wishes for the mass meeting and the League.</p>
   <p>(2) A letter from B. D. Zasada of Ashland, Wisconsin, who announced, in behalf of the Poles who had gathered at a meeting in that city, that Reverend Damian Koziolek had been chosen as their delegate to the mass meeting and that ninety-four residents of Ashland had already joined the League.</p>
   <p>(3) Letter from Erasmus Jerzmanowski of New York, excusing his absence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>(4) A letter from the St. Stanislaus Society, in Alpena, Michigan, wishing the mass meeting and the League success.</p>
   <p>(5) A letter from J. Ejdympt of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in behalf of the Sigmund August Society, a Lithuanian society. In its letter, the Lithuanian society expressed such sincere good wishes for the League that, at the suggestion of Reverend Vincent Barzynski, the assembly cheered in honor of the Lithuanians. At the suggestions of Czupka and Szopinski, the letter will be handed to the Resolutions Committee, which will comply with the request made in it.</p>
   <p>At 11 A.M., at the suggestion of Dr. Midowicz, president of the Committee representing the Polish League in America, submitted the plan for establishing the League.</p>
   <p>(To be continued tomorrow.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Polish League Established on Second Day of Mass Meeting</p>
   <p>Yesterday we published a brief account of the mass meeting up to 11 o'clock yesterday morning.</p>
   <p>Supplementing this information, we wish to add that yesterday, right after the opening of the session, a list of the names of the newly arrived delegates was read. This list included the names of Right Reverend Simon Kobrzynski, Reverend Francis Lande, Reverend S. Nawrocki (all from Chicago), and Mr. Stanislaus Sniegowski, delegate from the Uhlans' Society in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, Chicago; Mr. Ladislaus Kaptur, delegate from the fourth division of Uhlans in Town of Lake, Chicago; Mr. Louis Mrukowski, from the Sacred Heart Society No. 1, Chicago; Mr. Lucian Jastrzebski, from the Holy Family Society, Chicago; and Mr. Joseph Kudlicki, delegated by a group of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>As regards other activities of the mass meeting, we wish to add that the <span class="page-break">\15</span>chairman of the Resolutions Committee appointed the following persons as members of the Committee: Reverend II. Gulski of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Mr. Helinski of Duluth, Minnesota; Mr. Z. Brodowski, Mr. Anthony Stefanowicz, Mr. Henry Nagiel, Mr. John Chrzanowski, and Mr. Francis H. Jablonski, all of Chicago; M. Kruszka of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Joseph Kaczmarek of South Bend, Indiana.</p>
   <p>Establishment of the Polish League</p>
   <p>After Dr. Midowicz's submission of the aims and objects of the Polish League as given in the plan, Mr. Z. Brodowski said that we should unite all our forces--individuals, societies, and organizations--for common nationalistic work. Immediately after him, Mr. Zahajkiewicz spoke in the same spirit.</p>
   <p>T. Helinski, censor of the Polish National Alliance, who spoke in the name of this organization, stated that the original aims of the Polish National Alliance were almost the same as those of the proposed League and added that, <span class="page-break">\16</span>by opposing the aims of the League, the Alliance's representatives would oppose their own aims, and that, therefore, the Alliance's representatives recognized these aims as beautiful and noble. He said that, inasmuch as the Alliance's decisions are made at its conventions, the representatives could not undertake any action independently or make any decision which would bind them, especially in respect to joining or not joining the League. Mr. Helinski, asked the assembly not to be prejudiced against the Alliance, and added that the latter, seeing the progress and activities of the League, would probably join it later on, according to what might be decided at the next convention.</p>
   <p>This statement was discussed by Dr. Midowicz, Reverend V. Barzynski, and Mr. Zahajkiewicz, who explained that the object of the League was to unite the national forces, and that none of the organizations--the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish National Alliance, or the Union of Poles in America [Buffalo, N. Y.]--had been expected to send delegates to the mass meeting for the purpose of deciding matters whose decision was up to their <span class="page-break">\17</span>conventions. They argued that it was not the object of the League to hinder the development of these organizations; that its object was to help them as much as possible. Helinski and Terczewski spoke again in behalf of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Relating his experiences during his missionary travels in Brazil and other South American countries, Reverend M. Mozejewski asserted that the Germans have a very strong influence in these countries because they are organized and expressed the hope that the Poles in the United States would follow this example.</p>
   <p>Finally, on a motion made by E. Z. Brodowski and seconded by Reverend V. Barzynski and J. Czekala, it was decided to close the debate in order to proceed to the voting. When the chairman asked the delegates in favor of organizing the League to stand up, more than seventy-five per cent of their number arose; when the order was given to those against it, only four or five stood up. Amidst enthusiastic applause from the main floor and the <span class="page-break">\18</span>galleries, the chairman announced that, according to the decision of the first Polish mass meeting in America, the Polish League had been established.</p>
   <p>Later on, Dr. J. Czupka speaking in behalf of the numerous societies he represents, suggested that the question whether a delegate should have as many votes as the number of societies delegating him, or only one vote, should be considered again. Debates ensued in which many delegates participated. Brodowski moved that each mandate entitle a delegate to one vote. His motion, which had been seconded by Mr. S. Szwajkart, was not carried, and it was decided that each delegate should be entitled to one vote only, regardless of the number of societies represented. The session was then adjourned until 2:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>After adjournment, several delegates approached the chairman's table to return their badges and ask for their credentials, adducing that they had been instructed by their organizations to participate only in the mass meeting, not in the sessions of the League. The delegates asking for their credentials <span class="page-break">\19</span>were Dr. Lande, Anthony Zdzieblowski, who acted as substitute for [M.] Drzymala, Terczewski, [A.] Mallek, Helinski, [S.] Glominski, Gruenwald, [M.] Majewski, [J.] Magdziarz, [A.] Lisztewnik, Szatkowski, L. Nowak, Stanislaus Rokosz, D. Ekoski, Barszczewski (a representative of Ameryka, who declared that he desired to stay in the hall as a representative of some European newspaper), Joseph Kudlicki, R. Kotlowski, J. Adamowski, P. Binkowski, P. Binkowski, Blaszczynski, and Modrzewski.</p>
   <p>Afternoon Session</p>
   <p>At the afternoon session, opened by Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, it was decided that the outline of the Polish League in America should be submitted for deliberation. The entire afternoon was devoted to the discussion of the articles and paragraphs of the outline. The following articles were accepted with many amendments and additions:</p>
   <p>Article I, "Outlines and Principles of the Polish League"; Article II, <span class="page-break">\20</span>"Organization of the League"; Article IV, "Bylaws of the Polish National Fund"; Article V, "Legislative Power of the League"; and the first and second paragraphs of Article VI, "Executive Power of the League." Acceptance of Article III--"Financial Organization of the League"--was deferred; this article, along with others,will be accepted later on. Deliberation on Article VII, as well as on the rest of the paragraphs of Article VI, were left for the next session.</p>
   <p>The following amendments were made by the assembly: In Article I, Paragraph I, where the work of the League is defined, it was decided at the suggestion of Mr. Czupka that to the phrase "....benevolent, educational, and patriotic work" be added the words "political and economic." Paragraph 3, section a, was changed to read: "The League will help develop Polish interests in the United States, and will protect them in an honest manner, especially in the eyes of the American public, by means of the press." Paragraph 5, of Article I--"Rights of the Polish Clergy"--was changed to read: "Polish priests belonging to the League and working for the Polish cause in the League's spirit have <span class="page-break">\21</span>the right to voice their opinion at the League's conventions. Pastors of Polish parishes, or their assistants, belonging to the League are by virtue of their office automatically made delegates to the League."</p>
   <p>As a result of this change, Paragraph 4, Article V, referring to the privileges of the clergy at the conventions of the League, was canceled.</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of K. J. Bielinski, and after a lively discussion, the word "or" was deleted from Paragraph 6, Article I, referring to members of secret societies. This means that the paragraph in question refers only to the secret societies condemned by the Church.</p>
   <p>Minor changes were also made in Article II. To Paragraph 2 was added:</p>
   <p>"Individuals not affiliated with any society may belong to the League without the right of representation"; to Paragraph 4, "The central board of the League shall establish and fix the boundary lines of the districts, and the convention shall confirm them." An additional paragraph was added, which reads as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\22</span>
   <p>"Election of officials of district committees is autonomous." In Paragraph 8, referring to education and patriotism, the words "and welfare" were added.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 1, Article IV, about the Polish National Fund, was accepted without any changes. Paragraph 4, which specifies that the funds of the Polish National Fund are to be invested in United States bonds, brought up a lively discussion, but it was passed without any change. Paragraph 6 was changed to read: "The trustees of the Polish National Fund shall be chosen at the convention and shall consist of eight financially responsible citizens enjoying the confidence of the public and two priests chosen by the clergy at the convention."</p>
   <p>Article IV was thoroughly elucidated by Father Barzynski, who said that, in order to support the Polish National Fund with a clear conscience, the clergy must first be convinced that the Fund is adequately insured and based on a strong foundation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\23</span>
   <p>Paragraph 10 was changed to read: "When the Polish National Fund reaches the sum of $100,000, the convention will decide for what purpose the interest, or the capital, may be used, and the central board of the League, consisting of trustworthy men, will expend the funds according to the decision of the convention."</p>
   <p>Article V, Paragraph 2, was amended, at the suggestion of J. Napieralski, to read: "Conventions shall be held every two years, instead of every three years, as was proposed in the Outline."</p>
   <p>Decision on M. Kruszka's motion that the next convention be held next year was postponed until the next session.</p>
   <p>On a motion by H. Nagiel, the second part of Paragraph 4, Article V, which reads that the editors of Polish newspapers working in the spirit of the League are by virtue of their office made delegates to the convention, was eliminated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\24</span>
   <p>To Paragraph 6, Article V, was added: "The Polish clergy sitting at the League's conventions may choose from their midst one representative to the central board."</p>
   <p>Paragraph 1, Article VI, was also changed. It was decided that, not four, but only three directors should be chosen from the members of the central board.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 2, Article VI, was accepted without any changes.</p>
   <p>When Paragraph 3, Article VI, treating on immigration, was submitted for deliberation, Dr. J. Czupka made the suggestion that a detailed plan be worked out. This paragraph gave rise to a heated discussion, with the result that the matter was postponed until the next day and the session was adjourned.</p>
   <p>Incidentally, when the rights of the Polish clergy were under discussion and <span class="page-break">\25</span>several missionaries were mentioned, Father Barzynski introduced a Jesuit Father Reverend Francis Szulak, one of the most eminent Polish missionaries in America, who has contributed a great deal toward the establishment of many Polish parishes on this hemisphere. Reverend Szulak addressed the gathering in a few but hearty words, in which he assured us that he had worked in America for many years and that he desired to work for the Poles and the Polish cause. The assembly arose to honor him.</p>
   <p>Third Day of the Mass Meeting</p>
   <p>The morning session opened at 9:20 A.M. At the request of the chairman, Reverend Mozejewski said a prayer and the secretary read the minutes of the last session.</p>
   <p>The outline of the League was then submitted to the assembly for deliberation. However, before the reading started, Dr. Czupka asked permission to make a motion and submitted a plan whereby the League would be able to appropriate <span class="page-break">\26</span>a large sum of money to carry on its good work, such as protecting the immigrants and engaging in welfare work. The plan, which calls for the establishment of a Polish bank controlled by the League, was supported by Father Barzynski, who advised that it should be accepted at once in principle and incorporated in the constitution, and that its details should be entrusted to a special committee, which would prepare a plan and submit it at the next convention.</p>
   <p>This matter was settled by Zahajkiewicz, who, seconded by Dr. Czupka, moved that the following addition be incorporated in Article III, Paragraph 1: "c. From the profits derived from the bank which will be established and controlled by the League."</p>
   <p>The deliberations were interrupted by the reading of two letters--one from W. Graczyk of South Lend, Indiana, who expressed his good wishes for the mass meeting and the League; and the other from the Sisters of Nazareth, who asked for support of the Polish hospital. Mr. Kruszka moved that this <span class="page-break">\27</span>letter be handed over to the Resolutions Committee, and his motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Following this, Dr. Czupka proposed that a Polish bazaar, or bazaars, be held in order to raise funds for the League, and moved that another section, namely: "d. From the income derived from the proposed Polish bazaars," be added to Article III, Paragraph 1.</p>
   <p>Reverend Barzynski moved that Dr. Czupka be rewarded with applause for his suggestions.</p>
   <p>Dr. Czupka thanked the assembly for the applause and said that he had other suggestions concerning political matters but, that, since the delegates were exhausted and trying to bring the session to an end, he would not submit them.</p>
   <p>Next in line was Paragraph 3, Article VI, which, although accepted in principle, was referred to the Committee for correction.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\28</span>
   <p>At 11 A.M. Paragraph 4, Article VI, was discussed.</p>
   <p>(To be continued tomorrow.)</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, May 11, 1894.</p>
   <p>POLISH MASS MEETING ENDS</p>
   <p>Third and Last Day of the Mass Meeting;</p>
   <p>League Established; Officials Elected</p>
   <p>P. Erasmus Jerzmanowski was made president, J. Napieralski, vice-president, and Peter Kiolbassa, treasurer, of the League.</p>
   <p>Resolutions of the Mass Meeting</p>
   <p>To Paragraph 4, Article VI, was added, "which will be controlled and supervised by the Poles." This stipulation gave rise to a few sharp remarks, but <span class="page-break">\29</span>M. Kruszka, with the approval of the chairman, explained the matter to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>
   <p>In section "d" [of the same paragraph] the word "Prawach" was changed to "Sprawach" [the first means "laws"; the other, "affairs"], and in section "e", "Sprawach" was changed to "Prawach." It was also decided that only United States citizens can hold office in the League.</p>
   <p>After accepting Paragraph 5 of the same article with small changes, the session was adjourned at 12:30, right after Article VII had been submitted for discussion.</p>
   <p>The changes made in Article VII are as follows: To Paragraph 2, on a motion by Dr. Czupka, was added: "To the staff of officials in the Welfare Department there should be added ten directors."</p>
   <p>To Paragraph 3, a section was added, namely: "d. By holding literary contests."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\30</span>
   <p>In Paragraph 4, section "d" was changed to read: "By establishing a Polish bank, holding bazaars, and encouraging Polish business."</p>
   <p>Paragraph 5 was accepted, and Paragraph 6 was changed to read: "Each member of the central board must furnish a bond to the amount prescribed by the convention."</p>
   <p>Immediately, the problem of bonding the officials was taken up, and it was decided that the bonds of the treasurer, the president, and the secretary should be of $100,000, $25,000, and $50,000 respectively. Other officials shall be required to furnish bonds of $10,000.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 7 gave rise to a heated discussion, as many delegates insisted that the treasurer should receive a salary. The other paragraphs were accepted with minor changes.</p>
   <p>Reverend V. Barzynski moved that the treasurer of the Polish National Fund <span class="page-break">\31</span>should not keep more than one hundred dollars cash on hand, that as soon as this sum was reached it should be invested in a United States bond. The motion was carried with an amendment proposed by Bielinski that the amount of cash on hand be raised to five hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>When this matter had been settled, the Resolutions Committee was instructed to submit a report. We wish to add that some members of this committee have been replaced and that now it consists of Reverend H. Gulski and M. Kruszka, both of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; H. Magiel, L. Szopinski, August J. Kowalski, and S. Zahajkiewicz, all of Chicago; and J. Kaczmarek, of South Bend, Indiana.</p>
   <p>Resolution</p>
   <p>We Poles from all parts of the United States, gathered at this Polish mass meeting, held in Chicago, Illinois, on May 8, 9, and 10, 1894, do resolve and decide:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\32</span>
   <p>(1) That the first and sacred duty of the Poles living in the United States of North America and enjoying political freedom is to promote harmony and moral and political unity, so that, through this harmony and unity they may work for the welfare of all and for the welfare of our oppressed mother country.</p>
   <p>(2) That we will heartily approve and support all endeavors and attempts to establish national solidarity through the organization of the Poles in America for the purpose of fulfilling our national duties; that we will severely condemn all discords, contentions, and instigations tending to destroy this solidarity and plunge the Polish element in America into a destructive fratricidal conflict.</p>
   <p>(3) That we particularly condemn the scandalous actions of certian newspapers which, out of malice and personal hatred and resorting to slander and deception, have attempted to defeat all efforts to establish national solidarity; we brand their attitude as unpatriotic and contrary to the duties of a Pole.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\33</span>
   <p>(4) That we shall consider this year--known as Kosciusko Year, in which we commemorate this leader's heroic deeds and sacrifices, as well as those of the people who shed their blood and sacrificed their wealth that the mother country might be saved from bondage--as the most proper and suitable time for laying the foundation of an organization through which we may" establish unity, solidarity, and brotherly love among the Poles in America, an organization for which we have waited so long--the Polish League.</p>
   <p>(5) That, in view of the friendly co-operation of our brother Lithuanians and their participation in the mass meeting, we express to them our sincere love and respect, and solemnly confirm the eternal and voluntary union between our two races, a union based on the Union of Lublin--an alliance of the equal with the equal, the free with the free; that we will brand as betrayers of our holy cause all those who may try to rupture our eternal solidarity with the Lithuanians by any kind of unrighteous means.</p>
   <p>(6) That, in view of the foregoing reasons, not only the well-thinking Poles <span class="page-break">\34</span>living here, but also all brother Lithuanians and Ruthenians sharing our desire for national solidarity and in sympathy with an independent Poland, are invited to the Polish League in America; and finally,</p>
   <p>(7) That, conceiving the idea of national solidarity in a very broad sense, we reaffirm our unity with our native land and realize that we ought, as a portion of Polish immigration in a foreign land, to keep in contact with other portions of this immigration. Hereby we express the desire of establishing, by means of the League, such friendly and fraternal relationship, in order to carry on our common nationalistic work, not only with the Polish Emigration Alliance in Europe, but also with similar organizations in Europe, South America, and other parts of the world.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved, (8) That, in view of the arrival at the mass meeting of the representative of the Slovak parishes in Shamokin and Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania, we hereby express our most cordial acknowledgment and gratitude to our kindred race, the Slovaks, for their good intention and interest in our <span class="page-break">\35</span>affairs. We also wish to declare in the name of the Polish people in America that we sincerely desire to establish reciprocal and friendly relations with other Slavonic races in America for the purpose of defending ourselves against their leaders and for supporting our interests and the interests of those Slavonic races which are not inimical to our national spirit.,</p>
   <p>Finally, we resolve and enact, (9) That we Poles, assembled together at Kosciusko's mass meeting on the one-hundredth anniversary of Poland's struggle for independence, deem it necessary to pay public homage and respect to those heroes and martyrs who fought for the independence of our mother country and, above all, to the hero of two worlds, Thaddeus Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, on the one-hundredth anniversary of Poland's struggle for independence we voice once more, in the name of the Polish people, a loud protest against the partition of Poland in 1795 and the two previous partitions, which are a political crime. We also protest against the cruel oppression to which the Poles have been subjected for the last one hundred years under Russian <span class="page-break">\36</span>occupation.</p>
   <p>We protest particularly against the murders committed recently in Kroze, Poland, by assassins of the Muscovite government, on innocent, defenseless people who had refused to forsake their fathers' faith.</p>
   <p>Finally, we express our greatest respect for the American flag and the principles of freedom and liberty for which this Republic stands--principles which allow us to assemble for the purpose of discussing our national problems, and voicing our opinion in defense of our sacred rights.</p>
   <p>Other Matters</p>
   <p>The Resolutions Committee announced that the petition of the Sisters of Nazareth, asking support for the Polish Hospital, had been submitted to the central board of the League.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\37</span>
   <p>On a motion by Reverend V. Barzynski, the assembly decided to grant the petition of the Lithuanian Society from Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The society in question had asked that the Polish press publish articles from time to time about the need of unity between Poles and Lithuanians and condemning those who oppose such unity. This was submitted to the central board of the League.</p>
   <p>Further, Dr. C. Midowicz made the following propositions:</p>
   <p>(1) That the central board of the Polish League make an appeal to all societies, organizations, and parishes to join in a protest against the United States extradition treaty with Russia.</p>
   <p>(2) That the central board of the League send a copy of a protest against the partition of Poland, made at the mass meeting, to all European governments and to the government of the United States.</p>
   <p>(3) That the central board of the League make an appeal to all Polish <span class="page-break">\38</span>organizations, parishes, etc., urging then to become members of the League. These motions were carried.</p>
   <p>Future Conventions</p>
   <p>A motion by M. Kruszka to the effect that the next convention of the Polish League be held in May, 1895, was carried. The place where the next convention will be held was discussed, but no definite agreement was reached, since some of the delegates proposed Milwaukee, others Pittsburgh, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo, etc. Finally, at the suggestion of M. Kruszka, it was decided that the central board of the League should select a suitable location east of Chicago, in the state of Michigan, Ohio, or Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>And now other delegates voiced their opinion. Zahajkiewicz urged the delegates to work for the League so that the organization may have a few hundred thousand members before the next convention. At Dr. Czupka's request, the assembly arose in honor of the committee in charge of arrangements for the mass meeting and the <span class="page-break">\39</span>League.</p>
   <p>Elections</p>
   <p>On a motion by Judge La Buy, the delegates proceeded to the election of the president and other officers of the League. The Judge nominated Erasmus Jerzmanowski for president of the central board of the League and moved that the latter be elected by acclamation. The motion was carried and Mr. Erasmus Jerzmanowski became president by acclamation. Since Mr. Jerzmanowski was absent, it was decided to send him a telegram to New York. The same evening the following telegram was received from Mr. Jerzmanowski:</p>
   <p>"I accept and hope that united we will be able to render a good service to our Mother Country.</p>
   <p>"E. Jerzmanowski."</p>
   <p>The assembly then proceeded to the election of the first vice-president. The first ballot resulted in 40 votes for Joseph Napieralski, 22 votes for <span class="page-break">\40</span>Judge La Buy, 15 votes for Peter Kiolbassa, 14 votes for M. Osuch, 11 votes for L. Szopinski, 6 votes for August Kowalski, and 5 votes for M. Kruszka. In the second and final ballot Joseph Napieralski was elected by 80 votes. Judge La Buy had only 44. M. Kruszka of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was elected second vice-president by acclamation.</p>
   <p>The secretary was chosen by secret ballot. In the first balloting Stanislaus Szwajkart received 51 votes; F. J. Dankowski, 18; K. J. Bielinski, 17; B. Klarkowski, 15; J. Czupka, 10; Reverend F. M. Wojtalewicz, 9; L. Szopinski, 7. The final ballot gave Szwajkart 82 votes and Dankowski 45. S. Szwajkart was elected secretary.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa was made cashier by acclamation. The directors were chosen in the same manner. They are N. L. Piotrowski and Anthony Baczynski, both of Chicago, and Francis K. Rydzewski, of South Chicago. The rest of the directors are from other cities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\41</span>
   <p>Trustees of the Polish National Fund</p>
   <p>And now the assembly proceeded to elect the trustees of the Polish National Fund. Clement J. Bielinski and Andrew Bielinski both of Chicago, were among those elected. The other trustees are from other cities. The clergy announced that they had chosen Reverend A. Kowicki of South Chicago and Right Reverend Miskiewicz of Pittsburgh. The selection of the committees prescribed by the constitution, as well as the establishing of departments, was entrusted to the central board of the League.</p>
   <p>More Patriotic Speeches</p>
   <p>Although the session of the League had been officially adjourned, the enthusiasm awakened by the great work that had just been started demanded an outlet, and several citizens delivered patriotic speeches. Dr. Midowicz urged everyone to become an apostle of the idea of the League and work for the welfare of the nation. Reverend Barzynski said that the objections to the League were <span class="page-break">\42</span>groundless, especially the statement that the League had been established to gratify the personal whims of a certain clique. That this accusation is false may be proved by the fact that only three or four members of the Preparatory Committee were made officials of the League. Peter Kiolbassa thanked the participants of the mass meeting for their perseverance and good behavior.</p>
   <p>Then the assembly arose to express its appreciation to Ignace Czerwinski, Dankowski, Kiolbassa, Reverend V. Barzynski, Dr. Midowicz, and others.</p>
   <p>Initial donations, which were gladly accepted, were then made for the League at the suggestion of Straszynski. A total of 45.43 was collected, and it constitutes a nice beginning.</p>
   <p>The mass meeting ended with three cheers--Long live Poland! Long live the League! Long live the Polish National Fund! Then the assembly sang "Poland Is Not Yet Lost," and Reverend Szulak, the venerable missionary, blessed the <span class="page-break">\43</span>gathering.</p>
   <p>Some delegates went to the rectory of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish to discuss the problems of the League and nationalistic work.</p>
