   <p>The Polish National Alliance Convention opened yesterday; today's issue of Dziennik Chicagoski carries a full report of its first day's activity. We say in advance that whatever our own private opinions on Alliance affairs, the reports in Dziennik [Chicagoski] will be strictly nonpartisan and textual. Our sole aim is to present the activities of the convention without any partisanship one way or the other. In this respect, we will not follow the example of the Alliance's official organ [Zgoda], which begins its criticism of one side or the other on the second day after the convention starts. We will restrain ourselves from any premature judgments as to its results. We intend merely to perform the functions of a daily newspaper in reflecting faithfully and truthfully everything that happens at the convention.</p>
