   <p>The thirty-third anniversary of the Polish January Insurrection was celebrated last night at a meeting held in the school hall under the auspices of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Societies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Szatkowski opened the celebration at eight o'clock and called on Mr. Frank Kwasigroch to act as chairman, and the undersigned, Mr. Stanislaus Szwajkart, to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecelia Young Ladies' Chorus sang a medley of Polish national airs especially arranged for this celebration. Then Mr. Peter Kiolbassa was called on for the first speech.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa spoke of the heroic efforts of the Polish insurrectionists <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the year 1863, who, although the insurrection itself was not successful, deserve our greatest respect, because they gave everything they had for their country; and even though they knew it meant certain death, they were willing to make the sacrifice. He mentioned that we have quite a few witnesses to the events in our unfortunate country, men who took an active part in it, namely: Reverend Simon Kobrzynski, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, and his father, Mr. Joseph Barzynski. Never seeking praise, they seldom speak of it. The speaker then drew a comparison between genuine patriots who have proved their patriotism by heroic deeds and are modest and the other kind who merely mouth patriotism but never prove it in any concrete manner. He discussed at length the meaning of true freedom, which, alas, is misconstrued by some people in this country.</p>
   <p>Miss Rosalie Gorzynski recited a poem, "Trzy Polki" (Three Polish Women) in a truly artistic manner, creating quite a lot of enthusiasm. Then Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch sang Schubert's "Serenade" so beautifully that she was forced to <span class="page-break">\3</span>sing again.</p>
   <p>Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz spoke of the events during the January Insurrection. He graphically portrayed the history of this Insurrection, then urged those present to take an active part in national affairs, especially reminding parents to instill love for the Polish tongue in the hearts of the young and to teach respect for our national traditions. Both speeches were interrupted by frequent applause.</p>
   <p>Next, the well-known St. Cecelia Ladies' Chorus sang "Ojczyzno Dlugo Gnebiona" (Fatherland Oppressed A Long Time); then the soldier boys of St. Martin, the Guard of the Queen of The Polish Crown, and the Uhlans gave a beautiful exhibition of drilling on the stage.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecelia Mixed Choir sang "O Powstani u Styczniowem" (About the January Insurrection) and the tiny John Mroczkowski bravely recited a poem "Polska Zyje" (Poland Lives). Then Mr. Stanislaus Szwajkart spoke on the need for <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>Miss Wanda Barwig and Mr. John Kedziorski sang a duet from the Polish opera "Halka" so effectively that the audience forced them to render an encore. The recital of the poem "Wiara" (Faith) by Miss Rose Koppa also pleased the audience very much.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony W. Rudnicki then spoke.</p>
   <p>He pointed out the reasons for the failure of the January Insurrection and explained how we in the United States should act in order to deserve the name "good citizen" and also "good Pole".</p>
   <p>The singing by the St. Cecelia Male Chorus of the "Marsz Styczniowy" (The January March) followed, and Judge M. A. LaBuy was to have delivered the concluding speech, but instead a telegram from him from Milwaukee was read <span class="page-break">\5</span>as follows:</p>
   <p>"To The Chairman of the January Celebration in the hall on Bradley Street: Being far away from Chicago on important business, I cannot attend the celebration; but I am with you heart and soul. God Save Poland!</p>
   <p>"M. A. LaBuy."</p>
   <p>The chairman then asked the Reverend John Obyrtacz to say a few words. Reverend Obyrtacz briefly thanked the people for attending the celebration and then mentioned the various points brought out by the speakers and drew some constructive conclusions.</p>
   <p>The singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland) concluded the celebration.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Szwajkart,</p>
   <p>secretary of the celebration.</p>
