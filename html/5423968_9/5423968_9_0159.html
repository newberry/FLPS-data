   <p>We wish to take up the question of the Polish military societies in the United States of North America--a question which is irritating to many people and which; summed up, is as follows:</p>
   <p>There are approximately two hundred Polish military societies in the United States. Assuming that each one of them has at least twenty members, there are about four thousand Poles busy at the pastime of "playing soldier". Whether this pastime, which is quite expensive, has any deeper motives and significance, being therefore a practical thing worthy of support; or whether, on the contrary, it is only a vain showing-off, harmful at best, is a question which has been debated many times.</p>
   <p>Polish military societies have many opponents, who claim that these "playful knights" spend hundreds of dollars uselessly for showy colorful <span class="page-break">\2</span>uniforms, fancy shakos, sashes, cords, etc.; that this money could be used for better purposes, for instance, to help the poor Polish working people. In their opinion, this is just a squandering of hard-earned money.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, they claim that the military societies are useless. Although every one of these societies has in its constitution a paragraph which says that the society desires to contribute toward the liberation of Poland--very likely by supplying soldiers--the pessimists maintain that in case of need these societies would be unable to send even a small number of soldiers to the battlefield. They say that our "knights" who settled here are so used to American ways and so burdened with families that they would lack the desire, the funds, and, especially, the military training. These pessimists are of the opinion that the soldiers who belong to the Polish military societies are soldiers in name only, just for parading; that they do not understand military drills, cannot shoot or use weapons; and that they have no competent instructors or officers with professional training.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Finally, we are coming to the last and the most important objection. The critics hold that, from the American point of view, it is unpatriotic to organize military societies in America for the purpose of using them later against the enemies of Poland. They say that if we are bona fide American citizens and derive benefits as such, we have no right to meddle in foreign politics, which may even be opposed to American idealism; also, that we have no right to create a state within a state. They even threaten us with interference of the American Government against such military societies.</p>
   <p>These three objections have a shade of truth, but only a shade. In reality, they cannot stand criticism.</p>
   <p>We present these objections extensively in order that we may contradict them fundamentally and prove conclusively that the Polish military societies are necessary and useful, that they can exist here and benefit us as Poles and as citizens of the United States. This is our frank opinion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Not wasting time on empty phrases, we will proceed at once to analyze all objections made against these societies.</p>
   <p>As to the first objection, indeed, the military societies cost us a great deal. If we allow seventy-five dollars a year per average member for uniforms, weapons, "wasted time," etc., then the expenditure for four thousand Polish-American "Knights" would amount to about three hundred thousand dollars a year. This is a large sum, which, if wasted fruitlessly, would deplete the budgets of our military societies. But it is not wasted.</p>
   <p>As to the second objection, we will try to prove that the Polish military societies in America are not more useless playthings; that, on the contrary, they have very important, practical, civic, and nationalistic aims. This being the case, we must agree that the money spent by these societies is not wasted. Some people may say that there are other needs, more urgent, such as schools, libraries, welfare, etc., for which this money should be spent immediately. To this we will answer: No one can prescribe a common <span class="page-break">\5</span>standard according to which man and society should satisfy their needs. Bread is essential to life, yet man does not live by bread alone, for he needs religion, education, family life, and political affiliation. He even needs such wholesome recreation as will not endanger his moral development. In other words, the military societies are not merely diversions. Besides the aims which will be discussed in answering the second objection, they also have one great quality, one merit which outweighs all deficiencies. This quality awakens the patriotic spirit in the hearts of our plain people. Polish banners, white eagles, colorful uniforms, rattling sabers, and muskets help awaken a love for the motherland there where it does not exist. Thus the Polish spirit is awakened. Symbols, colors, and ensigns are necessary. If we had no military societies, our Polish Day manifestations, held every year on May 3, would not be so grand; their echoes would not reverberate throughout America; they would not proclaim so loudly our national aspirations. Consequently, the expenditure for the upkeep of military societies, which is borne voluntarily by the members themselves, is not squandered money spent unproductively. This money is donated to an <span class="page-break">\6</span>orphaned nation for her national cause, and for the donors' own benefit.</p>
   <p>The objection that military societies are useless is erroneous. Other national groups in the United States have societies which have their aims. Why should only our societies be without aims? If the Germans, the Irish, the Italians, the Scotchmen, the Danes, etc., have such societies, why shouldn't we Poles have them too? They are not better than we. Besides, the aims of all military societies, with the exception of special nationalistic aims, are clear and definite. The art of using weapons is of great value to a person everywhere, especially in America, where there is no great army, where civilians may be called upon to furnish their own protection. Furthermore, military drills are healthful, for they furnish gymnastic exercises which develop strength and are beneficial to the body. Finally, it is our civic duty toward our adopted country to be soldiers. It is not improbable that the United States may also be endangered by either an internal or an external enemy. We still remember the war alarms between <span class="page-break">\7</span>Chile and Italy. This may occur again, and in such case it would be the sacred duty of the American Poles and other naturalized citizens to defend their adopted country. And who can defend it better than those who have been militarily trained?</p>
   <p>Likewise, our military societies could render a great service to Poland by contributing toward her reconstruction. Only we should not demand too much of them or indulge in fantastic dreams. The pessimistic accusation that our Polish-American warriors have no desire to fight for Poland is groundless. On the other hand, it would be madness to suppose that every person wearing a Polish uniform would be in a position to sacrifice himself to the Polish cause. The truth lies between the two extremes. We are certain that if it will be necessary, at any time, to shed blood for our motherland, many volunteers will be found. Means for their transportation will also be found. Some would serve Poland in the battlefield; others by giving her part of their fortunes. This explains why we are making a collection for the Polish National Fund. Our volunteers cannot be considered professional soldiers, but they have enough spirit to <span class="page-break">\8</span>offset this deficiency. Whether Poland needs us now or at some future time is a question which we will not discuss; however, we are certain that American Poles will give their share whenever it will be necessary.</p>
   <p>Perhaps these considerations seem too fantastic, yet they are practical enough for us to admit that Polish military societies in America are purposeful.</p>
   <p>As to the third and last objection, that the members of military societies have no American patriotism because they are organized for the purpose of helping Poland, we wish to reply that it will not stand criticism. Now we will ask a question: Can anyone living in a country other than his own be charged with lack of patriotism just because he sympathizes with an oppressed nation and is willing to fight for its freedom? Were Lafeyette, Kosciusko, Pulaski, and Niemcewicz bad Polish patriots because they fought for the freedom of this country? Of course, not. Here, too, in view of <span class="page-break">\9</span>the freedom that is the basis upon which this country was founded, it is not a crime for an American citizen of Polish extraction to have the desire to fight for his native country. The United States Government has a special system. Its representatives belong to many nationalities which are united by one common ideology--the welfare of the country. This does not mean that they have no right to have their special sympathies. We do not believe that the United States would oppose its own policies, that it would support Russia in its oppression of a conquered nation. We also know that in case of need, not only the members of military societies, but also other individuals would participate in the fight, and they have a right to do so. In a word, even if such demand was made from our military societies, it would not be unpatriotic in the eyes of the American people.</p>
   <p>We think that we have proved our contention that military societies may exist here and benefit us as Poles and as citizens of this country.</p>
   <p>Whether or not these societies are in a position to fulfill their purpose is another question which will be discussed in another article.</p>
