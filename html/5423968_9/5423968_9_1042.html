   <p>The Polish community in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish is fully prepared for the Columbus Day festivities. Noble Street has been decorated with wreaths, ribbons, and banners. The home of Walter Smulski, editor of Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette), is among the best adorned, and so are the homes of Bieszki, Schultz, and Kortasa, and the offices of the Polish National Alliance and W. Dyniewicz.</p>
