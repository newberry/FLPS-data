   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, December 3, patriotic exercises were held under the auspices of the Holy Trinity Literary Circle at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall, honoring [Henryk] Sienkiewicz and observing the eighty-sixth anniversary of the November Insurrection [1830]. The galleries, as well as the main floor of the hall, were filled to capacity. The program consisted of thirteen numbers, all of which were successful.</p>
   <p>After the introductory music conducted by Edward Nowakowski, the exercises were opened by Stanislaus Uchacz. As the first number on the program, school boys from the seventh and eighth grades sang "Badly Wounded," in three voices, under the direction of Vincent Baluta. In truth, such beautiful singing by boys had not been heard for a long time. The entire audience was enthralled not only with the beautiful melody of the piece, but with the artistry with which it was rendered. The next number was a recitation--"Return of the Soldier", by Miss Angeline Nowakowski who, as usual, gave a masterful performance. S. Sobczak (of the Illinois Musical College), played a violin solo--"Der Sohn der Haide". There is promise of a great future in music for this young virtuoso. He deserves recognition.</p>
   <p>An address by the Reverend Gruza, C. S. C., followed. The speaker's subject was the November Insurrection. Although the insurrection failed, we can at least draw this lesson from it: that the virtue with which the youth of Wilno University distinguished themselves upholds the national spirit and leads the nation toward freedom. And although superior force can paralyze that spirit for a given time, sooner or later, the spirit will triumph.</p>
   <p>A vocal duet by Misses Valerie and Aldona Kempski followed the address. So enchanting was their rendition of "Starry Sky," that the audience applauded until they returned for an encore. J. Lukawski recited Julius Slowacki's "Agamemnon's Grave". His skillful interpretation of the great poet, both in word and spirit, is deserving of high praise. Following this number, Miss Valerie Krenz [Translator's note: Mrs. Krenz-Glowacki since her marriage] played Chopin's "Polonaise Militaire" on the piano. Miss Valerie, with her natural talent for music, may one day be a top-ranking artist.</p>
   
   <p>The speaker, Joseph Mallek, attracted special attention. He chose "Education" as his subject. His address was terse and practical, urging our youth to learning and to self-education. He said, "Our nation will rise in direct proportion to the spread of enlightenment among us." The audience showered applause upon him for his splendid address.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was a two-act play, entitled "For Faith and Freedom," in which all the players performed very well. Deserving special mention were S. Stelnicki (leader of the insurrectionists), Andrew Bialon (Russian Colonel), Miss H. Proch (Cesia), F. Kruwalski (the sergeant), Miss Sophie Nowakowski (the "vision of Poland"), and Adam Racinowski (the old man). The play was ably directed by Francis Pyszka, well-known local lawyer.</p>
   <p>The exercises were closed with a general singing of "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland]. A collection for the Sienkiewicz Fund netted $26.50.</p>
