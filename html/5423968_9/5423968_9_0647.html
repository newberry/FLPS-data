   <p>On Friday, May 29, the committee in charge of arranging the festival to raise funds for the Kosciusko monument held a meeting at the Bradley Street Hall.</p>
   <p>The following societies, whose letters were read at the meeting, have promised to take an active part in the festival on July Fourth: Dramatic Circle, Group 277 of the Polish National Alliance; Solidarity Club; Society of Young Merchants, Group 412 of the Polish National Alliance; and The Polish Falcons.</p>
   <p>After considering an offer concerning the music the committee decided the price asked was exorbitant and selected a subcommittee to get it at a reasonable price.</p>
   <p>The main committee announced that it had hired thirty-two young Poles as bartenders.</p>

   <p>The restaurant at the grove will not be operated by its owner, but by the committee itself. The committee, therefore, asks all persons interested to submit an offer for this restaurant concession to the secretary of the committee, Mr. I. Pulkowski, 817 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>At this meeting another subcommittee was chosen to prepare plans for the parade. Another committee was named to call on all Polish pastors in South Chicago with a request that they give this Kosciusko festival their support.</p>
   <p>The following persons declared they would make donations: P. Meczarski, 200 cigars; Walter Nowak, 200 cigars; and Mr. Sowka, 200 cigars.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of this committee will be held next Friday at Pulaski Hall. All committee members from all parts of the city are invited to attend.</p>
