   <p>During the Christmas holidays all National churches in Chicago were almost besieged by crowds of Poles.</p>
   <p>In the parish of Jesus Christ only one third of the crowd could be accommodated within the church. The remaining two-thirds swarmed the streets adjoining the church.</p>
   <p>Similar conditions prevailed in the All Saints and other parishes.</p>
   <p>All that proves that God sends light from above, and under the influence of that light the Poles draw near the National Church.</p>
   <p>As we see, despite the hindrances of our foes, the National Church is breaking all the prejudices on its way to victory.</p>
   <p>All because God desires it.</p>
