   <p>We promised our readers that we would acquaint them with the attitude taken by the American press on the Kosciusko manifestation.</p>
   <p>We wish to announce that the opinions expressed in those papers were exceptionally friendly toward us. All local papers commented on our Kosciusko manifestation of May 3, 1894. We are quoting some of these remarks.</p>
   <p>The largest and best article on the Kosciusko manifestation appeared in the Inter Ocean. The title of this two-column article was: "Fought for Freedom; A Celebration in Honor of Kosciusko; Orators Glorify Him." The article describes the manifestation in detail; it gives a summary of the speeches and the protest made against the partition of Poland. Besides, the Inter Ocean inserted a picture of Kosciusko.</p>

   <p>The Daily News published an article entitled: "Poles Have a Holiday." That paper inserted woodcuts representing Polish hussars.</p>
   <p>Friday's Record printed a long article entitled: "How Kosciusko Fell. The History of a Great Man Related at Battery D Hall. Poles March Through Chicago Streets with Banners, Accompanied by Playing Bands. Throngs at the Large Hall." The article was illustrated by two woodcuts, one of them representing Andrew Schultz, commander of Polish Cavalry, and the other showing several Polish knights of different orders.</p>
   <p>The Tribune published an extensive article about the manifestation under the following title: "Patriot Is Honored--Centennial Anniversary of Kosciusko Insurrection. "The article began as follows: "The former glory of Poland was revived during yesterday's Polish demonstration." The Tribune praised the manifestation and called it magnificent.</p>
   <p>The Times devoted a whole column to the manifestation under the title: "Patriot <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is Honored." The article then went on to say: "Chicago resounded with the glory of a foreign hero yesterday. Thirty thousand citizens of our city praised with pride the name of Thaddeus Kosciusko", etc. In addition to giving a complete description of the parade and the manifestation, the paper commented favorably on them.</p>
   <p>The Herald devoted two columns to the manifestation entitled: "Great Polish Hero." The paper also printed a picture of the parade. The article itself is very friendly. About the parade it said: "When the Poles of Chicago put on a parade they really make a splendid showing. Their parade was magnificent both as to the size and quality."</p>
   <p>Thursday's Mail headed its article: "Honoring of Kosciusko." The Dispatch wrote: "Poles Have a Holiday." Both articles were very complimentary.</p>
   <p>The German paper, Staats-Zeitung, published two articles about our manifestation, one on Thursday and the other on Friday. Friday's article described the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>manifestation in very friendly terms. Thursday's Staats-Zeitung printed an article entitled: "Kosciusko--A Hero of Two Worlds." The paper gave a biographical sketch of Kosciusko's life, comparing him with Lafayette, etc.</p>
   <p>This concludes our review of the comments of the American press on our Kosciusko manifestation which, indeed, could not have been fairer to us.</p>
