   <p>There was a storm, with snow knee-high, but nevertheless, the Bradley Street Hall was packed. All the seats were occupied, people stood all around the hall, and even the gallery was filled. More than five thousand persons gathered for the celebration, arranged by the St. Casimir The Prince Society, to honor Thaddeus Kosciusko and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
   <p>The Society did not spare expenses; it spent about one hundred dollars for decorating the hall and for other necessary items.</p>
   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated, and on the stage, between the Polish and American flags, surrounded by wonderful plants, was an enormous bust of Kosciusko decorated with a wreath of laurel leaves.</p>
   <p>At eight o'clock in the evening, after the grand entrance of the Polish Cavalry <span class="page-break">\2</span>with their flags--the entrance was applauded vigorously--Reverend Simon Kobrzynski opened the celebration in the traditional Polish manner, with a prayer, while the audience stood.</p>
   <p>The brave members of the St. Casimir Society did everything possible to honor the memory of our beloved "leader in the peasant's dress".</p>
   <p>The program consisted of twenty-two numbers, every one of which is worth mentioning.</p>
   <p>The speakers were: Mr. John Nering (president of the St. Casimir The Prince Society), Mr. Peter Kiolbasa, Mr. Walter S. Bogle, Mr. H. Nagiel, Senator Edward T. Noonan, Mr. John F. Smulski, and Reverend John Kruszynski.</p>
   <p>All the speakers performed their tasks excellently, and the enthusiastic audience rewarded all with thunderous applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We do not publish the text of their speeches here, because we will publish them in full, or at length, in future issues of the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>However, we wish to mention, that Senator Noonan was so imbued with love for the hero of two hemispheres that he learned a few words of his native tongue, and during his speech cried out "When Kosciusko fell, freedom shed tears," and concluded with the words "Poland Is Not Yet Lost!"</p>
   <p>Recitations were given by A. Klafta. Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch (in English), Vincent J. Jozwiakowski (now Jozwin), Mrs. Rose Gorzynski (in Polish), and Mr. W. Tomaszewski. The themes were well chosen and were rendered in a manner that left nothing to be desired.</p>
   <p>The singing by the Young Ladies' St. Cecelia Choir and by one hundred little girls, all dressed very prettily, with scarves of the national colors and flags in their hands, was impressive enough to bring tears to the eyes. All the <span class="page-break">\4</span>choir numbers were excellent.</p>
   <p>The solos by Misses Krolik, Frydrychowicz, and Kaczmarek, pleased everybody. In the "Song Of Hope, " which the St. Cecelia Women's Choir sang without a flaw, the singing of solos by the following was especially beautiful: Rose Kwasigroch, Anna Jozwiakowski, Rose Koppa, and Sophia Mroczkowski.</p>
   <p>In the "Kosciusko Medley, "by the mixed choir, the soloists, John Kondziorski and Mr. Ladislaus Barwig, surpassed all previous efforts, while Mrs. Jozwiakowski sang, as usual, like a nightingale.</p>
   <p>It was evident that all felt that they were singing to honor the memory of our leader and hero, and that is why everything went off so beautifully. The director of these, the best Polish choirs ever heard in America, Mr. Andrew J. Kwasigroch, in the uniform of a cavalry officer and with his baton in hand, <span class="page-break">\5</span>standing on a podium, looked like a general. He led the choirs, and yesterday's appearances proved that he is a most capable director of singers.</p>
   <p>The Nowicki Brothers' orchestra also deserves recognition for playing five numbers very nicely, including the "Awakening Of The Lion," by A. Kontski. In addition they played a march by F. Nowicki, to commemorate the one-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Kosciusko, "Polish Medley," by W. Troschl, and "America," by A. Cotlin.</p>
   <p>All the numbers blended into a beautiful and harmonious program.</p>
   <p>It is evident, that when the young men of the St. Casimir Society arrange anything, one can be sure that the affair will be well taken care of. All hail to them! We haven't heard a program like theirs in a long time. The collection for the Kosciusko monument brought seventy-three dollars. An itemized account will be published tomorrow.</p>

   <p>The contributions were collected in the ball by Mr. Arkuszewski and Mr. Paszkiewicz (Senior), also by Mrs. Kiolbasa, Mrs. Jedrzejek, Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, Mrs. Josephine Kwasigroch, Mrs. Anna Klarkowski, and others.</p>
   <p>Reverend John Kruszynski's speech concluded the celebration. His sincere words appealed to everyone present. He spoke of true patriotism and urged all Poles to work for their country. After this fine speech, five thousand voices joined in singing "God Save Poland".</p>
