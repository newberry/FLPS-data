   <p>Last Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday a forty-hour devotion was celebrated in St. Fidelis's parish. For three days the parishioners had an opportunity to attend the confessional and to reconcile themselves with God. In the course of the three days the church was never empty. From early morning to late at night mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters came to offer prayer. Thus there was an uninterrupted stream of prayers before the Almighty.</p>
   <p>The altars were richly decorated by the St. Joseph sisters. Songs by the church choir, under the able direction of Florian Czonski, added beauty and charm to the holiday.</p>
   <p>The services were opened by the pastor, the Reverend John Zelezinski. A procession, in which the church societies participated, marked the opening and the close of the three-day services. Many visiting priests aided in the ceremonies.</p>
