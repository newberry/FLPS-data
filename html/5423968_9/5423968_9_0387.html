   <p>January 26, 1919, there will be held in Poland an election of delegates to assemble in Warsaw and frame a government for the new nation.</p>
   <p>This is a day of mighty import not only to Poland but to the world. For a century and a quarter the Polish people have been the victims of military force, imposed from without. During all these years she has been what Belgium has been during the great war. The partition of Poland was the greatest crime of the eighteenth century. A proud people, with a noble history, have waited all this time to come again into its own. Many thousands of her children have found refuge in America and among the foremost to spring to arms in defense of civilization when our country recently called, were Americans of Polish birth or Polish descent. We, therefore, have a sentimental interest in the fate of Poland. But more important than all else, Poland's geographical situation makes her future of interest to all the world. From one side she is threatened by the wave of anarchy rolling in Russia and from the other the German Empire. A free, strong, independent Poland would mean much for the future peace of the world.</p>

   <p>Therefore, from self-interest, too, we are concerned about what Poland shall do. It would hearten and strengthen the people, if the great democracy of the New World were to send to Poland words of encouragement and hope.</p>
   <p>I hope, therefore, that my people may regard Sunday, January 26, as Polish Day, and thru public meetings and in other ways show their earnest wish that Poland may become a free and independent and law-abiding state, modeled not upon the Bolshevism she sees to the East nor upon the military despotism which has held her in the grip for more than a hundred years, but rather upon the American Republic, which has furnished shelter to so many of her children during the century and a quarter of tragedy thru which she has lived.</p>
