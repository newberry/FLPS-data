   <p>"To The Polish Societies</p>
   <p>"Thus far the Polish organizations have been interested in no other celebrations than those connected with important events in the history of Poland. This year, however, will mark the anniversary of a very memorable day not only in the history of America, but also in the entire world. It is the anniversary of an event which constitutes an entirely new period in the world. Everyone will understand that we refer here to the quadricentennial of the discovery of America by Columbus.</p>
   <p>"We know that October 12, 1892 is celebrated by all Americans as Columbus Day.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>According to the President's proclamation, Columbus Day is a national holiday. All the national groups in the United States are making preparations for a colorful celebration of this anniversary.</p>
   <p>"Are we Poles of Chicago to remain behind the other nationalities in this respect? We should say not, especially when such men as Kosciusko, Pulaski, Niemcewicz, and others unite us so closely with this adopted motherland of ours. Another reason why our people should lead all other nationalities is that these commemorative exercises will be held in Chicago, where we are represented so numerously.</p>
   <p>"It is to be hoped, therefore, that all Poles will make their appearance at this occasion as Poles, regardless of their imaginary or real differences, irrespective of whether some are referred to contemptuously as ecclesiastics and others as nationalists.</p>
   <p>"Having no assurance, however, that such solidarity will come about, the <span class="page-break">3</span>undersigned are calling a meeting of delegates of all societies that have conducted similar programs during the past years. We have designated August 14, 1892 as the date for consultation, so that all societies can make some decision and give their delegates some information relative to this matter.</p>
   <p>"The meeting will be held at 7 P.M. at Mr. Anthony Groenwald's hall, Holt Avenue near Blackhawk Street. The central administration of the Polish National Alliance will gladly come to our assistance, in so far as it will be in its power to do so, to make the program successful.</p>
   <p>"Hoping that the other Polish societies which thus far have not worked hand in hand with us, as well as all other associations throughout Chicago and vicinity, will agree to send their representatives to the above-mentioned meeting, we remain,</p>
   <p>"Yours truly,</p>
   <p>"Adam Majewski, President</p>
   <p>"Victor Karlowski, Delegational Secretary"</p>
