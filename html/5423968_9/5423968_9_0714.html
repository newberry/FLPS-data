   <p>A grand celebration commemorating the January Insurrection was held last night in the St. Hedwig Parish hall.</p>
   <p>The hall was overcrowded and everyone wore a happy smile when the pastor, Reverend John Piechowski, opened the meeting. Mr. Michael Fijalkowski was chosen to be the chairman and Mr. John Konczykowski, secretary.</p>
   <p>The schoolchildren's chorus opened the program by singing "Na Wschod Patrzac" (Looking Toward The East). Some of the children were dressed in Polish peasant costumes, and their singing and graceful actions created genuine enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>There followed the beautiful, long and fervent speech of Reverend Biel. Several portions of his speech will be published separately. Here we wish to mention that he was continuously applauded.</p>
   
   <p>The solo by Mrs. Lipecka, "Czarna Sukienka" (The Black Dress), and the recitation by Mrs. Clara Detlaf were also applauded.</p>
   <p>Next came the beautiful singing by the Fredro Chorus and accompaniment by the orchestra. After the singing of "Na Polach Slawy" (On The Field Of Honor) by the St. Hedwig Choir, Mrs. Meisner spoke bravely and beautifully, demonstrating her own ardent patriotism. She emphasized the necessity of properly educating our children so that they grow up to be good Poles and Catholics.</p>
   <p>After the singing by the St. Hedwig Choir and the recitation by Mr. John Sobieszczyk, Miss Martha Pacholska and Miss Mary Kaminska sang a duet which pleased everyone.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael Osuch, past president of the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance, then spoke at length with sincerity and ardor. He urged everyone to improve himself, to unite, to live in peace, to raise high the beloved flag of our nation, to preserve our faith and our nationality. Tremendous applause rewarded the speaker.</p>
   <p>The recitation by Miss Frances Ziemba and the children's singing of "Na Krakowskiem Bloniu" (On The Cracow Meadows), during which a young lad, Naskrent, provoked gales of laughter by his wonderful singing and dancing, preceded the speech by Mr. Sobieszczyk. He spoke briefly and simply, but sincerely and to the point. "With the Crucifix, with Faith For Country!" was his often repeated motto.</p>
   <p>One song by the Fredro Chorus and a solo by Miss M. Lorenz and the celebration was almost over.</p>
   <p>The curtain rose and we saw a beautiful picture--Poland in chains; Poland on the Cross; Poland the martyr with a crown of thorns. The grouping and artistic effect of the picture was wonderful. This concluded the celebration.</p>
   <p>But there was still one more interesting spectacle. On the miniature stage, a group of amateurs from the Parish Dramatic Circle, directed by Mr. Boleslaus Klarkowski, gave a short peasant sketch (with songs) written by Mr. H. Nagiel and entitled "Krol Sobek--Swatem" (King Sobek--The Matchmaker).</p>
   <p>The audience applauded the wonderful acting.</p>
   <p>The entire celebration was a grand success due to the efforts of the pastor, the Sisters, members of the Choir and Dramatic Circle, the local parish orchestra, and of course, all the parishioners. The audience left the ball happy, enlightened, and entertained.</p>
