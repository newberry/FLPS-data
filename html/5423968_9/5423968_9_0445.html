   <p>Today is Flag Day in the United States. The holiday was proclaimed by President Wilson, the governor of Illinois, and the mayor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>All over America great demonstrations will be held in honor of the Star-Spangled Banner of the United States, which is the highest symbol of liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>Several such celebrations will take place in Chicago today, at one of which Mayor Thompson will speak, in Grant Park. In Lincoln Park, celebrations will be held during which the United States Army Band will play. Celebrations are scheduled also for other parks and the public schools.</p>
   <p>The day is one of great significance. If we have always honored the American flag, if we have always honored the American flag, if we have always carried it high, we ought do it more so today, at a time when that flag is being carried on the field of battle "for the freedom <span class="page-break">2</span>and rights of the smaller nations" in order that it may stand among the flags of the great democracies of the world.</p>
   <p>We Poles, in particular, ought to honor that flag, for under its leadership and through its intervention, we will regain that which our forefathers and we ourselves have longed for--the freedom and independence of our homeland.</p>
   <p>All hail the American flag!</p>
