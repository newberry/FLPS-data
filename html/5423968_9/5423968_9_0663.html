   <p>A very grand celebration commemorating the 105th anniversary of the [Polish] Constitution of the Third of May was held Sunday in South Chicago. All local church and national societies took part.</p>
   <p>The celebration was held in Liberty Hall, on Commercial Avenue.</p>
   <p>The societies marched to the hall through Warsaw [a small Polish community in South Chicago] and through the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish. There were quite a number riding on horses; the music blared out loud marches, and the drums completed a wonderful picture.</p>
   <p>The hall was completely packed. About 1,000 people participated in the celebration.</p>
   <p>The marshal, Mr. Watkowski, opened the celebration and called on Reverend <span class="page-break">2</span>Frances Wojtalewicz to act as chairman. The latter spoke in Polish and English.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph E. Dudek was secretary.</p>
   <p>The main speakers at the celebration were the two South Chicago pastors and Attorney Donahue.</p>
   <p>Reverend Nowicki, speaking in Polish, explained at length the meaning of the Constitution of the Third of May and urged everybody to patriotic work and to preserve our Polish tongue. Reverend Wojtalewicz, speaking in English, insisted that we can be truly proud of our Polish birth.</p>
   <p>Mr. Donahue's speech was beautiful and thrilling.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. Komorowski and Mr. Ignacy Machnikowski also spoke.</p>

   <p>Miss Wojtalewicz sang so beautifully that she was forced to sing two encores and then was given a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Mallek, who directed the Chopin Choir, also received a bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>Miss Mikitynska played the piano excellently.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pacholski's orchestra and the Choir directed by Mr. Emil Wiedemann also took part in the program.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zagorska, president of the Polish Women's Society of South Chicago, dressed in a national costume delivered a wonderful speech, entitled "To Polish Mothers."</p>
   <p>The celebration was truly grand. There was no end to the shouting and the applause!</p>
