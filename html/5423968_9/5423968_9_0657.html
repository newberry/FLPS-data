   <p>Our Poles in Chicago have a new Polish Day to think of--one to which we wish to call the attention of all our people.</p>
   <p>This will be the 4th of July.</p>
   <p>This day, being an American national holiday, has been happily chosen as the date for the great summer festival for the benefit of the Thaddeus Kosciusko monument.</p>
   <p>We repeat, it is a happy thought.</p>
   <p>First of all, we should have done something to bring to conclusion the building of the Kosciusko monument a long time ago. This matter, after the first successful impulse, when about eight thousand dollars were collected, has become mired in the mud.</p>

   <p>We must drag it out of the mud and complete the necessary sum, so as to begin building the monument as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>This goal can no doubt be reached with the help of this July festival.</p>
   <p>This picnic on a national holiday should attract the entire Polish population of our city and bring in a profit of a few thousand dollars. A couple of thousands are needed to start building the monument.</p>
   <p>Secondly, a properly conducted Polish manifestation, with proper regard to American traditions on the day set aside for commemorating the Independence of this country, may and should create a favorable impression on all Americans.</p>
   <p>And finally, it will give us a chance to appear as a united front and prove our national solidarity.</p>
   <p>This last is very important.</p>

   <p>Of the Polish Day in 1893 and the great Kosciusko celebration, the events that brought the Poles closer together in Chicago, we have somehow lost step. Since then different roads have appeared to separate us and leading in all directions....</p>
   <p>Could we not utilize this beautiful occasion to once more come closer in spirit?</p>
   <p>Would it not be proper to designate the 4th of July also a Polish Day?</p>
   <p>The answer to the above depends on ourselves.</p>
   <p>Let us get to work energetically. Don't be ashamed to stand shoulder to shoulder. We will then show that we are again united and will be helpful in the cause to build the Kosciusko monument here, among strangers, in the very heart of America.</p>
