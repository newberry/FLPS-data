   <p>Yesterday the St. Casimir's Youth Society celebrated the day of its patron saint very solemnly. At the early hour of 5 A.M., the members of the Society, dressed in full regalia, gathered at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church to hear Holy Mass and receive the Holy Communion. The Mass was said by Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, spiritual adviser of the Society, who also delivered a beautiful sermon, in which he spoke of Saint Casimir as an example of virtue for the Polish youth, whom he urged to love God and the Motherland, telling them that man may earn eternal happiness by leading a virtuous life.</p>
