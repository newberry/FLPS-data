   <p>The early history of this parish starts about 1881. Frankly speaking, the Society of St. Vincent a Paulo started this parish and should get the credit for it. There were about seven Polish families then in So. Chicago and Stanislaus Gymatyma was the leader. They came to South Chicago about 1873. The number grew rapidly and, at the time of organizing of the Society, there were about thirty-five families. There are no written records prior to 1881. The reliable and historical records start with the organization of the parish.</p>
   <p>It was in the fall of 1881 a committee was formed and an agreement was made with the Irish, St.Patrick parish to hold Polish church services there. The first Polish mass was celebrated on St. Stephen's day in St.Patrick's church. Father J. Radziejewski, organizer of the parish celebrated the mass. This continued for some time. The young parish held church services in an Irish church, but soon they wanted to have their own church, so they rented an empty store at 92 St. and Brandon Ave. The empty store was changed into a church. For almost two years the church services were held there, and then fire destroyed the building. The Poles decided to have their own church. They bought five lots but as their location was too near railroad tracks, they changed their mind, and bought eight lots at the present location. Here they <span class="page-break">2</span>started to build a church which they finished first. As the Polish church was not finished the Poles held their church services in the German church every second Sunday.</p>
   <p>Bad Luck.</p>
   <p>When the Polish church was almost completed a hurricane pulled it down on Palm Sunday, 1882. The Poles were obliged to continue their church services in the German church. They then started to rebuild their almost finished but ruined church. First they finished the basement, and used it for church services till the remainder was completed.</p>
   <p>The Growth of Parish.</p>
   <p>The new parish grew very rapidly expecting a great future. The parish already owned ten lots at 88 St. and Commercial Ave. At this time, that is 1882, there was some difficulty in adopting a name for the new parish. The Society of St. Vincent a Paulo wanted to have the parish under their Saints name, while one of the church societies insisted on Saint Josephat. The matter was taken up with the Pastor and the name of Immaculate Conception Most Holy Mary Virgin was adopted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Organization of Societies</p>
   <p>The settlement grew in size and strength, and so did the social and patriotic life. In a short time the following societies were formed: Jana III Sobieskiego; Rycerzy Najsw. Marji Panny, Legion Sw. Jozefa; Jana Kilinskiego; Zwiazek Braci Polakow; Sokoli Tow. Spiewu; Osada Federacti Polsko Katolickiej w Ameryce (Polish Roman Catholic Federation) whose aim was to unite all Roman Catholic Poles into one strong organization. This organization did not last very long as the Poles were not ready for such ideal work; neither did the other societies last very long.</p>
   <p>The Choir.</p>
   <p>The church hoir of Saint Cecilia (now Immaculate Conception Choir) progressed very rapidly in size and talent and, as a result it gave a number of concerts. The choir instructors were the organists who devoted themselves to the work.</p>
   <p>Sisters as Teachers.</p>
   <p>During the early days of the school, the organist was also a teacher. As the number of children grew it was necessary to have regular teachers. At that time, there were only a few competent teachers. At last they were fortunate in securing Felician Sisters from Detroit as teachers, and later on Franciscan Sisters, from a <span class="page-break">4</span>German convent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>In 1907, Polish Sisters separated from the German Sisters, and started a Polish convent, at Stevens Point, Wis., where they are today.</p>
   <p>Further Growth of Parish.</p>
   <p>Father John Radziejewski remained as a Pastor till 1884. At that time, the Pastor of St. Adalbert's church in Chicago, died, and Father Radziejewski was appointed as a Pastor of the parish. In his place the Bishop appointed Father C. Pyplatz, who came to the Immaculate Conception parish on July 16, 1884.</p>
   <p>When Father Pyplatz took the parish over it was indebted $22,832., and there were many smaller debts. There was $220. cash in the treasury but Father Pyplatz was not idle. The church was finished and the basement was converted into a school and Sisters quarters, while an adjoining farm house was remodeled as a parish house. Now, there was the church, the school, and the parish house. It was not so easy as the parish was heavily indebted. Father Pyplatz started to pay off the debts, in which he was very successful. In 1885 bells were installed in the small, church tower.</p>
   <p>In 1887 the parish suffered another misfortune, as a storm weakened the church <span class="page-break">5</span>so dangerously that it was necessary to make immediate repairs. Accordingly the church building was strengthened with stone pillars, and iron rods, at a cost of $1,405. And that year they built a belfry at a cost of $465.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1889 they started to build a new parish house at 88 St. and Exchange Ave. It was a two story brick building, 40x50 feet, with a basement. It cost $15,513.91 including furniture.</p>
   <p>Father F.M. Wojtalewicz.</p>
   <p>As the parish grew in members it was necessary to have two priests. Father F.M.Wojtalewicz was appointed as an assistant, but, in a short time, he was transferred to High Ridge and in his place Father Adolf Nowicki was appointed. Father Nowicki stayed only fifteen months and in his place came Father Rajnert who remained as assistant till 1893.</p>
   <p>First Division of Parish. A New Paris is Formed.</p>
   <p>The growth of the parish was so rapid that the church was too small for its large number. A large part of the parish was then made into a separate section and another parish was formed, under the name of Sw. Michala Archaniola (St.Michael's <span class="page-break">6</span>Archangel) and Father Nowicki the assistant, was appointed as Pastor.</p>
   <p>The Misunderstanding.</p>
   <p>As some members were not satisfied with Father Pyplatz, two opposing parties were formed. The result was the removal of Father Pyplatz and, in his place, Father Wiktor Zaleski was appointed. He took charge of the parish on January 13, 1894. Some members not being satisfied with this arrangement the struggle continued.</p>
   <p>The Fire - - Building of a New Church.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, May 6, a fire destroyed the church. Immediately, the parish proceeded to build another, bigger and stronger. The services, and school, were conducted in the basement which was temporarily repaired. At the same time there was more dissatisfaction and Father Zaleski was removed. In his place the Bishop appointed the present Pastor, Rev. F.M. Wojtalewicz who was then a Pastor in Hammond, Ind. Father Zaleski took his place.</p>
   <p>Father Wojtalewicz not only found the parish without a church, but there was serious disagreement among the members. The taking over of the parish by Father <span class="page-break">7</span>Wojtalewicz, in 1895, was the beginning of its real growth and prosperity. He knew his business. There was a debt of $1,500. which he paid in fifteen months. He also succeeded in removing of the misunderstanding that had caused trouble in the parish. In 1898 he had enough money to go on with the building of a new church. The construction progressed so rapidly that it was completed in the same year, and the first mass was celebrated Christmas Day, December 25, 1898.</p>
   <p>The church is 165 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 75 feet high, on the inside. The tower is over 150 feet high. The cost was $73,908.43. The parish debt after building the church was $34,895.12. The church was dedicated April 23, 1889, by Rt.Rev. Archbishop Feehan.</p>
   <p>It was a great celebration in which thirty priests assisted. The participation of the public was great. Almost all Chicago societies as well as from near-by cities took part.</p>
   <p>The following year was devoted to the decorating of the new church. The walls of the church were covered with many beautiful paintings, some of them historical.</p>
   <p>At the end of the year there was held a concert in the newly decorated church.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Building of a New School.</p>
   <p>As the school quarters were too small, Father Wojtalewicz began to build a new school. On May 26, 1901, the cornerstone was laid. There was another great celebration. The ceremony was performed by Rt.Rev. Bishop Muldoon. The school was dedicated by him in the same year. It is a fireproof four story building. It contains twenty class rooms with modern equipment. The building is 1261/2 feet long, and 110 feet wide. It cost $61,616.58.</p>
   <p>After this school was completed, in 1902, the parish debt was $61,392.87. The year of 1904 was a jubilee year of the dogma of Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary. As the church is named after her, the parish held a special celebration at which Archbishop Quigley officiated. There were many clergymen, among them some from foreign lands. As a remembrance, the members made a collection and bought a church vestment for $1,425. In 1904 the parish bought another lot and moved the parish house there, changing it into Sisters quarters.</p>
   <p>In 1905 they built a new parish house. It is a two story brick building 72 feet long, and 54 feet wide. The cost was $23,443.35. The parish debt then was $34,565.64.</p>

   <p>"Father Frank."</p>
   <p>Rev. Frank M.Wojtalewicz, known as "Father Frank", is a very populat priest. He was born in Zalesie, West Prussia (Germany), on December 2, 1869. He came to America in 1869. He received his First Communion, in Chicago, at St.Stanislaus Church. He received his early education, also in Chicago. He received his classical education from St.Francis Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis. He studied theology at St.Meinrad, Ind. In the year of 1889, he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Feehan in Chicago Cathedral. His first appointment was as an assistant at Immaculate Conception Parish; his next as a Chaplain for the German Orphanage, Highridge, Ill. He organized a new parish in Downers Grove, then one in Sobieski, Wis., then in Hammond, Ill, where he stayed three and a half years. On September 20, 1895 he was appointed as Pastor of this parish where he has remained.</p>
   <p>No Polish priest has received greater honor than Father Frank for on March 10, 1912, Pres. Taft visited him and gave a talk to school children.</p>
