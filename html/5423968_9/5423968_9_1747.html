   <p>In accordance with the resolution adopted at the convention of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union at Philadelphia, Pa., efforts have been started by the organization in the matter of nominating new Polish bishops for the United States. Up to the present time the work of the officers of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, who are directing this campaign in the name of the organization, has been summarized in the opening steps leading somehow to a formal action in this matter, depending on the indirect calling of attention to the Pope himself with a plea for Polish bishops, or the immediate explanation of the question direct to the apostolic capital.</p>
   <p>Benefiting from the occasion of the recalling of the erstwhile apostolic delegate to the United States, Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano, who will become a cardinal, the Polish R. C. Union has sent to the returning representative of the Apostolic See, on the steamer "Providence," the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>following telegram in the matter of Polish bishops:</p>
   <p>To His Excellency Giovanni Bonzano</p>
   <p>Apostolic Delegate to the United States</p>
   <p>c/o S. S. Providence</p>
   <p>New York, Port, N. Y.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America, a fraternal organization, numbering 90,000 members, wishes Your Excellency a safe and happy voyage. It begs Your Excellency to present to the Holy Father in Rome the necessity and also our desires for Bishops of Polish descent in dioceses of larger Polish communities in the United States.</p>
   <p>The recent Convention expressed manifestly the wish of the Polish people urging its officers to beg the Holy Father not to delay this matter.</p>
   <p>A. Kazmierczak, President</p>
   <p>S. Godzich, Secretary General</p>
   <p>J. J. Konopa, Treasurer</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America, 984 Milwaukee Ave., Chicago, Ill.</p>

   <p>The last convention of our organization expressed plainly the wishes of the Polish people, entrusting its officers to plead with the Holy Father, so that he would take care of this matter as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The union has already worked out a program of action in this matter, and it will not stop in its work for the good of the Polish people in America, until the wishes of those people have been fulfilled. Calculating on the meaning of this largest and strongest Polish Catholic organization in the world, it is proper to expect that the matter will be promptly cared for in a successful manner.</p>
   <p>We are informed simultaneously that the Polish Womens' Alliance of America, by means of its honorable administration, has sent a similar telegram to Archbishop Bonzano, the apostolic delegate, who is returning to Rome.</p>
