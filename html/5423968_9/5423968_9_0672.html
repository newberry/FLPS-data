   <p>A grand celebration commemorating the anniversary of the Constitution of the Third of May was held yesterday in Kaiser's hall, on Archer Avenue.</p>
   <p>The celebration was preceded by a parade of all of the local societies and Alliance groups from Mr. Czeslawski's hall, corner of Laurel and 32nd Streets, to the hall on Archer Avenue. The parade started at six o'clock in the evening, and over 600 people participated in it.</p>
   <p>The hall could barely hold the tremendous crowd when, a few minutes before seven o'clock, Mr. M. Wleklinski opened the affair by calling on Mr. L. Czejlawski to act as chairman and Mr. Mezydlo as secretary. The president, Mr. Czeslawski, then formally opened the meeting.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Mr. Ignace Machnikowski, who gave a well-prepared speech about the history of the Constitution of the Third of May.</p>
   
   <p>The young "Zorza" Choir then sang, and were applauded very loudly. After the children sang and recited, Mr. M. J. Sadowski spoke about very important and timely matters. He spoke first about the Constitution of the Third of May, then urged the establishment of a reading room and a library in Bridgeport, explaining how necessary it is, and pointing out the tremendous benefits such a reading room would bring. He thanked the Poles in Bridgeport for the motion giving all proceeds from the celebration to the fund for establishing a reading room. In conclusion, he mentioned the matter of protesting against the bills aiming to restrict immigration from Europe, against the scandalous attacks made by some members in Congress on the good name of Poles in America, and appealed to those assembled to act in the matter.</p>
   <p>On the speaker's motion, seconded by all, a committee of five was immediately selected to send out such a protest. The committee members are: Mr. Wleklinski, Mr. Magdziarz, Mr. Poplawski, Mr. Biederman, and the speaker.</p>
   <p>A beautiful live tableu depicting "Kosciusko's Oath in Cracow" concluded the celebration.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this affair, which will amount to about $300, will go toward the proposed reading room, and will at once be of practical use.</p>
