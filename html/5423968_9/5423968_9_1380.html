   <p>The last issue of Narod Polski (Polish People), official organ of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, contains various items about the approaching convention of the parent organization, and among them one about the editor of Gazeta Katolicka, Leon Szopinski, who is among the many delegates to be at the convention. Narod Polski wants to prevent Mr. Szopinski from attending, on the grounds that he works for Mr. J. Smulski, who is a member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>We consider this motion to be unjust and wish to come to Mr. Szopinski's defense.</p>
   <p>As to the weekly that he solely edits and of which he is half owner with Mr. Smulski, it has always been a defender of Catholic principles and Catholic organizations. For his stand against a number of Alliance members, Szopinski has received a medal from his secular friends.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Szopinski is well known by all true Polish Catholics and is considered to be not only an honest man but a true friend as well. He has never been an enemy of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and never will be. That the members of his society are all in his favor is the best evidence that he is a good choice as delegate. His partner has never exerted any influence over the editing of Gazeta Katolicka and he cannot either, since he represents the financial end of the business.</p>
   <p>His elimination as delegate would be an insult not only to him but also to his organization. He may have certain views that may not be shared by some of the representatives of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, but that does not justify his elimination. As an honorable man and a member of the organization, he certainly would not act in such a way as to do harm.</p>
