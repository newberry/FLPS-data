   <p>Last night a patriotic celebration was held in the hall of the Polish Women's Alliance, arranged by the educational committee of the Alliance in honor of two great and famous men, Thaddeus Koszciuszko and Abraham Lincoln. Only a few score people came, and the hall was half empty. Whom to blame for so poor an attendance we do not know.</p>
   <p>The vice-president, Mrs. A. Milasiewicz, opened the meeting and asked Dr. Kaczorowska to preside and Mr. M. Latwis to act as secretary. The program included patriotic speeches and singing by the Polish Women's Alliance chorus under the direction of Anthony Wiedeman and by the Dawn Chorus of children's voices under the direction of S. Sieja. Miss Sophie Mazwrkiewicz entertained the audience with solos, accompanied on the piano by Mr. S. Sieja; a violin solo was played by Miss Irene Wardzinska. The celebration ended at 10 P.M.</p>
