   <p>In spite of the fact that Holy Missions were being held unexpectedly, Pulaski Hall was filled to capacity for the commemorative exercises last evening. Mr. W. Ziarko opened the exercises in the name of the committee on arrangements. Mr. J. Sadowski was called upon to be master of ceremonies and Mr. Osuch to act as secretary. Mr. Sadowski, after inviting the speakers, representatives of organizations, and the veteran Smietanka, to come up on the stage, made a short opening speech emphasizing the importance of the times. The mixed choir, Modjeska, sang "Rota" and "Do Nizeli." Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"We are commemorating the eighty-fourth anniversary of the insurrection and we are observing it at a particularly unusual time, a time when most important events are taking place on Polish soil. We are paying homage to the memory of the heroes who fought for Poland's independence, while over there in the homeland one of the most horrible wars of Slavic history is being fought. The audacious Prussian invader, like a snake nurtured at the breast of the Slavs, has raised his head after the defeats dealt him centuries ago and wants to destroy everything which is not Teutonic."</p>
   <p>The speaker gave a short resume of the history of Poland's battles with the Teutonic invaders---battles full of horror. Then in answer to the question "Which side should we join?" he said: "Should we join Austria, who permitted us to sing "Poland Is Not Lost" but exploited Poland at every opportunity? From the days of Jan Sobieski, to whom the Austrians showed no gratitude, up to the present, Austria has always repaid Poland with evil for good. Austria, whom some consider Poland's friend, plundered Poland as much as possible even after the partitions. It plundered her financial wealth, it plundered her salt and oil, and finally, it bought the consciences of her representatives in the Austrian parliament with orders and titles.</p>
   
   <p>"Should we perhaps side with Russia---this Russia which eagerly drank the blood of our young men---this Russia which sent the country's best sons to Siberia in chains.</p>
   <p>"Should we perhaps side with the detested German, the defamer of Polish women, the brute who tortured innocent children because they said their prayers in Polish?</p>
   <p>"We must not side with any of them, because each one of them is Poland's enemy, because each one of them is a plunderer, because each one of them is an oppressor. We should wait---wait until they use up their strength fighting each other. But refusal to help any of them does not mean that we should do nothing at all.</p>
   <p>"There is much work to be done and no one will do it for us. Our homeland is suffering terrible destitution. The whole world is helping Belgium, which the Prussians destroyed. Poland can expect aid only from us. We should contribute money in order to provide bread for those in the homeland.</p>
   
   <p>The Prussians have destroyed everything. Wherever a Prussian has set foot nothing remains for our people. Therefore let us contribute toward a fund with which to help those brothers and sisters of ours over there who need so much and have so little."</p>
   <p>After Miss Simbor's violin solo, Mr. John Smulski, president of the Polish bank [Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank], delivered an address appropriate to the times and painted a clear picture of the destitution on Polish soil. Miss B. Bura then sang two solos. After Miss Tyrakowski's recitation entitled "The Prussian Tortures Our Brothers" Judge Kavanagh spoke. His speech was followed by two songs by the Chopin Choir No. 1 of the Alliance of Polish Singers in America.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was the one-act Patriots play presented by Mr. Klein and Mr. A. Dobrzanski. Then, the master of ceremonies called upon those present to sing "God Save Poland".</p>
   <p>The collection yielded $35.43.</p>
