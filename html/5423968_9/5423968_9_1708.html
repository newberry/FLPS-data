   <p>In honor of the fifteenth anniversary of his priesthood, the Welfare Society, with the aid of their most energetic members, planned a banquet for Reverend B. J. Kasprzycki, pastor of St. Camillus' church. The affair took place New Year's day at the school hall.</p>
   <p>Because of the severity of the cold weather which has prevailed for the past week, all those who had reserved places did not attend. But despite this, a large number of friends and parishioners turned out to pay their respects to the celebrant. The "old reliable" people of the Polish community gathered into one group and entertained themselves as of old--something which is unusual today.</p>
   <p>The pastor was greeted with a rhythmical march played by a local orchestra. Then the school children of the parish paid their respects to him with a <span class="page-break">2</span>lively song, followed by the personal greetings of the "old timers."</p>
   <p>An interesting dramatical sketch was presented by the children, much to the enjoyment of the entire audience. At the conclusion of their entertainment role, they sang a group of pastorals. The interesting verses, interwoven with pathetic plots, were enjoyed by all. Their able execution of the songs was made possible by the hard work of the Nazareth Sisters. When they made their final bows, the banquet was officially opened.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ann Kurzawska graciously welcomed all the guests at this honorable occasion. After a short introductory speech, she called upon the toast-master for the evening, Reverend Stephen A. Bubacz, pastor of St. Stephen's church and colleague of the celebrant. At the completion of the palatable dinner, a short program followed.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was attorney Joseph A. Lasecki, who congratulated the Welfare Society for the fine work it has rendered throughout the year. He <span class="page-break">3</span>thanked the committee of women for their untiring efforts expended in making this banquet possible. Sylvester C. Bubacz, well-known real estate businessman of the town of Lake, was next to take the rostrum. Mr. Bubacz pointed out the many fine deeds of the Welfare Society. He was followed by Mr. Czurylo.</p>
   <p>Mr. Czurylo supported a movement for the rapid extension of the St. Camillus' school hall in his short talk. He contended as soon as such plans were completed they would aid in the organization of a literary-dramatic club to be organized among the youth of the parish.</p>
   <p>"This club", he said," would arrange the public presentation of dramatic plays, look after our children, and foster the language of our fathers and mothers among them." He was greatly applauded for his suggestions.</p>
   <p>Reverend Kasprzycki brought the speeches to a conclusion by thanking all for their kindness.</p>

   <p>After the tables were cleared, the orchestra began to play popular dance tunes. Many stayed to take part.</p>
