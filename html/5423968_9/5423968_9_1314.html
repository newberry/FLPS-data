   <p>A convention of the Polish Women's Alliance will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Sunday, September 18, 1910. This organization is similar to the Polish National Alliance. The beautiful city of Milwaukee has recently gained preference in being selected for the conventions and meetings of many Polish organizations. The eighteenth convention of the Polish National Alliance was held in that city only a year ago. This was one of the best known in the history of that organization. Two weeks ago we witnessed a splendid convocation of the Second Circuit of the Polish Falcons Alliance whose enactments and resolutions deserve the highest recognition. The convention of the Polish Women's Alliance, therefore, is the third consecutive Polish convention [to be held] in Milwaukee within the space of one year. The Dziennik Zwiazkowy also wishes success to this convention in all its endeavors. No one can be doubtful of the welfare of the convention in the presence of the universally known hospitality of the Milwaukee Poles.</p>

   <p>We mentioned at the very beginning that the Polish Women's Alliance is based upon similar principles to those of the Polish National Alliance. It is a patriotic organization, moderately progressive, accepting all Polish women into its fold, irrespective of their religious, political or social views, working in co-operation with other Polish patriotic organizations. The proof of this was given only recently when the Polish Women's Alliance accepted the fraternal invitation of the Polish National Alliance to participate in the National Congress at Washington. They sent their entire administrative staff to take part in all the councils and to work in all sections. The thing that pleased us most was when the representatives of the Polish Women's Alliance at the last general session of the Congress, during a heated debate on an important political resolution, did not allow themselves to be led in an improper direction, but in a fearless manner and with a knowledge of events, voted on the question of Poland's independence. Today, when this matter is already clarified, when it has been shown that Warsaw still stands in its place as it has stood for a thousand years, that there has been no massacre of Prague, that disappropriation has not as yet begun, and that, in general, the Polish nation <span class="page-break">3</span>has not vanished as a result of the passage of the Washingtonian resolution, today, we repeat, it is easier for all to [view] this question in a sane and natural manner. But in May, at the Raleigh Hotel at Washington, when many prominent people bitterly opposed the resolution, a considerable political orientation was necessary lest one fall victim to the wiles of the opponents. We therefore accord due credit to the behavior of the administrative group of the Polish Women's Alliance at that time, and credit it with great recognition for their commendable work.</p>
   <p>And equally tactful was the behavior of the Polish Women's Alliance representatives during the debates and passage of the resolution on the universality of the Polish National Alliance. While several so-called members of the Alliance were found who spoke in opposition to this resolution, the ladies from the Polish Women's Alliance, and, hence from a different organization, failed in fact to support this resolution and did not vote for its passage. They did, however, refrain from participating in the debates and from voting. It is but natural that, even today, there may be found representatives of other Polish organizations who <span class="page-break">4</span>cannot support a resolution which would maintain that the Polish National Alliance should, in time, group all the immigrant Poles under its banner. But it is equally natural to expect that no Pole, who understands the needs of the immigrants, can openly oppose a tendency so logical and so necessary for the future of the Polish people. Despite the presence of delegates of other organizations at the Congress, thanks to the political awareness and patriotism of the delegates, the resolution on the universality of the Polish National Alliance passed with no opposition, hence, unanimously. In theory it became a directive for all Polish immigrants.</p>
   <p>We understand perfectly well that the goal from theory to practice can be very near at one time, and very distant at another. It depends upon the convictions and general feeling, which are either already prepared to realize a great theoretical truth or remain unprepared for it.</p>
   <p>Consequently, regardless of how the general membership of the Polish Women's Alliance looks upon this question, we acclaim the great relationship of principles, aims and aspirations between the two Alliances. We wish the convention <span class="page-break">5</span>success in its deliberations and an abundance of results for the good of all Polish immigrants, for the welfare of the national cause, and hence, for the good of our dear Motherland.</p>
   <p>We know that there are many ladies in the Polish Women's Alliance who also belong to the Polish National Alliance. These honorable Polish women constitute a link between the two organizations. Where there are so many things in common, there cannot and should not be any misunderstanding or friction. Let this link therefore, increase in number. Let as many members of the smaller Polish Women's Alliance become members of this vast Polish National Alliance as is possible--with time, and through the will of the Polish immigrants, the P. N. A. will become the only Polish political organization. Before this occurs, however, we wish the polish Women's Alliance every possible success and much fruitful work for the good of our Motherland.</p>
