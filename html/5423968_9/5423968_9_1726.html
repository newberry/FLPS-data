   <p>One would think that the Polish National Catholic church does not bring us anything new.</p>
   <p>But the fact remains that Christ, sowing the seeds of his learnings in the human souls, wanted them to ripen continuously and assume new forms. The gist of his learnings was the continuous perfection of man, and this proves that a religion based on Christian foundations must be ever vital and progressive.</p>
   <p>He who does not progress, retreats.</p>
   <p>The ideology of some churches resents vigorously the term "progress."</p>
   <p>The Polish National Catholic Church, in accordance with the Christian spirit, is the promoter of religious progress. This church believes that <span class="page-break">2</span>all forms of religious life should be subjected to the laws of perfection, in order to meet the development of inner faculties of man.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Catholic Church freed itself from the barbarous atmosphere of the Roman-Catholic Church in order to awaken the Polish population from its indifference towards the continuous all-nation march of progress.</p>
