   <p>A regular meeting of the Polish Patriotic Organization was held yesterday, at which a report was made of the income and expenses of the program presented by the Organization on April 9 for the benefit of the parish library, and the Third of May Exercises on May 1. The income from the Exercises was donated to the parish hall, to defray the expenses of cleaning, lighting, etc.</p>
   <p>The income for the library amounted to over a hundred dollars, without deducting rental of the hall. Of course, since both the hall and the library belong to the parish, it is up to the parish committee to decide how this money will be divided.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that at the Organization's next meeting (semi-annual), amendments to the constitution will be proposed.....</p>
