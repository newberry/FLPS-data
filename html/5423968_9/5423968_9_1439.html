   <p>Last Thursday and Friday the first nation-wide convention of Polish-American journalists was held in Buffalo, New York.</p>
   <p>The convention in which Henry Nagiel, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, took an active part, resulted in the establishment of the Polish Journalists' Association of America.</p>
   <p>The aims of the new organization are to protect the interests of the Polish-American journalists and (2) to elevate public opinion among the Poles of America by ennobling and perfecting the Polish press.</p>
   <p>To bring about the latter aim a resolution was adopted which condemns that type of journalism that engages in personal attacks and concocts unfounded stories and slander. The resolution requires that newspapers promise to refrain from such practices in the future under heavy penalty.</p>

   <p>During the course of the convention there were many debates as to the means of attaining these aims. An administrative body was elected and the names of the members who joined the Association were entered in the books. The Association's treasury, too, received a great deal of attention. Despite heated debates, the convention ended peacefully.</p>
   <p>The principal results of the convention will be better understood by our readers if they read the complete report of the proceedings. Beginning today, we will publish the entire report. By reading these proceedings, our readers will get an idea of the purposes of the convention and the effect these purposes will have on the Polish press of America.</p>
   <p>Offhand, we wish to point out that in spite of the many difficulties that had to be overcome the results of the convention were favorable. Harmony prevailed throughout, although the matters discussed were rather delicate. A brighter future for the Polish-American press is expected.</p>
