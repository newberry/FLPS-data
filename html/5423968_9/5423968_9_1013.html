   <p>We are asked to publish the following letter concerning the matter touched upon in yesterday's Dziennik [Chicagoski].</p>
   <p>"The St. Casimir Youth Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church discussed the possibility of national exercises in honor of Copernicus at its yesterday's meeting. It was decided, in the presence of one hundred and ninety members, that this organization give the project its wholehearted support. At the close of the discussion, a motion was brought forward suggesting that on May 24, it being a week-day, only a public gathering be arranged in the evening. At such a gathering we could get our people acquainted with the merits of the immortal Copernicus by means of lectures and speeches dealing with his life and work. This would be appropriate, for many people know of Copernicus in name only. But in order to protest against German pretensions by showing that we honor Copernicus as a Pole, we could arrange for a parade or some other kind of celebration by Polish organizations and societies in Chicago <span class="page-break">2</span>on the following Sunday, that is, May 28.</p>
   <p>"These are only suggestions of ours, the suggestions of one hundred ninety young men. In any case, we will comply with the will of the majority and of those who are better able to work out a project such as this. It is our desire, however, that this celebration glorify the names of Copernicus and Poland to the greatest possible extent. It must be a really serious manifestation on our part--in the face of German pretensions."</p>
