   <p>Mundelein in fear.... How can it be? Yes, indeed! He fears the National Church. For seven years Poles residing in the neighborhood of Nowa Polska had made efforts to establish a Polish parish, but without any success. For seven years the arrogant German had had but one answer: "There will be no more Polish parishes in Chicago."</p>
   <p>All that time the German "prince" ignored numerous petitions to organize Polish parishes in Chicago. But when a real Polish parish was established, where not only sermons but the Holy Mass and other ceremonies were conducted in beautiful Polish, the German suddenly changed his attitude.</p>
   <p>In Dziennik Chicagoski of January 3 we read as follows: "One Polish parish more in Chicago. We will have three more in the near future. This news is very timely and the Polish community will certainly learn about it with great ease -- all the more that some gossips try to spread false information saying that there will not be any more new Polish parishes.</p>

   <p>If Mundelein or someone else in his behalf did not blush when publishing the above news, it may be assumed that something must have gone wrong with his conscience. We advise him to fall down on his knees and implore God for forgiveness.</p>
   <p>We have investigated this matter at the source and are able to present ten witnesses who will testify under oath that whenever efforts had been made to set up a Polish parish they had been answered: "The establishment of new Polish parishes will no longer be permitted in Chicago."</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we are very glad that Mundelein retreated like a coward, but at the same time we grieve at the fact that newspapers published by the clergy use lies to conceal their fear of the National Church in Chicago.</p>
