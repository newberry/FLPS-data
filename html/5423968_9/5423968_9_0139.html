   <p>The committee in charge of the program for the Kosciusko Mass Meeting held its first meeting yesterday. The purpose of this meeting was to prepare the program for the Mass Meeting and to present it to the Preparation Committee for approval.</p>
   <p>Since the date for the Kosciusko Mass Meeting has been set for May 3, 1894, it was decided that a special meeting be held on March 21 at Pulaski hall and that representatives of committees in charge of the Mass Meeting, representatives of Polish organizations, and the Polish clergy be invited to it.</p>
   <p>The place for the Mass Meeting will be chosen at this meeting. It is planned to hire one of the large halls downtown, such as Battery D.</p>
   <p>After settling a few minor questions, the meeting was adjourned. A special Mass Meeting announcement, as well as an appeal, appears in this issue of Dziennik Chicagoski. [Editor's note: The purpose of the Kosciusko Mass Meeting was to discuss plans for establishing a Polish League comprising all Polish organizations in the United States.]</p>
