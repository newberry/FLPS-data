   <p>The special convention of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America will open in a few days in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The convention was called in order to put an end to the troublemaking efforts of certain elements in the Falcon group, and in order to point out to the Poles, who have been confused by all sorts of agitators, especially in the East, the real road leading to the fulfillment of the cherished desires of the Polish people, a road which the majority of the American Poles want to follow.</p>
   <p>As much as we questioned the advisability of calling this special convention at the time when the Falcon board of directors convoked it, so much do we now rejoice in the fact that such a convention will be held in these very critical times, probably the only convenient moment for the Falcons to manifest their feelings and belief not only in our own cause but in the cause of our adopted country and all humanity as well.</p>
   <p>In view of the changed circumstances, the purpose of the convention itself must change, and the decisions and steps taken by the convention must be quite different from those originally planned. Today no one would want to question the stand which the board of directors of the Alliance has taken or, what is worse, would want to foster the bankrupt politics of the K. O. N. (Committee of National Defense).</p>
   <p>The Falcons and all the Poles in America now can see where the leaders of the K. O. N. would have taken us if we had not taken the direction of our affairs out of their hands and if they had continued to foist their extremely foolish orientation, based on hatred of Russia and not on love for Poland, on our immigrants and strongly organized groups. We believe that the Falcons' special convention will pass over this matter to the business of the day and will not even allow it to be brought up, in order to avoid lowering the dignity and seriousness of the convention.</p>
   
   <p>On the other hand, there is another matter that the convention cannot pass over. It is the many-times discussed matter of the Falcons' role in the present war. The convention will take place at a time when the President is standing before Congress to present before the forum of the world grave and final accusations against Germany, at a time when he is asking Congress formally to declare war on Germany.</p>
   <p>The President of the United States is doing this in the name of the nation, which by an overwhelming majority demands war because it can no longer bear to look on while the country's dignity and honor are disregarded by the Teutons, and while its rights and privileges are violated by these sea catchpoles. Inasmuch as we over here form a part of this nation, the highest official of this country will also be representing our will when he asks Congress to declare war.</p>
   <p>With the declaration of war, a call will no doubt be sent out by the nation for volunteers for military service to defend our common rights and property. Everyone must answer this call, because war is something that can not be postponed.</p>
   
   <p>And the Poles should be the first to answer this call, not only to fulfill the duties which they must fulfill as citizens of this country, but to show this country their gratitude for its clear and sympathetic attitude, as expressed by the highest official of this country in the name of the entire nation, an attitude which the President announced to the world in his memorable address of January 22, in which he expressed the viewpoint of the United States on the solution of the Polish question, thus placing our cause among the first and most pressing ones requiring consideration.</p>
   <p>Our Falcons should be the first to answer this call and set a shining example. If there has been turmoil in this organization, if the more zealous youths have been seeking for an outlet for their warlike spirit in all sorts of armies and countries, if the Falcons have been eager to take up armed action, what now could be more appropriate and more appealing to them than to join the star-spangled colors of this great republic and enter the company of our old heroes who also fought for freedom and equality?</p>
   <p>This is a war against our ancient enemy, an enemy who has challenged the entire world and against whom the whole world is now rising.</p>
   <p>The Falcons should give this matter first place in the order of their discussions. That it will meet with the approval of all the members and will be applauded by our entire Polish community does not even need to be argued.</p>
   <p>May great words resound in Pittsburgh and the beginnings of great actions be made! Let the Falcons, as the advance guard of the Polish people, point out the way to others and, in offering their services as a unit to this great republic, let them remember that they are fighting for the fulfillment of those ideals which President Wilson announced long ago, ideals in which freedom and equality for all nations of the world, as well as unity, freedom, and autonomy for Poland, occupy first place.</p>
