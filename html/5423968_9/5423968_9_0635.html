   <p>The Polish youth of St. John Cantius Parish undertook a difficult job last Sunday and made a smashing success of it. After many weeks of hard work and preparation, they staged a patriotic exercise for the parishioners, in commemoration of the thirty-fourth anniversary of the insurrection of 1863 against Russia. Besides the populace of the neighborhood, the St. George Singing Society, the Dramatic Circle, and St. Hedwig Sodality were invited.</p>
   <p>As a token of gratitude for their efforts, the young people were rewarded with a capacity crowd.</p>
   <p>The program was composed of a variety of numbers--twenty in all. Although the program was long there was not one dull moment.</p>

   <p>Before the program was concluded a plea was made to further co-operation, unity, and harmony [among Polish-Americans], for without solidarity they cannot gain the benefits they are entitled to for their labors.</p>
   <p>A great deal of credit should go to the pastor, the Reverend John Kasprzycki, C.R., who has helped to build interest among the Polish youth of the parish.</p>
