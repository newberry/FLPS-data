   <p>Through the endeavors of clubs and societies in the Bridgeport district a glorious third of May celebration was held last Sunday.</p>
   <p>In spite of very disagreeable weather the big hall was packed with the public who listened with commendable attention to the speeches, singing and the declamation of beautiful poetry. The celebration was opened with a long and beautiful oration by Rev. St. Nawrock, who called on Mr. Czeslawski to preside over the meeting. Mr. Ign. Kowalski, editor of Narod Polski delivered the speech for the occasion. Afterwards the dramatic club presented very successfully a comedy entitled "Jaki pan-taki, Kram" ("as the owner, so his store").</p>
   <p>The directors of the choirs, the singers, the school children who sang with such verve and understanding and the children that recited the poetry with feeling, all deserve credit and thanks.</p>
   <p>The first-rate band of Bros. Nowicki added not a little to the beauty of the celebration which was a success in every respect.</p>
