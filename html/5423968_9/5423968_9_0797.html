   <p>Mr. Rudzinski was called from the audience to say a few words. He told the crowd that this was the finest patriotic manifestation ever staged at St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>"I see many good Poles among you, many good Cracovites [type of Polish soldiers] and young but great scythe-men [peasants who fought with Kosciuszko with scythes]," said Mr. Rudzinski. "Wear these uniforms, brandish the sword and scythe, and remember that these served Poland nobly. But it is not enough to wear these uniforms, one must also work for the fatherland. Your sword, my brothers, will not be needed so soon, and perhaps will never be so necessary as the rebuilding of our people in this country, the retention of our national <span class="page-break">\3</span>spirit and harmony, and our work for the Polish cause. This cause should not be supported halfheartedly, but with the entire soul; and only then will Poland arise.....The ashes of your forefathers will rest in peace, and Our Mother [the Holy Virgin], who has performed so many miracles in our country, will effect our resurrection," he concluded.</p>
   <p>As the speaker left the rostrum, he was given a great hand by the audience.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the chairman thanked the audience for its warm support.</p>
