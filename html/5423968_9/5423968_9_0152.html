   <p>In our last article we proved conclusively that the Polish military societies can and ought to exist in America with benefit to us as Poles and as citizens of this country.</p>
   <p>In this article we will consider the questions: Are our military societies equal to the task for which they were founded? Are they fulfilling their purpose? We will answer these questions promptly by saying that it is our frank opinion that the Polish military societies are not yet functioning properly, and for this reason they cannot achieve the desired results.</p>
   <p>It seems that one of the charges that the critics make against our "warriors" deserves some attention. This charge, which is not absolutely justifiable, is to the effect that the members of military societies lack the necessary <span class="page-break">\2</span>military training. This may be true to a certain extent, but it does not apply to some knight societies whose units are drilled as well as regular army soldiers. Let us take for example the Kosciusko's Guard of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which took first place in the ranks of the State's militia in Wisconsin. Other examples are the Free Polish Sharpshooters and the Krakuses (Cracovians), both of New York, whose members are mustered like in a regular army. How about the Polish Lancers of Chicago, and the excellent Cadets and Knights of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish? Also how about our Lancers and Cadets of Buffalo, New York, or the stalwart Knights of Saint Martin and many other societies? They deserve praise and are as good as regular army units. But we have only a small number of such units, approximately twenty five of them. The others are below average. Moreover, there is no co-operation among these groups. Each society constitutes an independent unit. This lack of uniformity leads the prejudiced critics to maintain that our military societies are superfluous. We, however, arrive at a different conclusion. This fact, as it stands, suggests to us that these deficiencies should be remedied, that there ought to be one general <span class="page-break">\3</span>military organization embracing all military societies, and that the standard of military fitness should be raised. In other words, we should raise our knights to the proper level so that they may fulfill their purpose.</p>
   <p>We do not think that this would be so hard to accomplish. We have already sacrificed much and one more effort will surely be possible. This idea has already been discussed by the Polish-American press, and several attempts have been made to carry it through. But this year, Kosciusko's year, when our people are inclined to co-operate, the realization of this idea should come without difficulty.</p>
   <p>What, in reality, are the deficiencies of some of our military societies? Lack of proper military drilling, inability to shoot straight, lack of skill in fencing, and lack of competent instructors.</p>
   <p>All military societies lack competent officers possessing the required practical training in strategy to conduct maneuvers and command large masses <span class="page-break">\4</span>of troops.</p>
   <p>Our knights need, above all, a uniform method of exercises, uniform rules, and one or nearly the same kind of uniform and arms.</p>
   <p>It will not be very hard to overcome these difficulties if we create one general organization or association of Polish military societies for the entire United States. If this is not possible, the organization should be made to cover at least certain sections of the country.</p>
   <p>Such organization would be able, with the co-operation of its leaders, to establish uniform rules, exercises, and drills in all units; in other words, it would become a strong military organization. This organization would equip all its units with the same kind of uniforms and weapons. It would engage paid instructors to teach our soldiers, and, with the co-operation of all our societies, it would establish military schools where competent instructors could teach our knights to fence and shoot. Such military <span class="page-break">\5</span>association, if necessary, can conduct private military courses for its officers, and in case of need it may send them to special American officers' training schools.</p>
   <p>Such would be the sphere of activity of the general Polish Knights Association of America.</p>
   <p>It could work in conjunction with the Polish Falcons Alliance which is being organized now, because the Falcons also have fencing and target practice on their program.</p>
   <p>The Association could also dissuade newly formed societies from wearing fancy uniforms, thereby giving a change to poorer young men to join the ranks of the knights.</p>
   <p>Is the time ripe for the creation of such organization?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Undoubtedly. The Polish military societies in New York City have already such organization and formed the First Division of the Polish Army in America. It is a practical thing, although the title is rather pretentious. A similar organization was also formed in Buffalo, New York, and was named First Regiment of the Polish Army. Is Chicago worse in this respect? Formerly, before the celebration of Polish Day, it was hard to unite our warriors into one rank.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, we still remember, F. Zwierzynski, Z. Schmidt, Przymorski, and a few others, all leaders of Polish military societies, appealed to all Polish military societies in America, urging them to form into a general organization. Only a few societies replied to their appeal, and the matter was dropped.</p>
   <p>Today this matter is again the object of great attention. On Polish Day, Captain Przymorski delivered a speech in which he urged the necessity of <span class="page-break">\7</span>organizing Polish military societies. This speech will undoubtedly bring good results. Captain Przymorski and others may make another attempt, and this time they will have better success.</p>
   <p>There are thirty Polish military societies in Chicago, with approximately five hundred members. Let us form the Second Division of the Polish Army in America or some other organization under a less pretentious name. Such organization would be a step toward the realization of this undertaking in the United States; it would place our knights at their proper level. Thus united, our military societies would cease to be a plaything, as some of the units were, and would become an important and useful institution.</p>
