   <p>The Polish National Congress at Washington, which had been previously scheduled for May 3, has been postponed as a result of unforeseen developments.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the serious threat that war may break out at any moment between the United States and Germany is absorbing so much attention both in the capital and throughout the country that it would be great tactlessness on our part to distract the American people at a time like this for our own national cause.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, to hold the Polish National Congress without a previous understanding with, and without receiving the full approval of, the proper authorities--especially that of President Wilson, who, through his historic address to Congress of January 22, became the greatest and most powerful spokesman for the cause of a united and free Poland--would be an example of even greater tactlessness, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>might weaken the very friendly attitude with which our cause is regarded in these circles.</p>
   <p>Besides, the desire to have as large a representation as possible from all three sections of Poland at the Polish National Congress played an important part in this decision.</p>
   <p>Although several representatives would not mind coming over from the homeland for the third of May, they have wired the Executive Committee to choose a later date, saying that under present conditions it would require a long time to contact all the important people who are willing to come to take part in the Congress, not to mention the problem of making such a long journey safely.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Executive Committee had no choice but to postpone the original date of the Congress. The task of setting another date was left to the National Department's semiannual convention, which will be held in Chicago on April 11.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This postponement, no doubt, will benefit this noble undertaking. There will be more time for the proper preparation of the treatises assigned to the specific sections, of which there are six. The matter of universal representation will also benefit by this, because new groups of the National Department are being organized daily, groups which constitute new ranks of organized Polish-Americans who contribute to the national cause and are therefore entitled to representation in national questions.</p>
   <p>In the last few days, for instance, a group of Philadelphia Poles, affiliated to the so-called Central Philadelphia Polish Relief Committee, joined the National Department of the Central Polish Relief Committee in order to work for a united and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>Within the next few days the Executive Committee of the National Department will send letters to the most prominent statesmen, diplomats, sociologists, and educated people in general, asking them kindly to answer the following <span class="page-break">\4</span>questions:</p>
   <p>1. Do you believe that the restoration of an independent Polish state within the boundaries occupied by Poland before the partitions is necessary for political as well as moral and humanitarian reasons?</p>
   <p>2. In your opinion, what benefits, if any, would humanity in general and European peace in particular derive from the restoration of an independent Poland?</p>
   <p>In order to give those who are less familiar with the Polish problem an opportunity to become better acquainted with it, each letter will include a copy of Antonio Russo's Necessity of Poland's Independence, an unusually accurate pamphlet written during the present war by one of the most prominent Italian publicists.</p>
   <p>The replies gathered in this manner, after being listed and supplied with <span class="page-break">\5</span>appropriate comments, will represent the only referendum of the American people on the Polish question, and as such the document will be a very valuable one and a source of support for the spokesmen for the Polish cause at the future peace conference.</p>
   <p>This is only one of the many tasks the National Department has undertaken and executed quietly, systematically, and with full consciousness and feeling for the sacredness of its aim.</p>
   <p>Henry Setmajer,</p>
   <p>Secretary of the National</p>
   <p>Department</p>
