   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish held a special meeting yesterday.</p>
   <p>As the president of the society was absent, Jacob Mucha was made chairman of the meeting, and Thomas Krolik acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>On a motion made by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, supported by [?] Ogorek, the members decided to dissolve their society and join the Polish League as the "First Agency of the Polish League", under the patronage of the Queen of the Polish Crown.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, a committee was chosen to prepare a constitution for the new society. The following were appointed in the committee: Reverend V. Barzynski, the pastor, B. Clarkowski and Thomas Krolik.</p>

   <p>Jacob Mucha, president; B. Klarkowski, secretary; Theodore Ostrowski, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Thus, the League has gained already one agency with almost three hundred members.</p>
   <p>Bravo!</p>
