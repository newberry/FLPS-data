   <p>In order to turn public attention away from the unpleasantness of the long-drawn-out court procedure involving the members of the[Polish National]Alliance, who cannot come to any agreement among themselves, certain ingenious persons are making the most out of certain unpleasant misunderstandings in connection with the proposed new parish at the so-called "New Poland," a district in the neighborhood of the parishes of the Five Holy Martyrs, Saint Pancratius and Saint Bruno. These persons are spreading rumors to the effect that the chancery of the Chicago Archdiocese has announced that new Polish parishes will no longer be organized in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We feel it necessary not only to correct these rumors but also to brand as dishonest those who have said that the parish in "New Poland" was to be exclusively Polish. That this statement is false can be seen by the fact that an exclusive Polish parish is now being planned by the Franciscan Order, in the vicinity of the parish of Fathers Wojtalewicz and Kowalewski. This, <span class="page-break">\2</span>perhaps, is the best denial to the alleged rumor that Polish parishes are no longer to be organized in Chicago.</p>
   <p>But these shameless agitators are keeping this a secret, and continue stubbornly to gossip against the project. They gather material among themselves, and at times even get information from innocent children in order to attain their ends. This unscrupulous attitude toward sources of information is one of the worst characteristics of these gossipers.</p>
   <p>In order to get at the truth of the entire matter, we consulted two members--neither of them Polish--of the committee that tried to establish a parish in "New Poland". We did so because the two persons in question are not involved in our national ambitions, and therefore are able to give an unbiased picture of the entire situation. We have received a statement relative to this matter from these two persons--J. Weidenbach and Charles Thowbridge. In this statement, which is given below, it is pointed out that these two persons had jointly confirmed the fact that the parish in "New Poland" was not intended to be exclusively Polish, and that the Poles on the committee <span class="page-break">\3</span>had agreed to this. Their letter follows:</p>
   <p>"On or about September 15, 1927, Messrs. Rokosz, Machnicki, and the undersigned had an audience with Reverend Thomas P. Bona in connection with the removal of Reverend Thomas Smyk as pastor of St. Turbius Parish. From the very beginning, Reverend Bona lamented the fact that, in view of the lack of support from the devout Polish Catholics within the vicinity of the proposed parish, its organization had to be discontinued for the present. He also expressed sorrow that the committee--namely, Messrs. Rokosz and Machnicki--in its previous management, had presented an erroneous account of the numerical strength of the proposed parish. The committee had assured him that there were at least 160 Polish families and at least 75 other families [in the projected parish]; however, Reverend Smyk could only account for 70 Polish families and 32 families of other nationalities. To this, Messrs. Rokosz and Machnicki replied that they had expected this community to grow, for building lots had been sold to Polish families. (Both of these men are real-estate agents and have their own office in the neighborhood.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Reverend T. Bona maintained that the present number of residents, made up mostly of poor families, is inadequate to support a local parish. Such parishes are generally organized on an assumption of future growth, with provisions made for the accommodation of children in the parish school. St. Turbius Parish would have to go into debt to the extent of at least $170,000. The interest rate on this sum would be $9,000 a year. 'In spite of this,' said Reverend Bona, 'if the members of the proposed parish had shown some enthusiasm and good will, especially when a pastor was assigned, the strength of the organization could have been tested, and it would have been assured full support of the Diocese. But the devout people of this locality, especially the Polish people, began to boycott the pastor. They left him to his lot, denying him various sources of support. Because of this there was no other course left open than to suspend the organization of the parish.'</p>
   <p>"Asked whether there was any possibility of Reverend Smyk's return to the parish, Reverend Bona replied that he had been sent for the time being to <span class="page-break">\5</span>St. Blase Parish in Argo, and that later he would be delegated to organize a parish in another place, because there are parishes that are waiting to be organized, parishes which because of the lack of priests must unfortunately wait their turn patiently. The pastor suggested that the committee begin an energetic campaign to reorganize the faithful families within the boundaries of St. Turbius Parish; once they were organized, His Eminence would unquestionably give them a pastor.</p>
   <p>"Then the Polish question arose. The undersigned assured Reverend Bona that the non-Polish portion of the community had no objection to complete Polish dominance. To this Reverend Thomas Bona replied that if anyone was to get credit for this, it was the Cardinal, who always has the interests of the Polish people at heart. That is why he sent a pastor who could speak Polish well to St. Turbius Parish, with a recommendation that he take charge of all the faithful residing within the boundaries of the new parish. Reverend Bona recalled that Messrs. Rokosz and Machnicki had agreed and wanted to organize a parish on this basis, that is, one parish for all the devout <span class="page-break">\6</span>families in this community. For this reason, the newly-appointed pastor began to organize the parish along these lines, having in view the consolidation of all the families, to the satisfaction of everyone. After a short time, however, the Polish element began to dominate; their wants and demands had to be specifically and fully satisfied. Reverend Smyk called upon the Polish people to have patience and understanding, but without success. The Poles began to strike. As a result, Reverend Smyk was forced to leave his post.</p>
   <p>"Reverend T. P. Bona called upon the members of the committee for unity of action and mutual co-operation, offering the suggestion that they advise the people to attend Mass and devote themselves to the church to which they belonged at the time, while awaiting further developments.</p>
   <p>"He suggested that the committee seek further help from the Diocese. They went for assistance to the Right Reverend Sheil, chancellor, who more or less repeated what Reverend Bona had already stated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"We regret the behavior of our Polish brothers who are trying to break away from our holy church, knowing that the number desiring 'independence' is small. We are also sorry to see the names of Messrs. Rokosz and Machnicki among the leaders of this faction. During these times, let us not forget our faith, for the Catholic church is the true church, instituted by Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
   <p>"John Weidenbach,</p>
   <p>"Charles Thowbridge."</p>
   <p>This statement is very clear, but it calls for more comment. The fact that Messrs. Rokosz and Machnicki are conducting a real-estate business in this area, having an office in the vicinity, is worth mentioning. To these men the character of the parish could not be a matter of indifference. To be sure, an exclusive Polish parish would mean that more lots could be sold and more profit made. The Polish people, however, are familiar with this <span class="page-break">\8</span>trick for boosting real-estate sales. One can easily understand this by looking at any of the advertisements announcing the sale of lots; these invariably read: "Buy, friend, and you will have a home close to a Polish church....and your children close to a Polish school."</p>
   <p>The mixture of various nationalities within the parish in "New Poland" was not to the liking of these real-estate agents. They cleverly mixed religious and national angles with their business interests, thus creating a storm of controversy. Others followed in their footsteps, with the result that the agitation is becoming clamorous. To impress the public they use the time-honored method of waving a national flag.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, it must be pointed out that one of these real-estate men has for the past three years been making an effort to create an independent parish for the same business reasons. But he was not able to realize such a "laudable" aim. As a result, he "reformed" and set out to campaign for a Polish parish. It is repeated once more that by combining the Polish church with a Polish <span class="page-break">\9</span>school and a Polish priest, there will result an increase in the number of Polish settlers. This in turn will stimulate real-estate buying and building. In reality this is not a bad thing, but why "twist the cat's tail in the bag"? [sic] It is better to tell how conditions actually are, and not to pose as redeemers and guardians of the people.</p>
