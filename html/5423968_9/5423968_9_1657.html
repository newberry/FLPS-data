   <p>As an antidote and answer to much anti-Catholic propaganda, which passes for facts, we suggest that our readers commit to memory such facts as these:</p>
   <p>Are Catholics priest-ridden? There is a Catholic priest in America for every eight hundred and seventy-five Catholics, a Protestant minister for every two hundred and sixty Protestants. There are forty nine thousand Baptist ministers and twenty thousand Catholic priests.</p>
   <p>Are Catholics a foreign mission? Of fifteen thousand Catholic churches, two thousand and two hundred use a foreign language, while Protestant churches using a foreign language number nine thousand four hundred and fifty.</p>
   <p>Are Catholics taxed exorbitantly for the support of religion? Catholics average annually about three dollars and seventy cents, each while Protestants <span class="page-break">\2</span>average seventeen dollars each, and one Protestant denomination averages eighty dollars each, though no Protestant denomination duplicates our expensive school and charity system.</p>
   <p>Napoleon once called the Jesuits, "the best organizers, next to God." Figures indicate that the same tribute could be truthfully paid to the whole Catholic church.</p>
