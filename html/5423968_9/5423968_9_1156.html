   <p>Today the entire Christian world is observing the most solemn day of Holy Week [preceding Easter Sunday]. This is the anniversary of the day the Saviour of the world--God and man--permitted himself to be crucified for the salvation of man. He died in order that the barriers of hell might be opened so that the children of God could be joined with their Father.</p>
   <p>The bells have been silenced. The quiet of mourning fills the churches. Legions of pious people are kissing the cross, and are humbling themselves before Christ with the crown of thorns, as they realize how the drama ended at Golgotha.</p>
   <p>Does everyone know? Do those people who have renounced the representative of Christ know of the servant, in the services of the Saviour, at Rome?</p>
   <p>Do they know that the merciful God is ready to send His grace upon the millions of followers of various sects who have unknowingly strayed from the true faith, but may deny the same to those who are stubborn and oppose the principles of Christian society?</p>
   <p>Collect yourselves today, during Good Friday, in order that you may have the right to celebrate Easter Sunday.</p>
