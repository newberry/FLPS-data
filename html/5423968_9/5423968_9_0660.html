   <p>A national May Celebration was held yesterday at Bradley Street hall, Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>The pastor, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, opened the celebration by calling on Mr. Pyterek to act as chairman and the undersigned as secretary.</p>
   <p>All the numbers on the program were rendered to the complete satisfaction of the large audience.</p>
   <p>Our Choirs--the Girls' Choir and the Saint Cecilia Ladies' and Men's Choir--directed by our great conductor, Mr. Andrew J. Kwasigroch, were "roses in the wreath of the celebration."</p>
   <p>The speeches by Zagrzebski, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, and a former pupil of this <span class="page-break">2</span>school, Mr. J. Milewski, were generously applauded.</p>
   <p>Zagrzebski urged the parents to give their children more attention and advised the young people to join a society. Zahajkiewicz defined the meaning of true patriotism and pointed out the factors that bring about quarrels and dissension among us.</p>
   <p>The student Milewski delivered a beautiful speech on the Constitution of the Third of May, its meaning, and the causes that brought about the partition of Poland.</p>
   <p>The recitations by Z. Bielski, the youthful Miss Moczynska, and S. Subieszczyk, a student at our Saint Stanislaus College (now the Weber Academy) were applauded time and again.</p>
   <p>The drilling exercises of the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Turners were especially <span class="page-break">3</span>wonderful and deserved the applause showered on them.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the program, our beloved pastor urged all--the young and the old--to attend these national celebrations, and thanked the young people for being present in such large numbers and for their desire to help. It was evident that the reverend speaker spoke from his heart in a fatherly manner.</p>
   <p>The singing of the Polish national Anthem, "God Save Poland," ended the celebration.</p>
