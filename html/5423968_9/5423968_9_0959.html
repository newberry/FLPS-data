   <p>Two days ago, the societies of St. Adalbert's parish celebrated the thirty-first anniversary of the Polish Insurrection of 1863 at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened by Mr. J. Napieralski, who called upon Mr. K. Zychlinski and Mr. A. Szydlowski to act as master of ceremonies and recording secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>The master of ceremonies introduced Mr. Bobowski, who delivered a long speech, in which he explained certain historical facts in connection with the Polish Insurrection of January 1863. The next speaker, Mr. A. Klimecki, a veteran of the Insurrection, related his experiences in the fight for the motherland, urging his listeners to unite and work for the nationalistic cause. Next on the program was a choral piece by the young women of the singing society Jutrzenka (Morning Star), who were greatly applauded. Miss Bobowski was <span class="page-break">\2</span>rewarded with great applause for her recitation of "Do Orla Bialego" (O, White Eagle), which was followed with a piano solo by Mr. Kujawski, who played excellently in spite of being so young.</p>
   <p>Mr. Julian Smietanka, the son of Francis Smietanka, delivered a speech in English, describing the Insurrection of 1863, explaining the reasons why Europe is indebted to Poland, and suggesting how this debt should be paid. The next speaker, Mr. K. Bielinski, who spoke in Polish, urged the Poles to work for the motherland with deeds, not with words. His speech over, Miss Rykiert gave a beautiful recitation. The program concluded with a short speech by Mr. K. Zychlinski, who spoke of the proposed Polish mass meeting and the Polish League in America, urging his listeners to work for their realization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Heusla's orchestra played beautifully for the occasion. This service was free. At the end there was a collection for the benefit of the hall, which brought $11.75.</p>
