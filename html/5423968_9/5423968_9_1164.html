   <p>Unusual impressive Gregorian hymns were sung by the church choir during the blessing of the palms and the procession. Reverend Father S. Nawrocki, pastor, officiated during the solemn high mass. The Passion was sung by three assisting priests, garbed in attire fitting the ceremonial. Father C.

   <p>Those who have witnessed the blessing of the palms for the first time were greatly impressed by the solemn rites and the Gregorian singing. This Palm Sunday ritual recalled to many with joy and sadness the Cathedrals of Posen, Gniezno, and Pelpliny.</p>
