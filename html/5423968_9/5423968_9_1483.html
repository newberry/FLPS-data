   <p>Our public is very much interested in the project to hold a Polish mass meeting with a view to establishing a Polish League in America. The Polish press has already voiced its opinion on this matter and, as soon as the project is officially announced, it will devote more time and space to it.</p>
   <p>Since our people at large are quite interested in this project, we will try to get for them the opinions expressed on this matter by our various factions, regardless of whether these opinions are favorable or not. We like to know what the Polish public thinks about this question.</p>
   <p>We are quoting now the opinions expressed so far by several Polish newspapers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The opinion of other journals will be published also in our columns as soon as they make them public.</p>
   <p>Gosc (Guest), from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, writes as follows: "If it is customary for us American Poles to observe every national holiday, if we can afford to present a Polish Day at the Chicago Fair, if we can take active part in the Lwow Fair, then would it not be proper to think about honoring the memory of our hero at the one-hundredth anniversary of the year of his patriotic deeds for our motherland? But the question is, "How?"</p>
   <p>"We agree with Dziennik Chicagoski that this anniversary should be honored with deeds rather than with demonstrations. We also agree that to hold a general Polish mass meeting and to create a large patriotic organization, which would unite all large and influential political parties, would be the most proper way of honoring the memory of Kosciusko. We should give this matter careful attention."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Gosc, after commenting on its friendly attitude toward the proposed organization and mentioning the fights that go on among the factions, continues: "If we desire to honor the memory of Kosciusko properly, let us hold a general mass meeting and create something that may unite and lead us toward the same goal."</p>
   <p>Gosc advises the merging of four organizations into one; this, in our opinion, is impossible. We are positive that the editors of Gosc will abandon this plan as soon as they acquaint themselves with the program of the League.</p>
   <p>As to the necessity of unity and co-operation, Gosc writes: "Polish Day [at the Chicago Fair] has demonstrated that we can co-operate and work in harmony if we desire to do so. The celebration of Polish Day was in the nature of a demonstration; but this time we desire to accomplish a deed, to take a step which could bring us closer to our motherland. Why can't we sacrifice our egoism? Why do we divide ourselves into four parts? We should unite and work <span class="page-break">4</span>together for the resurrection of Poland."</p>
   <p>We agree with the opinion expressed by these words. Indeed, they express an aim, the realization of which the League could help accomplish.</p>
   <p>Polak w Ameryce (Pole in America) expresses itself on this question as follows: "Polish newspapers in Chicago have undertaken to arrange a general Polish mass meeting. This is a splendid idea, but at present it would be too expensive and impractical. It should be postponed to some other, more prosperous time."</p>
   <p>Moreover, Polak w Ameryce recommends Buffalo, and not Chicago, as the proper place for holding this mass meeting, basing its preference on the belief that the Chicago Poles want to monopolize the leadership.</p>
   <p>Sztandar (Standard), a new publication issued at Saint Adalbert's parish, has <span class="page-break">5</span>published a three-column article on the Polish mass meeting and the League. In this article we read the following paragraph: "In our opinion, a general Polish mass meeting is very important, beneficial, and necessary. A successful mass meeting may awaken in us a desire for action and deeds; consequently, it will stand above parties and factions. Polish organizations may preserve their own individuality, their own viewpoints--which, of course, are almost alike--and yet, in spite of all this, it should be possible for them to find some modus vivendi whereby they all could work side by side, helping one another. And what is more important, delegates of other nationalities, such as Lithuanians or Ruthenians, should attend this mass meeting. All our organizations have only one aim, that is, the liberation of Poland. Lithuanians and Ruthenians have a similar aim. We are not so much concerned about the aim as we are about the means; if all of us modify our views a little for the benefit of others, then the means will undoubtedly be found. All we need is more good will and less egoism, for the latter, in some measure, was responsible for the downfall of Poland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"Our enemies have always said that the personal ambitions of our ancestors destroyed Poland. Let us give them an opportunity in a very near future to see that the same Poland has been resurrected by her later generations. However, we cannot undertake any action in this direction until we understand ourselves."</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Sztandar is not in favor of any delay on account of the European situation and engages, in a controversy with Polak w Ameryce as to the place where the mass meeting should be held. Sztandar favors Chicago and supports the cause.</p>
   <p>The anarchistic journal Nowezycie (New Life) also mentions the mass meeting and the League. Its remarks, of course, are uncomplimentary. Like Polak w Ameryce, it desires to have the mass meeting in Buffalo, "where the influence of the Chicago leaders would be limited". And even this opinion is surprising, <span class="page-break">7</span>coming as it does from a publication the purpose of which is not to build but to destroy.</p>
