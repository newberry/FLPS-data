   <p>The Polish church and the Polish parish have always been supported by the Polish people. Just as the cornerstone is of fundamental importance to the parish church, the Polish parish is equally important because it is the nucleus of Polish immigration. Many other activities have originated from it and fostered by it. This has been true of the early conception of the parish, and the same applies to the present, because we Poles do not know how to express our activities and existence in no other way than in league with the church. In this same respect, the Polish people of Chicago will be informed that a new parish has been added to the already large number, and that three more will be added in the near future.</p>
   <p>The above information is very timely, and the Polish society has received this news with a sigh of relief. A rumor has been spread that there would be no new churches built in Chicago, however, this, as we see, is not true, <span class="page-break">2</span>nor was this ever given a thought. This is the work of bad, perversive, and dishonest persons, whose work apparently is to spread false rumors and create a misunderstanding among the Poles. When they are forced to face the consequences of their disreputable work, they hide themselves. Many times such false reports cover up the true material gain of the Polish community.</p>
   <p>To support their false claims and cover up the true facts, these dishonest people use the name of the diocese Chancellor, whom they quote as saying that there are enough Polish parishes in Chicago and that no more will be added. Meanwhile, this same Church official granted permission to Fr. Smyk to establish a parish in Harvey. What better evidence can be presented than this against the unjustified rumors?</p>
   <p>We have also been informed from reliable sources that in the neighborhood of Father Wojtalewicz's and Father Kowalewski's parishes in South Chicago, at 80th Street, a new Franciscan Fathers' parish is being organized. But the <span class="page-break">3</span>plans for this new parish have not been recent. They have been long in the making. This fact is now revealed in order to definitely prove that the spreading rumor is unfounded. But this is not all. Other parishes are also being planned for Chicago. This will certainly spoil the plans of those that wish to discredit our work.</p>
   <p>Although these agitators claim to be our guardian angels, in reality they turn out to be our evil spirits. They make themselves deserving "patriots," pointing out to the people their achievements and sacrifices, and warn them against imaginary uncertainties. All this is done only to gain attention and confidence. After this is created, they divert their power in realizing their lowly ambitions. Many times their plans are frustrated as in this instance mentioned above. In this respect, they lose a hundred times more than they were going to gain through their lies.</p>
