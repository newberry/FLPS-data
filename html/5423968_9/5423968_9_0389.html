   <p>July 4th of the present year was one of the most beautiful days in the history of the United States. All nationalities in all cities and towns arranged stately parades and gatherings, at which the speakers, in their own native languages, expressed loyalty and attachment to this country.</p>
   <p>The greatest and most beautiful were the Polish parades and gatherings, which were commented upon by the American newspapers. In Chicago, for example, all Polish parishes took part in parades, and with the parades were included all members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The greatest gathering, in Humboldt Park, Chicago, was directed by Mr. N. L. Piotrowski, president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, and the main speakers were the golden-voiced Rev. W. Zapala, Rector of St. Stanislaus College, head chaplain of the Polish army, who spoke in Polish, and Attorney Quinn O'Brien, noted speaker, who spoke in English.</p>

   <p>Similar Polish manifestations took place in all the large Polish settlements. This is not the first time the Poles have given proof of their enthusiasm and loyalty, for which they gain greater influence and respect in this country.</p>
   <p>Honor and acknowledgment is due the Polish clergy and the assisting committees, for the support of the cause and the preparation of the parishes for such splendid appearances.</p>
