   <p>To Hon. Frank O. Lowden,</p>
   <p>Governor of the State of Illinois,</p>
   <p>Springfield, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Honorable and Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Your proclamation creating January 26th as Polish Day thruout the State of Illinois brought joy to the hearts of all Americans of Polish birth or descent. Your utterances regarding the newly established Republic of Poland directed principally to all Americans threw a new light upon Poland's cause and stirred the democratic hearts of all Americans to expressions of steadfast loyalty to the principles so nobly expressed by President Wilson to the civilized world. Your proclamation, Honorable and Dear Sir, re-echoed within all loyal individuals inhabiting the state of Illinois, a new memory and official recognition of an ancient nation that was persecuted for the past century and a quarter and is now coming to its own within the ranks of all truly civilized peoples of the world. Your expressions, dear Sir, portray to the people of Illinois your feelings towards Poland, and hundreds of thousands of Americans of Polish birth or extraction living in Illinois. Therefore accept our profound homage and admiration. May the Almighty bring <span class="page-break">2</span>blessings upon your wise direction of the state affairs of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Resolutions of thanks to you were adopted at the annual meeting of the South Chicago District of the Polish National Alliance in whose name we beg to subscribe ourselves</p>
   <p>Your humble servants</p>
   <p>Committee on Resolutions</p>
