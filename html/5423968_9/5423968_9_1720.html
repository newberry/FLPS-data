   <p>The unusual persecutions of the Polish language by the high Roman-Catholic dignitaries arouse the masses of our Polish brothers here to assume a more appropriate attitude.</p>
   <p>A few months ago a group of Poles, residing on the West Side of the city, decided to organize a new parish.</p>
   <p>In carrying out that decision, a delegation went to the papal dignitary in order to receive his approval. Of course, the dignitary took the humble request of Poles into consideration and, having bought a few lots for the prospective parish, sent over a priest with distinct instructions to perform all his ecclesiastical duties exclusively in English.</p>
   <p>The poor priest, although a Pole, had to obey the strict order of that high dignitary, and soon began the "Irishization" of Poles. But most of our good thinking brothers did not approve of that disregard of their <span class="page-break">2</span>feelings and refused to pay their church dues.</p>
   <p>In reply to their attitude they were told that either they submit to the "higher policy" of the church dignitaries, or there will be no Polish parish.</p>
   <p>That answer, reiterated whenever our Polish brothers tried to persuade the church authorities to their cause, convinced them that God can not require of them to betray their most sacred ideals in order to satisfy the Irish-German church dignitaries.</p>
   <p>They understood that the faith itself will gain if they praise God in their own native language, and with that they conceived the idea of organizing a parish under the auspices of the Polish National Church.</p>
   <p>In order to carry out that decision a mass meeting will be held at 7 P. M. this coming Sunday, December 18, at the public school auditorium, at 58th and Hamlin streets.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The gathering will be addressed by various speakers, and among them the representatives of the Polish National Catholic Church.</p>
