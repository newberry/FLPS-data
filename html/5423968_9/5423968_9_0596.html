   <p>The proclamation of H. H. Clevand, American veteran, published in yesterday's edition of our paper, did not pass unnoticed; which fact was proved in this morning's mail in which we find warm comments regarding our proposal that our Societies join the grand march, on Sunday, June 14th.</p>
   <p>Invitations were sent to all Poles in Chicago, requesting that they participate in this 131st anniversary of the American Flag Festival. This celebration should arouse, in us, a sympathy for those, our country-men, who fought in the shade of the star spangled Banner. We should be proud also, of the fact that in this country we are met with different treatment.</p>
   <p>Americans invite us, to remind us of the advantages which this country offers, and which are unlike those of Russia, where Polish blood was also shed in defense of the Russian banner, but where we are now maltreated. It is for this reason that we should show our appreciation by presenting ourselves in large numbers.</p>
   <p>Military and school societies should not disregard this invitation of the great veteran, Mr. H. H. Clevand.</p>
