   <p>Sunday, Feb. 9, 1936, will be remembered by the members of St. Magdalene's Parish for a long time. On that day they celebrated a silver jubilee of the foundation of their parish. The celebration was conducted in a regular Polish Catholic spirit. The weather was cold but clear. At 10 A.M. the church societies gathered at the parish house, and from there they marched to church, where they remained in the reserved seats until 11 A.M. At 11 A.M. the procession started from the church, headed by Rev. G. Wesolowski, followed by the ministrants. The cross was carried in front of the ministrants. Then followed the clergy and the faithful.</p>
   <p>The church was beautifully illuminated and decorated with flower and silver leaves. The faithful filled the church to capacity. They thanked God for all the favors that He bestowed upon them and upon their parish for the last twenty-five years. They prayed for His blessing and the strength necessary for carrying work further. They also prayed for the souls who left this world in order to receive the reward for their work.</p>
   
   <p>The solemn mass was said by Prelate John G. Mielcarek, the pastor of the parish, assisted by Rev. L. Hinca and S. Dopar. The jubilee sermon was preached by Right Rev. Bishop Bona.</p>
   <p>After the celebration there was a banquet.</p>
