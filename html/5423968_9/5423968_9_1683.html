   <p>We realize that the Polish element in Chicago is, from day to day, creating a historical background. The political, social, religious and educational scope of its daily life, is now subject to constant changes. Up to now it was the general opinion, that the Polish element in America is only temporary, and that Poles will return to their homeland, to establish a permanent residence. It is true, however, that a small percentage of the Polish element returned to Europe, but later attempted to return here. This was impossible because of the immigration laws of America. We must remember that the Poles in America are aware of the more favorable conditions existing here, insofar as opportunity to share the general welfare and wealth of the country is concerned.</p>
   <p>The greatest attraction, and one which is drawing the people of all nations, is the high standard of living which the average laborer enjoys in America. The foreigners returning to Europe, are those who have been deported or who have reached an age where they are unable to earn a livelihood. Those are only rare exceptions; the average Pole remaining in America becomes a law abiding and loyal citizen.</p>
   
   <p>Conditions present the Poles in America with a new problem, namely that of attaining equal social and economic standards. Confronted with the task of writing the history of the Polish element in America, we must begin a thorough search of documents and records in archives of the various parishes in America.</p>
   <p>If all the Poles who are members of the many Polish parishes of churches in Chicago and the United States, would co-operate by submitting to the historians, whatever information they posses, it will bring forth the ever present pioneering spirit, with which the Polish race is endowed. It is a very important factor when compiling this history of Polish parishes, which truly will be a very complete chronicle, that all outstanding events, in which the Poles participated be mentioned. Today, items and notices which may have the aspect of insignificance will become valuable pieces of historical data; for instance, information as to the name of the Church pastor who took upon himself the responsibility of raising funds for the purpose of building more churches, schools and other necessary edifices, will be available.</p>
   <p>It is only fair that this history be compiled with the definite thought of paying homage to those brave people who gave their support in establishing it.</p>
   
   <p>Collections of valuable documents and archives of this type were greatly responsible for the publication of the following books and annuals.</p>
   <p>1-History of the Polish People in America, by the Reverend X. Kruszka.</p>
   <p>2-The Golden Ledger, by Zahajkiewicz.</p>
   <p>3-The Educational Era of Poles in America, by S. Osada.</p>
   <p>4-The Silver Jubilee booklet, published on the 25th Anniversary of the St. Stanislaus Parish, in Pittsburgh.</p>
   <p>5-The League of Nations and Poles in America, by S. Osada.</p>
   <p>6-The History of the Holy Trinity Parish in Chicago.</p>
   <p>7-A Jubilee Souvenir Booklet of Saint Joseph's Parish in Manistique, Michigan.</p>
   <p>8-The Parish History of Saint Hyacinth's Parish in LaSalle Illinois.</p>
   <p>The above number of books are but a small part of the historical data, which the Poles possess and which could be published.</p>
