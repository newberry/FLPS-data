   <p>The editor of Dziennik Zjednoczenia must be afflicted either with mental deficiency or with the ego of his masters and is ready to threaten with inquisition those who oppose papal slavery.</p>
   <p>Lately his demands and claims have been carried further than expected. Here are some of his own remarks published in his journal:</p>
   <p>"We have learned that a certain Polish Falcon group of Chicago has joined the Independent Church, in which its banner will be blessed. Such action in that honorable organization does not have the desired symptoms and with such tactics our Falcons are breaking away from those traditions which this gymnastical organization enjoyed and which based its activities on the foundation of the Roman-Catholic Church idealogy.</p>
   <p>"Such a symptom indicates that into the organization of Polish Falcons has crept an independent element which may cause discord in the ranks of the organization. Therefore, among the Falcons, whose members are mostly young men, a Catholic spirit should prevail; a spirit which characterized this organization from the very beginning of its foundation.</p>
   <p>"No, Falcons! You shall not gain anything this way. On the contrary, the weakening of faith in the ranks of the Falcons may do harm to the organization."</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to make any comments on these "wise remarks." Mr. Editor considers himself and his clique a dictator over the Polish Falcons.</p>
   <p>What right have the Polish Falcons to belong to the Polish National Church without first getting permission from the "little head" of Mr. Stefanowicz?</p>
   
   <p>That is, indeed, very amusing. It seems to Mr. Stefanowicz that he is the "boss" of the Falcons. He waves his club, full of rage and threats. Mr. S., those are silly threats. All organizations, Falcons and the rest of them, will in time break away from the Pope and work for the good of the whole community, because they realized that the Pope wants them to work only for himself.</p>
