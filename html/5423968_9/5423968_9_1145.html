   <p>The choir of the Philarets, which preserves not only the high quality of Polish music but many of our ancient Polish customs as well, decided yesterday to resurrect the old custom of caroling, already forgotten by Polish immigrants here.</p>
   <p>A group of choir members who were free from family obligations, together with their director, Mr. B. Zalewski, gathered yesterday at the home of one of their colleagues, Mr. Ernest, on Division Street. After singing carols to their host, the party left acaroling toward the next stop on its route, which was a long and tiring one. [Translator's note: A list of the names of the persons visited is given.]</p>
   <p>Everywhere they went they were sincerely welcomed, and were treated according to old Polish custom.</p>

   <p>The choir intends to carry out a more elaborate form of caroling next year, hoping to resurrect in this way our ancient national custom.</p>
