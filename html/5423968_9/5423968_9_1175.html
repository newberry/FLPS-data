   <p>Mr. Adamkiewicz, immediately prior to accepting the function of chairman, made a brief, but inspiring speech about our motherland; of the sacrifices that each sincere Pole should willingly bear in her behalf, concluding that in this free country our people can and should do a great deal of good for Poland.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was a declamation. Following this, there was group singing by children of the local parish, which was rendered with such simplicity that it touched upon the heartstrings of the attendance.</p>
   <p>The next speaker on the program was Mr. Stanley Swienton, Who reminded the people of Poland's oppression under her three aggressors, Austria, Germany, and Russia, and urged the people to work and sacrifice in her behalf.</p>
   <p>A medley of Polish national songs were excellently rendered by the local parish choir, under the capable direction of the organist, Mr. F. Nowicki.</p>
