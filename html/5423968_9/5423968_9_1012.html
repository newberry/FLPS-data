   <p>Mr. S. Slupski's suggestion to hold national exercises to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of the death of Copernicus is slowly taking shape. As we already know, the St. Casimir Youth Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish accepted it enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the officers of the St. Casimir Society--Messrs. Nering, Jozwiakowski, Szajkowski, and F. Kwasigroch--hold a confernce with Mr. Slupski on the subject. It was also decided that probably on Thursday of this week, a meeting of the representatives of various Polish clubs and societies will be held to discuss this question. This paper will publish the official announcement of this meeting.</p>
