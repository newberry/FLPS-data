   <p>National exercises in commemoration of the one hundred and second anniversary of the [Polish] Constitution of the Third of May were held yesterday in the Northwest Side under the auspices of the societies of the Polish National Alliance. Although the hall where the celebration took place is not a large one, there were many empty seats.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened by Mr. Kostka's orchestra, which played a number of marches. The first speech, delivered by Mr. Szopinski, chairman of the committee in charge, dealt with the significance of the Constitution. Mr. J. Slowikowski followed him with a speech in Polish on the Constitution and on the partition of Poland. The next speakers were Mr. [Sigmund] Slupski, who spoke about the exercises to honor Copernicus, and Mr. John F. Smulski, who spoke in English. Patriotic recitations were delivered by Mr. Slupski and Mr. Pulkowski, as well as by Miss Wienarski, Miss Listewnik, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and Miss Sniegocki. The program was completed by piano solos played by little Miss Majewski and Miss Goleniewicz; a few orchestral numbers, and songs by the Chopin Chorus.</p>
   <p>At the close of the program, a collection was taken for the Kosciusko Memorial Fund.</p>
