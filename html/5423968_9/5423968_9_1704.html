   <p>Although recently organized, The Women's Welfare Club of St. Camillus' parish has exerted energy comparable only to a long standing organization. Its New Year's banquet was made possible by the donation of many small articles and bakery goods. Many families of the parish were responsible for the contributions.</p>
   <p>This club was organized November 25, 1927. The administrative body has not been elected as yet. Despite this, plans for "Cracow Wedding" and a "Doughnut Ball" are being prepared.</p>
   <p>The organizers of the Club are as follows: Misses Jean Czurzylo, Rosalie Dutka, Josephine Fuchs, Eve Jedras, Marianne Klinek, Marianne Kopec, S. Kukula, Anna Kurzawska, Agnes Kwasna, Valeria Mikos, Catherine Murczek, Sophia Tokarz, and Frances Wojtasik.</p>
