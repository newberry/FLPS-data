   <p>In execution of an order from Cardinal Mundelein, priests in some of the Polish Roman-Catholic churches demand that the parishioners adhere to all the conditions imposed on them by the church.</p>
   <p>Most naturally, some of the parishioners begin to assume a critical attitude towards their religious "bosses," and in consequence join the German and Irish parishes where everything is quiet and peaceful.</p>
   <p>Of course, it is a diplomatic game on the part of Cardinal Mundelein, whose aim is to denationalize the Poles.</p>
   <p>In making it hard for them to belong to Polish churches, the Cardinal indirectly compels them to join German and Irish parishes and send their children to parochial schools, where not a single Polish word is spoken.</p>
