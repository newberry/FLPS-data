   <p>The Holy Name of Mary Society of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, gathered yesterday for the purpose of appointing and instructing delegates for the coming Polish Roman Catholic Union convention, publicly announces that it protests the action against Leon Szopinski taken by Narod Polski, which asks his elimination as a delegate to the convention. This society considers this an insult not only to Leon Szopinski but also to the society that has chosen him for this office. At the same time this society wishes to give Mr. Szopinski a public vote of confidence in order to compensate him in part for the injustice committed against him by the official organ of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The Holy Name of Mary Society desires that this protest be published in Dziennik Chicagoski and in the thirty-first number of Narod Polski. Chicago, July 26, 1897.</p>
