   <p>The rules and regulations adopted at the Polish journalists convention at Buffalo on July 5 read as follows:</p>
   <p>"We, the Polish journalists of America, at a convention held on July 4 and 5 at Buffalo for the purpose of bringing to life the Polish Journalists Alliance of America, have adopted the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>"1. That the Polish Journalists Alliance of America should have as one of its main objectives the formation of a means for the guarding and protecting the material interests of the Polish press and the introduction of a means to bring about the material growth of the press along the road of business betterment, by the creation of principles governing the association, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"2. That further, one of our cardinal concerns is the ardent support of our nationality in the presence of erroneous judgment which is often prevalent in the columns of the American press, and that the undertaking of this protection falls primarily upon this newly formed society to elevate the character and the reputation of the Poles at large.</p>
   <p>"3. That one of the duties of the Alliance is its concern over the purity of the Polish tongue in America.</p>
   <p>"4. That equal concern should be placed upon the uprooting of the disrespect of Polish literature which has been strewn amid out ranks, as is evidenced by the publication of articles and long stories without citing the sources or the authors, and that this alliance should pave the way toward correcting this fault.</p>
   <p>"5. That we severely condemn the personal attacks and brutal creations that <span class="page-break">3</span>are cast at individuals or at each other by the Polish press, and we consider such attacks as being out of place; that the general task and aims of the press which should be to strive for betterment among our people; that we will undertake various measures to weed our such practices in our ranks as they are unpleasant to our people, and that one of the most important principles considered by the newly organized Polish Journalists Alliance of America is the freeing of the Polish-American press from this sadly acquired foreign habit, that was unknown in the Polish press but was negligently acquired from others and to properly counteract through moral channels the intrusion of slanderers and attackers.</p>
   <p>"And in respect to the above we adopt the following articles to the constitution of the newly organized Journalists Alliance.</p>
   <p>"1. The aim of the society is (a) the mutual protection of the material <span class="page-break">4</span>interests of the press, (b) elevation of the horizon of Polish public opinion of America through the improvement and perfection of our press.</p>
   <p>"II. Only the officers of the Polish Journalists Alliance of America have the right to choose its members, but their decision can be appealed to the Diet.</p>
   <p>"III. Every Polish publisher, editor, or associate of a Polish paper in America may become a member of the Alliance including those that are temporarily unemployed in this field, provided they take an oath to do everything possible within their power to avoid the appearance of slanderous stories or attacks in the Polish press which heretofore have been practiced.</p>
   <p>"IV. Various transgressions of the above, upon charges brought by the libeled <span class="page-break">5</span>or assailed person, are subject to trial by an honorable court made up of three judges, one chosen by each side from the members of the Alliance, and the third, to act as an arbitrator, to be picked either from the members of the Alliance or some outside individual to be chosen by the two judges. The charges are to be brought before the administrative body which shall decide whether or not an honorable court shall be called to render a decision. The court, upon recognizing the guilt of the accused, upon request of the accuser shall recommend to the newspapers belonging to this Alliance, as well as to the paper in question, that they announce the decision rendered against the accused. The paper or persons in question, are forbidden to file an appeal, and in the event three such verdicts are issued against the same party in the course of one year that party or paper will be banned from the Alliance.</p>
   <p>"V. The protection of the Polish people, in view of the opinions expressed in the American press, shall be vested in the officers of the Alliance, who are duty-bound to keep a careful eye on all derogatory articles. The <span class="page-break">6</span>members situated in various cities, upon seeing any such articles in the local English papers, are obligated to call the attention of the secretary of the Alliance to the article, and to send a copy of the article to the secretary.</p>
   <p>"VI. For the good of the Alliance and to safeguard the material interests of the Polish publications, the following measures shall be taken:</p>
   <p>"A. To make an effort not to send out Polish papers on credit for any extended period of time, unless a special order has been given or an understanding has been reached.</p>
   <p>"B. To prepare a list showing all bad accounts, all advertisers who have defaulted in their payments, all out-of-town agents who have assumed the responsibilities of making collections when collections are past due and to <span class="page-break">7</span>communicate the names of such individuals to the administration, which in turn shall warn all members.</p>
   <p>"C. To make an effort to limit the exploitation of the advertising agencies through the road of reciprocity.</p>
   <p>"D. To make an effort for the accomodation of far-reaching principles, especially the appointment of agents and correspondents, the eventual introduction of an agency prepared to provide stereotyped material, illustrations, etc., to the Polish papers.</p>
   <p>"E. To adopt an insignia for this organization which will distinguish the papers of the Alliance from other papers, and to publish a list of such papers in the American business organs.</p>
   <p>"VII. The Alliance obligates its members to be concerned about the purity <span class="page-break">8</span>of the Polish language, especially to avoid the use of provincial or local phraseology which is used only in particular sections.</p>
   <p>"VIII. Whenever any person charges another with plagiarism, the administration will see that the offender receives several warnings through private channels. If this does not remedy the situation, the administration will have the right publicly to condemn the guilty writer in the papers of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>"IX. The administration, made up of a president, secretary and treasurer, will act as the executive board of the Alliance; the mediation board will be vested in the Diet, or convention. The convention will take place every year, the month and day being set up by the previous convention. All members are eligible to take part in the Diet. The Diet chooses the officers and adopts various measures pertinent to the efficient operation of the organization. The Diet is the highest authority and shall decide upon the various <span class="page-break">9</span>charges that are taken up by the administration or commission.</p>
   <p>"X. The duties of the officers, including the many routines, will be given in detail at the next convention.</p>
   <p>"XI. The above articles of the constitution, prepared and adopted, shall become a law from this day, July 5, 1895, obligating all members of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>"Sincerely,</p>
   <p>"Henry Nagiel, secretary."</p>
