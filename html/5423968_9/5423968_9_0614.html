   <p>A May Day exercise [in honor of the Polish constitution of May 3, 1791] was staged at Calumet Hall on May 9.</p>

   <p>When everybody had been seated after the parade, Martin Wiora opened the demonstration and called upon C. Witkowski to preside as chairman and John S. Derpa as recording secretary. A rich program, arranged by a committee representing all societies mentioned, followed.</p>
   <p>After a speech by the chairman, the White Eagle Band played a march, "War <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Signals of 1793". This was followed by an address, "The History of the Constitution of the Third of May," delivered by the Reverend F. M. Wojtalewicz, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The B. Dembinski Men's Chorus sang "Vistula," after which J. F. Smietanka spoke in English on the Polish constitution of the Third of May.</p>
   <p>Miss Marianne Barzynska played a captivating piano solo, for which she received a round of applause. Judge Edmund F. Burke spoke on Poland and compared its constitution with that of the United States. He stated that both stand for freedom and liberty.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch sang "Unfortunate Halka". Her rendition was so moving that she was compelled to give an encore, for which she was rewarded with a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers.</p>
   <p>Another speech about the history of the Polish constitution was made by Casimir Zychlinski. The Men's Chorus sang "Spring," and this was followed by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>recitations by A. Walkowiak, Fronkowski, and Strozewski.
