   <p>The [Tenth] Convention of the Polish National Alliance opened on Monday [September 4]. At nine o'clock in the morning, all delegates reported to the central headquarters for their badges. Later, at ten o'clock, they attended Mass at Holy Trinity Church. Mass was said by the Reverend Czyzewski, who was assisted by the Reverend Wojtalewicz, of Hammond, and Reverend Pawlowski, of Chicago. The Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of Holy Trinity parish, preached the sermon. He called upon the delegates to devote themselves to the work for Poland and not to seek personal fame, saying that he who seeks fame, works for himself, not for Poland. He spoke of the sad plight of our nation, that unfortunate motherland which, oppressed, asks our aid. "We can give it that aid", he said, "if we remain Poles, if we band together in the name of God." He adjured the delegates to keep in mind <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>throughout the discussion the general welfare of both the organization and Poland. "The fate of the Alliance," he went on, "rests in the hands of the delegates; their efforts, the results of the Convention, will be watched by sympathizers and enemies alike. The latter suspect the Alliance of anti-Catholic tendencies. The delegates gathered at the Tenth Convention ought to prove that they are not enemies of the Church." Finally, Father Sztuczko pointed out that the Polish youth in America had already begun to lose its national characteristics, that it was ashamed to use the Polish language. "The youth no longer has the Polish spirit, it does not understand our high ideals. For this reason, we must bend our efforts toward teaching our youth to remain Polish," he said.</p>
   <p>After the church services were over, the delegates formed into ranks and marched to Pulaski Hall, Eighteenth Street and Ashland Avenue. Since the march started at about twelve o'clock and the sun was very hot, the delegates arrived at the hall very tired.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>After the delegates had taken a short rest, F. Smietanka, in behalf of the management, welcomed them to Pulaski Hall. He expressed his joy at the fact that this Convention could meet in a Polish hall. He then turned the hall over to the disposition of the delegates and the censor. Upon the censor's request, Mr. Smietanka addressed the Convention. His speech was frequently interruped by vigorous applause.</p>
   <p>Following this address, the Convention was called to order by W. Przybyszewski, the censor, who said that he would speak to the gathering at another time. He proceeded immediately to the appointment of a Credentials Committee, naming to it L. Szopinski, Dr. L. Sadowski, Alexander Leszczynski, L.S. Dewoyno, and C. Zychlinski. Following the appointment of the Credentials Committee, the Convention was adjourned until the following day at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mallek, president of the Singers' Society, invited the delegates to attend the [Polish Singers' Alliance] concert to be held in the evening in the same hall.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The evening concert, played to a full hall, was very successful. Among the vocalists who distinguished themselves were Mrs. Bansiewicz, of Milwaukee, and Miss Dabrowski, of Racine.</p>
   <p>Second Day's Morning Session</p>
   <p>The second day's morning session of the Polish National Alliance was called to order at nine o'clock this morning [september 5, 1893] by Censor Przybyszewski.</p>
   <p>L. Szopinski read a report of the Credentials Committee to the effect that the secretary-general had flatly refused to allow the Committee the use of group-membership records, without which credentials could not be checked. As a result, the Committee was forced to question the credentials of all delegates present. This report gave rise to a storm of disapproval. It was claimed by the opposition that A. Leszczynski, of Sand Beach, as a representative of a group (H. Sienkiewicz Society, Buffalo) which had been in the Alliance for less than six <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>months, had no right to be a delegate. A stormy discussion followed, in which Secretary-General Mallek and Delegates Roland, Dr. Gryca, Gryglasiewicz, and others participated. As a result, the censor removed Leszczynski from the Credentials Committee and appointed Dr. Ilowiecki, of Detroit, in his stead. The secretary-general was directed to supply the Committee with the necessary records.</p>
   <p>Some time after ten o'clock, the meeting was adjourned so that the Credentials Committee might do its work.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 6, 1893.</p>
   <p>Election of President and Secretary</p>
   <p>The whole morning of the second day's session was spent in the verification of credentials, which, as reported yesterday, were all questioned by the Credentials <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Committee after the secretary-general had refused to submit membership records. After a long and stormy debate, Secretary-General Mallek was finally persuaded to surrender the necessary records.</p>
   <p>The Credentials Committee's report was completed at 12:30 in the afternoon and read to the Convention by C. Zychlinski, secretary of the Committee.</p>
   <p>The following were qualified delegates from Chicago: Stanislaus Lauferski (Polish Group), F. Sowadzki and C. Zychlinski (Polish Industrial Association), W. Bardonski and S. Makielski (Harmony), S. Terczewski (Polish Tailors' Union), J. Bobowski (Polish Group II), B. Korpolewski (Holy Trinity Singing Society), A. Groenwald (Industrial Youth Society), F. Jablonski (St. Joseph's Society of Holy Trinity parish), T. Golniewicz and A. Lisztewnik (Kosciusko Society), F. Smietanka and L. Czeslawski (King John Sobieski Society), O. Ekowski (Polonia Society), W. Templin (King John Sobieski Society of South Chicago), A. Jaroslawski (Third Division, Polish Krakus Society), S. Baranski (J. I. Kraszewski <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Society), M. A. Wleklinski and T. Nowacki (Batory Society), M. Moszczynski (August Gillers Society I), J. Slowikowski and J. Rudzinski (Eagle and Chase Society), L. Mroz and M. Magdziarz (King Miecislaus Society), W. Poszwinski and M. Ball (Star Society), S. Rokosz (Pole in Exile Society), L. Tuchoeki (Jan Kochanowski Society I), L. Roland (Adam Mickiewicz Society I) K. Machek and J. F. Smulski (Zana Society), E. Pawelkiewicz (Unity Society), J. Blaszka and T. Wikaryasz (King Casimir the Great Society). Delegates from the following cities were also present: Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Brooklyn, New York, Milwaukee, La Salle (Illinois), Duluth, South Bend, Philadelphia, and others. [Itemized list of delegates from these cities omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>After the report of the Credentials Committee had been accepted, election of Convention officers was next in the order of business. Delegates S. Lewandowski, of Cleveland, W. Bardonski, of Chicago, Lipinski and former Censor Gryglaszewski, of Philadelphia, were nominated for president. On the first ballot, Lewandowski received most votes. Gryglaszewski withdrew in favor of <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Lewandowski and moved that the latter be elected by acclamation. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Delegate S. Lauferski nominated Gryglaszewski for chairman of the Convention and proposed that he also be elected by acclamation. A number of delegates protested. Twenty-one delegates responded to the demand that those opposed rise. (Shouts of "Traitors!) Among those protesting, we noticed Bardonski, Jakinski, [L.] Szopinski, Roland, and Rudzinski, of Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Delegates Kosak, of Cincinnati, and [F] Jablonski, of Chicago, were nominated for secretary. There were no other candidates.</p>
   <p>The newly elected president of the Convention took his place on the platform amidst thunderous applause. He thanked the Convention for the unexpected honor conferred upon him. Following this short address, the chairman of the Convention, <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Gryglaszewski, addressed the delegates.</p>
   <p>He spoke of his own great services to the Alliance during his eight years as censor, emphasizing the patriotism with which he had worked for the Polish cause. He spoke also of his plans for the future, namely, that the Alliance build factories and shops so that Poles will not have to work for Germans. He touched upon the patriotic sermon of Father Sztuczko, who approved of the Alliance's tendencies. In conclusion, he read a toast written in verse by Simon Modrzewski. The verse cries out for enlightenment of the common people; enlightenment is the common people's only salvation from ignorance and slavery. The result of this enlightenment is to be a struggle against the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>The verse also complained against the American extradition treaty with Russia.....Since it was already two o'clock in the afternoon, a one-hour recess was declared.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Second Day's Afternoon Session</p>
   <p>The afternoon session opened with a proposal by Chairman Gryglaszewski that the manager of the hall be summoned to remove the floral decorations from the platform, seemingly disturbing to him. The flowers had been sent by E. Z. Brodowski upon request of the Committee on Decorations.</p>
   <p>The president settled this matter by--formally opening the session. First in the order of business was the appointment of a Committee to Recheck Credentials.</p>
   <p>The Committee retired immediately, its report to be ready the following morning.</p>
   <p>After a short, tactful address by the president, Censor Przybyszewski took <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>the floor. He spoke with sorrow of the quarrels and scandals which had occurred within the Alliance during the past two years. He talked at length about the well-known case of T. Stan, and the rough treatment this gentleman had received at the hands of the secretary-general. The censor said that he was convinced that the accusations made by Stan were justifiable and that the Alliance's accounts were handled incapably. He said that it was because of the tactlessness of the editor of Zgoda, that a violent newspaper controversy had ensued. Everyone who disagreed with Zgoda was referred to by that paper as a rogue and a traitor. The speaker touched upon the Morgenstern scandal and said that there was little hope of the Alliance's winning its case against his guarantors. Some agreement might have been reached with Morgenstern's guarantors had it not been for Satalecki's obstinacy. He spoke of such legal shortcomings as the lack of bond for officers and the lack of a proper charter, even though he himself, as censor, had recommended the procurement of a charter. He concluded his address with various recommendations to the constitution.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Following him, Vice-censor Helinski, President F. A. Satalecki, and Vice-president Slominski spoke. Secretary-General Mallek's reading of a written report was followed by a speech by Majewski, the treasurer. Satalecki, in his speech, advised that all scandalous matters be laid aside. Slominski's words were directed mostly against T. Stan. Mallek and Majewski spoke with equal sharpness though comparatively calmly; the former spoke of singing and music, to which he devotes his time, while Majewski attacked the censor and the newspapers Echo and Polonia, of Cleveland. Mallek spoke also of the national fund, and Delegate Pulkowski took up the museum and library question.</p>
   <p>Following these speeches, an Auditing Committee was appointed. This Committee consisted of L. Wild, Dowiatt, Poszwinski, Kupfer Schmidt, and Jakinski. The committee to audit Zgoda's accounts consisted of Olszewski, of Detroit, Twarowski, of Nanticoke, and Dewoyno, of Cleveland. Delegates Schreiber, Heurteux, and Czerwinski comprised a committee to attend to Convention correspondence. The meeting was then adjourned until nine o'clock the following morning. Dr. Dunikowski will speak at the next session, and doubtless, other committees will be appointed.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Among the letters read at yesterday's session was one that stated that "all religious fanatics should be hanged!" The assembly protested against the reading of such letters.</p>
   <p>Third Day's Morning Session</p>
   <p>The third day's morning session was called to order by President Lewandowski. Censor Przybyszewski submitted a written report to be included in the minutes. The long discussion which ensued over the acceptance of this report was finally terminated after adoption of a proposal by W. Bardonski that written reports of officers should be accepted.</p>
   <p>The report of the Committee to Recheck Credentials followed. The Committee reached the following decisions: (1) The credentials of delegate T. Stan are in order despite his expulsion from the Alliance by the secretary-general. The secretary-general's act is unconstitutional in that it violates Article I, <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>paragraph one, of the constitution, providing for self-rule of individual groups. Delegate Stan's group still regards him a member. (2) The objections to the credentials of Delegates Blaszka and Mitacki are unfounded. (3) J. Pulkowski cannot be a delegate since he has not been a member of the Alliance for the past two months, having left one group without signing up with another.</p>
   <p>W. Bardonski made a motion that the report be accepted as it stands. A long and bitter debate ensued over the Stan case. Delegates Terczewski and Lisztewnik spoke against the acceptance of Stan as a delegate, while Delegates Magdziarz, Smietanka, Roland, and Czarnecki defended him. Delegate Poszwinski argued that the secretary-general had no right to expel members from the Alliance. Such a right would give him despotic power. Lipinski, chairman of the Committee [to Recheck Credentials] declared that since Stan was a member in good standing with his own group, he therefore had the right to sit as a delegate; that if there were any accusations against him, impeachment proceedings should be instituted. At this point, the discussion became so stormy <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>that President Lewandowski had to rap for order and request that the delegates refrain from shouting.</p>
   <p>As we leave the hall (11:30 A. M.), the discussion continues. Final results in this case will be reported in tomorrow's issue.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 7, 1893.</p>
   <p>Third Day's Afternoon Session</p>
   <p>Delegate Lipinski, chairman of the Committee to Recheck Credentials took the floor three times during the discussion of the Stan case. He said that he had no idea of what had passed between Stan and the secretary-general, but that he was convinced that Stan's credentials were valid and that he ought to be permitted a seat in the Convention. He advised impeachment proceedings to <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>clear up the matter.</p>
   <p>Delegate Lisztewnik insisted that Stan had created so much dissension within the Alliance that he did not deserve a seat. (Cries of "Throw him out!") Pandemonium reigned in the hall; the crowds in the galleries stamped their feet and hissed. After order was again restored, the president administered a sharp rebuke to the offending delegates.</p>
   <p>It was finally decided that, with the exception of Pulkowski's, all credentials be accepted, that is, to accept Stan also as a delegate, but to suspend him immediately until he clears himself of the charges made against him (the secretary-general has not as yet made any formal accusations before the Convention).</p>
   <p>Since the hour was already late, the Convention was adjourned until three o'clock <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Dr. Dunikowski's Speech</p>
   <p>After carrying a motion that the hall be cleared of all who were not delegates, the assembly proceeded to name a committee to report the Convention's proceedings to the American press. Mr. J. F. Smulski, Casimir Zychlinski, and Thaddeus Wild were named to this committee.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Petitions and Correspondence reported. The chairman turned over the petitions and letters to the secretary, asking him to read them. In one letter, Group 188 of Chicago protested the questioning of the credentials of one of their delegates, Blaszka. Since the matter had already been attended to, the protest was tabled. A petition from Group 160 of Philadelphia made a motion that the one-cent assessment be abolished. The petition suggested also that Zgoda, the Alliance's official organ, devote less of its columns to <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>polemics and more to enlightenment. The petition was referred to the Constitutional Committee (not yet appointed).</p>
   <p>A plea for financial aid and moral support from the Polish Day Financial Committee was read. A long discussion began concerning the amount of money the Convention ought to appropriate for the Polish Day cause. Dr. Statkiewicz, of La Salle, made a motion that three hundred dollars be assigned for this purpose. C. Zychlinski, of Chicago, argued for five hundred dollars. On the other hand, S. Lauferski, also of Chicago, insisted that no more than a hundred dollars be appropriated. Delegate Smietanka spoke of the importance of Polish Day and asked that the Alliance be generous.</p>
   <p>At the request of the chairman, further discussion of this question was postponed.</p>
   <p>A letter from the Central Committee in charge of Polish-American participation <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>in the Kosciusko Exposition at Lwow [Poland] was read. Secretary Kosak's reading of the letter was so inarticulate that--the chairman took it from him and read it himself. Numerous voices demanded that this correspondence be rejected.</p>
   <p>Without attending to the Lwow Exposition question, the Convention returned to the Polish Day question on a motion by W. Bardonski. Delegate Satalecki spoke in favor of supporting the project, saying that it concerned not only Chicago Poles, but Poles throughout America. Delegate Kosak reminded the gathering that even the Negroes had had their "Day," and that it would be a disgrace if the Poles remained in the background. Dr. Statkiewicz withdrew his motion. Delegate Chrzanowski proposed that one-hundred-fifty dollars be given to the Polish Day Financial Committee, and that two-hundred-fifty dollars be used to represent the Alliance in the celebration. The motion was seconded. On a motion by L. Szopinski, debate on the subject was closed and Chrzanowski's proposition was put to a vote. The proposition was carried. Thus, a total of four hundred dollars was appropriated for the Polish Day celebration.</p>
   <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>
   <p>Participation in the Lwow Exposition was next in the order of business. Some delegates, among whom was the chairman himself, were dissatisfied with the [Central] Committee. Some asked for a plan of the Exposition; others advised that the matter be attended to by the Central Administration [of the Alliance]. On Delegate Bardonski's suggestion, Dr. Dunikowski took the floor. He was introduced by the chairman amidst thunderous applause. In his lengthy address, Dr. Dunikowski touched upon many important matters. He wished the Convention success and expressed his pleasure at being able to attend it. He spoke of improving relationships between Poland and American Polonia.... It was for this purpose that he had been sent to America by a group of patriots, behind whom stood all the people of Poland. He spoke next of the Alliance's constitution, terming it worthwhile and idealistic, but he suggested that the Alliance adhere more closely to its principles. It had pained him to hear words against our churches expressed by the highest officer [of the Convention]. "What will happen to our people", he said, "if we deprive them of the church? And our youth?" The speaker said that he knew a certain Pole who enjoyed enormous <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>popularity. His wife was Polish; yet his children spoke not a word of the Polish language. The speaker also said that he knew certain Poles, members of the Alliance, who should better forget their Polish origin. "Such members ought to withdraw from the Alliance", he said, "for they disgrace its name." (Thunderous applause.)</p>
   <p>Touching upon the labor problem, he advised that we should organize legally and that we should avoid internationalist radicals.....(Great applause.) He had been grieved on reading the demand for government supervision of our schools in the last issue of Zgoda. "We do not need the government in this case"; he said, "we ourselves can best take care of our schools; We ourselves can best improve them." (Applause.) Dr. Dunikowski concluded his beautiful address with a description of the Lwow Exposition [of 1894.]</p>
   <p>Delegate Rudzinski spoke eloquently in favor of the Lwow Exposition, saying that it was a Polish exposition and all Poles should participate. Gryglaszewski, <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>Satalecki, and Poszwinski also spoke on this question. Delegate Machek, a member of Zana Society [Chicago], severely criticized Dr. Dunikowski. A violent commotion arose in the hall and in the galleries, during which a large number of delegates left the hall. The speaker's discourse was interrupted while the chairman rapped for order. The chair allowed Machek to continue.</p>
   <p>The speaker said that Dr. Dunikowski wore his cloak on both shoulders, that he consorted with Poles from the other camp. (General laughter.) He concluded by saying that the former delegate of the Polish magnates had promised much, but had accomplished little.</p>
   <p>Another delegate asked if Dr. Dunikowski had produced his credentials as a delegate. Gryglaszewski and Satalecki answered that Dr. Dunikowski's credentials were perfectly in order; as a matter of fact, his name alone gave him the right to speak at the Convention. The chairman then gave the floor to Dr. Dunikowski who, in a few words, answered all the charges that had been made <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>against him. He said that he did not come to this country especially to visit the Polish National Alliance but to visit the Poles in general, that the work he was engaged in could not be done in one day, and that the future would show whether he would accomplish anything. (Thunderous applause.) The president of the Convention proposed that the delegates do honor to Dr. Dunikowski by rising. With the exception of five dissenters, everyone arose.</p>
   <p>Several delegates then spoke on the importance of Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition. Delegate Poszwinski [Chicago] donated twenty-five dollars to the cause. Following this, on a motion by Delegate Terczewski [Chicago], a resolution appropriating five hundred dollars toward the cost of erecting a Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition, was passed.</p>
   <p>Further correspondence included an invitation to a play to be given by the Alexander Fredro Dramatic Society on September 10. Delegates will be admitted <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>free. The invitation was accepted.</p>
   <p>Delegate Stefanowicz made a motion that the constitution be read to the Convention, so that necessary amendments might be made. The motion was carried and the session adjourned.</p>
   <p>Fourth Day's Morning Session</p>
   <p>The fourth day's morning session was opened by President Lewandowski. Following the reading and acceptance of the minutes, letters and telegrams were read. One letter proposed the candidacy of A. Brzostowski, Warsaw author, for editor of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>Following the reading of correspondence, the chairman announced the results of collections taken up for the benefit of the Polish-American exhibit at the Lwow <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>Kosciusko Exposition of 1894. The total sum collected was $65.65.</p>
   <p>The president then named a committee to examine the charges against Group 212 ( White Eagle Society of Detroit, part of the congregation of the apostate Kolasinski). This committee consisted of M. Welzant, of Baltimore, W. Mroz and F. Lella, of Minneapolis, and J. F. Smulski and A. Zdzieblowski, of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Revision of the constitution was next in the order of business. The constitution was read to the assembly by J. J. Chrzanowski. Paragraphs one, two, and three of Article I were passed without change. Paragraph four provides for the office of censor. A number of delegates demanded that this office be abolished. Among these were L. Szopinski, Roland, Sowadzki, Bardonski, and Zychlinski. Others, as delegate Kosak, objected to the title of censor, asking that it should be replaced by some other title more in keeping with the spirit of the Poles. Delegate Terczewski spoke for retention of the office, but asked that the duties connected with it be more strictly defined. Delegates <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>Grabarkiewicz, Lipinski, and others spoke for unconditional retention of the office. Turmoil reigned again until the chairman restored order. The question was put to a vote by a roll call. About eighty delegates voted for retention of the office of censor; a little over forty voted for its abolition. Thus, the office will remain.</p>
   <p>Delegate Chranowski read paragraph five of Article I, dealing with the charter. Delegate Terczewski demanded that the Central Administration explain the matter of the charter, for many delegates maintained that the Polish National Alliance did not have a proper charter. Delegate Lipinski asked that this document be read to the assembly. Delegate Czarnecki demanded an explanation of the matter by the Central Administration and the censor. The censor explained that he had taken out a charter for the Alliance in the State of Michigan. President Satalecki's explanation of the Central Administration's position in the matter was quite interesting.</p>
   <p>The president revealed that although the Alliance existed and operated under <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>the name of "Polish National Alliance", its charter, taken out many years ago, was granted to it under its original name of "Polish Benevolent Association". "It is this irregularity", said the president, "that has complicated the case against Morgenstern's guarantors, which case, as a result, will probably be lost." At any rate, such is Satalecki's opinion. The matter was muddled further when, on May 6, 1892, a commission engaged in framing a new constitution took out a charter for the "Polish National Alliance." The members of this commission were F. Bieszke, T. Wild, J. Slowikowski, S. Terczewski, M. Drzemala, A. Blaszczynski, J. Blociszewski, Pikulski, and Dowiatt. When we left the hall (11:15 A. M.), a stormy discussion was in progress. Details will appear in tommorow's issue.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 8, 1893.</p>
   <p>Continuing the discussion of the charter question, T. Wild, acting as spokes-man for the [1892 constitutional] commission, explained why it had taken out <a name="p28" class="page-break">28</a>the charter. In a solemn voice, he asserted that certain enemies of the Alliance, members of a [Polish Roman Catholic] Union society, had intentions of stealing the Alliance's valuable name by incorporating their society as the "Polish National Alliance". Delegate Wild forgot to mention the name of this insidious society. Delegate Beczkiewicz asked why the commission had not informed the Central Administration of the danger that threatened; why it had not sought the Central Administration's advice. The reply was evasive.</p>
   <p>The chairman read a telegram from Mr. McDowell, president of the Liberty Bell committee, placing the bell at the Alliance's disposal during the Polish Day celebration. Delegate Szopinski made a motion that the president appoint a committee of three to thank Mr. McDowell personally. It was finally decided to send him a telegram of thanks.</p>
   <p>Delegate Szopinski then moved that the new administration be instructed to <a name="p29" class="page-break">29</a>attend to the charter immediately. He further asked the Central Administration if taking out a new charter would in any way affect the case against Morgenstern's guarantors. Chairman Gryglaszewski, so well informed on all subjects, answered for the Administration. He said that a new charter could not be taken out until the Morgenstern case was settled, that the old [1892] charter would have to be cancelled. With this, debate on the charter question was closed. Article I of the constitution was thus accepted without change.</p>
   <p>An enlivened discussion arose over Article II. Delegate Chrzanowski read a beautifully written article on the aims and purposes of the Alliance and moved that it be incorporated in the constitution. The motion was not carried. Delegate Bobrowski moved that the words "establishing necessary institutions" be changed to "supporting....." Delegate Szopinski suggested "establishing and supporting....." Delegate Kuflewski moved that "institutions" be qualified by the word "Polish". Delegate Helinski moved that establishment of libraries and promotion of lectures be included among the aims and purposes <a name="p30" class="page-break">30</a>of the Alliance. All of the amendments to the original motion were accepted.</p>
   <p>Then followed a motion by Delegate Rydlewicz that a provision be adopted requiring all Alliance members to send their children to Polish schools. (Great commotion; cries of, "Unnecessary! Religious fanatics!") When order was finally restored, Delegate Rydlewicz regained the floor and shouted: "You have given proof of your patriotism, gentlemen!"</p>
   <p>Vice-president Slominski informed the assembly that an Alliance school had already been established in Holy Trinity parish, and that this school would produce capable citizens. "The pastor of this parish [Reverend C. Sztuczko], who is in sympathy with the Alliance, will help establish Alliance schools in other communities," he said, adding that the Alliance hopes to build a high school next year. With whose money? No one knows.</p>
   <p>Upon further reading of the constitution, a number of voices protested against <a name="p31" class="page-break">31</a>the article on drunkenness. The majority, however, voted to retain it. With this, the session was adjourned until two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Fourth Day's Afternoon and Evening Sessions</p>
   <p>At the opening of the afternoon session, the president of the Convention announced that from this session on the names of all absent delegates would be published in Zgoda, so that the groups might know how their delegates attended to business. The roll was called and a record made of the absentees.</p>
   <p>An evening session, which adjourned at 10 P. M., was also held.</p>
   <a name="p32" class="page-break">32</a>
   <p>Fifth Day's Morning, Afternoon, and Evening Sessions</p>
   <p>After the roll call, reading of the constitution continued. During the course of the morning session, the secretary-general's salary was raised to twelve hundred dollars a year, and the treasurer's to two hundred dollars a year.</p>
   <p>At the afternoon session, it was decided that death benefit payments be as follows: for the death of a member, six hundred dollars; for the death of the wife of a member, three hundred dollars. The one-cent assessment was abolished. A motion for the purchase of a printing press was carried. The evening session appropriated four thousand dollars for the complete outfitting of a printing shop. The Central Administration was instructed to make use of these funds within the course of one year. It was also decided that Zgoda [official organ of the Polish National Alliance] be prohibited from devoting more than one column of each issue to announcements of meetings. A motion was passed barring scandalous articles, and another motion, instructing the editors of Zgoda to print news of Congressional activities, was also passed.</p>
   <a name="p33" class="page-break">33</a>
   <p>Three hundred dollars was appropriated for the Alliance school in Holy Trinity parish [Chicago].</p>
   <p>Sixth and Last Day's Sessions</p>
   <p>The Auditing Committee presented a report to the effect that the accounts of the Alliance had been very incapably handled and that receipts for many expenditures were missing. The morning session was consumed in the debates that followed.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 11, 1893.</p>
   <p>In a vote by ballot, Cleveland, Ohio, was decided upon as the location of the next Convention. The afternoon session occupied itself principally with the election of officers. The administration, in accordance with a motion previously passed, will consist of the censor, vice-censor, and the board of directors (Central Administration), which will include the president, two vice-presidents, the treasurer, and an auditing commission of three. The secretary-general will <a name="p34" class="page-break">34</a>no longer be a member of the Central Administration. His duties will be limited to bookkeeping, and he may not have more than one hundred dollars in cash on hand at any time. He may not pay out any money without the consent of the auditing commission. Helinski, of Duluth, was elected censor; Lewandowski, of Cleveland, vice-censor; Satalecki, of Detroit, president; S. Slominski and W. Bardonski, of Chicago, vice-presidents; M. Majewski, treasurer; K. Mallek, of Milwaukee, secretary; and J. F. Smulski, K. Smietanka, and A. Groenwald, all of Chicago, members of the auditing commission. F. Jablonski, of Chicago, was elected editor of Zgoda by a large majority of votes.</p>
   <p>At the evening session, J. J. Chrzanowski was elected treasurer of Zgoda at a salary of three hundred dollars a year. S. Nicki was elected librarian, and one thousand dollars was appropriated for the upkeep of the library (including librarian's salary) during the next two years.</p>
