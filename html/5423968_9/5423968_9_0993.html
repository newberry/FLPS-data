   <p>The City Council of Chicago desires that the Fourth of July, Independence Day, be celebrated more impressively this year than at any time before. Naturally--this being Exposition year--the holiday should be observed with special solemnity. The originators of the idea want the Fourth to be called Liberty Bell Day, and to celebrate it with appropriate ceremony at the World's Fair. The Fourth of July program, as yet incomplete, includes a parade of civil and military organizations and school children, music, the dedication of the new Columbian Liberty Bell, etc.</p>
   <p>Even if only a part of this program is carried out, it will be as important a day as October 21 [sic] of last year [400th anniversary of the discovery of America]. One of the features of the program will be a parade of organizations. In our opinion, Polish organizations should participate, especially uniformed organizations, on condition that such participation would not produce the breaches and dissensions that occurred during the last parade.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The participation of all organizations, including Polish, is invited by Alderman M. B. Madden in the following letter:</p>
   <p>"To all civil, military, mutual benefit, and other organizations in the city of Chicago:</p>
   <p>"The Chicago City Council has decided that the celebration of Independence Day will be conducted at the World's Fair under the sponsorship of the City of Chicago. A committee, appointed by the mayor, has already determined the general character of the celebration. It is the earnest desire of the committee that all civil, military, mutual benefit, and other organizations participate in this celebration and by their presence help to observe the anniversary of our national independence. As president, I hereby invite all those interested to take part. Shortage of time prevents me from sending individual invitations to each organization. For further information, please communicate with me at room 320, Chamber of Commerce, and I shall be glad to give further details.</p>
   <p>Martin B. Madden"</p>

   <p>Such is Mr. Madden's invitation. It has attracted not only our attention. Stephen Terczewski, captain of the second "Polish Krakus" company, called upon us today and asked that we urge Polish uniformed societies to take part in the parade. Since, in our opinion, Mr. Terczewski's suggestions are entirely in order, we are complying with his request.</p>
   <p>Because of the short time left for preparation, Mr. Terczewski suggests that the officers of all such societies meet together to make necessary arrangements. The officers of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish societies could meet at the School Hall, while those of St. Adalbert's could meet at F. Zwierzynski's home. Representatives of Bridgeport and Town of Lake societies could come to the St. Adalbert's conference.</p>
   <p>Mr. Terczewski's idea has our fullest approbation. We believe that the officers of military societies, not only from the above-mentioned sections <span class="page-break">4</span>of Chicago but from South Chicago as well, will accept the plan willingly and will achieve the desired results.</p>
