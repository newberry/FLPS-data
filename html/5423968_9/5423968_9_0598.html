   <p>A great Polish manifestation is drawing near. All Polish patriotic societies will participate in the pilgrimage to the local Kosciuszko's monument, on that great American holiday, Decoration Day, May thirtieth. This national holiday is observed by visiting the cemeteries, and by the parades of war veterans and military societies, who will march to the monuments of merited leaders, to place wreaths of flowers.</p>
   <p>On that traditionally observed day, the people of this country pay homage to all outstanding and deserving countrymen, especially to those who have fallen in the last civil war, and in the great world war. In these and other wars much Polish blood has been shed for the good of this country, which fact, even early Polish immigrants were trying to emphasize by their yearly piligrimages to the monument of Kosciuszko at West Point.</p>
   <p>In later years years the pilgrimages to West Point were forbidden by authorities of of that institution; but, this year we intend to renew that worthy tradition by directing our national manifestation to the monument of Kosciuszko, in Humboldt Park. This, and subsequent manifestations, may prove of great patriotic and political importance.</p>

   <p>Beginning with the current year, the 30th of May will become a great Polish national holiday, especially in those cities that have a monument of Kosciuszko. On this day, we, the American-Poles, as citizens of the United States, shall manifest our political standing, our readiness to make any sacrifices for our adopted Fatherland; and we shall do it very eloquently-by recalling the memory of the noble Kosciuszko.</p>
   <p>On the 30th of May, when all the United States are worshiping the memory of their greatest men with Kosciuszko in the first rank restanding beneath his monument, we could honor him in silent reverence - but instead, shall say fervently; "Behold the man whose foot-steps we most ardently desire to follow!"</p>
   <p>The Kosciuszko monuments in America, shall have for us the meaning of that biblical, fiery pillar of the way-side which points out the straight road to duty.</p>
