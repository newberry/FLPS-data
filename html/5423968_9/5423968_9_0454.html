   <p>On Sunday May 6, the announced celebration of the one-hundred-and-twenty-sixth anniversary of the Constitution of the Third of May took place at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall, corner of Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Street. The celebration was held by Commune III of the Polish National Alliance and was a success in every respect. The hall was crowded with interested and attentive people as was shown by the quiet they maintained while the numbers of the program were in progress.</p>
   <p>The president of Commune III, Leon Nowak, welcomed the audience in a short, sincere speech, and thanked them for being present in such numbers. He then called upon Judge Joseph LaBuy to act as chairman and the undersigned to act as secretary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Chairman LaBuy immediately opened the program by calling on the Dudziarz Chorus, under the direction of Professor R. Henzel, to sing "Marsz Zvawow" (March of the Zuaves). The choir sang this number in such finished style that it was forced by the enthusiastic applause of the audience to give an encore.</p>
   <p>The address by Reverend W. Zapala, rector of St. Stanislaus Kostka College, was so strong, so thoroughly patriotic, and made such a strong impression on the audience, that the applause continued for a very long time after he had finished speaking.</p>
   <p>The speaker mentioned the merits of a man whom we all know well, a man who is not only known to the Poles, but to people of other nationalities as well--Ignace Paderewski. He also stated that we owe our respect and recognition to the President of the United States, Mr. Wilson, who at such <span class="page-break">3</span>a critical time did not hesitate to speak the truth when he said that the Poles deserve not a partial Poland, but a whole, free, sovereign, and autonomous Poland.</p>
   <p>Misses A. M. Jankowski and H. Szafranski sang a duet, "Kiedy Gwiazdy Jasno Swieca" (When the Stars Shine Brightly), very well and were forced to make another appearance.</p>
   <p>Miss A. Wieczorowski played a piano solo exceptionally well and was forced to give an encore.</p>
   <p>The speech by Mr. T. M. Helinski brought forth enthusiastic applause. The speaker exhorted the audience to give generously for Polish relief, explaining that in comparison with our brothers and sisters we find ourselves <span class="page-break">4</span>in a much better position at present than our people suffering in the homeland.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Czuwara recited a patriotic poem with great verve and was forced to give an encore.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, well known from previous performances, sang "Moj Kwiatek" (My Flower), accompanied on the piano by Miss A. Wieczorowski. She sang with such charm that she was called back repeatedly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leon Szall played a violin solo, to the piano accompaniment of Miss Eleanor Ball, and was forced to give an encore. The monologue given by Miss M. Jakowanis so entertained the audience that she was forced to give another monologue, which was even funnier than the first.</p>
   <p>The singing of the Dudziarz Chorus in their second appearance with the <span class="page-break">5</span>participation of Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch and Miss Josephine Wachowiak, bookkeeper of the Polish Women's Alliance of America, was so well done that the number had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>The collection taken up by Misses K. Zeglen, M. Zwierkowski, J. Sykta, M. Soder, K. Idzikowski, and A. Ankowski, yielded $49.05.</p>
   <p>In conclusion everyone joined in the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>The committee expresses its sincere thanks to the speakers, recitationists, singers, conductors, and the audience, and asks them to continue coming to its gatherings, for through these meetings we remind ourselves, and especially our young people, of our unfortunate Poland, soaked with the blood of the <span class="page-break">6</span>innocent.</p>
   <p>(Signed) L. Kadow, secretary.</p>
