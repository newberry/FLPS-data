   <p>The national celebration in Saint Adalbert's Parochial Hall, held yesterday, was very beautiful and impressive. The Saint Florian Krakus Society entered the beautifully decorated hall at seven-thirty o'clock in the evening, and was greeted by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The president of the celebration committee explained the meaning of the celebration, and called on the Reverend J. Radziejewski to act as chairman, and Mr. Leon J. Schultz as secretary. The program followed.</p>
   <p>The orchestra played a march. The parochial choir sang a beautiful cantata that entranced everybody. Miss Muchowska sang the solo.</p>
   <p>Then Reverend Paul Rhode, pastor of Saints Peter and Paul Church, spoke about the meaning of the Constitution of the Third of May. The Constitution raised high the idea of freedom. It established the Catholic religion in the country; <span class="page-break">\2</span>it helped the peasants; it freed the lowest class of Poles. The motto of the Constitution is the motto, which should motivate our lives always--"God and Fatherland!"</p>
   <p>Miss M. Danysz recited a poem "A Prayer For Poland," and was liberally rewarded by applause. The orchestra rendered "Cavatina," from the opera "Belizar". Then Mr. W. Wachowski, a trustee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, spoke, urging all Poles to live in peace and be steadfast to our faith; he condemned agitators and troublemakers.</p>
   <p>The young Severyn Kujawski, a son of the organist of the Saint Adalbert Parish, played the piano. W. Adamczyk recited a poem entitled "Boleslaw Chrobry." He is a student of the Saint Adalbert school.</p>
   <p>Other musical numbers followed. The cornet solo with orchestra was excellent, and the audience applauded vigorously. S. Kujawski and M. Muchowska played a four-hand piece on the piano, and they were forced to repeat it.</p>

   <p>Mr. Clemens Bielinski, the president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union was then called on to speak.</p>
   <p>He expressed satisfaction, that we, although in a strange country, are not being lost to our native country, that we are remaining true, and that we are working and improving ourselves. He pointed out that the future of the Poles in America lies in the hands of the young. He exhorted them to remain steadfast in our faith and language, and showed how we can avoid becoming expatriated.</p>
   <p>After this speech, a young student of the Saint Adalbert Parochial School, Anna Syks, recited a part of "Pan Tadeusz" very nicely. The orchestra rendered Donireti's a part of "Pan Tadeusz" very nicely. The orchestra rendered Donireti's "Overture" beautifully.</p>
