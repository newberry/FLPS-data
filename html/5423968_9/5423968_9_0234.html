   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization (Organizacya Patryotyczna) will make its first public appearance at the school hall near Bradley Street, at 7:30, Sunday evening, April 9. Dziennik [Chicagoski] has written time and again of the noble aims and remarkable growth of this society, which attempts to satisfy the cultural and national needs of American Polonia. The forthcoming activities sponsored by the Organization--scouts, Falcons, choirs, dramatic circles, etc.--should attract throngs of people. It will give the public a good opportunity to get acquainted with the aims of the Organization and with the measures it takes to attain them. Thus it is possible that, on seeing the Organization in action, many more people will become members, to work for our common good and for the good of our mother country.</p>
   <p>The program will be one of great variety. To begin with, the parish choir will sing the hymn "Prayer," following which Father Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, will deliver an address on Polish history and the aims of the Patriotic Organization.</p>
   <p>The net profit resulting from the affair will be donated to the parish library. This noble purpose will undoubtedly draw a considerable audience.</p>
