   <p>"Dear Countrymen! The American national holiday, Decoration Day or Memorial Day, falls on May 30, just a few days hence. On this day the people honor the memory of the soldiers who died fighting for the preservation and freedom of these United States by decorating their graves. They are also reminded of their courage and sacrifices. In fact, it is a very important national holiday.</p>
   <p>"At such time, so important and memorable, we also--although only adopted children of this great commonwealth--should add our prayers to those of the natives, and together with them honor the memory of those who bravely fought for the freedom of their country.</p>
   <p>"It was customary for us, in the years gone by, to participate in the beautiful and imposing celebrations on Decoration Day. We will certainly do so again this year.</p>
   <p>"I am therefore making this appeal to the Polish military societies. This is their most important duty. They should join other groups--American or of other nationalities--and parade to the cemeteries or commemorate the day in any other worthy manner. It would be most proper to decorate the graves of the veterans of the last war in the Polish-Bohemian cemetery.</p>
   <p>"In order to discuss this matter, I am calling upon the representatives of all Polish military societies in Chicago to attend a meeting at the bank hall in the old Saint Stanislaus Kostka school building (adjoining the church on Noble, corner of Bradley Street), to be held Wednesday, May 20, at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
   <p>"I hope nobody will be missing and that we will satisfactorily perform our civic and sentimental duty.</p>
   
   <p>In the name of the G. A. R.</p>
   <p>(Grand Army of the Republic)</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa."</p>
   <p>We endorse the appeal made by Mr. Kiolbassa most heartily.</p>
