   <p>Wednesday's deliberations were concerned with the plan of a new constitution for the organization, which would establish a Women's Auxiliary under the chairmanship of a vice-president and would provide for a woman director on the board of directors, who would represent the Women's Auxiliary. The constitution would obligate the members to practice their religion, and the groups under the direction of their spiritual adviser would be charged with seeing to it that this obligation was carried out.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was rather stormy. The constitution committee continued the discussion of the proposed changes. The spiritual advisers were to be accorded the competence of directors and a voice in all matters. They were to protect the religious character and the morality of the society. Also, they were to take part in the preparations of the convention committee.</p>
   <p>An important change, was the addition of a paragraph stating that the board of directors should have the power to remove an officer from the board by a <span class="page-break">\2</span>majority vote, if he had not fulfilled his duties.</p>
   <p>The deficit in the treasury necessitated increasing the tax rate by twenty-five per cent. The new rate will be put into effect on January 1, 1915.</p>
   <p>The committee on resolutions submitted two resolutions. The first asserted the marked denominational character of the organization, declared against religious toleration, declared the organization's loyalty to the United States, and praised the conservative governmental policies of the present president. Finally, passing on to the present war, it pledged a certain monthly sum for the purposes of the Polish National Council and turned to the American people, asking them to help in the rebirth of an independent Poland by lending their moral support.</p>
   <p>The second resolution was an expression of thanks to the convention Committee, to the Poles of Chicago, to Bishop Paul Rhode, and to the clergy who had taken part in the services.</p>
   <p>These resolutions were adopted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In accordance with the first resolution, at the motion of Dr. Wagner, a onecent monthly tax was passed for the benefit of the National Council. The collection taken up among the delegates yielded $46.36. It was then resolved to raise this amount to $100 by making up the difference out of the treasury of the Society and to give this entire sum to the National Council.</p>
   <p>Earlier, it was voted to print rituals for the groups and to publish an official monthly organ.</p>
   <p>After the constitution was accepted, a discussion was carried on as to who should print the monthly.</p>
   <p>The matter of the officers' salaries produced the greatest storm. It was decided that the president will continue to receive $200, the secretary $1,600 annually, the treasurer $200 annually, local directors $25, directors from outside of the city the same plus four cents per mile, and the spiritual counselor $25.</p>
   <p>At Thursday's morning session telegrams were read from Bishop Kozlowski, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Polish Women's Alliance, and the Polish Alma Mater; Mr. Gonski, legal adviser, gave his report; and the suggestion of the board which made Bishop Kozlowski honorary president was passed.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected at the afternoon session: Mr. Grutza was re-elected president, Mr. Czaplewski vice-president, Mrs. Sawicka of Milwaukee vice-president, Mr. Francis Koceja secretary general, and Mr. Celichowski treasurer.</p>
   <p>The following directors were elected: John Janowiak, Francis Belka, W. Ronkowiak--all of Chicago--and John Kantak, Anna Rozploch, and Anna Peksa of Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wasielewski was elected chief medical adviser, since Dr. Wagner refused the nomination. Reverend Kielpinski was elected spiritual adviser.</p>
   <p>After lengthy deliberations, the parish of St. Stanislaus in Milwaukee was chosen as the place of the next convention.</p>
   <p>Then a collection of $28.50 was made for St. Hedwig's Orphanage.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>After Reverend Goral swore in the new officers and delivered an appropriate address, the convention was adjourned at 6:35 P. M. with the singing of "God save Poland."</p>
