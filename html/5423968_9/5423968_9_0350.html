   <p>The Polish Roman Catholic Union will play host to the public next Tuesday night at Walsh's Hall, corner Noble and Emma Streets. The occasion will be the first annual ball.</p>
   <p>The date, co-incidentally, is the birthday both of Kosciuszko, and our own Abe Lincoln, it is, therefore, expected that the public will be in a festive mood and will attend the party en masse.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the affair promises an unusual program, never hitherto witnessed in Chicago; and the promise of Mr. Chonarzewski and his committee is always fulfilled faithfully, and even beyond expectations.</p>
