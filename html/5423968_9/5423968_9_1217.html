   <p>The fourth convention of the Polish National Council of America opened yesterday morning. The delegates, numbering about sixty, gathered at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Building at about 9:30 A. M. From there they went to Holy Innocents Church on Armour and Superior Streets to hear Mass.</p>
   <p>At ten o'clock, Mass was celebrated at the Church by the Reverend F. Ostrowski, pastor of St. Josephat's Church, assisted by the Reverends J. Mszanowski, chaplain, as deacon, and B. Kasprzycki, vicar at Holy Innocents Church, as subdeacon. The Reverend T. Langford, pastor of St. Valentine's Church, was master of ceremonies. In the presbytery was Bishop Paul Rhode, accompanied by the Reverends A. Gorski of Amsterdam, New York, and A. Ignasiak of Erie, Pennsylvania. The Reverends B. Goral, of Milwaukee, and S. Bubacz, Karabasz, and S. Szczepanski, were also present.</p>
   <p>The sermon was delivered by the Reverend John Zwierzchowski, pastor of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Holy Innocents Church.</p>
   <p>After the church services, the delegates returned to the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall, where, at eleven o'clock, Dr. K. Wagner, president of the Polish National Council of America, called the first session to order. Before naming a credentials committee, the chairman asked Bishop Paul Rhode to say a few words. Bishop Rhode was given a tremendous ovation, and was again applauded after an address of some length in which he explained the aims of the National Council and its tasks in the future.</p>
   <p>Following the Bishop's address, Dr. Wagner appointed a credentials committee, consisting of J. Golata, Joseph Hajdysz, and Catharine Rutkowski. The session was then adjourned until two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Afternoon Session</p>
   <p>The afternoon session opened at a few minutes after two o'clock. After the <span class="page-break">\3</span>invocation, temporary officers were chosen. Dr. Smykowski was unanimously elected chairman and T. Blachowski secretary. The chairman then made a short speech advocating reforms, in order that the work of the National Council be more efficient than it has been in the past. Committees were then named as follows:</p>
   <p>Development Committee: the Reverends Ignasiak and Zwierzchowski, N. L. Piotrowski, T. Ligman, and Mrs. Krenz.</p>
   <p>Resolutions Committee: the Reverends B. Goral and A. Gorski, Z. Stefanowilz and Kukulski.</p>
   <p>Press Committee: the Reverend Oembinski, [J.] Jankowski, and W. Poblocki.</p>
   <p>The Polish press was represented at the Convention as follows: F. Szczerbowski for Dziennik Zwiazkowy, K. Piatkiewicz for Dziennik Narodowy, T. Lasecki for Dziennik Chicagoski, W. Poblocki for Nowiny Z Milwaukee (News From Milwaukee), <span class="page-break">\4</span>and Mrs. Iza Pobog for Przewodnik Katolicki (The Catholic Leader), of New Britain, Connecticut.</p>
   <p>Officers' reports were then in order. Reports were presented by Dr. K. Wagner, president, P. Rostenkowski, vice president, Francis Barc, secretary, and the treasurer, Glodzich. The last report showed that the National Council's cash in the banks totaled $9,580.03. The Reverend B. Celichowski, Chaplain and scout master had no report to present. He imformed the delegates that immediately after the decision to form a scout division was made the matter was forgotten and there were no candidates. No press and publicity committee report was presented; S. Adamkiewicz presented a short local committee report. There was also no report from the Citizens' School Committee. On behalf of the financial committee, J. Jankowski read the report which was accepted, since it agreed with the reports of the secretary and the treasurer.</p>
   <p>In the matter of the publication, Free Poland, there was no report, for those who were to have made it are at present in Washington. Dr. Wagner explained <span class="page-break">\5</span>that at the last minute, the administration was informed that the National Council is three months in arrears in its payments for this publication, and he made a motion that the matter be referred to the new administration.</p>
   <p>There was practically no interruption in the regular business, for the delegates decided to forego questioning of the president, the scouting committee, and the local committees. Only the financial committee was questioned in reference to the losses suffered by the failure of the Fidelity State Bank. The matter was satisfactorily explained. The treasurer said that the loss affected only the operating capital and not the funds designated for Polish national work.</p>
   <p>The Press committee then presented a short report with a few suggestions. It advised that the greatest possible activity be undertaken for the benefit of the national committees and for the collection of contributions for relief of Polish war victims. After this report, a recess of fifteen minutes was declared. However, at the moment when the delegates were about to leave, <span class="page-break">\6</span>Wronski's military band arrived and played a few Polish songs.</p>
   <p>Evening Session</p>
   <p>The evening session opened at 6:45 P.M. The Reverend Ignasiak, as chairman of the development committee, read that committee's recommendations, which were as follows:</p>
   <p>1) That the administration of the Polish National Council distribute circulars in the Polish parishes concerning collections to be taken up at church services, which collections are to be turned over to the treasurer of the Polish National Council.</p>
   <p>2) That parish committees already in existence but not affiliated with the National Council be solicited for membership, and that where there are no committees, they be organized without delay.</p>
   <p>3) That all the operating expenses of the National Council be covered <span class="page-break">\7</span>by income.</p>
   <p>4) That local committees work out a plan by which they can send delegates to the National Council.</p>
   <p>The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>The next decision concerned the allocation of funds in the banks, which was left for the new administration. A motion was made that conventions be held every two years, but after a lengthy discussion, it was withdrawn.</p>
   <p>It was decided to request Bishop Rhode to address a circular to Polish parishes and to Polish Catholic organizations that they send in money to the treasurer of the National Council.</p>
   <p>A motion concerning the appointment of a budget committee was withdrawn, because the delegates believed that such an action might cause discontent, for <span class="page-break">\8</span>here only salaries of officers of the Council are concerned.</p>
   <p>The matter of scouting, to which the Polish Roman Catholic Union subscribed five thousand dollars, was left for the new administration to consider.</p>
   <p>The chairman then named an election committee, whose task was to nominate candidates for office. The committee consisted of delegates [J.] Czekala, Kiolbasa, and Mrs. Klawiter. A new constitution committee was also appointed. This committee is to present a new constitution to the next convention of the National Council. The committee consists of Z. Stefanowicz, editor of Narod Polski, Delegate Glodzich, Mrs. Szopinski of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Delegate Golat, and the Reverend Langford.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that the next convention of the Polish National Council should be held in October, 1919, the exact date and place to be decided by the new administration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>New Method of Electing Officers</p>
   <p>Election of a new administration was conducted in such a way that the candidates nominated by the committee for that purpose were accepted without question. The condidates who were proposed by the committee and elected by the delegates are as follows:</p>
   <p>Bishop Paul Rhode, chaplain; Assistant chaplain (local), the Reverend J. Zwierzchowski; assistant chaplain (for the East), the Reverend A. Gorski; N. L. Piotrowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, president; F. Kiolbasa of Milwaukee, first vice president; Mrs. Catharine Rutkowski, second vice president; Delegate Glodzich, secretary; John Czekala, Treasurer; T. Blachowski, Zdanowicz, and A. Plocinski, directors; Felix Gorski, chairman of the local committee; Z. Stefanowicz, chairman of the press committee; the Reverend T. Langford, chairman of the scout committee; J. Jankowski, Leon Zamorski, and Mrs. Frances Neuman, financial committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Delegate Adam Kiewicz arose to protest against this method of electing officers, saying that under such a system, a political clique and not the delegates elect officers. His protest was fruitless.</p>
   <p>In behalf of his committee, the Reverend Gorski read the resolutions, which were accepted unanimously.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to send a telegram to President Wilson. This matter was placed in the hands of the convention's officers.</p>
   <p>After the oath of office was administered to the new administration, the fourth annual convention of the Polish National Council of America adjourned with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
