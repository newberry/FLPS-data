   <p>There will be another great celebration in the South Chicago 'Polonia," the silver jubilee of St. Magdalene's Parish, on Feb. 9, 1936.</p>
   <p>History of the Parish. The early history of this parish is also closely connected with the parish of the 'Immaculate Conception' and Rev. Father Wojtalewicz (Father Frank). In 1910 the parish of the 'Immaculate Conception' had overgrown again, and its church was too small to accommodate properly the parishioners. Father Frank saw that, and he thought that another division of the parish was necessary.</p>
   <p>Not losing any time, he called a meeting at which it was decided to buy twenty-four lots at 84th Street and Saginaw Avenue, for which a sum of $5,379.40 was appropriated. This sum was given to the new parish as a gift. Archbishop Quigley appointed Rev. Edward Kowalewski as pastor of the new parish, and on June 10, 1910, he took charge of the new parish. Under his superintendency the foundation was laid for the brick church building in <span class="page-break">\2</span>which the school is also located. Due to the young pastor's care, the work progressed very quickly, and on September 10, 1910, the ceremony of laying the cornerstone was performed. The ceremony was performed by Right Rev. Bishop Paul Rhode, assisted by many clergymen. Rev. Father Wojtalewicz preached the sermon suitable for the occasion. The dedication of the church took place on Feb. 12, 1911.</p>
   <p>The Dedication. February 12, 1911, was a memorable day for every member of St. Magdalene's Parish. For those pioneers who worked for it the work was accomplished. That Sunday was certainly a beautiful day. The pealing of the new church bells announced to the world with a sweet and harmonious tone that a new temple of worship had been built.</p>
   <p>In that new temple, for the first time, a solemn mass was celebrated by its pastor, Father Kowalewski, assisted by the clergy and masses of people. The sermon, adaptable to the occasion, was preached by Rev. Prelate Thomas Bona.</p>
   <p>The church is large enough to accommodate one thousand people. The parochial school is attended by over 760 children. The school is conducted by twenty sisters. There are twenty-two societies in St. Magdalene's Parish. The present <span class="page-break">\3</span>membership is about 1,200. Near the church there is a parish house. In the back of the church there are big buildings. The auditorium is located on the second floor in one of the buildings. There are many rooms that are used for different functions. There is also a large and beautiful convent for the sisters.</p>
