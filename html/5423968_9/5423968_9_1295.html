   <p>With 700 delegates already in the city, and 500 more expected to arrive during the morning, the annual convention of the Polish National Alliance will open at 8:30 a. m., Monday.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, incorporated in the State of Illinois, is the largest Polish organization in the world. It has a membership of 101,000. Representatives of all chapters will attend the convention.</p>
   <p>Plans for the purchase of about 100,000 acres of land, to be used for the colonization of immigrants, will be one of the most important matters to come before the delegated. For two or three years the purchase of this land has been advocated as a means of raising the standard of living among Poles, but thus far the association has been without sufficient funds. It has, however, found means now for financing the project, and plans to make available to Polish immigrants small farms, at about $8. an acre. We believe that within a comparatively short time the entire tract will be taken ever by countrymen, and that it will be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>possible to erect a modern system of schools and churches.</p>
   <p>Another matter to be considered is the rewriting of the constitution, because several clauses contained therein are ambiguous and may be misconstrued, causing embarrassment in case of litigation.</p>
   <p>The reports of the seven different department will be one of the most interesting features of the convention. The Alliance is working to educate Polish immigrants and to quality then to command higher wages and make then better American citizens. The result of accomplishments along these lines will be given in reports from the departments of education, immigration, colonization, women's auxiliary, general aid, publication and insurance.</p>
   <p>Another feature of importance will be the report of the Polish National Alliance college of Cambridge Springs, Pa. A. hotel was purchased by the Alliance for $175,000 and converted into a Polish school, the first of its kind in the United States. A tract of 125 acres adjoins the college The tuition fees is $100. a year, and students are trained as thoroughly as in many American institutions. Each member of the Alliance <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>pays a monthly assessment of five cents toward the maintenance of this college. An assessment of two cents per capita also maintains the immigration building in New York, where all immigrants are directed to place which will give them the best opportunities.</p>
   <p>Ten thousand dollars was appropriated at the last convention to assist Polish boys and girls who wish to enter American universities, but are without sufficient means. Best of wishes, delegates.</p>
