   <p>The Polish military societies of Chicago and vicinity held a meeting last night in Columbia Hall in order to discuss plans for an alliance. The meeting turned out better than what had been anticipated and the hall was filled almost to capacity. Eighteen societies answered the appeal and their delegates showed a great deal of enthusiasm for the idea. Several decisions were reached at this meeting, and it may be said that the new alliance has already been established.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Sigmund Schmidt, who acted as chairman at the request of the representatives of the societies who signed the appeal. Mr. Przymorski acted as secretary. When the roll call of the delegates was taken, it was answered as follows: Four delegates from St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish--Peter Lama and Joseph Szczepanski, from the Kosciusko Volunteers; <span class="page-break">2</span>Francis Pokorny and Francis Golubski, from St. Martin's Knights.

Plocharz, Karol Milewski, and L. Ignowski, from the St. Martin's Hussars; W. Zwierzynski, Stanislaus Benke, and J.

A member of the Krakusy brigade, dressed in white and armed with scythes placed vertically as a prolongation of long poles, and used in battle as a lance or a saber.

Four delegates from the Bridgeport [district]--Valentine Zimny, Francis Labuna, and Martin Wesolowski, from the Krakusy of St. Michael Archangel; Boleslaus Bohdan,from the Poniatowski Sharpshooters' <span class="page-break">3</span>Society.

Three delegates from out of town--John Ciescynski and Joseph Katzbahm, from the St. Casimir's Knights, Lemont, Illinois; K. Janiszewski, from the fifth division of Free Polish Krakuses, La Salle, Illinois.</p>
   <p>After the roll call had been completed and the announcement made that eighteen <span class="page-break">4</span>societies were willing to co-operate, the meeting proceeded to the main business of the day--to organize the alliance and discuss its aims. Delegates Z. Schmidt, Przymorski, Gorecki, and Kaminski, as well as H. Nagiel and K. Zychlinski, who attended the meeting as guests, spoke extensively on the subject.</p>
   <p>The speeches over, Mr. Lama made a motion that the matter of whether or not the societies should form such a general organization be put to a vote. The motion was accepted and the vote was unanimous in favor of establishing an alliance of Chicago Polish military societies.</p>
   <p>This decision was followed by lively discussions, in which Pokorny, Lama, Gorecki, Bohdan, Zimny, Kaminski, Przymorski, Rozanski, Stefanski, Solski, and others took part.</p>
   <p>This discussion resulted in the formation of two committees, one of which will be in charge of the new organization temporarily and will prepare the rules <span class="page-break">5</span>and regulations. It consists of Z. Schmidt, J. N. Przymorski, F. Kaminski, W. Zwierzynski, and A. Gorecki, the originators of the plan, and F. Pokorny, Stanislaus Pawlowski, B. Bohdan, F. K. Rydzewski, W. Polfus, W. Kaptur, J. Gezele, J. Cieszynski, and W. Janiszewski. The number of members on this committee may be increased in proportion to the number of new societies joining the alliance.</p>
   <p>The other committee, assisted by the captains of the divisions, will be in charge of preparing common regulations and exercises. It consists of John Przymorski, W. Poplawski, P. Lama, L. Machnikowski, Z. Schmidt, J. Plocharz, and W. Zimny.</p>
   <p>Both committees will begin to function immediately; it is also expected that the delegates will gather again within a short time in order to give the finishing touch to the organization, which gives promise of a glorious future.</p>
