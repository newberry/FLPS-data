   <p>During the last Christmas holidays our church was so overcrowded that many persons could not get into the temple and had to go back home.</p>
   <p>Never before during Christmas holidays had our church been so thronged with our faithful disciples. Thank God that people of good will are awakening from their slumber and are drawing nearer to our Lord.</p>
   <p>The midnight mass was said by Bishop Leon Grochowski. After the mass was over, Rev. J. Padewski delivered an elevating sermon, and then Bishop Grochowski extended his best wishes to the congregation.</p>
