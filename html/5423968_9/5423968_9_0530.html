   <p>On Sunday November 29, at 8 P. M., magnificent exercises commemorating the November Insurrection were held in St. Adalbert's Parish under the auspices of Group No. 2 of the Polish National Alliance, Delegates of National Celebrations, and the J. I. Kraszewski Library. Many people attended.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. Ziarko, president of the Delegates of National Celebrations, opened the exercises and called upon Mr. J. Sadowski to act as chairman and the undersigned to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was a song by the Helen Modjeska Mixed Choir, under the direction of Mr. J. Jokajtys. This was followed by a storm of applause which forced the choir to give an encore.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program was an address by Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the central board of directors of the Polish National Alliance. The speaker explained at the outset the meaning and the purpose of the commemoration of the November Insurrection and how we should respect the memory of those of our brothers who were killed in 1830-31. He explained the faults and mistakes committed at that time and exhorted the people to consider present conditions coolly, in order not to make the same mistakes which our forefathers had made. He then posed the rhetorical question whether we should side with Austria or Prussia and answered, "no, definitely not; we shall side with neither; but when they have destroyed each other, we shall all go together to fight for Poland's freedom." He further stated that he did not wish to be a false prophet, but that he was certain that after the present war, which is being fought on Polish soil, all of Poland will be so ruined that one stone will not be left standing upon another. In concluding his excellent speech he asked us to be generous, to be mindful of our homeland always and everywhere, to contribute money in order to help our poor widows and orphans in the homeland. This speech was received by the public with a storm of applause.</p>
   
   <p>Then Miss W. Simbor played a violin solo, accompanied by Miss B. Niedzwiecki. This number was very well done and Miss Simbor had to give an encore.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. John F. Smulski, president of the Polish Bank, addressed the audience. The speaker began by stating that not so long ago speakers at celebrations told the history of our ancestors, but today we speak, and we shall continue to speak, of present conditions, the situation of our homeland, and the most important matter, Poland's independence. He exhorted the young men to join the Falcons, to join military societies, to train and be ready when the homeland calls upon us to come to her aid. In conclusion he said that what we need here is harmony and generosity; that we should leave politics to our brothers in the homeland, because they will know what to do and how to go about it much better than we over here, far away on American soil. His speech was received with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>The collection which was taken up for the Independence Fund yielded $35.43.</p>
   
   <p>Miss B. Bura, well-known national worker in St. Adalbert's Parish, gave a vocal solo, accompanied by Miss E. Jankowski. This number was very successful: there was no end to the applause and Miss Bura was forced to give an encore.</p>
   <p>Than there was a reading by the little daughter of Mr. Tyrakowski, the well-known jeweler. The title of the recitation was "The Prussian Oppresses Our Brothers." It was very well done. If only there were more such sons and daughters as A. Tyrakowski, we could say with confidence, "Poland is not lost as long as our children live."</p>
   <p>The next part of the program was an address by Judge M. Kavanaugh. The speaker stated that he was happy to be among us, that he had come to this country, just as we had, in order to seek a better future, he from Ireland and we from Poland. He compared the misfortunes of Ireland with those of Poland. He said that no nation had suffered such tortures or shed as many tears as Poland. He asked us to be patient because he is convinced that after the present war Poland will be free and independent. In conclusion he said that Poland's resurrection will be similar to the resurrection of the Lord after his crucifixion. His body was placed in a grave and covered with a stone. Our enemies have killed Poland and covered it with a great stone. But the day of resurrection is coming--just as the day of Christ's resurrection came, when the great stone was pushed aside and He rose. Just so will an angel appear on the day of Poland's resurrection to push aside the great stone and speak thus to our enemies: Whom do you seek? What do you want? Poland? She is not here, because she has already risen." The audience received Judge M. Kavanaugh's speech with a tremendous storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Chopin Choir No. 1 gave its usual excellent performance. The song "At the Grave" was received with a storm of applause. Miss S. Baur played the piano accompaniment.</p>
   
   <p>To conclude the program the chairman thanked those who had participated in the program and those who were present for the large attendance and asked all to rise and sing "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>With this, the inspiring commemoration was closed. It will no doubt long remain in the memories of those who attended.</p>
