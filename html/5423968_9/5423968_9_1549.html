   <p>The convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union was conducted in perfect harmony and the delegates went back to their homes satisfied. This happy outcome was in sharp contradiction to the uncalled-for prophecies that this would be the stormiest convention in many years, that such a difference of opinion exists as to make agreement impossible, and even that the Union is in danger of collapse, etc.</p>
   <p>As we foretold (in an article before the convention opened), these prophecies not only failed to come true, but were entirely groundless as well. Discussions were conducted peacefully, with dignity, amidst the mutual respect of each member for his fellow. Although the difference of opinion on important matters was great, the will of the majority was adhered to; this was as it should be.</p>

   <p>Some people unjustly maintain that the Union's conventions are characterized by monotony, lack of important business, and by the settling of frivolous and insignificant questions. The Twentieth Convention proved again that the matters which the conventions settle are important not only to the Union itself, but to the public at large as well. There were differences of opinion, of course, for the matters laid before the convention had been previously discussed by the member societies, which had instructed the delegates as to how they should vote. The debates and discussions were interesting. Those delegates should be commended who, upon arriving at the convention with opinions at variance with those of the majority, allowed themselves to be convinced by force of argument that the wishes of their particular societies were not for the general good. These delegates also undertook to convince their own societies that the decisions of the convention are beneficial.</p>
   <p>Among the important business settled by the convention was the matter of assessments, and the establishment of Wiara I Ojczyzna (Faith and Homeland) as the Union's official organ. The convention also voted on such matters <span class="page-break">\3</span>of public interest as support of the Immigrants' House, participation in Polish Day activities, and participation in the [Kosciuszko] Exposition in Lwow [1894]. Debate on these subjects was as interesting as it was instructive.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Polish Roman Catholic Union on its last convention. It should serve as a model for delegates coming to other conventions from all parts of the country.</p>
