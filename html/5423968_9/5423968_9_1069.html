   <p>By the time many of our readers receive the Dziennik, a solemn ceremony of decorating the graves will be in progress. Proper ceremonies will be conducted at all the cemeteries and we hope that tomorrow we will be able to present a general outline of these ceremonies.</p>
   <p>A solemn unveiling of a statue took place yesterday at the Bohemian Cemetery at Irving Park, commemorating the fallen Bohemian soldiers in the American Civil War. An enormous bronze statue represents an ordinary soldier holding a banner in his left hand, grasping a rifle and bayonet with the right. The statue is an impressive pose, symbolizing the defense of the flag. A corner-stone for this statue was laid some two years ago. Approximately five thousand persons had congregated for the ceremony of unveiling the statue. Carter H. Harrison delivered the main address.</p>
