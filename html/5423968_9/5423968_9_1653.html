   <p>After the fight in Saint Teklas' Parish of Chicago on account of an attempt to take away the Polish language, the committee for the protection of Polish language, appointed by the parishioners, after a long struggle with Chicago archdiocese, came to the conclusion that further struggle is useless, leaving the whole matter at the mercy of the Roman-Catholic clergy, betraying by such action the confidence of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Can that be cal led a Christian deed if for hard earned dollars the Polish people are led into a trap? If they are made to believe that the church and parish which they built will be Polish? And then the cat is let out of the bag. They find that the parish of Saint Tekla is not Polish and never shall be. It is not strange that the Polish people change their religious views after such treatment by the Roman-Catholic Church. It is due to such drastic measures of the Roman-Catholic clergy that the Polish National Church grows like mushrooms after the rain, and the Polish people flock to them seeing a true Christian love there.</p>

   <p>The time shall come when not only the Polish people but also the clergy who feel the Polish blood in their veins will embrace the new Lord's vineyard because they will not be able to bear such cruel measures which humiliate national feelings.</p>
   <p>I, the undersigned, not being able to agree with the committee for the protection of Polish language in Saint Teklas' Parish and not willing to wait for the promises of the pastor, decided to accept the invitation to the consecration of the Polish National Church of Our Savior at Cortez and Rockwell Streets, Chicago.</p>
   <p>I went there in order to convince myself how much truth there is in the clerical papers, slinging mud at the National houses of God.</p>
   <p>How great was my surprise, after I found myself inside the Polish National Church, where I was greeted cordially by the committee with smiling faces, inviting me to occupy any seat I wished. On looking around I saw happy <span class="page-break">\3</span>and pleasant people not hypocrites; it seemed that all of them belonged to one great family in that holy temple. I heard sweet tones of music; some people stepped out to meet their friends, others waited very anxiously for the moment when the new temple shall be dedicated to the glory of God and benefit of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Then the procession entered the church preceded by small children carrying flowers. And here a man forgets about his own self, hearing beautiful Polish songs, dear to every Polish heart. Here for the first time I saw Bishop Grochowski following the procession with dignity, full of hopes for the future.</p>
   <p>After the procession the church ceremonies started and only the Polish language was used.</p>
   <p>The holy mass, celebrated in the Polish language, makes a most profound impression upon a man, because he gets so interested that he forgets the words of prayer and finds himself in another world, especially during <span class="page-break">\4</span>the reading of the Holy Gospel. Because a man used to hearing the Holy Mass in Latin did not understand it, while hearing it in his native tongue, he has an opportunity to contemplate upon it.</p>
   <p>After such experience a man has an idea how false is the world and the people who are against the National Church. Now I can comprehend why those churches are growing for it can be seen that God blesses it and its faithful.</p>
