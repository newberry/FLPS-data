Delegates were present from such cities as New York, Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Schenectady, Milwaukee, Trenton, and Wilkes Barre. [Names of delegates from these cities omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>At 10:15, T. M. Helinski, president of the Polish Central Relief Committee, formally opened the convention, and the Reverend W.

In addition to these, there were representatives of the clothing committee, the Mothers' aid for children committee, the Girls' aid for girls committee, and the Committee for Economic Aid to Poland.</p>
   <p>Before beginning formal discussions, the oath was administered to the new delegates. Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, recently proposed for membership, was not present in the hall to take his oath. The press was represented as follows: W. Papara of Dziennik Chicagoski, H. Lokanski of Dziennik Narodowy, and S. Lewental of Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>The chairman then named several committees for the convention. [Names of committees omitted in translation.] The secretary then read the minutes of the semiannual convention of the Polish Central Relief Committee held on April 11, 1917. The minutes were unanimously accepted as read. Formal reports of the officers were next in the order of business.</p>
   
   <p>President's Report</p>
   <p>President Helinski declared that the principal activity of the committee was to gather funds for the relief of Poles in Poland and other countries. It must be admitted, unfortunately, that contributions have not been flowing in very rapidly of late, but this is undoubtedly due to the fact that our people have been faced with other problems which also demanded sacrifice on their part.</p>
   <p>Helinski further explained the relations of the Polish Central Relief Committee with the Central Relief Committee in Switzerland in the matter of administrational changes that had to be made at the death of Henryk Sienkiewicz. He said that the efforts of the Poles here were fruitful in that permission was received from the American government for the further sending of money to the committee in Switzerland. It had been feared that this would not be possible, because of the difficulties of communication with Switzerland.</p>
   
   <p>The next report was that of the secretary, for the period of April 11 to October 25, 1917.</p>
   <p>The activities of the Polish Central Relief Committee, for the period mentioned, just as in the previous period, were limited almost exclusively to relief work, all other nationalistic work for the Polish cause being left to the National Department. The first important action of the executive committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee was the normalization of relations with the General Committee in Switzerland, where, because of the death of Henryk Sienkiewicz, a temporary irregularity existed, the offices of president, secretary, and treasurer being rested in the hands of one man, Osuchowski. Without any reflections upon the confidence and honor in which the venerable Anthony Osuchowski is held by the Polish people in general, the executive committee was of the opinion that the continued successful development of the relief work of the Committee in Switzerland, conducted throughout the entire world, demanded that these three important offices be held by three different and equally trustworthy people. After an exchange of telegrams, the executive committee succeeded in prevailing upon the members of the General Committee in Switzerland to remedy the situation, and this was done in such a way that Osuchowski remained executive president and treasurer, Count Zoltkowski of Poznan was elected vice-president, and Henryk Sienkiewicz, son of the late Henryk Sienkiewicz, secretary.</p>
   <p>In May, 1917, the executive committee participated in the unveiling of a monument to the late Bishop Edward Kozlowski in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the bishop one of the organizers of the Polish Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>Since Spring of this year, the executive committee had received letters from a Mrs. M. Stabrowski in London, requesting money with which to rescue Polish prisoners from German prisons. These letters were accompanied by letters from Polish prisoners pleading for aid, and by confirmations of money already received from Mrs. Stabrowski. The executive committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee accordingly communicated with Mrs. Alma Tudema, representative of the General Relief Committee in Switzerland for England, and requested information as to the person of Mrs. Stabrowski. Upon receiving a reply that Mrs. Stabrowski is the honorary secretary of the committee for aid to Polish prisoners in Germany, that this committee is approved by the British government, and that she deserves the highest confidence, the executive committee sent Mrs. Stabrowski a thousand dollars on each of two occasions, the money to be used in furthering her good work. Mrs. Stabrowski continues to request further funds.</p>
   <p>A few months ago there appeared in a Lithuanian newspaper, published in English by Lithuanian priests, a slanderous article declaring that Lithuanians living in Polish territory in the war zone have been deprived of relief because the money collected for Lithuanian relief work passes through the hands of Polish committees which, instead of aiding the needy Lithuanians, use these funds to establish Polish schools in Lithuania for the purpose of polonizing the Lithuanian people. In the face of the demands of the Polish press that this slanderous attack be replied to, the executive committee, feeling it its duty to protect the honor and purity of the Polish name, published a refutation of these accusations, based upon figures given by the General Committee in Switzerland, which proved beyond doubt that Polish relief action did not differentiate between Poles and Lithuanians, either on Polish or on Lithuanian territories occupied by the Germans. The communique in this matter, entitled "In the Name of Truth," published by the Polish Central Relief Committee issued, in addition to the financial report of the General Committee in Switzerland, a general appeal to the Polish people of America for funds to further Lithuanian relief. The appeal brought results, for on this day [a Lithuanian Tag Day is referred to here], the Poles not only helped the Lithuanians collect funds, but also contributed their own money to such an extent that possibly the greater portion of the fund was subscribed to by Poles.</p>
   <p>The sale of buttons, postcards, portraits, and White Eagle stickers has continued to be a source of income to cover operating expenses to such an extent that there is no fear that the relief fund need ever be touched for this purpose.</p>
   
   <p>In September of this year, the Chicago Daily News published an interview between its representative and Anthony Osuchowski, during which Osuchowski was supposed to have expressed the opinion that at present it is virtually impossible to obtain food for the starving people in Poland, and that all efforts of the General Committee in Switzerland are directed toward obtaining food supplies in America. The executive committee immediately cabled Osuchowski and asked whether the interview had really taken place and if so, what is to be done with the funds it (the executive committee) now has on hand; that is, whether they are to be sent to Switzerland or kept here to be used for the purchase of food supplies in America. A reply has not yet been received.</p>
   <p>Collections for relief purposes have decreased during the last six months as compared with the previous period. The reasons for this should be sought in the greatly increased need for funds for general nationalistic purposes, as well as is the fact that, for a certain time, doubts have been expressed in the Polish press as to the possibility of continued dispatch of funds from the United States to Switzerland. In addition, all attempts at centralization of the relief action have failed, for individual organizations and committees continue to gather funds and send them to Europe on their own. In any case, the Polish Central Relief Committee has collected the largest amounts and is using these strictly for relief work, that is, no part of the relief fund is used to cover administrative expenses.</p>
   <p>The report of the financial committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee appears in another column of this issue, and is entirely in agreement with the reports of the treasurer and financial secretary. The chairman of the financial committee, Casimir Zychlinski, reported that upon examination of the accounts, everything was found to be in perfect order.</p>
   <p>Attorney Sypniewski asked how many meetings the executive committee had held since the last convention. He was answered by the secretary that there were three meetings. There were no other interpellations on the presidents' report, and it was accepted as read.</p>
   
   <p>The secretary was then asked by Sypniewski what steps had been taken by the Polish Central Relief Committee in the matter of the internal changes made in the General Committee in Switzerland, and what voice the Central [Chicago] Committee has in General Committee matters. The secretary replied that, with the death of Henryk Sienkiewicz, certain changes were made in the General Committee after an exchange of telegrams with the committee here, as a result of which Henryk Sienkiewicz, Jr. was named secretary and Count Zoltkowski added to the administration as vice president. Because of great difficulties of communications with Switzerland, still more complicated of late, correspondence is necessarily delayed, and replies are not received as quickly as they should be.</p>
   <p>Dr. Drobinski then asked when Osuchowski's interview with the American reporter had taken place.</p>
   <p>It was explained that the interview was supposed to have taken place several weeks ago. The matter was tabled, to be brought up later as new business.</p>
   
   <p>Sypniewski then asked whether all the members of the Polish Central Relief Committee were notified of meetings held by the committee in conjunction with the National Department on matters of lesser importance, to which the reply was that representatives were not called in from out of town for relatively trivial matters in order not to waste time and not to expose individual members to unnecessary expense. In matters of greater importance, however, all members were called to Chicago for a conference.</p>
   <p>Sypniewski further asked whether the administration of the Polish Central Committee had thought of sending a delegate to Switzerland for the purpose of ascertaining the state of the General Committee's treasury, and to see how its offices are conducted. The secretary replied that this matter will be more fully discussed at the National Department's meeting.</p>
   <p>On a motion by the Reverend Celichowski, the secretary's report was accepted, and upon a motion by Sypniewski the financial report also was accepted.</p>
   
   <p>President Helinski then called upon the Re-emigration Committee [Committee for re-emigration of Polish people in America to Poland] for a report. Since the chairman of that committee, Setmajer, was not present in the hall, the report was made by Lokanski, who explained that the committee had not held a single meeting and had not taken any formal action. At this point, Setmajer returned to the hall and declared that the committee cannot act until Poland is free and independent, at which time the committee will put into effect a prearranged plan for re-emigration.</p>
   <p>A short discussion next arose as to whether or not the minutes of the National Department's semiannual convention should be read. Sypniewski spoke for the reading, on the grounds that the entire organization should have full knowledge of the National Department's proceedings. There were voices against the reading, claiming that the National Department does not hold open meetings and that its minutes should not be read at an open meeting. It was finally decided that the minutes be read, which was done by the secretary, H. Setmajer.</p>
   
   <p>The president then called upon the clothing committee for a report. Mrs. M. Milewski's report declared that the committee's income was $4,589.20, its expenses $1,317,95. The committee shipped twenty-seven chests of clothing to France and Russia. The chests contained 7,747 articles of clothing: 1,455 pieces of men's clothing, 2,086 women's, 288 boys', 206 girls', and finally, 923 children's. In addition to this clothing, the chests contained 2,500 bars of soap and 600 pair of shoes. The entire value of the articles shipped totalled more than five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Milewski further declared that the clothing committee is now conducting an energetic action for the benefit of the Polish Army, and that members of the committee are engaged in making warm clothes for the soldiers. She said that a workshop has been opened at the Polish National Alliance Building. The Polish National Alliance has placed a thousand dollars into the hands of its Women's Department, which money is to be used in connection with the clothing committee's work.</p>
   
   <p>President Helinski commended the clothing committee for the work it has done.</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. Neuman then reported on the activity of the Mothers' aid to children committee. This committee sent out a total of $4,500 for charitable purposes and recently, during Madame Paderewski's visit, donated $200 for the adoption of Polish children. All the money sent to the General Committee in Switzerland with the restriction that it be used exclusively for children's relief.</p>
   <p>The president expressed appreciation for the committee's work, and called upon the Girls' aid for girls committee [Komitet Dziewczat Dla Dziewczat] to report. Miss Emily Napieralski reported for the committee. She declared that the purpose of the committee is to bring the Polish cause to the Americans and to work for Poland wherever possible. She had no written report to present, but said that several thousand dollars were sent [to Switzerland] and that the committee had recently discussed the building of a home for Polish girls, which matter was warmly supported by Madame Paderewski. In addition to this, the committee formed the "Living American Flag" with which it participates on patriotic occasions. In addition to this, the committee conducts a continuous collection, taking all contributions, however small.</p>
   <p>The president thanked the committee for its work thus far, and then called upon the committee for Economic Aid to Poland to report. The report was made by H. Lokanski, who explained the aims of the committee, and its activity thus far. He also read the portion of its rules that defines the field of the committee's activity. He said that, thus far, about $18,000 has been collected, which funds are at present in the hands of Kirkpatrick Brice of New York and Judge E. K. Jarecki of Chicago. Finally, he mentioned the recently issued special edition of the Chicago Herald, dedicated to the memory of Thaddeus Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>The president expressed appreciation for the committee's work and the secretary explained that a motion concerning this committee will be presented at the proper time. The secretary then told the convention that the motions committee was ready to report. Attorney Koscinski read the motions proposed by this committee:</p>
   <p>1. To send to Mrs. Stabrowski, in London, monthly payments of a thousand dollars for the Polish prisoners in Germany.</p>
   <p>2. To establish in the Polish Central Relief Committee a separate fund for economic aid to Poland, and to keep this fund untouched until the end of the war.</p>
   <p>3. To propose to Mrs. Turczynowicz that she organize a Polish Red Cross in America.</p>
   <p>4. To return to the Polish Army Citizens' Committee the sum of $358.47 which Mrs. Sakowski turned in to the National Department as the proceeds of a collection taken up during the manifestation at the Kosciusko Monument in Humboldt Park. Also to request of the Citizens' Committee the repayment of $500 which that committee had borrowed from the National Department to cover the costs of staging the great manifestation in the Dexter Pavilion.</p>
   
   <p>Following the reading of the motions, Dr. Drobinski brought up for discussion the interview supposedly held by Osuchowski with an American reporter. It was decided that the executive committee of the National Department communicate with Osuchowski and request an explanation. It was also decided that the executive committee request Osuchowski to resign for the good of the organization, from one of the two offices he is now holding in the General Committee in Switzerland.</p>
   <p>Further, Dr. Drobinski took up the matter of collections which were made for Poland to the American Red Cross as a result of President Wilson's appeal of January 1, 1916. This matter also was referred to the executive committee.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Dr. Wagner, the old administration was re-elected by acclamation. The president then called for the resolution committee to report. In behalf of the committee, Lokanski read the following resolutions:</p>
   
   <p>Resolutions Accepted by the Annual convention of the Polish Central Relief Committee, Chicago, Oct. 26, 1917</p>
   <p>"From among the storm-laden clouds of Europe, from beyond the flames that rage over the entire continent, we can finally see the dawn of freedom for Poland, and our hopes for regaining national existence are being realized.</p>
   <p>"We are already recognized.</p>
   <p>"By a decree on June 4, 1917, France permitted the creation of a separate, independent Polish Army under the White Eagle, and it gained the approval of all of the other Allied governments. By a decree on October 6, the United States War Department gave permission for the recruiting of Soldiers to the Polish Army in American territories. These two decrees are the cornerstone for the rising Polish armed force.</p>
   <p>"Recognizing the enormous significance of these two decrees, we, the representatives of Polish organizations gathered here at the annual convention of the Polish Central Relief Committee, on October 26, 1917, are unanimous in our call, 'To arms!" which should bring a response from every Polish community in the whole United States.</p>
   <p>"To arms, then, everyone who is physically able, everyone who is not bound by family responsibilities, everyone who has in his breast not a stone but a heart throbbing with Polish blood. To arms, young and old, for the struggle with our age-old enemy, for freedom, independence, and union. We who remained Poland's faithful sons in her blackest hours have been permitted to take up arms and break the chains that bind our motherland in slavery. Whoever is truly a Pole then, to arms, into the ranks of the Polish Army! This our first and most sacred duty today.</p>
   <p>"Understanding that this call should be made also from the pulpits of Polish churches, and while we appreciate fully the efforts thus far of our patriotic clergy, we call upon all of our priests to become the awakeners of the Polish armed action and to carry this call to the masses of Polish people.</p>
   <p>"We express our homage to Ignace Paderewski for his political activities and for the hymn he has composed, which will awaken new fires in Polish hearts, and we call upon the Polish people in general to support him in his attempts to achieve his own and our hopes.</p>
   <p>"Since we are recognized as one of the Allies, permitted as we are to form our own army, we hereby express our gratitude to the Allied governments and especially to the republics of France and the United States and, faithful to the traditions established by our forebears, we will fight at their side as long as our strength lasts, until, with them, we have one freedom for all the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>"Long may the Polish Army live!</p>
   <p>"Long live free, united, and independent Poland!</p>
   
   <p>"Long live the United States and its Allies!"</p>
   <p>The resolutions were unanimously accepted, and after the singing of the hymn "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], the convention adjourned at one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
