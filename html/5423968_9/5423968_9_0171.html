   <p>The Polish element in the United States of North America already occupies quite an important position, notwithstanding the fact that it is still young. We are already numerically strong; in fact, we are a group to be reckoned with and as such we should be organized.</p>
   <p>There are from a million and a half to two million Poles in America. There are from one hundred and seventy to one hundred and eighty Polish parishes, about one hundred Polish parochial schools, more than twenty journals, large and small. Here and there there are Polish orphanages and other benevolent institutions. There are hundreds of societies. Finally, we have a few large organizations of wider scope and which strive to see our people united in brotherly love and mutual understanding. We have many Polish national <span class="page-break">\2</span>activities. We are active; we are enlightening and civilizing ourselves. However, our development lacks something, and this something is a general system. Partisanship has weakened our strength. It is quite true that our large organizations unite the Polish element for a common purpose, yet when it comes to a concerted plan of action on nationalistic matters they stay aloof from one another.</p>
   <p>It is for this reason that our Polish public has felt for a long time the need for one general organization ready to co-operate in all important matters, an organization which would stand above the interests and ambitions of different factions, parties, and other organizations, without restricting their rights.</p>
   <p>It is high time for creating such an organization. We have experienced all kinds of vicissitudes. Today, after stormy conflicts, we have a period of relative calm. We will not discuss the factors which were responsible for <span class="page-break">\3</span>this achievement, but there is a fact worth mentioning. In 1893, at the celebration of Polish Day, we grasped the significance of unity. With the White Eagle waving above our heads, we marched in one rank, side by side, without reproaching one another for our faults, all factionalism forgotten. The year of 1894, Kosciusko's year, will present this matter in a better light. It seems that the spirit of a great man and patriot, Kosciusko's spirit, hovers over us, inspiring us with fraternal love and patriotism. It bids us to forgive injuries and forget differences; it fills us with a desire for co-operation in the fields which are accessible to us.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of this memorable year, we the undersigned, belonging to different factions of the Poles in this country, are sponsoring a plan to organize a Polish League--a new organization which will embrace all the Poles in America.</p>
   <p>The aims and character of this League, as well as its role as regards the <span class="page-break">\4</span>already existing Polish organizations in America, are as follows:</p>
   <p>The Polish League of America, as stated before, is to be a very extensive organization, embracing all the Poles in this country. Its purpose is not to provide sick benefit insurance or any other direct material gain. Its main function will be to get all the Poles together, keeping in touch with the motherland and doing its best to serve it. Besides this one purpose, it will work for the good of the community, taking part in patriotic, religious, moral, educational, and economic activities, and supporting all good causes here and in the motherland. In order to attain this objective, the League will strive to unite all the Poles, regardless of their political affiliation or religious creed. Likewise, the rights of member-organizations will not be restricted in any way. The League will respect the already existing organizations and wishes them success in all good undertakings. It promises not to interfere with the activities of any organization. In reality,the League takes upon itself the obligation of helping every Polish <span class="page-break">\5</span>organization to realize its honest aims. The League desires to unite us nationally and socially.</p>
   <p>In order to attain its objectives, the League intends:</p>
   <p>(1) To hold, at appointed times, Polish mass meetings, at which the whole Polish element of America may be represented, for the purpose of discussing the problems of the League and our vital issues.</p>
   <p>(2) To appeal to all American Poles for small but regular donations for the welfare of the Poles in America. A plan to impose a tax of one cent a month on every Polish person is considered.</p>
   <p>(3) To organize a permanent management, for instance, an executive committee and other departments, to conduct the affairs of the League when it is not in session.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>This is the outline of activities of the planned League. The name and the ideals of this projected organization are patterned after the historic Polish League founded in 1848 in the province of Posen by prominent Poles and unblemished patriots.</p>
   <p>We wish to organize our League at the first Polish mass meeting, which will be held in Kosciusko's year [1894] in the name of harmony and brotherly love. This mass meeting will be held in honor of a historical event which took place a hundred years ago. It will be held on May 3, 1894, in Chicago, at a place which will be announced later.</p>
   <p>All American Poles, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, have the right and ought to participate in this mass meeting, which will be called by our representatives and to which they are cordially invited.</p>
   <p>In order to make this mass meeting an organized body, it must consist of duly <span class="page-break">\7</span>appointed delegates. For this purpose, we have worked out a temporary set of rules governing representation. In our opinion this is the best arrangement, and we recommend it to parishes, societies, and other organizations wishing to send their delegates to the mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The rules we suggest are as follows: (1) Every Polish parish of one thousand members should be represented by a pastor and two delegates.</p>
   <p>(2) Parishes of more than one thousand members may have two additional delegates for every five thousand members, these delegates to be chosen by the pastor and the parishoners.</p>
   <p>(3) Every Polish society in America of one hundred members (regardless whether it is independent or belongs to a parish or a larger organization) should send one delegate; if it has more than one hundred members, it may send two.</p>
   <p>(4) Every Polish newspaper should send one representative; every Polish <span class="page-break">\8</span>school should send one representative, and large organizations should send all their officers as representatives.</p>
   <p>Countrymen! We have presented in brief an outline of the aims and principles of the proposed Polish League and the manner in which it should be organized. The details may be found in a pamphlet which is now being printed, which contains the history of the historic Polish League of 1848.</p>
   <p>Once more we appeal to our public for co-operation, upon which our future depends. All societies and organizations ought to take this matter under consideration at their meetings. Countrymen, let us unite and stand in one rank during Kosciusko's year! Let us repeat the oath of our great leader and learn to work for our fatherland, despite all differences of opinion and personal feelings.</p>
   <p>Parishes and organizations should share this common burden.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Organizations desiring to participate in this mass meeting are requested to notify us a month before May 3, 1894. Write to W. Bardonski, 638 Noble Street, or to S. Zahajkiewicz, 45 Sloan Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The manner of conducting this work will be decided at the mass meeting. Our present suggestions are only of preparatory character. There should be no prejudice. The public will decide the future course of the League.</p>
   <p>Countrymen, let us act!</p>
   <p>With fraternal greetings,</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: The appeal is signed by a large number of prominent American Poles, most of whom are Chicagoans.]</p>
