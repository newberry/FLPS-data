   <p>On January 27, members of St. Michael Archangel Parish of South Chicago gathered at Retmanski's Hall, 84th Street and Buffalo Avenue, to commemorate the anniversary of the January Insurrection (Rising of the Poles against Russia in 1863) and the one-hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland. The hall, which was beautifully decorated, was filled to capacity before the program began at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>Reverend A. Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael Archangel Parish, opened the exercises with the Lord's Prayer and called upon Marcellus Liebner and Michael Kaczmarowski to act as president and recording secretary of the evening, respectively.</p>
   <p>The stage was occupied by Reverend Nowicki, F. Gorowski, Burbach, Herych, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Schaefer, presidents of the various parish societies, guest speakers, and others.</p>
   <p>The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. "January 22," a poem, recited by Victor Weclewski.</p>
   <p>2. "The Course of Polish Events," a talk by Reverend F. Gorowski. The speaker gave a picture of conditions in Poland prior to the partitions and described the events that led to the fall of the Polish nation. He also gave a summary of the results of the fall of Poland and of the measures that led to the revival of the spirit of the broken Poles, and urged his listeners to keep this spirit alive and to work for the recovery of the fatherland. He predicted that if we are patient in our work for our country, we will see the Polish <span class="page-break">\3</span>standard unfold, the white eagle awaken, and Poland be resurrected.</p>
   <p>3. "Wygnaniec" (The outlaw), a song, by the parish choir.</p>
   <p>4. "Rownosc w Niebie" (Equality in Heaven), recited by Miss M. Czajkowska.</p>
   <p>5. "O Potrzebie Oswiaty" (The Need for Culture), a talk by F. Jurkiewicz.</p>
   <p>6. Recitation, by C. Weclewski.</p>
   <p>7. "Piekna Nasza Polska Cala" (All of Our Poland Is Beautiful), song, by the parish choir.</p>

   <p>9. A short play, woven around the Congress of Vienna, prepared by Reverend Adolph Nowicki. The following amateur actors took part: W. Weclewski, M. Kranc, Mrs. A. Wiedeman, and F. Kraszkiewicz.</p>
   <p>10. "The Meaning of our National Celebrations," a talk by Reverend A. Nowicki. The aims of our national celebrations were clearly presented by the speaker, who said that they are the means whereby we offer tribute to our Poland of the past. According to him, our participation in national affairs indicates that we have not ceased to be Poles. "To attend such affairs is not enough for one to be a true Pole or to boast of Polish patriotism," said the pastor; "one needs to work, make sacrifices, love his brothers, renounce his ego (swego ja) and, above all, jealousy; malignancy and hatred should be cast away. He who does not love his brother and does not go hand in hand with him is not a Pole nor a patriot. He who does not forgive his brother an offense does not know how to do anything of value for his fatherland. Therefore, let us love one another, let us get together, let us work together for the good of the fatherland, and only then will God help us," he concluded.</p>
