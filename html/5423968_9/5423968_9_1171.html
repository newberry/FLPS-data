   <p>The Fourteenth Convention of the Polish Falcons of America began on September 3, 1922.</p>
   <p>This organization prior to and during the entire World War, through the untiring work of its members, did its share in keeping alive the Polish Question in this country, and when this country became involved in the War, it gave a great percentage of its membership to fill the ranks of the American and Polish armies. This Convention went over past work and layed new foundations for work in the future. A free Poland is now a reality. About the only specially noticeable change in the organization's delegation, according to members who have attended various previous conventions, was the large appearance of new and younger blood, mostly born in this country, and these delegates asserted themselves in the athletic tournament, and in the various actions, debates and resolutions of the convention.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, September 3, 1922 the delegates marched to services at the Holy Trimity Church (Polish R. Catholic). In the afternoon the Athletic Tournament was held at Douglas Park and after manoeuvers, individual contests in running, high jumping, disc throwing etc., were held and the winners were awarded a silver statue, several shields and gold, silver and bronze medals.</p>

   <p>The business part of the convention began on Monday, September 4, 1922, and brother John Rybicki, who was chairman of the committee on arrangements, and who had put his whole heart and soul into the work, greeted the delegates in behalf of the Chicago Membership of the Falcons. Speeches were also made by a representative of the City of Chicago, Miss Emily Napieralski, of the Polish Women's Alliance and Doctor A Pietrzykowski, on behalf of the Veterans of the Polish Army. In the evening a reception was held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall and the various prises were distributed among the athletic victors.</p>
   <p>At the second session of the convention on Thursday morning, our friend, Stanley Chelminiak of South Bend, Indiana, was elected President of the convention, and in the afternoon the Chicago Society of the Polish National Alliance entertained the delegates with an automobile trip through the boulevards and Lincoln Park, Humboldt Park, with a stop-over at Kosciuszko monument, through Garfield Park, Douglas Park, Washington Park and Jackson Park down Michigan Avenue to the Art Institute of Chicago, where the delegates spent about an hour looking over the paintings, <span class="page-break">3</span>sculptural work and various other interesting subjects which represent the collection of the Institute. At 6:30 P.M. a dinner was tendered the delegation at the headquarters of the Chicago Society in the Aviation Club (up in the clouds). The food was delicious and tables were decorated with beautiful flowers donated for this occasion by the Niles Florists, who also furnished carnations for the lapels of all delegates; in fact, the delegates were still wearing the carnations on the following day of the convention. Just before the dinner, Marion G. Kudlick, President of the Society expressed the happiness of the membership of the Organization in being able to entertain the delegates and stated that it was the hope of the Chicago Society that the example set and entertainment arranged would be followed wherever the conventions of our various organizations are held. A good many of the society's membership attend these various conventions and have always found a lack of opportunity of getting together under sociable condtions. They have found at these conventions all work and no play, which never brings out the feeling of fellowship or gets the best results. The president expressed in behalf of the society, a word of thanks to the members who contributed financially to make this affair a success, and also to those who contributed their automobiles, and to the Niles Florists <span class="page-break">4</span>for their floral decorations. The music was furnished by brothers, Sylvy Klosowski and his orchestra, and the selection of his good music was appreciated. The dance program consisted of circle dances, Ladies' Robber, Two-step dances, with bouquets of flowers for prizes; gentlemen's Robber's, Two-step and Polish dances, which got everyone acquainted and the society made a lot of new friends before the affair was over. The best expression of thanks which the Chicago society could get for arranging this affair was the fact that nearly everyone stayed and had a good time until Home Sweet Home was played.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday the delegates started their work early and stayed late, and on Thursday after various resolutions were passed, among others, an expression of thanks to the Chicago society of the Polish National Alliance for the entertainment which they arranged for the delegates; a rejection of the proposition of changing the home office of the organization from Pittsburgh to Chicago; and the election of Mr. R.S. Abczynski of Pittsburgh, Penn. as president of the Polish Falcons; the convention ended with a feeling of good fellowship and resolutions for future good work of the organization.</p>
