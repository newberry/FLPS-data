   <p>Over two thousand Chicago Poles participated in the annual commemoration of the uprising of 1863, last night, in the auditorium of the Polish School of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. Just before the opening of the program the parish orders of the Knights marched in and were seated in their special places.</p>
   <p>J. Arkuszewski, who has been asked to become president of the Polish Patriotic organization for the ensuing year, called upon the secretary of the society Ignacy Machnikowski, who asked Father Barzynski to offer a prayer in honor of the anniversary.</p>
   <p>After the prayer, one of the teachers of St. Stanislaus Kostka School Mr. Jarzebski gave an interesting and illuminating reading about the part he took in the uprising of the Poles in 1863. He gave a vivid description of his activity in this revolt against Russia, European politics, and their attitude toward the Polish people. The audience was greatly pleased with this. The church mixed choir sang numbers appropriate for the occasion, after which a special drill was given by the order of the knights.</p>
   <p>The well-known member of the Society of the Name of Mary, P. Ligman, delivered the following address:</p>
   <p>"Dear listeners, we have heard what has been read to us about the misfortunes of the uprising of our people. You were told that our Russian enemy, which pounced upon us like a beast, has doubled its cruelty upon our people. Like a child who recalls with feeling the misfortunes and sacrifices of its mother, we are deliberating about the conditions of our people abroad, who were greatly mistreated in 1863, when we were without power. The enemy has torn from our hands the liberty of our fathers and is striving to wipe out the remainder of the treasures: the deeply imbedded faith and the love of our people. The latter shows a close attachment to the mother tongue throughout the annals of Polish history. Our enemy, realizing the might of these jewels, is doubling its forces in order to obliterate the last of Polish tradition. But our unwavering love for these two pearls of our people has thus far withstood the ravages of the Tsar.</p>
   <p>"This example can be likened with that of Job, who suffered greatly. Because of his sickness and misfortunes all of his friends and even his wife left him. In this respect France has deserted us after we helped her for many years. Many of our soldiers lost their lives fighting for her cause in former years. Their blood has tainted the soil of Spain, their perspiration the sands of Egypt, their feet the frozen shores of the Volga, and in reality most of the battlefields of Europe. Today, France is renouncing her relations with us in order to win the favor of Russia.</p>
   <p>"Austria has followed in the footsteps of France. And Austria gained her freedom by the sacrifice of our flesh and blood. But when we wanted to regain our freedom in 1863, Austria severed all her relations and obligations with us.</p>
   <p>"In this respect we have been deserted by our allies, just as Job was deserted by his associates.</p>
   <p>"Just as Job remained faithful and rose above the disrespect of his wife, who had added to the miseries placed upon her husband by God, many of our people are being unmercifully punished for their faith in God. Because of this the European press has spread propaganda against our religion and clergy. This type of attack is doing us more harm than the violence of the Russians.</p>
   <p>"My dear friends, you all know without any hesitation that a religious Pole is more reliable than a non-religious one. The latter is more vociferous than active and likes to boast about his partriotism beside a schooner of beer, while at the same time he tries to intimidate the religion of our youth.</p>
   <p>"Could we call an individual of this kind a patriot? To do this would be unsound, unwise, and dangerous.</p>
   <p>"After a long period of suffering Job was returned to his normal self by the word of God. All his health, all his riches were returned because he withstood all ridicule through his patience and his goodwill toward God.</p>
   <p>"We ought to follow this example for it is apparent that we are undergoing a like test. Let us not falter under this cloak of hardship that is becoming heavier at the present time; let us not waver in our faith in God and in our love for our people, and God will reward us for our patience and faithfulness."</p>
   <p>"Remembrance of Poland," was sung as a solo by Anthony Huntowski.</p>

   <p>Celebration of the 1863 Uprising</p>
   <p>[continuation from previous issue]</p>
   <p>The first order of the Knights that embodies the young members of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, under the name of Cadets, garbed in slate-blue uniforms adorned with epaulets and military cords, marched on the stage and in the aisles, displaying their skill in military drill. The audience was greatly pleased by this demonstration and hoped for more. This desire was fulfilled when the regular order of the Knights presented their drill maneuvers.</p>
   <p>The Knights of the Order of St. Martin performed a brilliant demonstration on the large stage floor. Their rigorous training was evident as they executed every order. The gallant command, the response in unison, and the various rotations displayed the potentialities of this order in case of war.</p>
   <p>The audience was greatly impressed by this military performance; those who kept indoors because of the severity of the weather missed an unforgettable event. Many persons in the audience showed signs of envy when they saw their friends wearing uniforms of officers. It was apparent when these people sighed that they were sorry for not having joined an organization such as this. Now they are denied the wonder of the public eye, for they are a part of the spellbound public.</p>
   <p>In the place of our noted friend and patriot Mr. Jozwiakowski, who was suddenly taken ill, Szczesny Zahajkiewich our own poet, novelist, and active organizer of the Polish Dramatic Guild delivered an address. He was sorry to see that this spacious hall was not filled to its capacity on such an auspicious occasion. He hinted that business interests had detained those who had intentions of attending and that deep in their hearts they cherish the thought represented by this commemoration. "Many of our people, here in America, are afflicted with the disease of religious disbelief. They should be shunned by us. We should believe strongly enough in the hope that we shall see Poland a free country once again, but we must never forsake the thought of God, for without him our cause will be lost. Our patriotism must have in its background the recognition of the will of God; it must be supported by the word of God, which gave Christianity the endurance to rise above paganism, and which will in the end give us the banner of victory and our enemies the flag of defeat."</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of this stirring speech, a men's chorus group came to the foreground. "Song of the Brave" was rendered in true musical style and received as much applause as did the speaker.</p>
   
   <p>A second order of Cadets performed for the audience. This group's versatility showed that our Polish Church Societies bring good results and allayed all doubt of time being wasted.</p>
   <p>J. Kondziorski, favorite singer of Chicago Poles, sang in his resonant bass voice "Utarczka" (Skirmish), to the enjoyment of the crowd. After this followed a regulation drill of the Guards of the Queen of the Polish Crown. This included a bayonet drill and a mock skirmish. In this latter maneuver one of the guards lost his cap by a sweeping pass by one of the rifles. The soldier's gesture denoted that he was fortunate that it was not his head. This drill brought a light of hope that our guardsmen would fare well in a war dance with the Muscovites. The public was greatly pleased by this army routine.</p>
   <p>The choir of mixed voices sang "Faith" with such ardor that even the audience was prompted to raise their voices and join in the singing.</p>
   
   <p>The Reverend Father V. Barzynski delivered the concluding speech of the evening in honor of this solemn patriotic anniversary. His speech, filled with the words of God and the indomitable spirit of Polish patriotism, resounded throughout the entire hall. He spoke of the hope that this uprising of 1863 brought to the people, its misfortunes, and its sad results. However, he pointed out that emigration and colonization of the Pole to other countries of the world did not spell doom for the cause of Poland. Instead it was a definite gain, a marked step in the direction of the liberation of the Poles, and the establishment of a free Poland. As a concluding gesture, Father Barzynski requested those who participated in the January uprising of 1863 to write of their experiences, and from time to time they will appear in this paper.</p>
   <p>A prayer for the souls lost in this cause and for all of Poland was then offered by Reverend Barzynski.</p>
   <p>Ignacy Machnikowski,</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Affair.</p>
