   <p>Mr. Zychlinski is presenting Mr. Mallek for president and Mr. Koscinski for censor. Last night at the personal invitation of the president of The Polish National Alliance, there gathered some 150 delegates of the advance guard to the convention. They met in the upper hall of the Sons of Freedom Club, at 1042-46 N. Robey st. Among those present were many of the most-prominent and influential men and women members of the Polish National Alliance. Presidents and various officials were present. Above all 30 elected delegates to the convention were already on hand.</p>
   <p>This gathering was for the purpose of discussing important matters of The Polish National Alliance, and to formulate a working program for the coming convention. The meeting was opened by the prominent lawyer and banker from St. Adalberts Parish in Chicago, Mr. Zachariasz. He also requested that attorney J. M. Pindrasa be given a place of honor. He being a delegate to the convention from Cleveland, and at the present time acting as host to the presidents of committees of the Home Office Building Commission. The request was granted with great applause by the assembly.</p>

   <p>Mr. P. Zychlinski, the president of the Polish National Alliance, requested that he be permitted to speak. Speaking eloquently, he let it be known that this was his last term as president of The Polish National Alliance, and that he would not be a candidate for re-election or for any other office, at the coming convention in Chicago. He made it clear that he was compelled to give up his public life due to ill health. He continued, Dear Brothers &amp; Sisters, you have suggested that I find capable men qualified to hold the highest offices in The Polish National Alliance, and that I present them to you. I have endeavoured to find able men from far and near and found it very difficult. Then I turned my attention on one, who, is by the way, a Chicagoan, and who was acceptable to the delegates of this convention, but unfortunately, due to the nature of his business, this gentleman could not accept the office. Two months ago, I was visiting in the East. There I was met by a large number of Polish National Alliance members, who also questioned me about possible candidates for the presidency. They intimated that they would gladly accept a candidate of my choice.</p>
   <p>At the present time I have a candidate that I want to present to you. But before I go on with the presentation, I am going to call to your attention a momentuous situation that has permeated the Polish National Alliance. I am a member of this organization for 45 years. I was a delegate to some 16 past conventions. For 16 years I have carried the proud title of president of The Polish National Alliance.</p>

   <p>I have held several offices in the organization, being elected 5 times by the conventions, but during the whole time of my activity in the Polish National Alliance, my last term in office proved to be the most conspicuous. In the past we have experienced a great deal of friction, dissention, misunderstanding and jealousy, but in the end we all adhered to the rule of the majority. Many bitter battles have been fought, but after the battles have been fought and won, both, the victors and the defeated layed down their arms, forgot all their animosities and resolved to work side by side for the general welfare of the organization.</p>
   <p>During my last term things were different. Two factions are necessary, and disputes will arise, but all these can be solved in an orderly manner. Recently methods resorted to were very ungentlemanly; lies, slander, jealousy. It is unthinkable that in an orderly society, men would descend to such depths of degradation. But today, dear Brothers and Sisters, as old as I am and as long as you have known me, and as long as I have carried the proud title of President, I am willing to take a solemn oath before God, that I have not violated any of the laws, or committed any crime against the Polish National Alliance. Neither have I proved traitor to those pioneers who have made this organization possible. It is only human to err, therefore I also can make mistakes. But in my every thought, deed and action, the welfare of the Polish National Alliance was uppermost in my mind.</p>

   <p>No individual can prove, that in my 16 years as President of this Organization, an injustice has been done or that one penny has been misappropriated or stolen from the Treasury of the organization. The slanderers should be made to stand trial. The truth of the matter is that these slanderers are still spreading lies; that the Treasury is short thousands of dollars, that we are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars recklessly, and that the management is poor and inefficient.</p>
   <p>It is not our duty to go before these slanderers and to try to prove their lies or to resort to the courts and to defend ourselves. These would not be condoned by our organization. But, my fellow brothers and sisters, it will be your duty, at the coming convention, to bring these slanderers to trial and demand from them proofs.</p>
   <p>I did not invite you here to give you excuses or to win your praise. I am here to tell you plainly what is on my mind. I also want to present to you, candidates for the two most important offices in this organization. I will begin with the office of censor. After a prolonged oratory Mr. Zychlinski presented Mr. Leopold A. Kosinski for president and Mr. A. Mallek for censor.</p>
