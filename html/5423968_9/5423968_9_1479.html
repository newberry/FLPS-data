   <p>There are a few score of so-called Polish military societies in Chicago and vicinity. Their object is to develop physical strength among the members, to give them military training, to protect their civil rights in this country, and, if necessary, to serve our mother country, Poland.</p>
   <p>So far these societies are not united; they even differ in their uniforms, regulations, exercises, weapons, etc., and yet, in union there is strength. If the aims of these societies are noble and praiseworthy, then they should be united in order to attain their aims through united effort. These societies would become very powerful if they were united and had the same kind of regulations, exercises, etc. They could help our warriors to gain perfection in military art.</p>
   <p>Several attempts have already been made to organize these societies in Chicago and vicinity. Right now, during the year dedicated to Kosciusko, <span class="page-break">2</span>one hundred years after the historical battle at Raclawice, is the time to establish this organization. This is year of national commemoration, and it should unite us for harmonious nationalistic work.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen from the East--New York, Buffalo, and other cities--have already such an organization. Shall we be laggards? Is it impossible for us to repeat their accomplishment? In our opinion, it is not; on the contrary, we believe that this is possible and that it can be accomplished with good will, energy, and work,</p>
   <p>Therefore, we appeal to all Polish Military societies in Chicago and vicinity to unite into one organization.</p>
   <p>In order to accomplish this, we will hold a meeting of all representatives of the Polish military societies from Chicago and vicinity on April 16, 1894, 2 P.M. at Pulaski Hall, 800 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Every patriotic Polish military society which cares for the welfare of the public is requested to send two delegates to this meeting, at which it will be decided whether this Polish general military organization should be established or not.</p>
   <p>In the name of the public and in the name of patriotism, we appeal once more to those concerned to come to this meeting.</p>
   <p>Every Pole who honors our hero of Raclawice will join us in this memorial year; he will help a noble cause by joining the common ranks.</p>
   <p>Every military society is asked to take this appeal under consideration at its next meeting.</p>
   <p>Societies desiring to send their delegates are very kindly requested to communicate as soon as possible with J. Przymorski, 789 West 17th Street, or with S. Schmidt, 48th Street and Ashland Avenue.</p>
