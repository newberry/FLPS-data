   <p>The commemorative exercises arranged last Sunday at St. John of God's Parish by the combined efforts of the various groups of the Polish National Alliance and the Alliance of Polish Falcons, as well as other national societies, were a greater success than any previous commemorations arranged by combined national and religious societies. Pulaski Hall was crowded. For the Independence Fund $41.41 was collected. Nevertheless several Alliance groups, in spite of repeated invitations of the committee and constant exhortation by the press, did not deign to take part and pay their homage to the memory of our heroes who have died for the Polish cause. Citizens, wake up! Show at future celebrations that you are Poles.</p>
