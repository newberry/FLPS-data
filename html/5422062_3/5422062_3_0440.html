   <p>Our community is waiting for the first theatrical performance of this season with anticipation and delight. Everyone agrees that theatricals assume first place in social doings during the winter season. The Greeks of Chicago are more than interested in this higher form of art, and we are sure there will be a great turning out on November 3, at the Eighth Street Theater to welcome the opening of "Dio Lohion," presented by Theatrikos Kallitechnikos Omilos, Chicago.</p>
