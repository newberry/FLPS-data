   <p>p. 6.- The annually given concert in honor of the graduating students of the Balatka Academy of Music took place last Monday in Kimball Hall. The principal part of the program was constituted by Professor Geo. Kampas, who presented on the stage an orchestra of violins, composed of young school boys and girls, playing Greek and American pieces to the accompaniment of two pianos and an accordion.</p>
   <p>The performance was so successful that the American audience cheered with the greatest of enthusiasm and admiration. The compatriots who were present declare that they have never felt such great national pride as they did when they heard the boys and girls play, in the midst of so many Americans, the "Evzonaki," under the personal direction of Geo. Kampas.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Kampas is worthy of congratulations as he never in any of his performances forgets for a moment his greek origin. It would be an omission if we did not mention here that two of his students, Nickolaos Karkambasis, ten years of age, and Galigano Rojas, a Filipino, were awarded gold medals as the first among 314 students in the performance of "Carnival de Venice", by Paganini, and the "Concerta No. I."</p>
