   <p>With the coming of winter, interest in theatricals has been revived by the people. Chicago never before had the chance to present a Greek troupe, as New York has been doing for the last three years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gerasimos Kourouklis has asked Christ Taboularioes to give an Athenian performance in Chicago this season. Mr. Tacoularides replied that he will be in Chicago in a month and will be ready to present "Dio Lohion" in November 3. Our Greek community is awaiting his arrival with anticipation.</p>
