   <p>Our community in Chicago has recently acquired two brilliant church choirs which have excited frequent approbation and praise for the efforts of their directors.</p>
   <p>We shall confine our praises, however, to our own circle and to the performances of the choirs in our churches. For we believe that it is time to introduce choirs in our churches and improve our ecclesiastical music, considering the fact that our Byzantine singers can be counted on our fingers, and that our new generation does not understand much about Byzantine solos. However, when our newly organized choirs, not to mention those which are not yet complete, wish to demonstrate outside our own community, we consider it our duty to remind then that they are going too fast and think too highly of themselves.</p>
   <p>They must know that in America there are well trained church choirs, many of them large choruses, and that the American public before which they appear has well developed musical taste and is capable of judging what our singing is worth Nor should we deceive ourselves that we have reached the point where our choirs may be compared with the American choirs. We still have far to go, and much time and training are still needed.</p>

   <p>What caused us to treat this subject was the concert of the Byzantine choir given the day before yesterday at the University of Chicago, which as a performance before the American public was not anything exceptional.</p>
   <p>We consider it our duty to make these criticisms, so as to put a stop to this absurdity at the start. We suggest to the directors of our recently formed choirs that they confine their efforts within the Greek community; for the hour for outside demonstration has not yet arrived.</p>
