   <p>Last Sunday at Smith Hall of Hull House, the first annual lecture was given by the Messinia Society. Dr. K. Papatheodore was the speaker and he chose for discussion two very interesting and very important subjects.</p>
   <p>The first part of his lecture dealt with the origin of man and the second part with after-life, or what is in the beyond. Such a subject drew a great audience and everybody listened eagerly to every word the speaker uttered.</p>
   <p>Refreshments were served after the lecture.</p>
