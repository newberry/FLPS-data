   <p>p. 6.-We enjoyed a wonderful play given, last Sunday, for the benefit of the Greek school, Plato, by the pupils.</p>
   <p>The Civic Theater of the Opera House was filled to capacity. The synopsis of the play went back to the crusades, and gave an idea of what the Oriental people went through during the crusades of western Europe.</p>
   <p>All hail the little Greek children!</p>
   <p>When we have such results, there is no danger of having our language extinguished. The dance with more than forty Greek girls in uniformly modest dresses was wonderful.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kampa's orchestra played excellently.</p>
