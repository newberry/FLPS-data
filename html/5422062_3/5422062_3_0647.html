   <p>p. 5.- Last Thursday, at the Midway Masonic Auditorium, the Greek Ladies' Society of the South Side and the Society of Amateur Dramatic Artists also of the South Side, gave a dramatic performance, which was crowned with great success.</p>
   <p>The performance "Kyra Phrosyne", a national tragedy written by the distinguished poet, Mr. D. Vernardakis, was played upon the stage for the first time in Chicago. At the intermissions the South Side Mandolinata played various selections, and Miss Sophia Stamou, with her sweet voice, sang the "Gero Demos" and the "Valfe Ariett." Miss Demetra B. Argyres and her sister, Aigle, with gracefulness, danced the classical circle dances. Mr. Soterios N. Stamou, wearing kilts, sang the "Evzonaki" to the delight of the audience, and was compelled to sing other verses upon the insistence of the roaring audience.</p>

   <p>Congratulations to the ladies society and to the amateurs for their untried efforts to make the performance a grand success. Proceeds of the affair go to the fund which takes care of poor and needy families in Chicago. Special attention must be given to Mrs. Petrakis, the wife of Rev. Marcus Petrakis, who is always ready and willing to assist in noble activities.</p>
   <p>Bravo, enough money was collected for our needy Greek families.</p>
