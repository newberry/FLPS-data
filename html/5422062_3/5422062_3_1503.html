   <p>One more step has been taken by the Greek colony of Chicago to better itself and to establish a precedent for the Greeks in America. The first public lectures in Greek were delivered last week at Hull House and were heard by a vast audience, in which women and children predominated. This is a forward step and a corner-stone in the constructive effort to shape and mold the minds of the public.</p>
   <p>Patriotism, religious education, our duties to our countries, adopted and native, and various other subjects were discussed in the lectures.</p>
   <p>Their explicit and analytical form facilitated their absorption by the attentively listening audience.</p>

   <p>We are glad to hear that other lectures will follow, and the Star congratulates the Pan-Hellenic Society for its devotion to that which is Greek and for its initiative in taking the first step along this line of progress.</p>
