   <p>p.1.--The Cretan Brotherhood of Chicago intended to hold its annual picnic on July 3, but on account of the rain they postponed it to the 10th. On that day more than half a thousand crowded the breezy Grand View Gardens.</p>
   <p>It was a merry occasion for all who attended. Feeling the association's spirit of real fraternity, all thoroughly enjoyed the outing. The president of the Brotherhood, Mr. Stylianos Saridakes, or Steve Saridan, as he is popularly known, as well as the other members of the board, did everything possible to please the crowd. The native music of the Cretan lyre and the orchestra of Constantine Kiagiadakis, provided much diversion for the guests, who danced their native dances to their hearts' content. At 10 p. m. a radio was raffled off and delivered with a big ovation to the luckyman, Mr. Demetrios Maniates.</p>

   <p>At midnight all set off for home with pleasant memories of this outing, and all congratulated the committees for their arrangements.</p>
