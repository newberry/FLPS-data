   <p>P.-1-......In a previous article we rendered due tribute to the Order of Ahepa for its generous initiative in bringing upon the American stage the recent dramatic work of our Greek poet, Mr. D. Michalaros, who incidentally is a member of this fraternal organization.</p>
   <p>We firmly believe that the numerous members of the eight chapters of this organization which exist in our chicago community would more than fill small auditorium of the Studebaker Theater, for we had noted the eagerness to attend and the enthusiasm which prevailed when the Society offered dances and other forms of entertainment.</p>
   <p>We, as well as many others who strongly believed that since the presentation of this work had been sponsored by Ahepa, the Studebaker Theater would be filled to capacity, were astounded to find that not even half the seats were occupied, and that the great majority of those present were regular theater-goers and lovers of music who would have attended the performance regardless of who had sponsored it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>People were justified in asking the question, What evidence is there that the Order of Ahepa has endeavored to make this production a success when it could not fill to capacity a theater so small as the Studebaker?</p>
   <p>We were about to accord due praise to the Order of Ahepa, for we firmly believed that in this undertaking it had made a noble gesture and had centered the field of the fine arts by sponsoring the play "Theodora,"- that it had discovered a new horizon and had raised its ideals to a higher level, - that the many trite forms of entertainment which it had hitherto afforded to the Greek community of Chicago were now considered passe'. But is is obvious that we erred in our assumption, for not only did this national oraganization fail to make any effort to assure the financial success of the play, but on the contrary, it employed means to prevent its succeeding.</p>
   <p>Not only was this fact evinced by the actual failure of the play financially, but strange as it may seem, many members of this fraternal order exerted every possible effort to make the premiere a fiasco. These members displayed their malicious and mischievous intentions by publishing unfair criticism of the author of the drama, thus proving the truth of an old adage, "Best friends often become worst enemies."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Yet there were at least a few brothers Ahepans who because of their interest in the higher forms of art and because the playwright was an Ahepan were kind enough to attend the performance, thus averting a total lack of spectators and the presentation of the paly to rows of vacant seats.</p>
   <p>Were the great majority of Ahepans incapable of realizing that since all the local chapters of this national organization had sponsored the performance of this drama on the American stage, their individual support in attending the performance was absolutely required to make the play a success?</p>
   <p>Do you expect us to believe that you are a powerful organization when you do not comprehend even the most elementary principles of brotherhood and loyalty and fail to support the reputation of your society? You boast of your efficiency and your strength, proved by the popularity of the dances and the other minor forms of entertainment which you often present, but when the hour arrives which affords you the opportunity to elevate your organization toward a loftier ideal, and you might have earned boundless honor and praise, you relax in your endeavor and shatter the hopes of those who in all sincerity had believed that the Order of Ahepa was setting up higher standards for itself, entering a sphere of more <span class="page-break">\4</span>significant activity, and conducting affairs nobler in purpose.</p>
   <p>Perhaps we had expected too much, but we believed for a time that there existed in the Order of "Ahepa" a spirit of idealism, and we ask our Ahepan brothers to forgive us for our misconstruction of the facts.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
