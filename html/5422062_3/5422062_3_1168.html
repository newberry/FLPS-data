   <p>The Greek Star has just done a wonderful and philanthropic deed. In order to help the poor Italians suffering from the earthquake, the Star promised free subscriptions to those bringing in donations to help the sufferers.</p>
   <p>Kind-hearted Greeks went from store to store, collecting what they could. After the money was handed to the Star, the publisher presented it to a prominent American organization interested in the Italian situation.</p>
   <p>"Here is $200," he said, "a donation from the Greek Star."</p>

   <p>This is a false statement we would like to correct. This money is a donation from the Greek people of Chicago, not from the Greek Star. The Greek Star was very wrong in doing what it did. Instead of giving the money to an American organization, it should have sent it directly to the Italian Consulate from the Greek people of Chicago. Why? Because we Greeks have much in common with Italians and owe them many courtesies. When the money comes from us, Italy will thank us for it and a mutual feeling of friendliness will prevail.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star lost considerably in not seeing this because it probably would have gotten a letter of thanks from the Italian Government, if it had not been so hasty. Now the American organization will take all the credit.</p>
