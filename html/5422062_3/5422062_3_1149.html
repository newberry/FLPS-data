   <p>Once again our subject is the Greek press in America. We have written pages on this and yet the Greek population fails to realize that the Greek press of America is their worse enemy. It ruins every national or progressive movement the Greeks might make. It is a microbe which is slowly eating out our hearts and spirits. And yet we do nothing about it!</p>
   <p>Now Spiros Matsoukas has come to America. Everywhere he goes the Greek press tries to kill his chances. Why? Because he is a promoter of Hellenism and a lover of the Greek people. Hellenism in America is 100% worse than Hellenism in Greece because we allow ourselves to be dictated to by a paltry group of mercenary editors. If we put the Greek press in its place we will be able to find a place of our own.</p>
   <p>Hellenism in America has a lot to learn and far to go. But first we must correct the evil; the right newspapers will help us go forward in the right direction.</p>
