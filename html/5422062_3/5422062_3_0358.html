   <p>With great pride and joy we present the young Greek violinist Leon A. Methenitis, who, although only twenty-five years old, has been directing, for the last two years, the enormous Balaban &amp; Katz Theater orchestra.</p>
   <p>This young star has been in the public eye since he was ten years old and is affiliated with Balaban &amp; Katz since he was 18. At present he has assumed the name of Louis Ardian. This does not make us less proud that a Greek has shown such unusual talent.</p>
