   <p>With unbelievable vigor and joy the heralded national frolic of the Chicago Tegeatic Society of America took place July 21st at Schiller Park.</p>
   <p>More than three thousand Greeks attended the affair in order to have "a get together" with members of the Tegeatic Society, which is highly esteemed for its national activities among the Greeks in America. Men and women, old and young, boys and girls, all came to frolic, with the Tegeataes. Pretty girls predominated and became the center of attraction, by flying like butterflies from group to group, dancing with frivolity and gusto, and singing Greek and American songs. Conviviality and joy prevailed everywhere in the gatherings.</p>

   <p>Many prominent Greeks took the opportunity to participate in the get together affair they forget their business worries for the time being. Clerks, workers, business men, professionals, journalists, industrialists and what not, were there to pass the day in joy and mirth.</p>
   <p>Among them, we observed Dr. N. Salopoulos, a native of Tegea, journalist, president of the Greek Professional Men's Club, former Consul General of Greece, a jewel in the Greek community and an active patriot in local and national affairs. Dr. K. Theodorou, Dr. K. Papatheodorou, Attorney G. Kyriekopoulos a former assistant States Attorney, G. K. Gatsis, the great realtor and president of the Chicago Tegeatic Society, who very wisely planned to take moving picture films of the festivity in order to send them to Athens, Greece, the headquarters of the society.</p>
   <p>Hundreds and hundreds of pretty girls stormed the camera, but the photographer knowing his business did not let the girls steal the show.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Every group of school children, teachers priests, old men and women, professionals etc. and every activity was filmed, that the folks in the old country may see our doings.</p>
   <p>Time and space do not permit mentioning the speeches of the many orators who with brilliant oratory enthused the crowds.</p>
   <p>National frolics of this kind constitute the barometer of unity, friendship and vitality of the Greek element in America.</p>
