   <p>The well-known musician, Mr. Louis Adrian, conductor of the Chicago Theater Orchestra, is now presenting a regular program on W. G. N. He was given a contract last week, and he and his fine orchestra have been broadcasting nightly since then. They will be heard again on Saturday from 8-8:15 P. M.</p>
   <p>We recommend that the Greek community listen to his program, and ask that it become a permanent feature.</p>
