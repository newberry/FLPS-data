   <p>The Argeians had a wonderful picnic last Sunday at the Desplaines River Resort.</p>
   <p>We noticed that the Argeians are full of life and pep, radiating brotherhood, eating Psita (roasts) and drink Retsina wine. Songs, dancing, laughter, and conversation filled the air.</p>
   <p>The president, Mr. P. Basiliou; vice-president, E. Rentas; John Ladas, treasurer, and the rest of the members worked hard to make this event a success and it is our belief that they succeeded.</p>
