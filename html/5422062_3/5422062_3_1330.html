   <p>p.2--From all indications it seems that the Greeks in Chicago are very much for dancing. Young and old, even very old bachelors, flock to the dancing places to keep their bodies in trim. Besides the dozens of privately operated dancing schools supported by Greeks in Chicago a public dancing school was established last week. This new place is owned by the Misses G. Economou and B. Zepos and is located at 27 North Clark Street. Fees for dancing lessons are fifty cents for men and twenty-five cents for women, and the establishment is for Greeks only. Terpsichoreans are welcomed.</p>
