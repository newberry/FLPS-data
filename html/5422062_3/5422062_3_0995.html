   <p>The management of the Greek Press feels certain that, during the entire four and one-half years of its publication, it has always maintained a high journalistic standard. The printed matter has always been of such a nature that it could offend no one; and at the same time it has told the truth, even at the risk of becoming unpopular. We have striven to keep abreast of all the social and economic changes, in order that through reading, the Greek public might benefit and learn. The Greek people of Chicago trust and support the Greek Press because they, too, are becoming synchronized, and they appreciate the progressiveness and unselfishness of the Press' policy.</p>
   <p>An examination of the past issues of the Greek Press reveals that, despite the considerable number of such episodes, the paper has never devoted even one line to the publication of scandals which grew out of school, church, or parish affairs. If we discussed the problems of these various groups, it was always from an academic viewpoint. We declare, without reservation, that we <span class="page-break">\2</span>have never been petty, mean, or vindictive. It has been our fixed and purposive policy to be heralds of logical and sane thinking concerning matters which affect the life of the Greek group. The general outline of our procedure has been based upon the interpretation of our national and racial ideologies and their maintenance. Using these as a yardstick, we will continue to work for those ideals which we so firmly believe in. As long as we can help the Greek people, not only of Chicago, but of America, as well, it shall be done.</p>
   <p>After having written--as we have done for so long--about the immediate need for the unification of our power through the formation of one undivided community, we are more and more convinced that only such a course can solve our community difficulties. This is the only way we can hope to create a defense against the rapidly rising tide of assimilation which threatens to eradicate us. The fact that we have repeatedly fought for this unification <span class="page-break">\3</span>as a solution to the problem indicates beyond a doubt that there is no serious obstruction in the path of such a move. The only thing we need is a sincere desire. Since we are convinced that the desire does exist it puzzles us that nothing has been done to satisfy this public demand.</p>
   <p>An understanding and a discussion among the men who represent the various parishes could be the first step toward such a unification. An understanding should not be difficult to arrive at, since the ground has been prepared and is merely awaiting the seed. That which remains to be done is to start movements which are for the benefit of the churches and the people alike. We can then plow under all the weeds and parasites which have for so long thrived upon the Greek community.</p>
   <p>Great and lasting deeds are the fruit of long thought and good intentions. Common ones do not require thought, sincerity, or foresight. They are ephemeral and will mean nothing to future generations. Those accomplishments <span class="page-break">\4</span>which benefit many generations of men are usually the ideas of a brave or prophetic individual--an individual who has devoted his life to the betterment of his fellow man and the world in which he lives.</p>
   <p>The problems which confront the Greeks of Chicago are not of such a nature that only a genius could solve them. All that is required is a little co-operative thinking and action--and the deed is accomplished. Nor is it necessary for the present setup to be entirely discarded. Some of it can remain unchanged; and even the necessary changes need not effect the personnel or the duties of the church boards.</p>
   <p>Even if it is impossible for us to create a legal unification of the Greek churches, we can at least work out a program of co-operation, just as has been done by the Holy Trinity and St. Constantance in their social programs. If a beginning is made, the rest will come naturally in the course of time.</p>
