   <p>The foundation has been laid for the organization of the Commercial Club of Greek salesmen of Chicago. The work is progressing more favorably than the Saloniki dared to hope.</p>
   <p>The organizing committee is composed of George Bambakaris, Basilopoulos, N. Sarantakis, P. Damascis, C. Spirakis, D. Sarantakis, C. Giannia, A. Apostolou, John Agriostathis, and Th. Theodoropoulos; and these gentlemen laid out the purposes of the club very efficiently, as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To be a brotherhood of Greek salesmen.</p>
   <p>2. To support and aid Greek representatives in their dealings with their concerns.</p>
   <p>3. To teach and enlighten the Greek businessmen concerning their dealings with American business firms.</p>
   <p>4. To develop good salesmen, and then to see that each American firm that is patronized by Greek stores has at least one Greek representative.</p>
   <p>5. To promote a closer and friendlier spirit between the Greek and American businessmen.</p>
   <p>6. To increase the strength and influence of the Greek salesmen, by teaching the Greek businessmen to demand Greek salesmen and to patronize firms that do have them.</p>
   <p>These purposes and aims pleased the assembled salesmen. These purposes were commented on and critisized until all those present were finally satisfied.</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Salopoulos honored the meeting by making a short speech, and he was followed by Mr. Wilson, advertising manager of the Saloniki. Mr. C. Damascus, Mr. Bambakaris, and the Reverend Hadzidimitriou also spoke.</p>
   <p>Among the salesmen present were G. Arvanitis, J. Agriostathis, C. Agrios, C. Giannias.....</p>
   <p>Saloniki is proud that it has the right to take the credit for the idea of forming such a necessary organization.</p>
