   <p>Only a few years ago several [Greek] philharmonic symphony orchestras were organized in quite a few cities in the United States, including Lynn and Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>It was in these orchestras and musical choruses that our music-loving youth learned the noble and divine art of Orpheus (music). The playing of Greek music and national marches in the various Greek communities throughout America lent wings to our national sentiment, and inspired and comforted our countrymen who yearned for and had pleasant memories of their homeland.</p>
   <p>With the passing of time, however, these philharmonic symphony orchestras were dissolved, so that today there are none left. Our spirited and energetic musicians of Chicago, however, decided to establish a new musical society in which all lovers of song and music in America are invited to participate. The purpose of this society is to enrich the musical sentiment and appreciation of our music-loving youth not only in Chicago but in the entire country.</p>
   <p>The need for such a musical organization became especially apparent at the time when the question of the exploitation of our typical, provincial Greek musicians at our numerous Greek wedding celebrations first arose. It was at such celebrations that the groom, the best man, and their friends expected the wedding guests to pay for nearly all the expenses of the wedding by throwing or offering money to the instrument players during the excitement of the Greek dances. This practice has not yet been abandoned, but this sad state of affairs and the shameless exploitation of even our ordinary amateur Greek musicians must cease.</p>
   <p>We are informed that many efforts are being made to re-establish the Greek Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of Chicago under the direction of our well-known music instructor, Mr. Spero Bekatoros.</p>
   <p>Here is a noble task which deserves the approval and support of all! The organization of musical clubs and gymnasiums for the development of the art of music and the strengthening of our youths' bodies must attract the attention of every Greek community in America. It was through music and gymnastics that our ancestors, the ancient Greeks, became a great people. Music makes for the nobility of the soul, while gymnastics and strenuous physical exercise make for a strong and beautiful body.</p>
   <p>Forward, then! Let us all take part in this new movement. The signal has been given by our loyal, patriotic, and progressive Chicago community with our worthy Greek musicians in the forefront.</p>
