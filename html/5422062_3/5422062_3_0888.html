   <p>The Hellenic Post of the American Legion, which is raising funds for a monument to a World War hero who has gone home, staged an elaborate program last Tuesday, at the"Own Your Home" Exposition on East Chicago Ave.</p>
   <p>A festival entitled a "Night in Greece" was its theme. The Tsoukalas Greek Dancers danced on the Exposition lawn, and male members of the Hellenic Post in Greek costumes gave folk dances on the Exposition terrace.</p>
   <p>Two huge tents were placed on the Exposition plaza to provide dressing rooms for the several hundred performers.</p>
   <p>The design for the monument by the sculptor Basil Goumas is on display at the Exposition. It is to be erected to the memory of H. Dilboy who was killed in action on July 18th, 1918 and was subsequently awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for exceptional bravery.</p>
