   <p>The country frolic of the Cretans' society which took place last Sunday will remain unforgotten by those who were lucky enough to witness the event. Greeks, who have never seen Cretan dances are advised of the opportunity to witness the ancient dances of the 5,000 year old Minoic civilization.</p>
   <p>The Cretan dances of today are identical to the traditional ones of the Cretan civilization of 5,000 years ago. Note-worthy dances are the Syrto and Sousta which are distinguished for grace, and the Pentozalis which is purely an ancient Pyrrhic dance.</p>
   <p>Greek mythology tells us that the Cretans were the first to promote the art of dancing, and that Rhea, wife of Saturn, when she begot Zeus invited the Cretans to dance the Pyrrhic dance, Pentozalis, accompanied by the celestial melodies of Saturn. Hence the Cretans developed the art of dancing and today every one of them is a good dancer.</p>

   <p>Noted dancers at last Sundays affair were George Videlakis, N. Katsicovalos, D. Gerakaris, Basil Fasoulas, John Georgakakis, M. Mamalakis, M. Barbunis, John Saridakis, E. Markakis, E. Busikounakis, Theodore Androulakis and G. Vasilakis.</p>
   <p>The Cretan maidens and matrons attired in the colorful apparel of the Minoic era, their faces and bodies beautified by the conviviality of the affair, performed the Cretan dances like nymphs of fire. Noted among them were: Mrs. Maria Christopoulou, Mrs. Maria Agelakis, Mrs. Maria Koumentakis; Mrs. Ch. Stathoudakis. Among the graceful maidens were: Misses I. Mavromichelakis; Marianthe Safiakis; Chrysin Gerakaris and Catherine Kissamitakis.</p>
   <p>The orchestra of George Anifantakis echoed with melodies of long ago, and the Cretan lyre played by Constantine Tsayadakis presented magical and alluring tones identical to those that possibly were attributed to the lyre of Hermes.</p>

   <p>When the joy and enthusiasm reached its height Commander of the Pan-Cretan Federation, Dr. John Volicos after eulogizing the event and the devotion of the Cretans to the traditions of ancient Greece, asked Dr. Salopoulos to dance the "Armatores" as it was performed on the summit of Olympus. Dr. Salopoulos, being a scion of Tegea, complied and the result being that old timer, Dr. Volicos was compelled to lay down his arms of Crete and capitulate to the Tegeatan, Dr. Salopoulos.</p>
