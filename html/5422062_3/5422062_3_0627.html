   <p>Young Greeks of Chicago, devotees of the dramatic art, who recently organized the first Greek troupe in Chicago, presented the popular play, "Esme e Tourkopoula" (Esme the (Turkish) Girl) at Turner Hall last Sunday. The performance was acclaimed by Chicago newspapers as a brilliant success. Practically all the press commented very favorably, and in flattering terms described the naturalness of the young Greeks, whose acting was pleasing and realistic.</p>
   <p>"Orpheus" is the name of the Greek troupe, and true to tradition, these young Chicago Greeks have the power, as Orpheus had, of charming even inanimate objects with their lyres.</p>
   <p>In response to numerous requests the performance will be repeated next Sunday at Hull House so that the crowds of people who wish to see this popular drama <span class="page-break">2</span>may have an opportunity to do so.</p>
   <p>The troupe intends to present in the immediate future another play, "Sklava" (The Slave Girl), for the benefit of the national defense fund of Greece.</p>
   <p>Announcements of the production will soon be published.</p>
