   <p>In behalf of the Greek movie company known as the Cosmograph Hellenic Films Company, which has just brought the movie entitled, "This is Life" to Chicago,....I desire to invite all of you to take part in the beauty contest we are sponsoring. On the committee chosen as judges will be members of Ladies' clubs, scholars, professional men and women, and American art critics. The judging will be done in the aristocratic Aragon Ballroom, February 18.</p>
   <p>The plan and hope of the Cosmograph Hellenic Films is to choose for the first time the three loveliest--in face and body--Greek girls. Beside that, we hope to encourage all Greek girls to be proud of their lineage by making them aware that the people to which they belong is one famous for its <span class="page-break">\2</span>lovely women.....</p>
   <p>The contestants will parade in front of the judges and the assembled family groups in evening dress. The three winners will be rewarded with rich and queenly gifts. The nine girls chosen as ladies-in-waiting to the queen will also receive lovely gifts.</p>
   <p>Most important of all, the first three contestants will be assigned parts in the films, the work on which we hope will soon be started in our Chicago studios. We hope to establish successful Greek movies in Chicago, using Greek beauties as stars.</p>
   <p>Should you decide to enter this dignified beauty contest, please communicate at once with our headquarters at 110 South Dearborn Street, Suite 905....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Someone from the Ladies' Committee will always be on hand to accept your name and picture.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Cosmograph Hellenic Films,</p>
   <p>Nicholas A. Christy.</p>
