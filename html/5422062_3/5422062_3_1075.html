   <p>A year has passed since the death of Christ Damascus, journalist, who labored untiringly and ceaselessly for the progress of the Greeks in America. His labors were so arduous and so heartbreaking that his body sickened and sought repose in death.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday the Reverend Leon Pygeas conducted memorial services that were marked by their simplicity and dignity.</p>
   <p>Christ Damascus was an ideal type of Greek. His straightforwardness and the inherent nobility of his soul enabled him to look at the world with his head held high. He was educated and prepared for the teaching profession, but later switched to the field of journalism. He entered a very trying profession, one in which you are sometimes an outcast, and at other times the prodigal son of the community which you serve. Usually it is a position barren of material or spiritual gain. Yet it is a profession without which a community cannot exist, since a newspaper is the unifying medium of large heterogeneous groups of people.</p>
   <p>It is very difficult for society to judge the merits of a journalist. At times he is glorified undeservingly, and at other times he is hated and despised without just reasons. The criticizm is directly in proportion to the education and intellectual level of the members of the community.</p>
   <p>For this reason the late Mr. Damascus had many admirers, but he also had many enemies who believed him to be extreme and biased in his beliefs.</p>
   <p>This newspaper, in order to refrain from praising someone who so closely controlled its destiny, instead of printing its opinion of Mr. Damascus will print a letter written to the general public by the late Mr. Damascus a few days prior to his death.</p>
   
   <p>His letter will show more clearly than we could, the true character and the basic intentions of the late lamented journalist:</p>
   <p>"My beloved co-patriots: Having heard the call of our Almighty God, I am preparing myself to appear before the heavenly tribunal which will judge my earthly actions. I do not consider myself to have committed any great sin, but I cannot believe that I have never been unjust or unkind to a human being, even if I always tried to be just and good. I have honestly endeavored to let kindness and consideration rule my thoughts and govern my actions. In accordance with the precepts of my religion, which believes in confession and then forgiveness of sins, I desire to express my sorrow for any action that has caused grief or harm to anyone. I implore the forgiveness of those whom I have injured, whether knowingly or unknowingly. If through hastiness or bias I have been unjust, I humbly apologize.</p>
   <p>"All my life I have desired nothing more than to be able to serve individuals, society, or my country; and aid them toward a solution of their problems. For Greece, I would have given my life if it had been of the slightest benefit to her. Feeling that death is coming closer to my bed each day, my thoughts have been taking a turn toward the philosophical. Slowly, the unimportance of so many worldly matters which so engross our attention in our short life, becomes impressed upon my mind.</p>
   <p>"Now, in my dying hours, I feel impressed by two things only; the inspiring Christian religion, and the beautiful land of my birth, in which I desire to be interred.....</p>
   <p>"I offer thanks to my wife and my relations, who have been so kind during this long period of my sickness....</p>
   <p>"Please forgive me as you hope to be forgiven some day; and may the Lord shower you with blessings.</p>
   <p>Christ Damascus."</p>
