   <p>p. 5.-- Several days ago, J. Kolovos and M. Athanastakos came from the West bringing with them a famous film "The Glory of Greece." This film which is 13,500 feet long, shows the celebration of the centennial anniversary of Greece's Freedom. The film cost $10,000 and is one of the best Greece has ever made. It met with great success in New York where it stayed for a whole week. The Greeks of Chicago are very fortunate to be able to see this picture. Don't miss it.</p>
