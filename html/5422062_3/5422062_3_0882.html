   <p>The new Greek church of Pullman, Saint Spiridon, is giving this coming Sunday, July 7, their first annual Picnic for their church and their school, the Plutarch.</p>
   <p>We recommend all Greek people, especially those living in the eastern section of the city, to help as much as possible those who are promoting the church of St. Spiridon, in their endeavors.</p>
