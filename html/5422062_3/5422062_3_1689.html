   <p>p. 1- In our last article we wrote that the Order of Ahepa was without definite aim or purpose, and we promised our readers that we would prove this statement in our columns today.</p>
   <p>Our first step will be to recall the time when the order was established and the causes which prompted its establishment. These causes are so familiar to all that we need not go into details; very little need be said to recall them to our memory and convince ourselves that the circumstances which led to the foundation of Ahepa no longer exist, and that ever since they disappeared, the Society has been simply an opportunist affair.</p>
   <p>About ten years ago, as all the Greeks in America remember, the infamous order of the Ku Klux Klan or K.K.K. was at the height of its influence <span class="page-break">\2</span>and was employing all possible means to rid the country of foreign immigrants.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that the purpose of this movement was to protect the business interests of those who had immigrated long before, and whose trade had been much affected by the arrival of the modern Greek, who established far better restaurants and confectioneries and had begun to offer strenuous competition to other shops which had been established long before.</p>
   <p>The Ku Klux Klan, which was very strong in the southern part of the United States, began an organized war against the Greeks and was successful in compelling many to give up their business establishments.</p>
   <p>"One-hundred-per-cent American" was the slogan of the K.K.K., and the Greeks of the South suffered so much by its persecution that they undertook to find means of defense and salvation. Their method of defending themselves was to unite in a strong organization and that they, too, were "one-hundred-per-cent American."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To prove their claim to "one-hundred-per-cent Americanism" they established the Order of Ahepa. This is the reason for Ahepa's adoption of the "one-hundred-per-cent American" policy and for the use of the English language in its regular meetings. Ahepa's purpose was to Americanize the entire Hellenism of America according to the principles of the K.K.K., and the name of the organization is not at all symbolic of the principles which it had adopted, - American-Hellenic Educational Progressive Association or Ahepa. In other words, Ahepa became a branch of the Three K's and many members of the Ku Klux Klan enlisted in the ranks of Ahepa so that they might properly guide the order on the same course which was followed by the Klan. This is the reason why Ahepa became a secret society like the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, the Klan subsided and became harmless to the Greeks. But the Order of Ahepa had now acquired great momentum in its development, for it had discovered virgin soil among the Greek-Americans. This was because it was known to be a secret society, the first one organized by Greeks in America, and it began to take in new territory very rapidly and made great <span class="page-break">\4</span>progress, Many of its members enrolled for protective purposes, and many joined because they believed in the principle of "Americanization."</p>
   <p>The order consisted of Greeks with various motives and of various principles, - Greeks who had cast aside their Greek sentiments and Greeks who were true and sincere "Hellenes," - Greeks who were ignorant of the Greek language and of Greek ethics and found an opportunity to express their sentiments by offering their services toward the promotion of the interests of their sponsors, the members of the Klan, - and desired to exploit the organization for their own profit.</p>
   <p>Gut in its progress Ahepa has acquired many members who believe in one-hundred-per-cent Hellenism and naturally do not want the organization to adhere to the policy of one-hundred-per-cent Americanism. They prefer to promote the interests of their own nationality. We have not the slightest doubt that the majority of the members of the Order of Ahepa today are loyal and sincere Greeks who want Ahepa to be a Greek organization with the purpose of promoting the cause of Hellenism in the land in which we now live.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The statements which we have already made make it clear that Ahepa was established with a purpose far different from that at present pursued by its members. In fact, Ahepa has lost the original object of its existence and today exists without any object whatever.</p>
   <p>And so we now find ourselves in this very peculiar situation: not a single Ahepan knows the purpose of his organization! Every Ahepan who is asked what the purpose of his organization, is replies by expressing his own conception of the purpose of the Order, inventing one to suit his individual tastes.</p>
   <p>By my contention that Ahepa today is without a purpose I do not imply that it has no reason to exist. I do not aim by what I have written to disintegrate the Order of Ahepa but merely to bring to the attention to all Ahepans the present state of affairs so that they may not become victims of the crafty few who are attempting to mislead them with imaginary purposes and to conceal from them the original aims of the Order.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>It is time for those who are exploiting the Greeks of the Order of Ahepa to realize that the majority of the members of the Order want it to be a Greek organization; the exploiters cannot continue to suppress the Hellenic sentiments which prevail among Ahepans and come to light in various ways within the organization. If Ahepa today exists without purpose or aim, be assured that in due time it will discover a new purpose and pursue it. We hope that Ahepa will begin its search for such a purpose immediately, and we feel convinced that sooner or later the Order will become a Greek organization with this purpose in view, - the promotion of the interests of Hellenism in America and the preservation of our Greek nationality in the land in which we now live. Only with such a purpose will Ahepa be able to survive in the hearts of the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>If members still exist in the Order of Ahepa who have renounced their Greek nationality and think that they have become Americans, they are sadly mistaken and are the victims of an illusion. They are without national spirit, and we suggest that they withdraw from everything which is Greek. Those unfortunates who have been so led astray should at last realize the extent of their error and not try to hinder the evolution and <span class="page-break">\7</span>the metamorphosis of the Order of Ahepa, which can save itself only by becoming a Greek organization for the promotion of the cause of Hellenism in the United States.</p>
