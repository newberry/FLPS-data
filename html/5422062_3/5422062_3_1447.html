   <p>Last Thursday the Greek community of Chicago had an opportunity to hear the distinguished visitor, Mr. George D. Fragoudis, attorney, journalist, statesman and author of many books. He delivered his lecture before a crowded and chosen audience at the convention hall of Ahepa.</p>
   <p>The theme of his speech was the system of education and culture in Greece, and with historical data and convincing arguments brought out the fact that the Greek system is inadequate, lacking political culture and the method of moulding of character. He attributed the present misfortune of Greece to such a lacking.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fragoudis, due to his wide experience in political life, is thoroughly convinced that Greece in order to save herself from further deterioration, must turn her full attention to education. To that effect he decided to devote the rest of his life. Recently, owing to his efforts, a society was organized in Athens under the name of The Educational Rebirth whose object will be to establish an Academy of Political Science for the education and culture of future statesmen and government officials.</p>
   
   <p>The building of the Academy, which is built by contributions, is nearly completed and next Fall classes will begin. Many of the professors of the National University and various political personages declared that they will offer their services as teachers gratis.</p>
   <p>We can not but congratulate from the bottom of our hearts Mr. Fragoudis for his patriotism and devotion to national welfare.</p>
