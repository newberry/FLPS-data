   <p>Both Mr. Kanellos and myself wish to thank you for your steadfast support of our Hellenic Art Festival. You stood with all your power and force back of our "Dionysia" like the great Mount Olympos. Your continual sacrifice for the beautiful ideals of Greece, brings forth my deepest respect and admiration and gratitude. You cannot know what it meant to us in all the work and great responsibility of such an art program to know that we could depend upon your great strength and kindness. With out you, our task would have been impossible.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope you will honor us with a visit here this summer. I think you will enjoy our simple country life with the cool breezes and open spaces. We are very happy to be here with our babies and to have the garden to work in.</p>

   <p>We want to tell you again of our great love and affection - You are truly a descendant of the great Emparors, noble in heart as in lineage, of the finest of these great Hellenes which we all admire so much.</p>
   <p>We look forward to continuing the work in St. Louis and the other cities. With your fine endorsement and help it should be a fine success.</p>
   <p>All respect and honor to you, our dear Prince Paleologos.---</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Charlotte Mrakham Kanellos- "Tanagra".</p>
