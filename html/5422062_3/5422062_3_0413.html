   <p>Despite the fact that the evening services in honor of St. Constantine drew a large number of the Greek community away from the benefit performance sponsored by the Eptanisos, or Seven Islands' Benevolent Association, the entertainment proved an artistic and economic success.</p>
   <p>The play, "One Night of Life," was written by the foremost Greek playwright of this period, Spyro Melas, and was presented at the Eighth Street Theater last Sunday night. It was presented with an artistry that is all too rare in the Greek theaters of Chicago. The Eptanisos deserves commendation for choosing such a means of raising funds.</p>
