   <p>Mr. Murley, Professor of Classic Languages at Northwestern University, the guest of honor and principal speaker at a testimonial dinner given by the Greek Professionals Men's Club, in honor of Chicago Greek graduates from various Universities, delivered the following speech under the caption, "What Significance has Ancient Greece for us"?</p>
   <p>"I assume that our interest in ancient Greece is not merely archiological, as of a once beautiful statue which has lost its nose, ears and arms. We are especially concerned with those attitudes and achievements which bear vitally upon us, today. I wish therefore to run through a number of traits, especially certain paradoxes which were essential to the classical Greeks and are also immediately significant to us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"They were is their way exceedingly traditonal, conservative, and the convention, 'Womos', was powerful over them. And yet they proved great innovators. At any given time they might seem to be reproducing what they and their predecessors had always done,i.e. like Socrates said, according to Alcibiades in Platos Symposium, 'Seeming always to be saying the same thing about the same thing.' They had little sympathy with rash experiments and irresponsible vagary. Although they had the same athletic events through out the generations, conventions of the drama, set metres regarded as canonical for each of the several types of poetry, yet they made rapid progress in Art from the archaic tunes to Phidiar; and Aeschylus was felt to be archaic almost before he was dead.</p>
   <p>"The explanation of this paradox lies largely in the fact that the Greeks made very few false starts. We have much affectation and gesticulation of progress today, like the man of whom it was once said, inadvertently, that he rushed off rapidly in all directions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>One would think from the old Greek's manner that he should have made much less progress than he did and from our's that we should make much more progress than we do.</p>
   <p>"We have had silly extremes of eccentricity, lately, flag-pole sitters and marathon dancers. This sort of thing, like th dancing of Hippoclides on his head, which Herodotos tells us, cost Hippoclides his bride, was to the Greeks simple (silly). It is a device to avoid competition by doing something so foolish, that few others would stoop to do it, whereas, the Greeks courted and dared competition. We have had our absurdities such as the worse forms of free verse, and even more unintelligible impressionistic art. The research for novelty of treatment and subject, begins in Greek art and literature, says one critic, when the belief in life and zest of living began to fail.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"The Greeks were mature in their understanding of life. Yet they had the joy of living and continued power of invention, as if they were children, which indeed the Egyptian in the Timaeus of Plato (of the race of which it is said that they could learn but not forget), assured Solon they all were. 'Greek literature,' says the same critic, 'is often sad but it is with the sadness that springs from love of life, not from distrust or weariness'. It is not hard to see the pertinancy of this lesson to our time, with its debunking biographies calculated to leave, not Launcelot brave nor Arthur pure,' and all the cynicism and disillusionment which are so characteristic of today.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks were brilliantly clever, but they escaped the natural temptation of the clever, to be superficial. Hesiod had observed that before the attainment of virtue the immortal gods put untiring effort and a steep path to it. Horace admitted that his countrymen were not willing to take as much pains as the Greeks did, with their literature.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"A paradox analogous to this is their extraordinary combination of idealism and practicability. The idealism, alone might have been the one that elevated the other, and the latter kept the former sane. Plato's ideal wise man, except in the most meta physical of dialogues still reminds us of the market place and daily duties.</p>
   <p>"Beside the qualitative standard of conduct to which we are accustomed, the belief that some acts are always wrong intrisically and some always right, stands the Greek quantitative standard, the concept of balance in art, architecture and life. The Greeks took much more seriously than we, fanaticism and whatever disturbs the adjustment of a healthy mind in a healthy body; that is why students find it so hard to translate their words for self-control in to English. Surely in the age of pleasures scarcily less strenuous than our work, this time of popularization of fancy psychological complexes the ancient lesson of equilibrium is vitally essential.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"Yet there might be labored out a loose paradox between this emphasis on quantity in internal relations and the bold disregard of it in externals.</p>
   <p>They showed a fine disdain of comparative numbers in the Persian wars, and in the realm of opinion and knowledge, Plato is never weary of insisting that the one man, who knows, is more valuable than a thousand ignoramuses. From a era of questionnaires, fads and frills and carefully classified reactions of ignorance, we hark back with relief to men whose stupendous individual merit defies statistics.</p>
   <p>"The classical Greeks were preoccupied with two loves above all men of whom we know: the love of glory and the love of beauty. So much of this is true that the difference amounts to one of a kind rather than merely of a degree. Horace spoke of that race, as compared to the Roman (or American) money-seekers, as greedy for nothing but glory. And St. Paul was impressed because all the severe exertion and stern self-denial of their athletic training was suffered to get a wreath, Ruskin's 'Crown of wild Olive.'</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>we must remember that most of this love of praise, was love of the praiseworthy.</p>
   <p>"As for the other love, it is very noticeable that the Greeks expressed ethical ideas in very aesthetic terms. Objectionable conduct was not so much morally bad in our sense as 'Apre pes Aschemon Plemeles.' Virtue was obtained through the intellectual, inasmuch as Plato argued that virtue could be taught and a man learned the best he knew. Even Homer had the ghost of Agammemnon assure Odysseus that Penelope would not kill him because she knew better. So that when keats said, in the 'Ode on the Grecian Urn,' 'Beauty is truth, truth Beauty,' it was more than a piece of rhetoric.</p>
   <p>Homer and Tyrtateous would not have urged the point that old men should be protected in battle, because the dead body of an old man is unseemly to see exposed, compared to that of a young man, had not the Greeks felt more strongly about the primary of beauty than we do. So the beauty of Helen excluded her conduct and Hyperides is said to have secured the acquittal of his mistresd. on the same ground. Truth, beauty and righteousness had more in common for those Greeks than they have for us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>I have suggested at several points the significance of certain ancient Greek attitudes towards us today. The question arises what share has the modern Greek in that former glory? If he lives unworthy of it, that unparalleled past is an eloquent accusation against him. If my father was a millionaire and I am a pauper, especially if I have squandered my patrimony, what have I to be proud of. It is a challenge with as overwhelming odds for the Greek of today facing his history, as when little Greece met vast Persia at the Marathon. Perhaps it is impossible for him, literally, to measure up to his ancestors. But those young Greeks who have won academic laurels, and the rest as well, may claim this impressive heritage with proper modesty if and only if, they face life with an honest and vigorous devotion to those standards of high excellence, of perfection, which would satisfy their fathers.</p>
