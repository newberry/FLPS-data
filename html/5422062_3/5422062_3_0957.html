   <p>Mr. Lazarus Lazarides became first known to the Greek world at large, and especially among the literary circles of Constantinople, where he was born, when he studied ancient Greek monuments in situ, in ancient Kyzicus, Priapus, and other Greek cities along the Sea of Propontis. He was then assistant to Mr. Mistakides, director of the Constantinople Museum and professor of history in the Grand National College of Constantinople.</p>
   <p>He also took part in the poetic and ancient epigrammatic contest. When he was acting as director of the Greek College at Panormos, Asis Minor, he was a regular contributor of Constantinople's great daily, Tachydromos, in which, among others, he published poetic collections on the Finnish epic, "Kalevala", and translations from the "Lomsiades of the Portuguese poet, Kamoens. In 1911, he published his first volume of poems under the title, "The Breeze</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In 1911, he published his first volume of poems under the title, "The Breeze of Granicus", which was warmly commended by Mr. Aristides Phoutrides, the distinguished Greek at Harvard University, where he teaches Greek and Latin Literature.</p>
   <p>In the year 1912 the "Breeze of Granicus" appeared in a second edition with "Theodote", another poetic collection by the same author.</p>
   <p>In 1917, "The Sighs of Daphnis", his third and most beautiful work, was published. Other poems of his were being published from time to thime in Pieria, a magazine of poetry.</p>
   <p>In Chicago recently the poet published the "Adrasteia", an excellent and inspiring poetic collection of poems in praise of the cities of classical Greece.</p>
   <p>By studying the development of Mr. Lazarides' entire literary production, one sees clearly the stages of his literary evolution. Regardless of the unimportance <span class="page-break">3</span>of his first efforts, his lines, though simple, contain a pathos and lyricism of a high order. Clearness of thought and a musical rhythm, with a sparse use of symbolism are the principle characteristics of his poems.</p>
   <p>In his "Theodote", the art of the poet in the composition of more intricate and involved themes becomes clearer, as in "Hecuba" and "Maria and Eupolis", two of his most exquisite poems. His art, power of execution, lofty inspiration, and the artistic ordering of his compositions are clearly circumscribed with a profound analysis of human nature in "The Sighs of Daphnis" and "Phyllis' Flute".</p>
   <p>The evolution of the subject's plot and its selection in these idyllic poems place Mr. Lazarides among the outstanding modern poets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarides has been mainly criticized by Chicago literary connoisseurs and critics for the frequent and extensive use of the popular fifteen-syllabic line in blank verse. To my judgment, however, the poet, as is seen in his other works, and especially in his sonnets, has put these pastorals metrically in a <span class="page-break">4</span>more simple composition for the sole purpose of giving a Doric simplicity and grandeur to the unaffected description of idyllic life; thus, he was saved from repeating the errors of most other modern and contemporary poets; that is, the adorning and loading of the poetic concept and strophe with an affected and hollow verse.</p>
   <p>As far as his recent work, "Adrasteia", is concerned, the myth and the depiction of character are dispensed with in most of his poem. These elements are encountered in only three or four of his major poems, namely, "Ephesos", "Zeleia", "Troy", and "Byzantium". All of his other literary and poetic works belong to pure lyric poetry and to the various types of hymns and odes.</p>
   <p>In his minor compositions one distinguishes the following characteristics: a supple and rhythmic verse, an unadulterated symbolism, a richness of diction and a careful classification of the material. In most of his compositions we notice the beauty of the rhythmic effect even to the smallest detail.</p>
   <p>In order to comprehend fully the poetic inspiration, and the artistic power of <span class="page-break">5</span>the poet, one must compare his poems to similar poems of other poets. We do not know in which one of these two forms the poet excells even himself,--in subjective or objective poetry.</p>
   <p>I would like to call the attention of my readers to the rich vocabulary and poetic diction of the composition and to the ornamental and flowery verse. There are more than four thousand words in the last two volumes. This is a significant observation, for we must consider that the richness of diction is paralleled by the composition's length. As many modern critics have remarked, a modern author or a reporter seldom uses more than one thousand words.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarides' "Adrasteia" resembles much the great masterpiece of one of the greatest Greek poets, Calvos, who first invented this type of poetic composition.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazarides is not very well-known to the general Greek literary world. Nevertheless, he is the best poet that the Greeks of Chicago ever had the pleasure and honor to have in their midst. His final triumph is close at hand and easy <span class="page-break">6</span>to be attained, because the poet of "Adrasteia" is not an amateur writer of verse, but one of those undaunted and daring wanderers in a realistic age, who have devoted all their lives with self-sacrifice and admirable zeal, to the adoration and worship of Art and Beauty.</p>
