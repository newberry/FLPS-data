   <p>One of the most important events of the Christmas holiday season, which will remain forever in the memory of the Greeks of Chicago, was the annual ball of the Association of Greek Confectionery Men. This affair not only surpassed any other previous and similar social event in brilliance and magnificence, but it also won the admiration and elicited the applause of all those who attended and contributed to the success of the gathering.</p>
   <p>The flower of our society was present; hundreds of families in their best clothes, charming young ladies in gay dresses and beautiful formal gowns, all the members of the professional ranks, businessmen, and representatives of the press made the affair a brilliant spectacle and a rare gathering of happy, smiling, and cheerful people. Many American families and friends, as well as representatives of American business and industry, accepted our invitation to join in our festivities and enjoy the company of our most prominent leaders and outstanding members of our Greek-American society. It is estimated that there were some fifteen hundred men, women, and children present at this memorable Christmas gathering.</p>
   <p>The success of this excellent affair is evidence of the power and influence of the well-organized and excellently functioning Association of Greek Confectionery Men. The Greek Star is indeed happy to see that its fervent hopes and wishes in behalf of the Association, which represents a large part of Greek business enterprise in Chicago, are being realized.</p>
   <p>We are indeed pleased to announce the brilliant success of the confectionery men's ball and extend our warm congratulations to those who had an active hand in organizing it. We give three cheers for our confectionery men. Mr. Pericles J. Manousopoulos is president of the Association; Mr. Bill Varellas is secretary. Messrs. Bill Georgakopoulos and James Floros led the grand march at the ball.</p>
