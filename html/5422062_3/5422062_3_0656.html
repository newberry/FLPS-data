   <p>The performance of "Athanasios Diakos" (the name of a Greek patriot, burned at the stake by the Turks, in Greece's fight for liberty), which was given last Sunday in the impressive Auditorium Theater, was a tremendous success. All the dramatic groups in Chicago took part in this stirring play which was written by A. Galanou.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the play are for the orphans and widows of the war.</p>
   <p>From an artistic point of view the drama was a complete success. The dramatists worked with unending zeal to make this event one to be remembered. However, it was not a financial success due to the efforts of a group of charlatans who have no right to call themselves Greeks, and still less right to be thought of as patriots.</p>

   <p>These charlatans are guilty of a heinous crime perpetrated against helpless little children and poor widows, who are the victims of war. We leave the judgment of these traitors in the hands of the community.</p>
   <p>Mr. Angelo Grygoropoulos took the part of "Diakos" and made his portrayal an unforgettable one. In the second act he held the audience spellbound when he quoted the famous lines spoken by Diakos as he was burned at the stake because he would not change his religion and become a Turk: "I was born a Greek, and I will die a Greek."</p>
