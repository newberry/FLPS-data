   <p>p.1.- The young men of our Greek community assembled, one evening, and decided to form an Athletic Club. Their purpose is educational, militaristic, athletic and patriotic. The formation of this club has much significance. We hope it does not go the way of so many Greek clubs that believe in fighting each other instead of working together. We heartily congratulate our boys for the fine spirit they have shown. They are the heart and soul of the coming generation and we are proud of them. May they continue this good work for years to come.</p>
