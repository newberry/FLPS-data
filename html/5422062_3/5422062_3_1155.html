   <p>We have heard that one of our dear colleagues is trying to cause considerable trouble for us in our dealings with the Chicago Post Office. To him we have a few words to say.</p>
   <p>We paid a visit to the post office and cleared up some minor misunderstandings. The post office stated that it was very sorry to have caused such unnecessary trouble which started with misleading information.</p>
   <p>Our dear colleague is trying to push Loxias back from the top row as a leading Greek newspaper. He does not know that the publisher and editor of Loxias has successfully established six Greek newspapers in America and consequently is well versed in the game of journalism.</p>

   <p>Our colleague tried to harm us but he did nothing but good because the public rallied to support us and proved its loyalty to our paper.</p>
   <p>Our aim is to give the public unprejudiced and unbiased news. We open their eyes to what is going on around them. We help them, we advise them. And thus we preserve Hellenism in America.</p>
