   <p>To-day was the last day of the sessions of the representatives of the Pan-Arcadian convention which was held in St. Basil's Church.</p>
   <p>There in the spacious church hall the representatives of the twenty branches of the Pan-Arcadian Brotherhood formulated the constitution of their society and laid the foundation for future social work, benefits, and enjoyment by providing for insurance and compensation and excursions to the homeland for the members of the organization.</p>
   <p>This brotherhood has every opportunity to become the strongest Greek organization in the Chicago district, since the largest settlement of Arcadians is located in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>The work of the convention was very ably directed by Attorney George Kyriakopoulos, who presided, and by Mr. Heniades, the secretary,</p>
   <p>But the guiding spirit of the meetings was Mr. Anestes Phanos of the editorial staff of Altantis. He is the apostle of this organization as well as the founder of it, and by his advice and instruction he enlightened the convention on various points.</p>
   <p>Mr. Phanos was also the principal speaker at the banquet of the organization, which was attended by a multitude of Arcadians.</p>
   <p>He recommended that Greeks make a united effort to preserve their language, their faith, and their schools in order to preserve their national consciousness here and to be able to spread the high ideals of the ancient Greeks.</p>
   
   <p>For these reasons he advocated an annual excursion to Greece to be conducted by the newly-established Pan-Arcadian Union.</p>
   <p>The convention ended its sessions by electing officers and voting in favor of an excursion to Greece.</p>
   <p>The officers elected are George Kyriakopoulos, grand president, George Anthoules, grand vice-president, Anastassios Megremes, grand treasurer, John Agriostathes, grand secretary, and Andrew Vlahos, grand legal advisor.</p>
