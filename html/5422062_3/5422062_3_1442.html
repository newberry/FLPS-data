   <p>The Ahepan chapter No. 46 is preparing for us a very special occasion next Thursday. At the Lodge Hall, 190 N. State Street, we will hear a lecture by Mr. George E. Mylonas, Professor of Archeology at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>His theme will be "Archeological Finds in Greek Territory", but his talk will center mostly around Peloponnesus. The lecture will be of great interest and value to every Greek person.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mylonas will be introduced by the Professor of Comparative Languages at the University of Chicago, Mr. Carl D. Buck. Prof. Buck is conducting classes in "New Greek" this fall and was invited by his pupils to attend this lecture.</p>
