   <p>On March 24, the Greek Post of the American Legion sponsored a wrestling program at the Casino Theater. Three pairs of Greek wrestlers took part in the bouts; among them were the nationally known George Basil and Spyros Vorres.</p>
   <p>It would be a reflection on us if we did not express our thanks to Mr. D. Pantelis, a Chicago lawyer, who made this event such a success by his energy and sincere interest. We also wish to thank the young men who took part in the bouts.</p>
   <p>The Post plans to sponsor another program of this kind in the near future.</p>
