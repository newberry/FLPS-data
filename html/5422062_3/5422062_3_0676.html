   <p>The fine dramatic group called Sophocles gave a splendid dramatic performance last Sunday of "Esme, the Turkish Maiden".</p>
   <p>The theater was packed to overflowing, and the performance excelled the highest expectations of the audience. The young and attractive John Stavrogiannis played the lead, showing his fine artistic ability. The acting of Mr. John Kouvarakus was very natural, and was heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>The part of "Esme was taken by John Bogiantzopoulos, and he was highly successful in it. And we do not wish to forget Mr. Angelos Tsinonis, the microscopic comedian who as "Birkon" stole the show.....The others who took part are to be congratulated upon their fine performances.</p>
   <p>We cannot finish without mentioning the well-known musician of our city, Mr. Nick Varzos, who has aroused our finer senses and the memories of our homeland with his music. The applause he received is the best criterion of his ability and popularity.</p>
