   <p>p. 4 Two hundred and fifty Greek girls of Chicago have enrolled in the "Popularity Contest" to take place on Apr. 27th. The winners will be those who obtain the highest number of votes cast by the Greeks of Chicago. This forthcoming affair is expected to draw from five to ten thousand Greeks.</p>
   <p>Ancient Greece left nothing undone in regard to the promotion of any thing that was good. Beauty contests originated in Ancient Greece. History tells us that the King of Arcadia in conjunction with the festivities of the Eleusinean Diana, ordered beauty contests to be held. The crowned queen of that contest was Erodiki, wife of Kypselos. From this contest we see that married women were not barred from the competition. Pausanias, tells us that the contestants were called Chrysoforae (goldin-attired). Theophrastos tells us that the Eleans held masculine beauty contest, and the winner was awarded a weapon and narrow band which was placed around his head, and leading a procession he laid the weapon in the temple of Athena. The same writer tells us, other contests were held of prudence, purity, temperance, of pleasures and desires and housekeeping. This last contest of economy in housekeeping <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>would be a great benefit and salvation to us moderns if we took the notion to advocate it, as a contest. It would diminish the number of divorces.</p>
   <p>Also the same author says that in Tenedos and Lesbos beauty contests took place with great pride and enthusiasm, and that the women of Tenedos were the most beautiful in all the known civilized world.</p>
   <p>For the benefit of our readers we mention a few of the ancient noted beauties:</p>
   <p>Thargilia the Melesian, who possessed rare beauty and wisdom, and married fourteen times, according to Ippias in his Synagogue; Anoutis from Asia, according to Deinon; Timosa the mistress of Exarchos as Philarch says in his 9th and 10th writings. Zenopatheia, the moth of Lysandros, was the most beautiful woman in Peloponnesus, according to Theopompos in his 6th and 50th historical writings, and many others.</p>
   <p>Beauty is a devine gift, but if it is not accompanied by prudence and temperance it leads the possessor in to libidinous ways. In conclusion we the moderns reproduce what the Ancients have done in hundreds of centuries past.</p>
