   <p>Our Reverend Hariton Panagopoulos has just released the December issue of the only Greek church and sociological periodical of its kind in America. It contains timely religious articles.</p>
   <p>In Religious Echo there are articles on the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ; the story of the commemorative ceremony in honor of Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myron, or a biography of the Saint, which serves as an example for the salvation of the faithful; a document from the Greek Consul in Chicago, explaining the proper manner of using the name of His Majesty Alexander, the King of Greece, during church services; an appeal by the central committee in New York and the Greek Consul in Chicago, soliciting funds for our unfortunate fellow countrymen in Asia Minor and Thrace; an article on the validity of the ceremony performed by a non-Greek Orthodox bishop at Holyoke, Massachusetts, at the dedication of a church there; the bylaws of the relief organization of the Greek Orthodox community at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In previous issues of the Religious Echo much has been said about this agency; an admirable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>article on work, likening wealth to a feast, of which only those who work partake, and characterizing the idle as harmful individuals impeding the progress of society; on lying when buying, on whether it should be wholly prohibited or permissible on certain occasions; a eulogy on the liberation of Jerusalem by Great Britain; an article concerning the illegal and anti-religious practices of Pastor Mercouris, who went to the parish of another pastor at East Moline, Illinois, creating a scandal and causing ill-feeling.</p>
   <p>The annual subscription to this periodical is $1.60. The price of one issue is fourteen cents.</p>
