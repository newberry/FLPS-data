   <p>p. 5.- Thousands of Tegeatans were present at the Kerasitsan Picnic given last Sunday at the Desplaines River Resort because they are the first Arcadians to settle in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dancing started early with American music. Later Greek dancing was begun and lasted far into the night.</p>
   <p>One good feature of these picnics is that all Greeks coming from the same part of Greece get together and enjoy themselves with one another as in the old days. For this reason, picnics are never forgotten by many of the old timers who love to recall similar affairs in Greece.</p>
