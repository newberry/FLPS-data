   <p>The above mentioned musical society, which acts and thrives without much publicity, gives its annual dance at the Aragon Ballroom.</p>
   <p>The Society, which is composed of many Greeks, selects every year five Greek boys and girls, who are distinguished for their musical talent. To these it supplies funds enabling them to continue their study of music. Thus, we see that in the future we will have real artists of music.</p>
   <p>In the past artists were rather neglected by the Greek population of Chicago but this is not so now.</p>
   <p>The forthcoming dance is given for the purpose of raising money for the musically talented boys and girls of Greek origin. The Greeks of Chicago are invited to participate.</p>
