   <p>Harold R. Willoughby, Professor of Philology of the New Testament, University of Chicago, has published in an American newspaper that he has bought a very valuable collection of Greek manuscripts of the Gospel for the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the collection,he mentioned, there is a manuscript of the thirteenth century, written in a Greek calligraphy that has no parallel in other ancient manuscripts.</p>
   <p>The Professor publishes the fact that the man, who sold this valuable manuscript of the Gospel, is a dentist from Janina, living in Chicago, and that Janina is an Albanian City, universally notorious for robbery and brigandage.</p>
   <p>But we wish to inform the learned Professor that Janina is a Greek city and not and Albanian one as he said. And in regard to robbery, comparing Chicago and Janina crime data, per capita, Janina is a holy city, inhabited by angels.</p>
   <p>We very much regret, that the eminent Professor does not record the name of the dentist of Janina, that we might enlighten future historians.</p>
