   <p>p. 1.- Yesterday we dealt with the question of the theatrical activities in our community. However, the question of the Greek theater's existence in America is of the greatest importance and we think that we must not confuse it with the impromptu formation of troupes from amateur or even professional players. Because such a false belief might do harm to the Greek theater in America.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of America have always shown great readiness towards supporting the Greek theater. However, they met often with so many disappointments that their confidence is shaking and their zeal is cooling. We judge this by the great promptitude shown in the beginning and the cautiousness observed for some time lately.</p>
   <p>We have not been severe in our criticism of plays or of persons taking part in them, purposely, because we know how difficult it is to create a Greek troupe in America and present upon the stage a play worthwhile. We did not want to discourage with such a criticism the players as well as the public.</p>
   
   <p>It is high time, however, to have a Greek theater created in America, and do away with experimenting, especially now when professional players have started coming from Greece and towards whom the public is looking with greater expectations. The period of amateurs is over and now the Greek theater enters its artistic period, and the public's support depends upon the merits of the players artistic talent.</p>
   <p>The Greek public has shown its promptitude in support of a Greek theater. Let the actors now prove that they care for its dignity by staging selected and well studied works, and they will surely gain the sympathy and support of the public.</p>
