   <p>Last Saturday one of our group turned his face toward that mecca, Hollywood, in search of fame and fortune. This person, Earnest Karsis, is ten years old. He is well known among the Chicago Greeks because of his frequent appearances at their social and artistic gatherings. His remarkable soprano voice has long been a source of pleasure to us. Earnest, accompanied by his proud father, Kames Karsis is going in response to an invitation from a Hollywood studio. Screen tests will be made, and, if his talents are found acceptable, Earnest will enter upon the road to fame and fortune.</p>
   <p>It is said that he may be co-starred with Shirley Temple.</p>
