   <p>The Greek Professional Club of Chicago considers it an honor to let the public know that on Saturday evening, October 22, at 9:30 P.M., a debate will take place under its auspices on the subject, "Will Hellenism of America Disappear?"</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul Tzavaras will support the affirmative, while Mr. Spiros Kotakis will take the negative.</p>
   <p>Both debaters are qualified to handle this question since both have been living continuously for over a quarter of a century in Chicago. They are journalists and have followed and studied Hellenism in all its expressions in America.</p>

   <p>There is no doubt they will give us a fine treat on Saturday evening when they will argue and present the reasons for their respective positions on the subject. Admission 25 cents.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>The Greek Professional Club of Chicago.</p>
