   <p>The two existing Greek athletic clubs in Chicago, the Greek-American Athletic Club and the Hercules Club, have decided to become one under the name Greek Olympic Athletic Club.</p>
   <p>The two clubs for years have had the same aims; so the perpetuation of both was unnecessary. Last week the boards of the two clubs declared for the union.</p>
   <p>John Kallas, a member of this club, in last Saturday's games at St, Louis, among 361 competitors, came first and brought home the bacon. The same boy, two weeks from now, will compete with the famous runner, Chief White, in a fifty-mile run.</p>
   <p>G. Petropoulos Pres.</p>
   <p>A. Tragos. Secretary.</p>
