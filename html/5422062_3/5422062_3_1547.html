   <p>The Committee of Entertainment of Ahepa, Chapter No. 46, last Thursday, presented a complete athletic program, under the auspices of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club.</p>
   <p>Mr. Aristotle Kolias, speaking of the activities of the club, brought out its usefulness and urged the parents of youths to enroll their sons on the roster of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club.</p>
   <p>The preliminary exhibition began with the youthful Andrew and Leonidas Photopoulos, brothers, in a boxing match of three rounds. the small bodied combatants, forgetting all about being brothers, threw rights and lefts and few fouls, with such a dexterity that no doubt was left in the minds of the crowd, that some day they would be champions.</p>

   <p>Next came N. Flambouras, a promising fighter and John Mitchell, in the 130 lb. class also boxed three rounds. Athanasios Petros and Alexandros Xeros in the 160 lb. class, also boxed.</p>
   <p>The battle between Andrew Kallas and Henry Glazos was fierce, but George Koutalis and B. Thomas of the 175 lbs. class topped the exhibitions with what was both an artistic and scientific fight. Refreshments were served to those who came to see how Greek fights Greek.</p>
