   <p>The much heralded lecture of Professor G. Melonas took place last week at Ahepa's chapter No. 46.</p>
   <p>Paradoxically, and to the great disappointment of the audience, Mr. Melonas butchered Greek grammar and the Greek language which is the most precious tradition of the Greek race. The lecture was delivered in such Greek that is only used by pseudo-Greeks and Levantines.</p>
   <p>Mr. Melonas claims to be a doctor of philology at the National University of Athens and Ephor of archeology. If Professor Melonas was really a miller (Melonas means a miller) in a Greek village, he would have been able to use better Greek than the language he employed at the lecture, because millers are Greeks and not wooly-tongued pseudo-Greeks or Levantines.</p>

   <p>Professor Melonas, rightly and justly, characterized as vandals and human monsters those barbarions who maimed Greek status, but what characterization can we give those who maim the most beautiful status, the Greek language?</p>
   <p>They are paid tools of the Athens propagandists who betray the noblest country, for the thirty pieces of silver of Judas.</p>
