   <p>Last Sunday night the performance of the comedy "Tziotiko Ravaisi" took place in the beautiful Aryan Grotto Theatre. It was given by the Vappa dramatic group.</p>
   <p>Before the performance, Mrs. E. Stamos and Mr. I. Kouyarakos sang a beautiful Spanish duet and danced a Spanish dance with great skill and accomplishment.</p>
   <p>"Tziotiko Ravaisi" by Tinov Depastas, is undoubtedly the best comedy of the newer Greek theater. The setting is rustic and the play unfolds very naturally.</p>
   <p>Mrs. A. Stamatogiannis played the lead and danced a comical dance with the historical Rokan, with great finesse. Mr. C. Kokkinis and Mr. G. Stamatogiannis portrayed their parts with extreme success. The latter has a remarkable resemblance in his walk and appearance to the well-known Charlie Chaplin.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. Vappas took the part of a buffoon and was heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>In general the performance surpassed the expectations of the public, which was very enthusiastic.</p>
