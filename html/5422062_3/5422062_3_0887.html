   <p>Last Sunday the annual picnic of the church of St. George was given with great success at Kolzes Park. The members of the church and a large number of other Greek people showed up for the Greek amusements.</p>
   <p>The priest of the Church, Rev. Daniel Kolemis, the president, that hearty Zakinthian, Mr. A. Flambouras, and the entire Board of Directors did everything in their power to entertain and amuse their guests.</p>
   <p>An outstanding characteristic of the gathering was that two thirds of those present were women and children. The Greek children are being developed and brought up in Greek communities. In this way it becomes a habit with them to love, just as their parents do, the Greek customs, the Greek sense of honor and pride, the family spirit and characteristic unity of the Greek people.</p>
