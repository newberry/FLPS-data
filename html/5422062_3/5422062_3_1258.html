   <p>Those, who have attended the various performances of the Greek movie, "Astero", given in the Chicago Women's Club Theater, assert that it is one of the finest Greek films they have ever seen.</p>
   <p>The Play itself is one which deeply stirs an audience composed of Greeks because it recalls to them so many instances of their early lives spent in Hellas. The scenes are recognizable and extremely clear, so that familiar places can easily be discerned by all. More than a thousand people saw this movie last Sunday. In fact, many did not get a chance to get in and the movie will be shown again next Sunday. It will run continuously from two o'clock until eleven at night. Admission is only forty cents for adults, fifteen for children.</p>
   <p>Greek parents will act wisely in taking their children with them. It will give them a chance to see the historic places of Greece and the birthplaces of their parents, of which they no doubt have heard much.</p>
