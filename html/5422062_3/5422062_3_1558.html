   <p>p. 3.- There is a bozo training at the G.O.A.C. by the name of Alex Xeros who also goes under the name of Al Marino. Now he is K.O. but somehow or other I do not think that he has taken the game seriously. By that I mean that although he fought some of the toughest middle-weights in these parts, if he had paid more attention to his work he undoubtedly have come out a winner at more events than his record show. All that Alex needs is to buckle down to business, some real training and he will surely raise havoc in his class.</p>
   <p>As George Curtis remarked, "There is a man after my heart." But if anyone can get that boy to do some honest-to-goodness training he is certainly going to rise.</p>

   <p>Many Thrills in Store</p>
   <p>Visit the Greek Olympic Athletic Club. After all, your life and my life is not made up of just food, work and sleep. The boys that I have mentioned are training at the Club, and so are others. If you go there you will see every boxer go through their training stunts, and if you Greeks are the descendants of the Ancients as you claim you are, then, by all means, have Athleticism on your daily menu of important events.</p>
   <p>There is a Club on the West Side by the name of Greek Olympic Athletic Club. Few of us have ever taken notice of the fact. Fewer yet have ever taken the trouble of visiting their headquarters at the Hull House. Weekly events of athletic importance take place at the petite club of Sports. This story is written with the view in mind of getting some of you out there and giving the boys a hand.</p>
   <p>Within late years Chicago's Greeks have branched out to a variety of activities, both in the business and the social world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Young ladies societies, young men's groups, old men's and old ladies clubs and God knows what not, have come and gone. In this mania for social organization, in this near insanity of getting together and trying to do something, for humanity, the race and the nation, a few less assuming Greek youths, have organized the Greek Olympic Athletic Club.</p>
   <p>History of 20 Years</p>
   <p>With a history of some twenty years, G.O.A.C. has stood the test of time, it has become an integral part of our social life. It has, from time to time, staged events of importance that have attracted the attention of the American press. At the headquarters of the G.O.A.C. youths come and are trained in the various arts of the sport world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Not Noticed By Many</p>
   <p>Few of us have ever taken notice of the organization, in spite of the fact that we claim to be the direct descendants of the once glorious race of sport lovers, the classical Greeks. Fewer people yet have ever taken the trouble of visiting the training quarters of the Club at Hull House and there witness with pride the work of the younger generation.</p>
   <p>Weekly events of athletic importance take place at the petite club of sports in the heart of the most typical Greek colony in America, our own West Side. Some of you "Great Big Tired Business Men", if you ever step on the gas and go down to the G.O.A.C. you will get the surprise of your life.</p>
   <p>Curtis Conquered Garlow</p>
   <p>One of the toughest battles in local pugilism was staged at the Cicero Stadium a week ago. Sam Curtis, who is being trained and managed by <span class="page-break">5</span>George J. Curtis, regular training Professor at the Club, met and came out the winner in a bout with Angelo Garlow. It was an interesting exhibition of fist giving and fist taking between the two. Many thought that Curtis would not be able to come out victorious as he always does, on account of his inactivity for some six months or so.</p>
   <p>Many on the Spotlight</p>
   <p>Sam Curtis is not the only one that holds spotlight attraction at the G.O.A.C. There are many others under the direct training of George Curtis. Jimmy Eliopoulos, flyweight, battles often and when he does there is wild fire afoot.</p>
   <p>I saw Jimmy battle the other night. Take it from me. That boy is good. From bell to bell, he jumps around the ring like a rabbit being chased by the hunter. Seeing Jimmy in action, one recollects the fistic arena is certain. At present, Jimmy is being groomed for the Golden Glove Tournament.</p>

   <p>Flambouras Never Beaten</p>
   <p>Another youngster, whose good stiff punch you will hear about soon, is Nick Flambouras, a 130 pounder. Nick has answered the gong ten times up to date recording ten individual victories. "Ain't that something, I asks youse?"</p>
   <p>The Greek element constitutes now in America an indispensable part of the American Commonwealth and there is no question that through its assimilation with the other races will add many important qualities which will greatly promote the ultimate development of the true American character.</p>
