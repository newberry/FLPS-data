   <p>In the Goodman Theater of the Art Institute of Chicago have been given, in the last three days, three Greek dance presentations, a summary of Greek life as a whole from its beginning up to the present, by the artist-dancer, Mr. Vaso Kanellos, and his wife, Mrs. Tanagra Kanellos.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Kanellos interpreted, as well as it can be done in our days, the ancient life of Greece. Then they unfolded before the eyes of the spectators by mimicry and dance one of the thrills of our race produced by the Souliotin novelist and scholar, Mr. Ch. Christovasiles.</p>
   <p>The Kanellos couple have made very praiseworthy efforts to extol the Greek name here and to prove that we are pure descendants of the ancient Greeks.</p>
