   <p>Every race has a feeling of pride and joy when one of its countrymen succeeds in a foreign land by his own efforts.</p>
   <p>Such an individual is Peter S. Lambros, the well-known editor of the Star. Mr. Lambros left his native country at an early age and came to America. He was imbued with a sincere desire to succeed and was governed by this desire all his life.</p>
   <p>He arrived here without any knowledge of the English language, without any education, and without any friends or relations, to make the way easier for him. Having only his natural abilities and a burning desire to become someone, he made a place for himself in the community without becoming a burden to any one. By persistence and patience, and the dignity of hard labor, he won recognition by both the Greeks and Americans. Having a strong faith in himself, he endeavored to do what few of us would have the courage to even try--speaking in English before various clubs. This he did, and he was heard and applauded. He spoke before the largest political audiences in Chicago. At one of these meetings, held in the Auditorium, over six thousand people <span class="page-break">2</span>were present; many of them being well-educated leaders of the community. At this meeting the principal speaker was ex-Governor Lowden, who outlined his political platform. Mr. Lambros was one of the other four speakers.</p>
   <p>But his progress did not end there. He was chosen as head of the committee sent to Springfield, to ask the governor to speak before the Advertising Association concerning national problems and the needs of to-day. The governor accepted the invitation and named February 23 as an acceptable date. The Association appointed Mr. Lambros to act as toastmaster at the dinner to be given in honor of the governor. Without losing courage at having to speak in English before such a select group, Mr. Lambros accepted that honorary position of the evening. He performed this duty so well that the guests continually applauded his wit and humor.</p>
   <p>Among other things, he explained the position of the Greeks in America; saying, that not only did they love America, but that they were willing to sacrifice their lives in behalf of their adopted country. His speech was enthusiastically applauded.</p>

   <p>Among those present at the dinner were Mr. C. Paleologos, and the editor of the Saloniki, Mr. C. Salopoulos.</p>
