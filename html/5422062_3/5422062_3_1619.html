   <p>p. 2- Initiated and sponsored by Mr. N. Protopapas, the Greek Athletic Club of Chicago has been founded. Eighty-five members have already been enrolled. At the next meeting officers will be elected and installed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Protopapas, who holds the record for lifting, is an athlete of great renown. Being a professional athlete, he was not permitted to participate in the Olympic Games in St. Louis. His record of lifting 306 pounds is still unchallenged. Pericles Kakoustris, the Greek who won the title for lifting at the Olympic Games in St. Louis, lifted a weight of 246 pounds only.</p>
   <p>Beyond any doubt the Greek community welcomes the formation of the Greek Athletic Club of Chicago for the great physical benefit which it will render to the Greek youth.</p>
   <p>Only time will prove whether this newly-formed athletic club will produce athletic champions of whom Chicago and the Greek community will be proud.</p>
