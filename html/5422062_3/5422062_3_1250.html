   <p>The Greeks in Chicago all know Nick Lambropoulos. His writings and ideas on idealogy are known to every Greek from one end of the country to the other. "The Bad Road" (Kakos Dromos). This work proves that Mr. Lambropoulos knows what he is doing and what he is writing about. We ought to be proud of a man that can write of the Greek customs and ideals in such a way as to arouse the interest of the Americans.</p>
