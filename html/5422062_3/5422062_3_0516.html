   <p>An offspring of the lyre, the "Santuri", will make its carnival bow on the Greek program, Nov. 30, at the Aragon ballroom. Spiro Stamos will play accompaniments on this instrument of 140 strings for the Byzantine Ensemble as well as putting it through its solo paces.</p>
   <p>The Ensemble as a brisk program of its own in mind. A torch number of about 600 B. C., titled "The Song of Bacchus", is contemplated along with other selections both serious and light. The Byzantine Ensemble is to be featured in the Greek festival, already assured an attendance running into the thousands.</p>
