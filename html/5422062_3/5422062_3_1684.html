   <p>p. 1- Continuing our articles on Ahepa, we shall now take up the subject of its conventions, which are held annually to discuss ways and means for the improvement of the organization and to elect its administrative officers.</p>
   <p>By various forms of publicity the general public is led to believe that the Order of Ahepa successfully carries out certain programs which it formulates in its conventions. This is not true, however, for almost the entire time of each convention is consumed by the delegates in circulating propaganda and in trying to influence members to support their favorite candidates for administrative offices. The convention is in fact a campaign to promote the election of candidates for office and not a gathering to discuss ways and means of improving the organization.</p>
   <p>The crux of the entire campaign is the election of the chairman of the convention. The faction from which this chairman is elected assumes control and rules the convention thereafter. The chairman himself <span class="page-break">2</span>assumes absolute power, and oftentimes members have difficulty in getting the floor. Roberts' Rules of Order are put into effect, and woe to the delegate who has not familiarized himself with these rigorous rules which instead of maintaining order cause commotion and become a torture and a nuisance to those who are not acquainted with them in detail! Being unacquainted with these rules, amny of the members are compelled to refrain from speaking and remain silent. In substantiation of these statements let us say in the Ahepa convention at Kansas City last year the delegates present unanimously requested that the use of these perplexing rules be discontinued so that they might have a chance to express their views and opinions freely.</p>
   <p>The entire time of there annual conventions is consumed in explanations of Roberts' Rules of Order and in campaigning for candidates. Even in the well-known Republican and Democratic conventions which nominate candidates for the office of President of the United States no such ardent interest, such zeal, and such ballyhoo are to be found as one sees and hears in the annual conventions of the Order of Ahepa in the election of the supreme president, the supreme governor, and the other titled officers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The preelection campaign often begins many months before the convention. This early campaigning is done within the chambers of the various chapters of the Order of Ahepa, where the delegates to the convention are elected. In the meetings of the chapters cunning plots are hatched, and political cliques are formed to be utilized in the election of candidates for office in the ensuing conventions.</p>
   <p>Besides the element of the personal popularity of candidates the section of the country from which the candidate comes must also be considered, that is, whether he is from the eastern part of the United States or from the West. Heretofore all the presidents of the Order of Ahepa have been Easterners, and the chapters of the eastern section of the United States have dominated the conventions and have assumed control over the other chapters of the Order. At present, however, fear exists that control of the conventions may pass from the East to the West for the next convention of the Order of Ahepa is scheduled to be held in San Francisco. For this reason many chapters will not send delegates to this convention.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>To avoid the loss of its leadership, the East now considers taking steps to cancel the decision made by the Order at its last convention to hold its next meeting in San Francisco.</p>
   <p>We reveal these facts in order to prove that the purpose of the annual convention of the Order of Ahepa is not to adopt measures for improving the organization as it asserts, and as the general public believes, but merely to elect candidates to titled positions as officers of the Order.</p>
   <p>By the facts which we have already produced and by those which we now produce in these articles appearing in our columns we have proved that the Order of Ahepa ever since its establishment has been and continues to be an American organization in spite of the intense desire of the majority of its members to see it become a Hellenic society. It seems likely that Ahepa will continue to exist as an Order devoid of Hellenic ideals and principles, and that the beneficent desires and endeavors of its members to make it Greek will continue to be thwarted by the smooth and cunning devices of the crafty few.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>What means this majority shall employ to realize its desire to make Ahepa a Greek organization is the majority's own problem. We, however, who are outside the organization are capable of judging the Order by its history, its aims, and its accomplishments, and whatever we have written about these matters is actual fact.</p>
   <p>The publication of these facts in our columns is our contribution to the realization of the desires of most of us Greek-Americans, who long to see the Order of Ahepa become a Greek organization with Hellenic ideals and principles.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
