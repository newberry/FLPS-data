   <p>The largest number of restaurants in Chicago are owned and run by Greeks. Recently a small number of Americans entered this field. What does this mean? Nothing to the unsuspecting Greeks, but, in reality, very much. The Greek restaurateurs in Chicago must organize immediately. They must protect themselves from this unsuspecting menace. When an American opens up a restaurant, a Greek loses one. The next week another Greek restaurant goes and another, and another.</p>
   <p>Some day all the Greeks will be thrown into the streets and only then will they realize what has happened to them. A Greek never philosophizes until a thing is over, but this time it will be different. Every Greek feels that he "knows it all," and that his fellow is an ignoramus. He deems it unnecessary to follow a leader or cooperate with another Greek.</p>

   <p>This is going to cause the downfall of all Greeks in America and is going to ruin them unless they realize that they must unite and stand together. Messrs. G. A. Kyriakopoulos, S. D. Kantzas, S. Spyropoulos, P. Kolombakos, A. Sellas, J. Askounis, and B. Koutsociannis have decided to call a meeting of all restaurant men to decide what is to be done. We hope something will come of this meeting, because it is a very serious problem confronting the Greek restaurateurs of Chicago. More will be said at a furture date.</p>
