   <p>The Greek Star is up to its old tricks again. It recently published an article stating Hellas (a newspaper) donated $2 to the Italians; Athena, $7; Loxias, $1, and the Greek Star, $440.</p>
   <p>Nobody is being fooled by such statements. Everyone knows that Mr. Lambros of the Star, went from door to door, collecting contributions and putting them in his own name. If Mr. Eutaxias did the same he would have a much larger sum because he has many more friends than P. S. Lambros.</p>
   <p>We preferred to have each person bring forth his little contribution by himself instead of having him begged for it.</p>
   <p>Contributions are still being taken by C. Petroulas, 264 S. Halsted St.</p>
