   <p>Yesterday's performance of the "Tziotiko Ravaisi" was a tremendous success both from an artistic and financial viewpoint. Both of the leads, Mrs. Stamos and Mr. Skoufas, were so good that we cannot decide whom we liked the better. However, the highest honor should by right go to Mr. Harcy Sillan who took the part of "George" ..... The other characters were well-played. In general, Chicago has never had such a "Ravaisi" (similar to a Mardi-Gras). And now, we will rest our jaws and prepare ourselves for more laughter tomorrow.</p>
