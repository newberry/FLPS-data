   <p>p. 1. Seven Greek teams contested the basketball game last Sunday. Of all the teams, the Sophocles team from Gary, and the Centaurs of Chicago's Hull House contested the victory, step by step, and showed themselves to be the best trained in the game.</p>
   <p>The Centaurs of Hull House, with its brilliant players P. Kollia and K. Varella, won first prize which was contributed by Mr. John Raklios. The Sophocles team of Gary won second prize presented by Deligiannis Brothers. The Lodge Ypsilantis won third prize presented by the Chicago Pie Company and the Lamda Delta won the sportsmanship prize offered by Mr. John Askounis.</p>
   <p>Praise for the arrangement and success of the whole enterprise should be given to Mr. John Askounis, who not only offered a prize, but was the most ardent supporter of the whole affair, and also to Mr. A. Polemis who worked for the success of the affair.</p>
