   <p>With the first snow flakes of the cold winter which have visited us so early this year, many thousands of Greek laborers will be released from hard, dangerous work on the railroads. Hundreds of them will swarm into the Greek quarter this winter, as usual. A month hence there will be thousands of workers arriving in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Thus, Saloniki will grasp the opportunity to study and make an investigation of our labor problem, on which so much has been written in the past.</p>
   <p>Chicago is pre-eminently a great railroad center, and, as such, it is also a great labor center. No one can find a better place in which to study this vital labor problem.</p>
   <p>We are at present restricting the scope of our study to the railroad industry, without intending to underestimate the importance of the manufacturing centers <span class="page-break">2</span>of New England, where thousands of Greeks are working in the cotton mills. Nor do we want to overlook the mining industry in Utah, where thousands of Greeks are digging in the depths of the earth.</p>
   <p>Saloniki is happy because the return of the workers' caravans to Chicago will afford the opportunity to make an analysis and intimate study of labor conditions in railroad construction companies, where more than fifty thousand Greeks are employed. Only a few of us know of their toil and their hardships, of the hard labor in the scorching heat of the desert, of the blood and sweat which they shed.</p>
   <p>Blood! Yes, plenty of blood!</p>
   <p>There are hundreds of accidents and deaths among Greek railroad workers every year. Many hundreds are maimed and crippled. That is why the termination of these men's employment is likened to the demobilization of our troops in Greece.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Both these armies have shed their blood, both have worked hard, both have been engaging in a desperate struggle: the one to defend and protect the fatherland, the other to support and sustain the poor families on the farms and in the villages of Greece.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being sent to their families in Greece every year by the sturdy railroad workers. Thousands of wives, parents, sisters, and children are given a new lease on life with the sweat of the far-away immigrant, who for this very reason must be called a national benefactor. Then, he should have the absolute right to full protection by the government.</p>
   <p>As a newspaper which fulfills its program, Saloniki will examine all aspects of the labor question, especially at this time when the streets of the Greek quarter are filled with many idle workers.</p>
   <p>The laborers themselves will be asked by Saloniki to give an account of their life, their conditions of work, and their problems. Thus, we will learn about <span class="page-break">4</span>those notorious bosses and hiring agents of labor, about the exploiters and parasites amongst our laborers.</p>
   <p>But even the life of our workers in the city, in our Greek social centers, in the traditional coffee houses during the winter months, will be of great interest to our community. Saloniki will undertake to study this problem impartially, and will disregard any misunderstanding that may arise.</p>
   <p>This newspaper is pleased to greet the arrival of thousands of Greek workers in Chicago. It will listen to and publish all the complaints and demands of labor, in order to correct many evils and to improve labor's status.</p>
   <p>The struggle of Saloniki in behalf of labor will of necessity be restricted to the journalistic field. The workers who are in any way wronged or mistreated will find this paper on their side in our common effort to obtain justice and fair treatment. The government, which is always willing to support the just <span class="page-break">5</span>demands of labor, is welcomed to obtain all the information which it desires from the offices of Saloniki.</p>
   <p>A newspaper established in a labor market and industrial city such as Chicago will have compromised its principles and purposes, if it did not gladly undertake to fight for and protect the interests of the sweating, toiling, and unfairly treated worker.</p>
