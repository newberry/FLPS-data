   <p>It is well-known to the entire community of Chicago, that a great paper has been published here for quite some time. It is printed upon very cheap paper, quite the opposite of its fine compositions!!! [sic] printed therein. This paper is usually read after dinner, and should be printed upon glossier paper in order to do justice to its royalistic readers. It must be hard for these friends of the throne [the throne of King Constantine] to be compelled to read such a democratic-looking paper.</p>
   <p>This paper, which is fairly well-known, due to its latest affiliation with royalty, is edited by a man [Spiros Kotakis] who is well-known--not only to the Greeks of Chicago, but to the Greeks of the United States--because of his honorable and brilliant career.</p>
   <p>His poise, his ways, and the dignity of his appearance, give him such a fine <span class="page-break">2</span>aspect, that he arouses tremors of joy in those whom he condescends to honor with his presence. No gathering can be completely successful unless due honor is paid to his excellency, who repays the honor by saying afterwards: "How would you like it gentlemen, to honor this group by speaking before them; and to know that not one of those goat-shepherds understood what you were saying?"</p>
   <p>This man has traveled to many places doing good deeds and has allowed the Greeks of America to become enlightened by listening to his speeches [on practically every subject], so that he has earned the right of being called Homer. Of course there are some who are jealous of his greatness, and so call him Iscariot, others call him an unbalanced scale, and others..... The respectful ones term him a great sociologist and educator; and we, in order to show our due respect have given him the title of the Fioron (flower) of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are sorry to characterize him so, for we might cause some people to <span class="page-break">3</span>mistake him for another individual who rightfully should have that title; because he earned it without public notices and any ballyhoo. Our Fioron seems to be doing a good job of imitating the character of this individual. It is necessary that we love both of them--the flower of Chicago and Mammonas.</p>
   <p>This is the sincere hope of our hero who so unselfishly labors day and night to enlighten our community, and to save it from the clutches of that self-governing anti-canonical man called Paleologos (Mammonas).</p>
   <p>The Fioron has been sent to us from above; gifted physically and spiritually with endowments which have enabled him to play the part of uplifter and educator of our poor blind community. If we wish to benefit, we must hear what he has to say.....</p>
   <p>He claims that he is a lawyer, and we must believe him; for does he not <span class="page-break">4</span>always venture an opinion concerning legal matters? Doubtlessly he is a great teacher of law; his purpose is to formulate new standards of social justice.....</p>
   <p>He has three desires. They are: to bring back his exiled friend (King Constantine); to send his enemy, Venizelos, to a degrading death; to receive some high honor for accomplishing the above.</p>
   <p>His profession is that of a journalist, and when his articles are read after dinner they are guaranteed to accomplish what nature sometimes fails to do. [sic].</p>
   <p>He speaks various languages; among them being Chinese. He uses this particular language when he writes letters to Prince Paleologos. The meaning of his statements is completely Chinese (to us).</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>He is a historian and has evidenced interest in the genealogy of Mr. Paleologos. He completely overlooks his own ancestors for some reason or other.</p>
   <p>He is handsome and well-behaved, and tries to act like a gentle milch cow. Nevertheless, people meeting him for the first time are prone to classify him as the same type of person as Judas Iscariot. He quickly dispells all such feeling by his use of Parlez Vous Francais; and gives you to understand that you erred in your classification, and that if you had not been so hasty you would have seen his sterling qualities.</p>
   <p>He is a good mixer, especially when he strums on his mandolin; but when he enters the conversation, everyone is made conscious of him; he upsets every one's nervous system. He is an ardent conversationalist. In fact he will talk for hours and hours, only demanding an occasional cup of coffee or a dish of rice pudding to invigorate his system.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>He is a great and pure patriot. His patriotism reaches the point, where he will do any thing to have his name appear on any and every committee which has some patriotic purpose.</p>
   <p>His self-effacement is so great that his only thought is that of helping the fatherland.</p>
   <p>He is independent and father of the "Independence". How many his virtues and what they are, is known to all of us. We wish to ask the community a question. "Should not such a flower be protected,--should we not become enlightened from such an Epiphany of greatness and intellectual background?"</p>
   <p>When we do become so enlightened, we shall then be able to realize our own pitiful condition;....</p>
   <p>We are the first to say, that our Fioron must speak to us even if he will <span class="page-break">7</span>call us names. We urge that the hall be filled to overflowing by the community, because when he speaks he is much more effective than when he writes. The slightest movements of his hands, or the least twitch of his distinguished gray beard is most expressive.</p>
   <p>Forward then with courage and patience--it will be only for one night. He will speak to us beautifully. We who have heard him many times knew what we were doing when we titled him Fioron.</p>
   <p>Only one thing bothers us, and that is: What perfume (smell) does this flower give out? But even the answer to that question is dependent upon the person whose nose is doing the smelling.</p>
