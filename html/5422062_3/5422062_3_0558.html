   <p>Leonidas Methenites was born in Athens and came here at the age of five. He began taking violin lessons at the early age of twelve. He demonstrated such skill and talent that he is now ready to become a real artist. After studying in Milwaukee for a short period of time, he came to Chicago in order to complete his studies under the tutelage of Mr. Harry Diamond, who recognized the young man's ability and talent. There prevails the idea among Chicago musical authorities that the Greeks have no ear for music. This is because of the simple reason that the Greek musicians of Chicago are not being sufficiently represented. After Mr. Diamond heard the Greeks performing, he discovered that not only did they have a good musical ear, but there exists among them real musical talent. His student, Leonidas Methenites, proved this. As all nationalities encourage a true artist, we, too, suggest to the Greek people that they support this youth, who is deserving, even without the encouragement of his fellow-countrymen. There is no doubt that he will feel that his efforts have not been in vain. The Greeks should occupy a proper station in the art of music in Chicago. But if this is to be realized, they should support and appreciate newly discovered musical talent. If the American people discover it, why should the Greek people ignore it? This article is written by the young artist's instructor, Mr. Harry Diamond. It is now up to the Greeks to do their duty.</p>
   <p>To-morrow,Sunday, January 30, at 8:00 P. M., the same very promising violinist will give a concert at the West End Women's Club, northeast corner of Monroe Street and Ashland Boulevard. Here it will be proven whether the Greeks of Chicago have the ambition and patriotism to support an artist who will honor the Greek name, or will they offer him the glass of disappointment as often is the case in Greece?</p>
