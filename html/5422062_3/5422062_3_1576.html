   <p>As athletes, Americans are first class Greeks. This was disclosed by Professor John A. Scott, professor of Greek, in the Northwestern University.</p>
   <p>"No nation resembles the ancient Greeks in attitude more than the Americans," writes Professor Scott. "No nation has created anything superior in the field of athletics to the Greeks."</p>
   <p>The enthusiastic devotion of a nation to athletics is the greatest contribution towards democratic ideas, honesty, temperance, straight-forwardness, and preservation of manly instinct.</p>
   <p>Athletics was to the ancient Greeks, and is to Americans, the biggest contribution to the health of the race. We must remain true to athletics <span class="page-break">\2</span>and stop commercializing them because commercializing sports is the greatest drawback to their development.</p>
   <p>Professor John A. Scott is the brother of the president of Northwestern University, Walter Dill Scott.</p>
