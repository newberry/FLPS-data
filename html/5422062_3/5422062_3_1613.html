   <p>p. 1- Basil Demetrelis, the Chicago Greek youth who for the last six months has gained one victory after another in wrestling, won another match last week and is rapidly climbing the ladder which leads to the championship of his profession. The Chicago Transatlantic, commenting on the Greek boy, said: "John Roony, the giant police officer who holds the wrestling championship, last week met his Waterloo or rather his Marathon in the person of Basil Demetrelis at the Metropolitan Hall.</p>
   <p>"The youthful Greek, who is only twenty years old and has arms and legs of iron, weighs 185 pounds against Rooney's 204. His development into a real Hercules is merely a matter of time. Though he is unskilled in the art of wrestling, which he tackled only six months ago, he has nevertheless already defeated eight veterans of the arena in the United States and Canada.</p>
