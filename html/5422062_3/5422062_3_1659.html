   <p>Each year the Cretan Brotherhood of Chicago and vicinity holds a dinner and dance at Easter time. This function is typical of those held in Greece at this holy and beautiful season of the year.</p>
   <p>This year, as usual, the dinner was dedicated to the Cretans of Chicago--especially to those who have no families with whom to spend the holidays. This affair helps them to forget for a short while the excruciating pangs of exile and loneliness. This is one of the reasons why the Brotherhood is so well-loved and so strongly supported by its members.</p>
   <p>As usual, announcements were sent out early enough to inform everyone in ample time of the forthcoming event. More than two hundred people gathered in the Cretan Hall at 701 Blue Island Avenue. If it had not been raining so heavily, undoubtedly the hall would have been filled to overflowing.</p>

   <p>We have but one criticism to make to the committee on arrangements: it should secure a larger hall for future affairs of this kind so that there will be more room for dining and dancing.</p>
   <p>Lack of space forbids a complete report of the evening's entertainment. The two musicians....who provided the music for the spirited Cretan dances are worthy of the highest praise for their skill and endurance.</p>
   <p>There were many non-Greeks among those present, including Carl Francia, candidate for mayor of Gary, Indiana, and his wife and son. Mr. S. Saridakis, a director of the Pan-Cretan union, honored the affair with his presence.</p>
   <p>Credit is due to M. Mamalakis, president of the Brotherhood, for his splendid leadership.</p>
