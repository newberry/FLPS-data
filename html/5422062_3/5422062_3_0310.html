   <p>P.1--The walls of Judge Summerville's court last Wednesday reverberated to the sound of Ionian, Doric, and Chicago Greek. All the Greek importers in Chicago petitioned Judge Summerville to correct the injustice done them by the custom-house officials in imposing a tariff duty and reckoning the Greek drachma at its gold standard monetary value.</p>
   <p>Judge Summerville, after listening to their valid arguments, decided in their favor and advised them that in the future they must procure affidavits from the United States consuls in Greece verifying the value of the drachma, and that the custom-house duty must be calculated on the basis of this value.</p>
