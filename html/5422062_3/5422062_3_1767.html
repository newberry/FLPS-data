   <p>Next Sunday, June 24th, all the natives of Kastri and Saint Peter are holding a picnic at Kolze's Electric Park, 6353 Irving Park Blvd. A considerable sum has been collected for the construction of a road between Tripoli-Kastri and Saint Peter. Although much progress has been made there is still some money required to complete the job. This is the purpose of this picnic.</p>
   <p>All money raised will be sent for the completion of this road.</p>
   <p>Come all, and let us make a summer resort out of our native town, to increase its trade, to honor it, and to be honored by it.</p>
