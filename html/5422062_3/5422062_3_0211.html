   <p>Under the name of the ancient Greek god of trade and commerce, Hermes, an important corporation has been established, with both Greeks and Americans participating.</p>
   <p>This company has a capital investment of $50,000. It competes with the greatest American companies of its kind in the manufacture and sale of dye and shoe polish products. The quality of these products is excellent, and prices are very reasonable.</p>
   <p>Almost all the owners of shoe-shine parlors, both in Chicago and other cities, obtain their supplies from the Hermes Corporation, which is under the direction of experienced businessmen, who are a credit to the Greek name.</p>
   
   <p>On page four we are publishing an important announcement of this great progressive company, and we suggest that our shoe-shine parlor owners read it very carefully.</p>
