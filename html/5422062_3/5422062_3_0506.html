   <p>On June 10, at 8 o'clock the students of Mrs. Charles Marshall will be featured in a concert at Curtiss Hall in the Fine Arts Building. It is interesting to note that several of her students are Greek, two are from our parish, Barbara Petrakis and Annette Tarantelis.</p>
   <p>The other Greek students are Sophie Bexes, Bertha Flores, Helen Economopoulus, and Christ Georgopoulos. The program will be a varied one, consisting of several scenes from "Aida," "Hansel and Gretel," and other operas. In addition Greek demotic songs will be sung by Mr. George Demopoulos, and other Greek pupils. Mr. Mark Mamalakis will direct a Cretan folk song.</p>
