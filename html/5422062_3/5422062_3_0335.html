   <p>The Greek Community of Chicago soon will have the opportunity to enjoy the vocal talent of Mr. and Mrs. De Parree, at the Aragon Ball Room, at a dance given by the United Chapters of Ahepa. Mr. De Parree must be remembered far his wonderful singing at the Auditorium Theater, on the occasion of the Panhellenic gathering at which Patriarch Meletios spoke. Mrs. De Parree also has distinguished herself vocally and dramatically, especially before France-European societies.</p>
