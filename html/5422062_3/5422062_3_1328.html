   <p>The question of the education of our people in this city, and in the United States generally, has been one of our most vital concerns from the very beginning. If our own community and our church and school officials cannot provide real and permanent opportunities for the intellectual guidance and enlightenment of our people, any "outside" opportunities which are offered from time to time in various parts of the city must be grasped immediately.</p>
   <p>The Star takes this opportunity to announce that excellent English classes for the foreign born have begun at 277 South Halsted Street, room 12. Instruction is offered from 1 to 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>The English language is taught by an easy and practical method which guarantees that the ability to speak, read, and write English can be acquired within a few months.</p>
   <p>We urge our people, especially our young men, to use their spare time profitably by giving these new classes a trial. They have nothing to lose in attending these classes.</p>
