   <p>p. 2.- The dance and entertainment of Tegeates, which had been advertised for some time by the Greek papers of Chicago, took place last Sunday and was a great success.</p>
   <p>This affair, will known to the Greek community of Chicago, was attended en masse by the elite of the Greek population.</p>
   <p>The orchestra, under the direction of our artist, Eddy Varzos, pleased the dancers so much by the pieces which it rendered that all were enthusiastic.</p>
   <p>The dance continued till after midnight, and all left with the best impressions.</p>
   <p>Copies were distributed to those in attendance of an album containing an article by Mr. Traka about Tegea from ancient times to this day and also various pictures of works beneficial to Tegea accomplished by the Association of Tegeates.</p>
   
   <p>Congratulations are due to the members of the committee which organized this affair, among whom was Dr. B. Trakas.</p>
