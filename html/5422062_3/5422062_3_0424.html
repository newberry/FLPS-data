   <p>Our community, with great anxiety, is awaiting the arrival of Marika Kotopouli. Being busy, only a few thousands will be at the station to welcome her. Next Sunday night, she will appear at the Studebaker Theatre to play the immortal "Electra," and Monday night she will play the part of Stella Violanti in the drama that was written by Gregory Xenopoulos.</p>
   <p>Everyone is anxious to see the great tragediene, therefore we predict, the Greeks of Chicago will fill up the Studebaker to capacity for these two dramas. The success of the plays will show if we will be able to have the great tragediene for more performances in Chicago.</p>
