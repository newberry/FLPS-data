   <p>p. 1- This is the subject that was discussed last Friday before a select audience by four Greek boys, who belong to the Helicon Association of students. These boys were born and reared here in America and have never set foot on Greek soil; yet they are profoundly attached to Greece and are filled to overflowing with patriotic feeling.</p>
   <p>This public discussion, at which we were fortunate enough to be present, was really a national affair because in spite of the fact that both sides were forcefully defended, and the pros and cons were properly advanced, the opinion finally prevailed that Hellenism can really survive in America, and the most surprising thing was that the very ones who with great force of reasoning and strong arguments defended the negative contributed most to the positive side of the question in debate. For they presented all their arguments so painstakingly, and their patriotic feeling seemed so pure that they turned the sentiment of the audience to the opposite view rather than to that which they defended.</p>

   <p>The boys who defended the view that Hellenism in America will gradually vanish told many bitter truths that may be used as lessons by those who wish to avert the disappearance of the Greek race in this country. They tried with all the power at their command to sound the danger-signal rather than to support the opinion that the Greek population will lose its racial identity.</p>
   <p>These modern Greeks of America, who belong to the second generation, did not undertake to show that the Hellenism of America will eventually disappear nor to convince us conclusively that we must be Americanized; they did not come there to counteract the efforts of those who think and believe that we must remain Greeks, for their criticism was constructive, and that is why, as we have said above, they supported their opponents' viewpoint, and their Greek sentiments made a greater impression on their audience than the logic of their arguments.</p>
   <p>And when we have young men born and educated in America as deeply imbued with racial feeling as those who held this debate, Messrs. Apost. Kokkinakis and Panag. Andrew, who defended the view that the Greek race will survive in America, and Messrs. Geo. Levanos and Panag. Belogiannis, their opponents, <span class="page-break">3</span>is it possible to doubt, even for a moment, that Hellenism in America will continue for a long time its national career, and that it is not in danger of being assimilated - when we have, we repeat, children of the new generation who have a race-consciousness and a race-conscience deeper even than those of many young people born and reared in Greece?</p>
   <p>We most heartily congratulate this splendid Helicon Association, which has such members as these young men, and we urge it to continue its lectures, which are so influential in building up the national spirit.</p>
