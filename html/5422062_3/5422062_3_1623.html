   <p>Fellow-veterans and fellow-Greeks of America:</p>
   <p>Those of you, who have visited Athens, whether in Ahepa, Gapa, and Legionnaire excursions, or individually, have undoubtedly noticed the lack of a proper center in which gatherings of Greek-Americans could take place. A center in which every Greek from America could have his appointments instead of the usual places of coffee houses or commercial centers.</p>
   <p>The lack of such a center will exist no longer. The Athens' Post of the American Legion, with the unanimous approval of the Greek government and under the auspices of the American Legion, undertook to erect a memorial Greek-American center of classical design to fill such need.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Greek government, headed by Eleutherios Venizelos, upon the introduction of the idea by the Athens Post, at once donated a site for the fulfillment of the idea. In this, not only the governments' decision was unanimous, but it was supported by the wholeheartedly approval of the Greek people as well. This ground plot is of 25,000 square feet in the heart of the capital. It is behind the palaces of King Constantine, just opposite the Serbian and Italian legations and near the palatial residence of Mr. Skouzes.</p>
   <p>On the 30th day of last August, the corner stone of this beautiful building (as you see in the picture) of the American Legion, was laid with great ceremony and pomp.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Present at the event were the Ministers of War, Navy and National Economy, the Vice President of the parliament, high officers of the army, the mayor of Athens, the American Consul-General, the representative of the American Legation, the Legionnaires from America many distinguished American visitors and many prominent Athenians. The ceremonial rites were performed by the Most Rev. Chrysostomos, Archbishop of Athens and head of the Church in Greece.</p>
   <p>This building will serve as a public center of Greek-Americans, promoting friendship and place between the two countries and expanding their place and good will in the Near East.</p>
   <p>In the halls of this mansion, one will find comfort and quietness, a complete library, desks for writing a reading room with Greek and American newspapers and magazines, baths and capacious resting rooms for both sexes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The hall of the hero's shrine will be decorated with beautiful oil paintings and adorned with statues of Greek and American heroes, and other distinguished American personages. The names of American organizations and the names of American cities will be found in the hall.</p>
   <p>The amphitheater of the building will have 4,000 seats, appropriate for national or international conventions, theatrical performances, lectures, scientific announcements, public gatherings, expositions and for other Greek-American social activities. The exterior of the amphitheater will be beautified by the emblems of the forty eight states of the Union.</p>
   <p>The expenditures for the building will amount to $250,000 which must be covered by individual donation from Greek-Americans and Americans. The latter have already contributed great sums.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We appeal to you and to all the Greeks of America to contribute according to individual ability for the completion of the American Legion's building which will be a credit to Hellenism.</p>
