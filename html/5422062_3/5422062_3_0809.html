   <p>p. 5.- The annual picnic of the Falanthians which took place last Sunday at Charles Andrew's New Grand View Gardens was very successful. The hot, summer weather prompted many to come early. The park was filled soon and the people continued coming instead of going. The first to arrive and the last to leave were the Board of Directors and their families. They all worked hard to make the day an enjoyable one for their guests.</p>
   <p>The president, K. Avgerinos invited many prominent people to his table. Among them were T. Valos, G. Chiagouris, and others. The treasurer, L. Psiharis, had charge of the bar while Secretary K. Kezios supervised the dancing.</p>
   <p>Everyone had a good time and went home tired but happy.</p>
