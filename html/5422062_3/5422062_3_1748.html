   <p>The Eptanisian club gave a dance last Sunday at the La Salle Hotel. The hall was crowded due to the efforts of the Board of Directors. There was a huge profit from the dance which will go to the National Hero of Athens fund. The crowd proved that every Greek affair can be a success if organized the right way. The committee was:</p>
   <p>George Kokalis, president</p>
   <p>A. Chonoromaras, vice-president</p>
   <p>A. Pagoulatus, secretary</p>
   <p>I. Zerbos, treasurer</p>
   <p>A. Mourikos- rec. secretary</p>
