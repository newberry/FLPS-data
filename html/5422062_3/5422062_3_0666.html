   <p>The performance of the play "Golfo" last Sunday night was a success. The four leading characters.... are to be congratulated upon their fine work.</p>
   <p>This performance brought to light some defects of the Greek theater here in Chicago. The need of a good prompter is particularly evident. No matter how well the actors know their lines, it is always possible that there might occur a lapse of memory on the part of any member of the cast. The resulting humiliation or confusion can be lessened, if a prompter is there to assist a forgetful individual.</p>
   <p>On the whole, however, the performance of "Golfo" was a good one. And the community should support the dramatic groups, as they are making valuable contributions to our cultural life.</p>
