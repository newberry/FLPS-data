   <p>The May issue of Religious Echo, the Greek religious periodical, contains some very interesting religious material by Archimandrite Hariton Panagopoulos.</p>
   <p>The contents for May include: an article on religious sentiment; a brilliant speech by the New Metropolitan of Athens, Mis Grace, Meletios Metaxakis, and comments by the editor of Religious Echo; a question on whether the gifts which are offered by the faithful to the church and to the priests have any religious significance; a question on whether killing is allowed among Christians in time of war; a much-needed announcement to the effect that Syrian bishops and, in particular, the Bishop Germanos of Seleucia, have no right to initiate and consecrate Greek priests in America and to dedicate Greek churches, because this right belongs exclusively to the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece; a question on whether one is allowed to give two names to a baby receiving baptism; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>an article seeking to dissuade individuals from improperly abusing the Greek clergy of Jerusalem, especially when they are referring to the Holy Land, Palestine.</p>
