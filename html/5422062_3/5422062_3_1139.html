   <p>The Greek community in Chicago and elsewhere is urged to be vigilant and with the sword in hand to destroy the enemies of our race. Unfortunately the enemies are not of the other foreign elements they are fellow-Greeks. They are the demagogues of the Greek press in Chicago and New York.</p>
   <p>Fellow-Greeks of Chicago and everywhere in America, be on your guard and don't let history repeat itself.</p>
   <p>The demagogues or orators of ancient Greece not only destroyed the pure political character of the citizen, but rhetorized Greece to subjugation by Rome.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The demagogues of the Byzantine era, rhetorized to the mind of the masses that God Almighty would take care of them. Greeks, in that period, thought that God was a Greek monopoly. Everything was left to God. No need for a strong army, no need for preparations. Church and God would protect Greece from invasion, from the barbarians. And while the barbarian hordes were storming the city of Byzantium, the Greeks, who at other times depended upon their fighting ability to win, left everything to their monopolized God, debating as to how the Holy Spirit was delivered, whether by the Father or the Son, while the barbarians were at the city gates. The result is known to us all.</p>
   <p>The demagogues or orators of corruption of the 350,000 Greeks in America, today are the Greek newspapers (with the exception of very few).</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>These corrupted orators of the Greek press in America, who advocate only church and religion ignoring school and education, are not ignorant and blind followers of the Cross, but on the contrary they are shrewd, cunning and hypocritical followers and defenders of the Cross. The Cross which besides love, contains smuggling disgrace and humility.</p>
   <p>Today in the Twentieth Century and here in America where 350,000 Greeks under democratic and progressive laws of the United States have begun to create a new Greece in America, these demagogues of the press, for their own interest and gain, rhetorize,not religion, but flout religion. Oh! Greeks of Chicago, for the last fifteen years since your establishment here, where is your schools, where is your local military companies, where is your patriotic virtue, your idealism, your duty, your organizations? Where is your Greek legions composed of young Greeks with developed bodies and minds to march under our new flag for the protection of our new country?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Everything is neglected and ignored by the masses, whose minds are directed by these corrupted orators of the press that lead us towards division, fanaticism and stagnation. Today in this great country, our new country, where the political nature and idealism of every race begins to blossom under the great nursing of American democratic polity, the evergreen branches of the Greek race here began to fade under the destructive atmosphere of the Greek press in America.</p>
   <p>Oh! Greeks of America don't let history repeat itself. Ignore these demagogues of the press, who sooner or later will hang themselves from remorse as Judas did, after the betrayal of the Master, for the sake of the thirty pieces of silver.</p>
