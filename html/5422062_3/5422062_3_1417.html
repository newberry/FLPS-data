   <p>p. 5.- Woodlawn Chapter No. 93 of Ahepa had an open-house last Thursday at the South Side Masonic Temple. They held a debate which was:</p>
   <p>Resolved: "That Alexander the Great was Really Great."</p>
   <p>Opponents were two Greek boys born and reared in America who spoke Greek.</p>
   <p>The affirmative was taken by twenty-year old P. Belogiannis (P. Belroy), student of law at the Lewis Institute and the negative was handled by T. Sarris, student of law at Northwestern.</p>
   <p>G. Barounis acted as chairman and Messrs. L. George, A. Vlachos, S. Rekas, M. Lambros and P. Matsouras were judges. The decision was a tie. Both young men were splendid!</p>
