   <p>Last Thursday the members of Ahepa and their friends heard an exceptional lecture. We are grateful to Mr. D. Parry, president of the educational committee for inviting Dr. Preston Bradley to speak to us.</p>
   <p>Before a large crowd, George Porikos, president of chapter No. 46, praised brother Parry for his successful endeavors. Dr. Bradley's theme was, "What Greece has contributed to American Civilization.</p>
   <p>For three quarters of an hour, the lecturer told us the effect of the Greek spirit on the world. He closed his address by saying he would like to see a "new Greek rebirth."</p>
   <p>Dr. Bradley's lecture was enthusiatically applauded and the Ahepa was thanked again and again for bringing him before us.</p>
