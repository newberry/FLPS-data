   <p>True to its journalistic principles and faithful to its duty as guardian of the Greeks in America, the Star takes exception to statements made by the Banner, a Greek newspaper of New York City, and writes this article to correct its erratic sister paper and at the same time to defend the good name of our Greek consul in Chicago, who on account of his diplomatic position cannot engage in journalistic controversies.</p>
   <p>When a journal stoops so low that without due cause it attacks innocent individuals, it not only exposes itself to suit for libel, but it also reveals itself as an apostate from the fundamental principles of journalism. It further reveals the true character of certain people who have attired themselves in the journalistic mantle of freedom of the press.</p>
   
   <p>The real journalist who is faithful to his calling has every right for the interest of the people, to expose and to criticise public officials when corruption exists, when they are inefficient or negligent, or when in any other way they, as public servants, have acted against the public welfare.</p>
   <p>Criticism in such cases is service to the public, and the press in this country enjoys full liberty to serve the masses by exposing or criticising corrupt or incompetent officials. Censure under such circumstances is just because it is dictated by conscientious adherence to truth, justice, and the obligations of good journalism. But when censure is dictated by malice, vindictiveness, and a desire for personal aggrandizement, then true journalism has stepped out of the picture, and venomous hatred, imprecation, and insurrection against goodness and justice have been installed in its place by degraded and destructive pseudo-journalists.</p>
   
   <p>This New York Greek newspaper in its last issue stated that the Chicago Greek consul general had failed to fulfill his obligation to protect the interest of certain Macedonian Greeks in Terre Haute, Indiana, who had been intimidated by Bulgarians of that city. Our sister journal in sarcastic and inelegant language attacks what it calls the inefficiency of the Honorable Dr. N. Salopoulos in failing to defend our fellow- Greeks against the Bulgarian wolves who have threatened them with death unless they contribute generously to the Bulgarian cause.</p>
   <p>Gross ignorance is revealed in these unfounded accusations. What does our sister paper expect the Greek consul to do except to act through the regular diplomatic channels, which is all that he is legally authorized to do?</p>
   <p>Does the Banner expect him to mobilize Greek legions in Chicago, march to Terre Haute, and demand an apology? Does it expect the consul of Chicago to call out the marines?</p>
   
   <p>Silliness, ignorance, hot-headedness, gross misconception and abuse of prerogative are revealed in the article published in the New York paper. Maybe the Banner expected the Chicago Greek consul general to report to its editor his activities in the case and to ask the editorial staff for advice!</p>
   <p>It is really a shame, no matter how the action of the New York Greek journal is interpreted.</p>
   <p>For the information of this misguided,erratic,and apostate Greek newspaper the Star hastens to inform the public and all who are interested in the Bulgarian extortion case in Terre Haute, that the Greek consul general in Chicago upon receiving information about this incident immediately dispatched a secretary of the consulate to the scene to investigate the alleged extortion and intimidation. After the consul's secretary had brought back to Chicago the facts of the case in depositions, the Greek diplomat acting according to the prescribed procedure, sent copies of the findings to the properly constituted authorities of the sovereign State of Indiana, that is, to the State's attorney and the attorney general, and to the United States authorities.</p>
   
   <p>The result of this action was that the United States Government has taken over the prosecution of the case and has had the culprits arrested, and the trial is set for next week on the calendar of the Federal court. The Greek diplomat as representative of a friendly nation has been invited by the Government to send a consular secretary to follow the procedure of the trial, as is generally done in cases of this kind.</p>
   <p>Many prominent Chicago Greeks have visited the Greek consul in regard to the Bulgarian incident in Terre Haute, and all the Greek societies have taken an interest in the case, but the well-trained Greek diplomat has answered them laconically,</p>
   <p>"The United States Government has taken charge of the case."</p>
   
   <p>All hot-headed eagerness for immediate and foolish action melted away like snow before a fire when the astute Greek consul of Chicago uttered these words, "The United States Government." It was enough.</p>
   <p>In closing its argument the Star, using the phraseology of the Greek consul, informs the New York Greek newspaper that "the United States Government is in charge of the extortion case," and if the Banner possesses any intelligence, it will retract its statements.</p>
