   <p>p. 5.- This year's most successful picnic was given last Sunday by the Eptanisians. Great numbers of them came early and stayed late enjoying themselves to the utmost. Throughout the park there were family gatherings where private parties were in progress. A. Tzakis, secretary of the club had a table spread all day long and invited everyone to dine and be merry. The rest of the members were equally hospitable and did their best to give everyone a good time.</p>
