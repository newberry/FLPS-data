   <p>Last Sunday at about 8:00 P. M., Dr. Diamesis gave a lecture on"Prehistoric Medicine," at the Drill Hall of the Masonic Temple. The lecture was given under the auspices of the Messinian Club. The lecture was very interesting and was clarified by the use of slides, which illustrated the latest developments in medicine. Their use made possible a good comparison between the early "diaper" stages of the profession and its highly skilled state of the present day.</p>
   <p>The hall was crowded, but there were not as many from the professional group present as could have been desired.....</p>
