   <p>A large and select audience gathered in Kimball Hall to hear the musical program prepared by Mr. Peter Vournas. There are few Greeks in Chicago who have not heard Mr. Vournas make glorious music on the mandolin. Last Sunday he outdid himself and enthralled his hearers.</p>
   <p>The three hundred people in the audience who put aside all their other social obligations to be present, compensated in a small way for the absence of the large number which should have been--but was not--present. Even if these absentees did not care to hear the lovely music, it was their duty to support an artist of their race and community. Mr. Vournas has done much to raise the cultural level of the Greek community of Chicago, and therefore is worthy of everyone's support.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vournas was assisted by Mr. Minas and Mrs. Marion Boaras, who sang lovely Greek and American duets.</p>
