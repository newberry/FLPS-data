   <p>p. 1.- The Athena newspaper of Chicago tells the Greeks of America to subscribe to it because it is a national, patriotic, and honest newspaper. Loxias, which always looks after the interests of our countrymen, states that it is not a national, patriotic, or honest newspaper. We will say no more about it. Let the readers judge for themselves.</p>
   <p>Mr. Akgyros (editor of the Athena) deems himself a scholar. We feel sorry for any professionals or other Greeks who listen to his words. There is an old saying, "With the teacher that you pick, so shall you learn your lessons."</p>
   <p>Be careful, Greeks, don't let this glib-tongued man fool you. Don't give us the chance to say "I-told-you-so." Be careful!</p>
