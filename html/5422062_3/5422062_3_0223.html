   <p>Dear Readers:</p>
   <p>During the month of July the secretary of the Restaurant Association announced that dues would be payable at once and that a big drive would be inaugurated to obtain new members. Unfortunately, of the 102 members only fifty-five are in good standing. No new members were brought into the organization.</p>
   <p>The Association promised to better the economic standing of its members, yet already ten have closed their doors in bankruptcy. The trouble is that most of us do not know what an Association is. We don't know the meaning of cooperation, harmony and brotherly love. Nothing can be done without the support of each and every member. You can't depend on the organization, it depends on you.</p>

   <p>Show your enthusiasm and good will at the next meeting, Chicago, August 1, 1910.</p>
   <p>P. Katsikopoulos.</p>
