   <p>p. 3- Several young Greeks, lovers of music and song, who were members of various philarmonic societies in Greece, have recently united to found the first Greek philarmonic society in Chicago's Greek community.</p>
   <p>These boys on October 28th, will give a concert before the Woman's Club of Hull House with a program that will please all. The specific object of the concert is to raise funds so that they may dress in uniform.</p>
   <p>Since these young men are a credit to our community, which they are serving gratis, everybody is requested to attend the affair. Let us show our musical boys how much we think of them!. If it is impossible for you to attend. buy half a dozen tickes anyway! The concert must be a success in attendance and in receipts for the encouragement of our boys.</p>
   <p>Greek families especially are requested to attend the concert with all their children. Greek music and Greek songs are nourishing food for our new race in America.</p>
