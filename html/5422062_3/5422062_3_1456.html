   <p>With great success the symposium of the society Pontos took place last week at the Morrison Hotel, with many notables participating.</p>
   <p>It was rather an innovation to have the Hotel serve Greek meals to the diners. The Greek food,songs, and music pleased all those who took part in the affair.</p>
   <p>After the dinner speeches were delivered, with an eminent American as the first orator. He was Dr. G. E. White, president of the American College in Salonika. Mr. J. Kent Greene, former Judge, spoke in both English and Greek to the delight and astonishment of all. Other prominent men were Mr. Litsinger, former nominee for Mayor, Mr. H. W. Elmore and others. Dancing followed the speeches which lasted until a late hour.</p>

   <p>Profits of the symposium will be sent to Greece for the benefit of the refugees. Noble work indeed; the American Greeks never forget the sufferers in the old country.</p>
