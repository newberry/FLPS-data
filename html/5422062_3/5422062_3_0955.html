   <p>130 North Wells Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>Ever since the February 17th edition of your paper came to me, I have meant to write to you and to thank you just as an American citizen for that splendid Lincoln article. I did express myself at our meeting Monday, but I wanted to put myself on record in writing. It was a beautiful testimonial, and I have been eager to tell you so.</p>

   <p>Hoping to see you at our meeting on Wednesday, I am</p>
   <p>Very cordially yours,</p>
   <p>Harriet E. Vittum, head resident</p>
