   <p>The Chicago Public Library, besides the Ancient Greek books, has enriched its collection with books written in modern Greek.</p>
   <p>Over sixty new books have been put in circulation by the library. Many of the books are modern writings but none have been translated into Greek. Among the titles, we were glad to notice the book of poems "Xipnia Onira" (Day Dreams) by our well-known dentist, P. Chronopoulos.</p>
