   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Permit me to take this opportunity to thank you for permitting me to have a copy of the Greek Star containing the comparison between the funeral oration of Pericles over the heroes of the Peloponnesian War and Lincoln's Gettysburg speech. I read your comparison with great interest, and it inspired me to compare the original oration by Pericles with the Gettysburg speech. It is indeed astonishing that there is so close a resemblance. Your treatment of the subject is certainly instructive.</p>
   <p>With kindest personal regards, I remain</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>J. Kent Greene</p>
