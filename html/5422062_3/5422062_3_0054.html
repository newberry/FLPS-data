   <p>I am the only Greek who has received the proper training and permission to serve as a funeral director. Although it is a dreaded and hated calling, it is nevertheless a necessary one to the community. It is a great comfort to the bereaved family if the funeral is conducted in a dignified, quiet manner. I pledge myself to maintain the solemnity of the occasion, and to do so at the lowest possible cost to the bereaved.</p>
