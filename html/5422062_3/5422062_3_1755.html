   <p>One of the largest clubs in Chicago is that of the Paleohoritan community. The Paleohoritans are among the first Chicagoans to organize themselves and carry out their purposes and endeavors successfully. We all know that wherever we turn, we will see a Paleohoritan with his own establishment, if not owning the entire building in which his business is located.</p>
   <p>With all this progress, they have not forgotten their native land. Their organization has done many things for their "home town" and will continue to do so.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, they gave their annual picnic last Sunday at the Polonis Grove. Naturally, the picnic was a success. We never realized there were so many Greeks in Chicago; men and women born in Greece and the younger generation born in America.</p>
   <p>For hours the Greek orchestra played our beloved songs and the Paleohoritans danced with their wives and friends and sons and daughters. Four dance circles were necessary to give everyone a chance to dance. The enthusiasm which the boys and girls showed for Greek dancing was an unexpected but pleasant surprise. The Paleohoritans have every right to be proud of their Greek children.</p>
   <p>The success of the picnic was due chiefly to the efforts of P. Courlas, president; G. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, vice-president; N. Economos, secretary and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Gianakakos, treasurer.</p>
