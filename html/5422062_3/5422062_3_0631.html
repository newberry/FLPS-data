   <p>p. 4.- If we should judge from the enormous success of last Monday, the Gapa chapters should devote themselves to play-acting.</p>
   <p>Those in the play acted their parts with much naturalness and talent before a house packed with thousands of fellow members and friends.</p>
   <p>Among those taking part were Mr. A. Parisis, as Gero Linardos; A. Gantos, as Chris, the cook, lover of Maroula; Mr. T. Constantinides, as Constantis; and P. Primas, as Pankratis. All the players performed their parts very admirably. They worked very hard to make the performance a success and they were not disappointed, neither was the audience.</p>
   <p>This Gapan performance has done much to interest the Greeks of Chicago in the theater. We are very grateful to the originators of the idea.</p>

   <p>At the end of the performance, George Gretsis' orchestra entertained us with those undying Greek songs of Kleftourias (Robinhoods).</p>
   <p>We congratulate the various presidents, those who took part in the play, and those who were connected with it in any other way, for a wonderful performance and a huge success.</p>
