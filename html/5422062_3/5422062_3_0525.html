   <p>When WGN last year presented the Greek Chorus of Chicago under the direction of Demetrios Papageorge in a program of Greek music of the post-Byzantine age, it was overwhelmed with expressions of appreciation for the great beauty and the novelty of the program.</p>
   <p>This same chorus, 25 voices strong, will again be heard over WGN at 7:45 o'clock next Friday night in a 30-minute program of Greek music ranging from the year 312 A. D. to the present day. Mr. Papageorge will again conduct the chorus.</p>
   <p>Prior to the concert a brief account of Byzantine music will be given by P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star.</p>
   <p>The concert will be one of the highlights of an 18-day festival of Byzantine art sponsored by the Renaissance Society of the University of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago and will enable WGN listeners to hear this chorus sing several of the same numbers which they will present in their program at the University of Chicago on November 6.</p>
