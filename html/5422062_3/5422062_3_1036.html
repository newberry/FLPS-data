   <p>We remember the old days, when a new paper was published, how they were snatched from one another, how rows of people waited outside the office in order to see the first page. In many cases, we are told, the demand was so great that a second edition was necessary to supply the demands of the people.</p>
   <p>These remembrances come to us with the issuance of the Greek Press. The appearance of the Greek Press was not symbolized in any similar way as the above, nor was there an anxious, general waiting for the day of its edition.</p>
   <p>All things, we are told, are relative in this world of ours. The absolute does not appear in a single instant of human action or thought. Success, truth, honor, wealth, all are parallel. And when we have this truth in mind, the conclusions deduced from our thoughts will always be within the boundaries of logic.</p>
   <p>Look at the proportion, then, and have in mind the interest the world showed in the first edition of the Greek Press, and, we can venture to say, a significant number of our countrymen remained to see the first page and a large group of people, with an inward joy, heralded its appearance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Everyone waited to see if all the promises of the circulars were fulfilled, if the Greek Press lived up to their expectations, if it would really possess a distinctive journalistic stamp, so that there will be a noble attempt creating an instrument corresponding with the spirit of the times.</p>
   <p>In a previous issue, our brilliant contributor wrote in his article, "The Greek Press and Its Position in America," that the Greeks of Chicago accepted the paper as filling a long felt lack in the field of community publications. Zores once said, in a psychological observation, "The world is coming to a new are, an era where great works are contributed for the silent."</p>
   <p>This psychological condition of the friends and readers of the Greek Press was not able to continue for long. After the first criticisms and after the long yearnings were satisfied, many sent their sincere thanks in to us.</p>
   <p>The numberless letters we received and the manifold congratulations that were wished us even before the publication of the Greek Press, bear evidence to our above statements. These encouragements have made us very enthusiastic and have inspired us anew. We not only feel that we shall be successful but also that we shall strengthen the position of our countrymen in Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Incomparable was our delight--our feeling--when our old friends and acquaintances sped to telephone us, came to see us, or wrote immediately on the receipt of the first issue, in order to wish us a faultless career, as well as "wings in the spirited chase."</p>
   <p>These manifestations move us deeply. They are unanimous in telling us that the Greek people of Chicago have felt very much the lack of a contemporary, journal, of a paper in whose pages are found true facts and unbiased opinions.</p>
   <p>With this certainty, that the road we cut will be followed truthfully, we hasten to give to all our deepest thanks!</p>
   <p>The Greek Press.</p>
