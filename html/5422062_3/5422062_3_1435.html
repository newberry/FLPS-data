   <p>The Greek Professional Men's Club is sponsoring, on Friday, August 9, a special lecture. For the second time, Prof. George E. Mylonas, who has been teaching at the University of Chicago, will lecture to us on the above date at the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mylonas' theme will be "Archeological Finds of Grete". His lecture will be supplemented with films, which Mr. Mylonas had taken during the digging of the finds and after completion of the work.</p>
   <p>To all those who have not heard Mr. Mylonas speak, the Greek Press offers the advice that they grasp this opportunity before it is gone.</p>
