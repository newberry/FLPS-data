   <p>p. 1.- The new ordinance forbidding peddlers on the city streets has gone into effect. This naturally affects the Greeks, because they are very numerous in this trade. The Greeks have voiced a protest against this ordinance, but to no avail.</p>
   <p>Hope hasn't been given up yet. They have taken the matter to court and are preparing another protest. A meeting was held at Horan Hall last Sunday for this purpose. The principal speaker was Andrew Vlachos who urged the Greeks to stand together and fight.</p>
   <p>The Greek Ambassador, Mr. Lambros Koromilas was also there. Other speakers were Mr. Karagiannis, president of the movement, and Messrs. Tsambas, Drabilas, and D. Eutaxias.</p>
