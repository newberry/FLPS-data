   <p>P. 1 - All nations have folk songs and they are all beautiful, but the Greeks have something distinctive. They are blended with the history of two thousand years, the traditions of a continuous culture, the hopes and aspirations of a people which has lived, laughed, cried, and is determined to carry on.</p>
   <p>On April 2, at 8:30 P.M., within the walls of The Recital Hall of the Auditorium Bldg., 431 South Wabash Avenue, Angelo Desfis, a Greek Tenor of meritorious reputation, will afford us an opportunity with his interpretation of Greek folk songs, to enter the gates, and sense the thrill that is entirely Greek, by hearing him sing "H Volko" "To Poulaki," "O Aetos" and as many more as your heart desires.</p>

   <p>Mr. Angelo Desfis is a well known Greek artist in the interpretation of Greek folk songs. He has a musical education that is the envy of many concert singers. At the International Music Festival at Frankfort Germany, he was the only Greek representative of the art of Folk Music. With an international Musical background he attempts at all times to offer his innermost towards the true interpretation of folk songs.</p>
   <p>Business accomplishments of the Greeks are well recognized. The Greek in America stands as one foreign element that is economically independent. What the Greek needs more is intellectual progress. Consequently, whenever I see, a Greek who advances in the arts and the letters, certainly I am pleased.</p>
   <p>Here are two doctors, Minas Johanides and George D. Tsoulos, who have had the results of their medical research printed in the Archives of Surgery of the American Medical Association. Bravo Doctors! And you, George, as I have already told you, as a president of a club you are not so hot, but as a scientist you are darn good. Discount the former. Keep up with the latter.</p>

   <p>Vasilios Navromatis of "Sons of Pericles fame," seems to be one of these youngsters who are out with a gospel and are ready to preach it at every corner. Just talk to him. He is a two hundred per cent Greek and is not afraid to admit it. Only sixteen years old when he organized the west side boys he did it on Friday 13th and called his chapter "The Lucky 13th." Aside from that he informed everybody that superstition is of no concern to him. He is out to raise "the befallen name of Halsted Street, mother of American Hellenism, even if it takes him a life time" I admire your willingness to start a crusade!</p>
   <p>But has Halsted Street befallen, I doubt it. It still is the only Greek thing left in America. By all means do not try to Americanize it. It will lose its color.</p>
   <p>Here is something that might give you a smile. A Greek lady read the story about the miracoulous icon that I happen to discover in the Galineas home and she immediately advised a neighbor whose baby boy is ill to take a tama of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>$10.00 so that her son may regain his health. Certainly there is room for a racket, but not with Galineas. He is a proud Maniati.</p>
   <p>"Makria apo ton Kosmo" (far from the world) is the name of a Greek eight reel film to be shown April 5 at the Eighth Street theatre. Product of the Olympia Film Company of Athens, it was filmed in Greece particularly in the locale of Agion Oros where no female specie is permitted to enter the sanctified gates of the monastery. Leave it to the movie folk to do the impossible. Demos Cakridas of Boston and Nick Yeracopoulos of Athens are the two representatives of the company in America.</p>
