   <p>Two hundred people attended the concert given by the young Greek violinist, Nickolas Mavrikes, in Kimball Hall.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Mavrikes is master of his instrument, and this may account for the fact that this is the first time that no one either came in late or left early at a concert attended by Greek people.</p>
   <p>After the concert the young artist was feted by a group of music lovers at the Ranch Cafe of Mr. C. Terzakis.</p>
