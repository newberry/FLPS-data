   <p>A sincere journalist must possess five characteristics, that are of tremendous importance. Truthfulness, a sense of justice, strong patriotic feelings, courage, and a sense of duty, are all prerequisites of good journalism. Any man, who enters the field of journalism must have unlimited courage and an adequate education.</p>
   <p>Publishing a newspaper is not a job for any peddler; or for even a patriotic pedant. It is a sacred and patriotic undertaking that must be entered into with great foresight and consideration.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, various fish peddlers and other social floating wrecks anchor themselves to a community by pretending to be great and mighty journalists. Their only subterfuge is a heterogeneous smattering of knowledge that was amassed in no recognized school of learning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The papers they publish are nothing more than scandal sheets, and are highly beneficial to those who use the medium of the press to exploit the public. These pseudo-scholars present themselves to the Greek, and even to the American public, as men who tie and untie major social problems.</p>
   <p>They create social problems, instead of solving them; since they find a more lucrative living in a disrupted community, that cannot watch their activities too closely, than they can find in a unified and peaceful society.</p>
   <p>Curiously enough, these men are allowed to continue their farce, even when the people have become aware of their true characters. This is something that will always puzzle us. A natural conclusion is that there are certain powerful individuals in the community that secretly support and help these uneducated parasites.</p>
   <p>Thousands of Greeks all over America throw their papers into the rubbish heap <span class="page-break">\3</span>without even bothering to open them. This is not a logical thing to do. In time there will be no Greek papers in America because people erroneously discard the worth-while papers along with the yellow-sheets.</p>
   <p>The Greek papers in America are performing a sacred duty; they are keeping the Greek language alive in a foreign land. Many Greeks who do not take time to read even one Greek paper a week are forgetting their mother-tongue; and their children are being raised in ignorance of the beauties of the Greek language.</p>
   <p>These individuals claim that they are never free from their duties and cannot read their papers. Others excuse their actions by saying that they do not like to read scandal sheets and abusive editorials, written by some individual who is unfit to shine shoes. There are still more who complain because they receive papers that they never subscribed to; and that they do not wish to read those pieces of "wrapping paper", even if they are sent free of charge.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>These complaints, of course, have some justifications, but all papers must not be judged by the standards of the cheap papers that, unfortunately, exist.</p>
   <p>Human beings must provide themselves with spiritual and mental nourishment if they desire to remain on a par with their fellow men. Regardless of the type of work an individual is engaged in, he must devote a certain amount of time to cultivating his mind. By reading his papers, a man can separate the wheat from the chaff. Thus, he will become aware of the frauds, and will find it easy to ignore them, by knowing them for what they truly are. He will also be in a position to expose them to his friends and associates. Therefore, such a person is a benefit to his community and to his race.</p>
   <p>The real Greek papers must have hearty and ready access to every home and place of business in America.....They will bring truth and light with them and so enlighten and brighten the future of the Greeks in America.....</p>

   <p>The martyred Patriarch Gregorious, who was hung from the door of the Patriarchy by the Turks, performed a wonderful work for his country. He was the first Greek Patriarch to found a printing shop. In 1815, he had a press installed in the Patriarchy and proceeded to print many books. He continued until the revolution of 1821, when he was ruthlessly killed by the barbarous Turks. This great man not only gave his life for his country, but he kept Greek letters alive by printing his books.</p>
   <p>Has the holy Patriarch died in vain? Is not the printing of Greek books and papers in America a trust as sacred as the one he died for?</p>
   <p>The Bulgarians in a city in Illinois have a daily newspaper printed entirely in Bulgarian. They are even trying to teach the Bulgarian language to the Greeks from Serbean Macedonia.....This daily paper is supported by a club that has three thousand members, and each member pays one dollar a month for a subscription to this paper. Therefore, the working class of Bulgarians are <span class="page-break">\6</span>being educated by means of a daily newspaper since 1906.</p>
   <p>We have always considered the Bulgarians to be barbarians, and yet they have realized the importance of education through the medium of the press. While we Greeks, who brag and pride ourselves upon our culture and civilization, permit hypocrites and liars to print their inanities at our expense. They are allowed to exploit the power of the press and blithely go their way oblivious, or perhaps indifferent, to public opinion.</p>
   <p>We are cultured and superior, yet we do not properly support the few papers that gallantly and courageously hold high the torch of enlightenment and truth to light the path of the coming generations.</p>
