   <p>At last a committee has been chosen to continue the investigation of the so-called bankruptcy of the Greek-American Bank of Chicago. It will attempt to bring to light the mysterious activities of these bankers, which resulted in the disappearance of $215,000.</p>
   <p>Our past strong denunciations, finally, seems to have aroused the conscience of the community. Last Sunday fifty of the defrauded investors appealed to the Greek community for financial aid, with which to engage a capable lawyer to represent them; and we are happy to say that they received the communitie's support. A lawyer has been engaged to defend the rights of the eight hundred investors.</p>
   <p>We ask even those outside of Chicago who wish to help this committee, that they send in their contributions in order that the fight might not be lost because of a lack of funds.</p>
   <p>Two of the officials of the Bank, Mr. George Douros and Fotios Papakostas, have left for Greece in order to purchase flour; however, Mr. Angelos Geokaris and Mr. George Stamatides are still in Chicago. These two gentlemen are, naturally, just as responsible for the failure of the bank as the other two; and, therefore, can be forced to answer for their partners actions as well as their own.</p>
   <p>The courts have heard of the flight of the two bankers and have begun to realize there must be some truth to our accusations, and have started to investigate the affairs of these two fly-by-nights very carefully.</p>
   <p>In the meanwhile, however, the committee and the investors must not remain idle with their hands folded, and expect the Lord to smite their enemies dead. In order that justice might triumph, action--decisive, thoughtful action--must be taken; and taken at once.</p>
