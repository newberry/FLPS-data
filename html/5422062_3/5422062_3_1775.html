   <p>We are informed by Mr. A. Soteras, who has just arrived from Greece, that a Greek-American society was organized in Sparta, by the initiative of the distinguished Councilor at Law, Mr. K. G. Tsigourakos. The various Lacedemonian societies of America are charter members of the New Society in Sparta Greece.</p>
   <p>The money raised and forwarded to this new Greek-American society, brings results of progress, and a determination to spread them to the rest of the countries of Lacedemon. Old streets are repaired, new ones are built, and water works are spread everywhere. The New Society plans in a very short time to erect a modern hospital in Sparta. The germ, of Greek American progressiveness, is contagious, and is spreading like wild fire in every county of the state.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Mr. Tsigourakos, and the sons of Sparta, for sooner or later, their initiative will be imitated by other states of Greece, who are in need of Greek-American progressiveness.</p>
