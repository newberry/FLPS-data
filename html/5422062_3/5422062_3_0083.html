   <p>Everyone is impressed by the amazing business and enterprising genius of the Greek people of Chicago. Our success and material prosperity are due to our inborn ability to engage in any business with hope, energy, and resourcefulness.</p>
   <p>If one wishes to survey and make a study of the business accomplishments of our Greek people, not only in Chicago but in the entire United States, he cannot but admire and appreciate the fascinating and marvelous Greek business spirit and genius.</p>
   <p>We say this because the individual success, progress, and prosperity of the Greeks in this country, and especially in Chicago, are gigantic and remarkable. It is even more remarkable when we consider the poor intellectual and social equipment which the average Greek individual possessed upon arriving in this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>country. Remember, also, that he could not speak the English language and was living here under new and difficult economic, racial, cultural, and social conditions. Our people must be judged by the business standards of America, the greatest business center in the world, if in one is fully to comprehend their great energy, industry, thrift, and ability.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Greeks in other lands such as Egypt, Russia, Rumania, and Turkey, prospered and enriched themselves, but they lived under conditions which differ from ours. Those who went there were not illiterate and untrained immigrants like those who came here; nevertheless, they did not accomplish more than we did in Chicago and in America generally, in the short space of ten years.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the Greeks of those countries, being more highly educated and prepared, were considered an important factor in their civilization, and as a desirable and constructive element. They contributed inestimably toward the progress, development, and prosperity of those countries.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>On the contrary, in this country, to which many divers peoples immigrated, who were illiterate, ignorant, and miserably poor, we were, among the other ethnic groups, considered by most Americans as an undesirable element, a wretched and pitiful lot of wandering "foreigners." Our crudeness and illiteracy, then, was due to the corruption and incompetence of the Greek governments in power before the present Venizelist government came into office and gave new life to the whole national Greek state. No one can forget to what trials and tribulations, to what humiliation and contempt, to what intolerant attacks and sufferings we were subjected during the first years after our arrival in America. In those times, occasionally, the Greek consul in Chicago raised his voice and acted to prevent such injustice and intolerance. He did this not because it was his duty, but because he had courage and was greatly interested in the well-being and struggle of the hard-working and sweating Greek immigrant. That consul was also deeply conscious of the obligations of the American leaders and officials, who had immigrated earlier to this land, toward our nationality because of our historic contributions to humanity in the past.</p>
   <p>The consciousness of our commercial progress is much greater here than in any <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>other country, because in numbers and by comparison with Greeks in other lands, we have done much more in establishing successful and thriving business enterprises.</p>
   <p>For some time now we have discovered several individuals among our people in America, who, if they do not enjoy more moral and social power and prestige than the Greek merchants of Egypt, Turkey, Russia, and Rumania, at least are just about as wealthy. This phenomenon is attributable to the fact that many Greek businessmen in Chicago, and in America, became millionaires during the World War business boom; thus, more rich Greeks were added to those who had made millions previously in the manufacture of cigarettes, in the coffee business, and in theatrical enterprises, etc.</p>
   <p>The admiration for our rapid business rise and ingenuity reaches its zenith when one thinks that all this has been accomplished by individuals as business units and not by corporations, companies, and powerful trusts, which are characteristic of American business. It is well known that America's companies <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and corporations are her main business units, and the basis of her economic and capitalistic life. Consequently, one cannot fail to notice that the Greek, operating as an individual, as a single business unit, has been competing not only with other businessmen, but also with large companies and corporations. Though a foreigner, uneducated, unable to speak the native language, he has been struggling on with these disadvantages in his battle against these larger and better organized competitors.</p>
   <p>In our desire to come down to concrete cases we will examine our commerical and economic life in our city, Chicago; upon proper examination we will see that we are supreme in, and the "King" of, the candy-store and confectionery business, even though we had little previous experience in the business. Our stores now occupy the best and busiest corners in the Loop, and in the most strategic shopping centers in every district of Chicago. These stores are both beautiful and spacious. What more should we say about our beautiful and excellent restaurants which beautiful and distinguish the main business thoroughfares of our city?</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We have also engaged in the fruit and grocery business in Chicago with great success. We are not only superior to many other nationalities in this line of business, but we are rapidly expanding, and very soon we will become the leaders.</p>
   <p>With his superb business genius, the Greek has made secure his grip on these particular business by engaging predominantly in the restaurant business, and for this reason it is said that he has gained a monopoly of the American-people's stomach.</p>
   <p>The Greek has also gone into the theatrical business. This is clear evidence that he has not neglected to love the beautiful and strive for artistic excellence, the ancestral characteristics and gifts of his people which have been handed down by his forefathers, the masters of the arts; the first poets, dramatists, and men of letters.</p>
   <p>A Greek, Mr. Pantages, became Czar of the theater business in the Western States. In many cities in the United States Greeks own and manage great theaters.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Chicago, especially, is well known to us for its magnificent Greek theaters.</p>
   <p>From the above survey, one gets an idea of the greatness and promise of the Greek business genius and his potentialities. What could our homeland, Greece, and we not do in the business field, if more emphasis were laid on business training and education, if we co-operated more in business, and if we combined our resources into companies and corporations? It would help, if we suggested to the Greek Government that it should support and subsidize every type of business. The Greek Government must realize, as well as we, that in business we will find the greatest and most important source of our individual material prosperity, both national and individual.</p>
