   <p>The Trianon was filled with thousands of Greeks who came from all parts of the city. For blocks around, all parking space available was filled. If all the people present at the Trianon that night were settled in one community, they would easily form a fair-sized city.</p>
   <p>Chicago should be proud of Greeks who show their interest in progress and philanthropic works by turning out in a body for social affairs of this sort. Only those present at the Ahepan dance Monday night can realize the multitude of Greeks that were there. The profits totaling many thousands of dollars are going to be distributed among the Greek schools of Chicago. School teachers, priests, parents, principals,---all thank the Ahepa for this benefit and we hope that other organizations follow in Ahepa's footsteps in order to help further the Greek education of our children.</p>
   
   <p>To Supreme Vice-President, P. Sikokis, to Governor of this district, S. Rekas and to everybody else connected with this dance, we extend the heartiest congratulations.</p>
