   <p>Dr. L. Diamesis of Chicago gave a lecture before a large and select audience in the Sherman Hotel last Sunday afternoon. Among the notables present was John Giannes, the Consul General of Greece. Mr. P. Papatheodore, president of the Stereoelladition's Society, introduced the speaker.</p>
   <p>Dr. Diamesis began his speech concerning his impressions of Greece today, by stating that many years had intervened since he left his homeland to emigrate to America. "Everything seemed small," he said. "No one knew me, and I was a stranger in my own land." He then discussed the many discomforts one who comes from America is bound to feel in Greece. Curiously enough, no one ever noticed them when he lived in Greece. America makes every other country look inferior.</p>
   <p>Dr. Diamesis then pointed out the delights of Greece, and recited stanzas of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Greek poetry in order better to describe her natural beauty. He analyzed the economic and political structure of Greece much to the delight of a very interested audience.</p>
