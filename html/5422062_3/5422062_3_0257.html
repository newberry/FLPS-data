   <p>p. 1- Mr. Rifakis - "Dear Sir, I am hastening to add my congratulations to those of our fellow Greeks in praising your wonderful plans for the progress and future of the Chicago Greeks. I am willing to answer all questions put to me, truthfully and frankly."</p>
   <p>Mr. Eutaxias - "Are there many large fruit concerns in our city, Mr. Rifakis? If so, which are they?"</p>
   <p>R. - "There are six of them, operated, respectively, by Messrs Prokos, N. Mazarakos, Giannakopoulos, Rifakis, Giannakopoulos (bananas) and Boutsanesis or Benson (bananas)."</p>
   <p>E. - "Do many Greeks work there?"</p>
   <p>R. - "At least twelve at each."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>E.- "Do many customers come to the market daily?"</p>
   <p>R.- "About 5,000."</p>
   <p>E.- ""hat is the percentage of Greeks out of this number?"</p>
   <p>R.- "Half are Greek -"</p>
   <p>E.- "Which are more successful in the fruit business, the Greeks or men of other nationalities."</p>
   <p>R.- "Even if there were 12,000 Italians and Jews in comparison with 2,500 Greeks, the Greeks would be more successful. They realize that rich men want excellent fruits and are not afraid to spend money for them and they know that poor folks want excellent fruits, too. So what do they do? By making a higher profit off the rich man, the peddler can afford to sell good fruit at lower prices to the poor man."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>E.- "Do the Greeks buy their fruits from Greeks alone or do they buy from all nationalities?"</p>
   <p>R.- "They buy to suit their purses."</p>
   <p>E.- "Do you think that if the Greeks united, they would benefit by it?"</p>
   <p>R.- "Yes. If all the Greeks of Chicago unite and pull together, they can outrank all other nationalities in the fruit business and make bigger profits for themselves."</p>
   <p>E.- "What if the Jews, Italians and Irish form a union to rival ours?"</p>
   <p>R.- "There is nothing for us to fear, because these nationalities are bitter rivals and do not get along together."</p>
   <p>E.- "What gain will the Greeks get by uniting?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>R.- "They will be able to monopolize the fruit industry, they will obtain added profits and they will become strengthened and will not be afraid of opposition from no one."</p>
   <p>E.- "Do you think the Greeks are willing to unite as we have suggested?"</p>
   <p>R.- "To say yes would be a lie. It is an excellent suggestion and should be carried out, but the Greeks are stubborn people, so we don't know how they'll take such a suggestion. I approve of it, and will lend all possible help."</p>
   <p>E.- "Mr. Prokos, are there many Greek stores selling fruits in our city?"</p>
   <p>P.- "About 800, large and small."</p>
   <p>E.- "Is that all?"</p>
   <p>P.- "Well, there are about 4,000 Greek fruit peddlers but they do not have their own stores."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>E.- "How many buy fruit from you daily?"</p>
   <p>P.- "About 1,500."</p>
   <p>E.- "Why is this, since there are almost 5,000 in Chicago?"</p>
   <p>P.- "They don't all trade at Greek places."</p>
   <p>E.- "How many go to strangers?"</p>
   <p>P.- "About half."</p>
   <p>E.- "Why do the Greeks go to strangers instead of supporting their own countrymen?"</p>
   <p>P.- "They do not do it for spite but they are afraid that we are too high in price and won't haggle over prices as the Jews and Italians do?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>E.- "If all the Greeks had a chance to get together and talk things over, would it help?"</p>
   <p>P.- "Oh, yes! Many misguided notions could be cleared up in this way, and outstanding problems could be talked over. The one thing that will solve our problem is a union of all Greek fruit merchants in Chicago. It is the only solution."</p>
   <p>Loxias - We have written and spoken of many things. The rest is up to you. Go ahead.</p>
