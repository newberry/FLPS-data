   <p>In Lowell, Massachusetts, on October 12 one of the greatest Columbus Day parades marched in commemoration of the city's first centennial, and many military and political organizations of various nationalities took part. The Greek community was well represented by the Ahepa lodge, which participated in the parade with its band, flags, and banners and more than two hundred members, all wearing the organization's uniform. They also had a float representing the Parthenon, the nine Muses, and Pallas Athena. Ahepa's float added much to the beauty of the pageant, and the Parthenon astonished Governor Curley of Massachusetts and the city officials as well as the throngs of spectators. Fifty robust members of the Boston Ahepa lodge marched in Foustanellas.</p>
