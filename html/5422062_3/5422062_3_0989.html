   <p>With the complete collapse of the Greek rebellion apparently a matter of days, the Greek colony in Chicago yesterday was filled with rumors of a royalist move to place Marina, the Duchess of Kent, on the throne as Queen, with her husband, Prince George, son of the King of England, as her consort. According to dispatches from Greece, preparations are being made in Athens for the royal return, with little enthusiasm for any member of the royal family except Marina.</p>
   <p>Behind this move, Greek leaders say, is the desire of Greece to cement its alliance with England. England in turn would gain by the creation of a strong ally in the Mediterranean area. The enthusiasm with which Marina, a royal Greek princess, was greeted by the British Empire at the time of her marriage has given Greek statesmen cause to believe that such a move would meet with the approval of the British foreign office.</p>

   <p>P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, pointed out that history would be repeating itself in such a move. When King George of Greece was crowned almost seventy-five years ago, England made him a present of the Ionian Islands.</p>
   <p>A similar gift, the Island of Cyprus, is being considered in connection with the present diplomatic move, according to reports.</p>
