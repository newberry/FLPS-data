   <p>The Cretan Organization of Chicago is giving, this coming Sunday, a dance at the Olympian Hall, owned by the Kollias brothers, at 748 S. Halsted.</p>
   <p>This Cretan gathering expects all Cretans to come and sing and dance in the true Cretan way. It is a pleasure to attend such an affair whose countrymen have given so much honor and glory to Greece.</p>
