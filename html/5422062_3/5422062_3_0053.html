   <p>We are happy to inform the public of the opening of the first Greek furniture factory here in Chicago. Mr.A. Kalamatianos is the owner and his plant will be called the Archimedes. All kinds of furniture will be made, including restaurant and candy-store fixtures, at reasonable prices.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt that the Greek people will support this enterprise, which will in turn benefit the community.</p>
