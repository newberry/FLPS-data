   <p>P.2--Miss Addams's production of "Athanasius Diakos," a Greek patriotic drama which was presented last Thursday at Hull House for the benefit of the Greek community in Chicago, was more than a success.</p>
   <p>The hall was so much packed that hundreds of ticket-holders were unable to attend. Miss Addams therefore decided to repeat the performance and render it possible for every one to see this thrilling drama of national character. Tickets are sold at 338 and 342 South Halsted Street and at Hull House.</p>
