   <p>Dear Fellow-members:</p>
   <p>Today, as never before, the nations of the world are uniting to protect their own interests. Today all elements in the community are trying to insure their existence by uniting to fight for their rights. Today we confectioners of Chicago are organized in order to set up standards of production and of production methods. We have organized to prevent cutthroat competition, and to protect our interests.</p>
   <p>In view of this, we ask all confectioners to join our union, because "in unity there is strength". The first general meeting will take place on June 2 at two o'clock at 20 West Randolph Street. Important problems will be decided at this meeting, so please be present.</p>
   <p>Secretary,</p>
   <p>J. Adinamis</p>
