   <p>The Greeks of Chicago do not always have the chance to hear Americas' greatest philosopher give a lecture. We are referring, of course, to Clarence Darrow. Due to the indefatigable efforts of Louis George of Woodlawn Chapter No. 93, Mr. Darrow has consented to speak before Ahepans, next Tuesday, at the Masonic Temple, 64th and Green Streets. His theme will be "My Philosophy of Life and Americanism". Thousands of Greeks are expecting to be present at this lecture.</p>
