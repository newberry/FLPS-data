   <p>Wrestling champion J. Londos, whose laurels are being watched by the whole Greek population, especially by the Chicago Greeks, who attend en masse when he wrestles in Chicago, does not forget his moral obligations towards our Greek community. Of his own free will he is offering the proceeds of a match for the needs of our community.</p>
   <p>This statement of Londos has been made through his promoter, after which preliminary understanding the central committee of the Greek communities of Chicago will come together to discuss and arrange details for the affair.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greek Daily, in announcing this pleasant information, congratulates Mr. Londos for his generous offer, and reserves to itself the publication of arrangements in detail.</p>
