   <p>p. 5.- Hundreds of Tegeatans escaped last Sunday's scorching heat by attending the picnic at Schiller Park. While others sweltered in various parts of the city, these people were enjoying themselves in great comfort. In the shade of the many trees, they ate, drank, and danced to their hearts content.</p>
   <p>Both old and new faces were seen. They came from all parts of the city. Rev. H. Tzobalas of Nashville, Tennessee was there. Mrs. Houndras, wife of the priest of Memphis, Tennessee and her two brothers, Nick and Bill Trakas were also present.</p>
   <p>Everyone remained at the picnic till late at night. It was an enjoyable day for many of the Tegeatans and will not be soon forgotten.</p>
