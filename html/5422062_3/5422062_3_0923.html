   <p>Due to the fact that the two year old Greek church Evangelismos of the North-Side has many obligations to meet besides needing of interior decoration, the church's authorities have deemed it advisable to hold a picnic in order to raise the needed funds. The church needs yet more funds because shortly a Greek school will be built to give our American born boys and girls a taste of the immortal Greek language.</p>
   <p>For all the aforesaid reasons all Greeks in Chicago are cordially invited to attend this forthcoming frolic, which will be held on Aug. 28th at Kolzes Electric Park.</p>

   <p>The Greek Community of Chicago announces that on Aug. 28th a picnic will take place, at Schulth's Grove Park, 22nd street and Desplaines Ave, for the benefit of our wounded soldiers, widows, and orphans. Everybody is invited to come and make the picnic a success.</p>
