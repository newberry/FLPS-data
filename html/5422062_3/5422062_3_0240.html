   <p>p. 2.- In a few days all facts concerning the new Restaurant Association will be disclosed to the public. That which we have tried to promote since last year (and no other newspaper saw fit to help us for the mutual benefit of all Chicago Greeks) has finally materialized. We pray daily that this organization will become a strong force and trample out those elements that are trying to impede our progress.</p>
   <p>We hope the members of this organization will realize their danger and cooperate with one another against the common enemy. "In union there is strength." No one wants to harm the Greeks by suggesting unionization to them. Please don't act superior to one another. Everyone needs help.</p>
   <p>By uniting you stop giving coffee, rolls and butter for five-cents. Why should you work and sweat merely to meet expenses? Fill your pockets and take life easy. Unite with one another and demand higher prices. You can get them!</p>
