   <p>Because the Greek community of Chicago is the most populous and richest Greek community in America,</p>
   <p>Because the Greeks of Chicago own more real-estate property than all the other Greeks in America combined,</p>
   <p>Because there are three magnificent Greek churches in Chicago, which are free of all debts and which are valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars,</p>
   <p>Because there are over thirty patriotic and benevolent societies which are functioning admirably,</p>
   <p>Because in Chicago we have established the only Greek bank,</p>
   <p>Because there are more than four thousand Greek stores in this city, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Finally, because Chicago is striving to become the greatest city in the world in a period of ten years:</p>
   <p>For all these reasons, Chicago, as a city, and as a great Greek community, must have the greatest, the richest, and the best-informed Greek newspaper.</p>
   <p>A writer on an American newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, has given us a hint regarding this necessity in a recent article which dealt with our Greek problems.</p>
   <p>Without a dignified, serious press, without a wise and erudite newspaper, without a newspaper truly great in its editorial policy and its international, national, and local news service, the Greek community, despite its greatness, cannot be proud of its numerical strength, its wealth, its promising future,....,its trade, and all the other activities which distinguish Chicago from any other Greek community in America.</p>
   <p>These are the reasons why Saloniki came into being. In just three months, this <span class="page-break">\3</span>newspaper has advanced by leaps and bounds. A comparison of the present issue with the first issue will confirm this. The progress and success of Saloniki are truly phenomenal in the annals of journalism.</p>
   <p>The large advertisements of the greatest and wealthiest commercial and manufacturing concerns and factories that appear in Saloniki speak most eloquently. The many thousands of Saloniki readers are giving the utmost support to these concerns.</p>
   <p>Under such circumstances, Saloniki, with more pages and more frequent editions, will very soon occupy its proper station in the journalistic world. Thus, a great void will be filled in the community of Chicago. The Greeks of this metropolis of the Middle West may well boast of this newspaper, which is nothing more than the product of their patriotism, their loyalty to our fatherland, their thought, and their initiative.</p>
   <p>Assured by such omens, Saloniki thanks all its good friends and readers heartily.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It will continue in its patriotic career with the same policy of service to America, to our fatherland, and to every Greek. It will accept, and it will struggle for, the highest ideals and ideas. This program has made Saloniki an indispensable national Greek-American institution.</p>
