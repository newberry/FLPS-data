   <p>The recital given by the Greek students of the McKinley High School on February 4 was a success. The artistic performance was well balanced and held the undivided attention of the large audience.</p>
   <p>The program included the following:</p>
   <p>The "National Anthem"; piano solos titled "Meditatum Rusticana" and "Spinning Wheel," by Miss P. Javaras; American songs by Miss H. R. Levine; a violin solo by the well-known student, Jacob Selovity, which received hearty applause; Mr. James Yourelle who executed the ancient Greek dances with breath-taking grace.</p>
   <p>The entire program was inspiring, and a typical Greek evening of entertainment. The love for knowledge possessed by these students, is admired by the Saloniki.</p>
