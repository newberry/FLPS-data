   <p>The unveiling of a statue of General Demetrios Ypsilanti at the Michigan town bearing the Greek hero's name is a tribute to the memory of a man who, in his troubled day, did as much as any other individual to arouse civilized nations to sympathy for the cause of Hellenic independence.</p>
   <p>At a time when a group of settlers on the Huron river decided to form an organized community, in the early twenties of last century, the military exploits of Demetrios Ypsilanti thrilled every freedom-loving heart, not only in Greece but the world over, and perhaps nowhere more than in the United States. The name was no sooner suggested for the new settlement than it was chosen. Now, after more than 100 years, through the efforts of Ahepa, a Greek-American fraternal order, the city of Ypsilanti acquires a marble likeness of its patron, modeled in the stone of which the ancient Parthenon was built.</p>

   <p>The Ypsilantis were a family of Phanariot Greeks, who had long enjoyed protection and favor at the hands of the sultans of Stamboul. But when the first sparks of Hellenic revolt flared up the princes of the house of Ypsilanti were found on the side of struggling Hellas. Demetrios, born in 1793, son of Prince Constantine, distinguished himself as an officer in the Russian army in the campaign of 1814. In 1821, on the outbreak of the Greek war of Independence, he went to the Mores, and thereafter, for a period of nearly eight years, he played an increasingly important part in the conflict which ultimately was to free his country from Turkish bondage. He died in Vienna on January 3, 1832. Since that time the Ottoman empire has been utterly crushed and Greece has grown politically and territorially to proportions of which Demetrios never dreamed, though without the pioneer sacrifices of himself and other Greek patriots of a century ago the history of Hellas might not have taken so happy a turn.</p>
