M. in Thompson Hall, 75 Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>Dr. Apostolopoulos, who last Sunday delivered a Pan-Hellenic lecture at the meeting of the Greek community of Chicago in Hull House, will lecture this time on "The Affairs of Kynouria, " the native county of the members of the Society of St. George.</p>
