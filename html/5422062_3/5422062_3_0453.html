   <p>p. 8.--On Sunday, November 2, at 8:30 p. m. the newly-arrived theatrical troupe of Mrs. Pantopoulos will present to the Greek public of Chicago its first play at the Garrick Theater. This large and excellent theatrical company will initiate its series of plays in Chicago with the operetta "Innocent Suzanne," in three acts.</p>
   <p>At last the Greek colony of Chicago enjoys the privilege of seeing plays produced by a real Athenian theatrical troupe. It is the business of the Greek public to keep this troupe here throughout this coming winter, that we may have the pleasure in the long cold nights of being entertained by Athenian players.</p>
   <p>Let us broadcast this announcement, and let us fill the Garrick Theater for the opening play of Mr. Pantopoulos's troupe and admire her acting and that of the grand old gentleman, Mr. Theodore Pofantes! They will make us forget our troubles for the night.</p>
