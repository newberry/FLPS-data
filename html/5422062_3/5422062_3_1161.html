   <p>p. 2.- A new daily newspaper is about to be issued in Chicago. We bid it welcome. We are not among those people who are too selfish to let another man earn his bread at the same trade. If 1,000 papers are issued in Chicago, we still will welcome them.</p>
   <p>If this new paper is patriotic, Loxias will support it. We don't want it to act as the Periodic did. After Loxias wrote about it, supported it, and gave it the names of 30,000 possible subscribers, the Periodic turned right around and tried to take away our subscribers and advertizers. If the newspaper is patriotic, we will support it, if not, we'll break it.</p>
