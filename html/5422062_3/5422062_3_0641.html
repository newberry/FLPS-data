   <p>p. 5.- The Greek Olympic Athletic Club in conjunction with the Greek ladies society, St. Barbara, will give on November 24th a theatrical performance at the Eighth Street Theatre.</p>
   <p>The play is the well known tragedy "Esme, the Turkish Girl," and the players are members of the two respective clubs. Greek kilts and the colorful attire of the Voskopoula (Shepherd girl) will animate the performance.</p>
   <p>Behind all these are two important facts that are the burning desire of the two clubs. The Olympic club wants to raise money for a gymnasium. The ladies society wants money for a Greek orphanage. So it is not merely for entertainment or for financial gain for the players, but the purpose is of great importance to all of us, an orphanage for Greek children and a gymnasium for our blooming generation.</p>
   <p>The affair should be attended by all.</p>
