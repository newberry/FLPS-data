   <p>It is only a short time since Mrs. Maria Parisee had her triumphal success in Thorne Hall of Northwestern University. This Greek artist is esteemed and respected so much by the management of the university, that thanks to its noble efforts to encourage her, Thorne Hall is going to be used once more--the third time in succession--by Mrs. Parisee on Sunday, March 21, 1937.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Parisee will be assisted by her husband, a baritone. We are informed that most of their songs will be those of the most renowned Greekcomposers, songs which the artistic couple feel deeply in their souls, so they will be in so much the better position to render them with charm and feeling.</p>
