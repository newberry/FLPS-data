   <p>Our predictions about the presentation of the "Red Rock," in which the talented Penelope Haloulas took the leading part, proved to be accurate. The play was a tremendous success. Miss Haloulas and the capable amateurs who supported her must have worked very hard to achieve the artistry and technique which were evident throughout the entire play. The four hundred people who witnessed the performance were enthusiastic in their comments.</p>
   <p>Miss Haloulas is a graduate of the Dramatic Department of Mundelein College; and is beautiful and talented. The rest of the cast....are all talented young people, capable of instilling new spirit and life into the Greek-American theater.</p>
