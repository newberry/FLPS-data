   <p>The Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago sponsored a lecture by Doctor Spyros Soter. This lecture was presented last Sunday and was one of the best received talks of the series.....</p>
   <p>Dr. Soter spoke on "Surgeons and Surgery," a topic of great interest to the average dudience because so few laymen know anything about this fascinating subject.....</p>
   <p>Speaking in perfect Greek, Dr. Soter made it clear he had comprehensive knowledge of his subject.....Although the subject was a technical one, the speaker explained himself so capably that all of the hundred or more people in the audience clearly understood his explanations.</p>
