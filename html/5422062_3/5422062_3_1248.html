   <p>p. 1.- Four years ago, last Monday, appeared the first issue of the Greek Press and immediately captivated the hearts and souls of the Greek-Americans of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Having charted a new course in Greek journalism in America, it gained the respect and admiration of the Greek element to the extent that it now has become an institution, as indispensable to their lives as their churches and other organizations.</p>
   <p>The road that led up to this recognition has not been strewn with roses; it required days and nights of hard labor, an unbending faith, a dynamic will power and, above all, immeasurable capacity and ability to hold on to the reins and keep up with the race.</p>

   <p>As a result of these efforts and moral stamina the Greek Press has steadily and surely risen to higher levels---justified in pointing with pride to its past and hopefully visioning, a better and a fuller future.</p>
