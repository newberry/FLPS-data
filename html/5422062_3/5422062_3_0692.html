   <p>The Greek nation and the Greek race upon which hardship and misfortune have recently been visited have relied and now rely upon the generosity and the energy of foreign people.</p>
   <p>Their predilection for Greece and the effective aid which they have given to it are derived of the respect, the gratitude inspired in them by the achievements of ancient and Byzantine Greece, for the Greek generation of to-day under the conditions which surround it is a spectacle pathetic rather than inspiring.</p>
   <p>To-day the United States has become the criterion in all international questions and on its decision the solution of many problems depends. For example many eminent and wealthy persons have undertaken with great enthusiasm the task of reviving ancient Greek and Byzantine art throughout the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This is a great advertisement for Greek rights and the Greek name; Thanks to this revival the modern Greek generation finds a welcome in the hearts of all, and America stands as a shield to defend our national rights and pretensions.</p>
   <p>The Patrons of this movement as we shall see in the programs, are the wealthiest and most eminent people of this country.</p>
   <p>The Dionysia, the annual Athenian festival of Dionysus, will be presented on Monday, May 5, 1923, at 8 p.m. in the Chicago Auditorium. The chorus will execute genuine Greek dances. More than a hundred persons, Greeks and Americans, will perform on the stage, and the orchestra will play Greek music.</p>
   <p>Procure your tickets of the Drama League, fifth floor, 59 East Van Buren Street, of Mouzakiotes Brothers, or of the Central Trust Company, in the office of Mr. Paleologos. Only 1,600 seats are available for Greeks; the others will be disposed of among Americans and those of other nationalities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Prices of tickets are $5, $3, $2.50, $1, and 50Â¢. The scenery and the costumes will be elaborate and beautiful. That evening will mark the inception of a great artistic movement.</p>
