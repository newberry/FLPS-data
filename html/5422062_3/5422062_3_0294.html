   <p>P. 4 -- Permission has been granted to us by the president of the National University of Greece, the Honorable Neocleus Kazazis, to use his distinguished name in advertising our best cigar, which we have put on the market as the Kazazis cigar.</p>
   <p>Our name and our reputation as manufacturers of cigars in the last ten years have been extended over the country, and our new cigar is guaranteed to contain only pure Havana tobacco.</p>
   <p>Every Kazazis cigar is made throughout of selected tobacco, and the workmanship, which is our specialty, is the very best.</p>
   <p>We fill orders for every part of the United States and for all countries abroad.</p>
   <p>S. Georgiadis,</p>
