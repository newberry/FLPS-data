   <p>The ancient Greek modes, Dorian, Phrygian, Myxolydian, authentics plagals, are due to emerge from their confines in the text books and become definite items in music-making, when the Byzantine sextet steps out into its professional career this season. This is a Chicago organization founded and directed by Nick John Matsoukas and under the musical direction of Marion Booras.</p>
   <p>Spiros Stamos is the arranger. He has been in Greek music all his life, having danced before King George I of Greece. He is an authority on the transcription of the ancient Byzantine musical notations, and has deciphered much of the music that will appear on this program.</p>
   <p>He is also a featured soloist of the Sandura, an instrument similar to the lyre of Orpheus.</p>
