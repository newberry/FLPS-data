   <p>The greatest insight on the Greeks of America can be gained through the Greek press. The Greek press tells the exact truth about our countrymen, it pictures the good and the evil, the right and the wrong.</p>
   <p>Has the Greek press raised the position of the Greeks in America? No! Why not? Because the press readily points out and criticizes all the faults of the Greeks. No little mistake is overlooked. It is all right to be corrected once in a while but nobody likes to have his faults continually talked about. The associations and organizations especially are up in arms against the press. What little good work is accomplished by them is torn down by the ridicule directed against them by the Greek newspapers. Let us stop all this petty quarreling and praise the good of our neighbors and friends instead of criticizing so vehemently their efforts at what they think is right.</p>
