   <p>The Greek Women's University Club scored another success last Sunday when it offered a lecture by Mr. P. Kosta to the Greek community. His subject was "The Ethnology of the Modern Greek," and he handled it with the ease of one who really knows his subject.</p>
   <p>The lecture took place in Ida Noyes Hall at 3:30 P.M., and in spite of the terrific cold a large crowd attended.</p>
