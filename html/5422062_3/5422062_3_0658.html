   <p>The finest business, philosophic, and artistic elements to be found in Chicago were gathered in the aristocratic theater, the Aryan Grotto, last Sunday night. The feminine sex was represented by the ladies, Dedaki, Nicolatsea, Bakalou and others. The patriotic play, "All for the Father-land," brought tears to the eyes of the audience and handkerchiefs were much in evidence. Mr. Filipeas was excellent in his role of patriot.</p>
   <p>The liberal community of Chicago enthusiastically and capably increased the size of the treasury of the Liberal Society. Warmest congratulations are extended to the committee in charge of the program, especially to Messrs. Stavrou, Gallios, Sousanis, and Alexopulos.</p>
