   <p>"Give me a lever long enough and I can move the world," said the philosopher and engineer Archimedes. The Greek immigrant, who has come to America, says: "Give me an opportunity and I will become a successful businessman". This is unquestionably a true assertion. The Greeks have taken advantage of every opportunity offered them, and have become owners of fine and successful enterprises. One of the most successful of these enterprises is the confectionery business.</p>
   <p>A Greek confectionery store will be found wherever one goes in America. It is easily recognized by its white marble soda fountain and its immaculately clean interior. The Greek boys usually employed in such stores are pleasant and attractive in appearance. Their willing service attracts a great number of American customers.</p>
   <p>Every Greek should be proud of the progress made by these confectioners. They <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>not only keep their stores clean in appearance, but, what is more important, they also keep the moral atmosphere clean, and thus hold the respect and trust of the community. There have been very few instances where a crime or a misdemeanor has occurred in a Greek confectionery store. For this reason they are approved of and supported by the parents of young boys and girls.</p>
   <p>As an example of this support, we cite the following incident: The owners of drug stores in the city tried to have a law passed forcing the candy stores to close on Sundays, in order that they might have a monopoly on the Sunday trade. Immediately, the citizens of the community came to the defense of the candy stores. They felt that their children were in better surroundings in a Greek store than in a drug store where whiskey, cigarettes, and other harmful articles were sold.</p>
   <p>The Greek confectioners of America have proven themselves to be intelligent, industrious, courageous, and far-sighted businessmen. By their own industry and enterprise, they succeeded in opening thirty thousand stores in America, employing at least one hundred thousand people.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The confectionary business represents a large potential fortune to the Greeks of America who control it. Therefore, we consider it our duty to clarify certain problems, the solutions of which are pertinent to the realization of our dreams. The first step to strengthen the power of the Greek stores should be unification. In this country, especially, co-operation and unity are absolutely necessary to insure steady and safe progress. Of course, the Greek businessmen are to be commended for their success as individuals. Without any help other than their own ability, they are engaged in enterprises that bring honor and respect to the Greek name.</p>
   <p>In America, however, individualism in business is not beneficial. This is the land of the trust and the corporation, and even the simple partnership. By having organized itself, American business is in a position to dictate to the Greek merchants. Greek men are forced to buy their supplies from highly organized concerns that can charge very high prices, and in many ways exploit the small merchant. The strength of these large concerns is doubled because of the lack of unity among the small businessmen.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Therefore, it is necessary that the Greek merchants form companies or partnerships in order to protect themselves against exploitation. At present, they are losing business because the five-and-ten-cent stores are selling cheap candies and chocolates. If the Greeks were organized, they could conduct an advertising campaign and inform the public of the finer and healthier ingredients used in the making of Greek candy, in contrast to the impure, but cheap dime-store candy.</p>
   <p>If fifty Greek merchants were to form a buying syndicate, they would be able to purchase large quantities of supplies at much lower prices. Such a course would enable them to make more profits on their sales, and would also make them more influential than they are as single units. This subject has many aspects which we have discussed at length in previous articles; therefore, we will say no more about it. The point we wanted to make was the immediate need for co-operation among Greek confectioners.</p>
   <p>We frankly admit our bewilderment and surprise at the various types of advertising <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>material that Greek confectioners allow on their display windows. We are bewildered because in most instances the very things advertised in the windows are not even sold in the store. For instance, you will see large signs advertising Fan Fizz in a store that does not carry it. Elsewhere immense Coca Cola signs are hung over the door of a candy shop that has no soda fountain.</p>
   <p>Even stranger are the posters advertising the Fatima or Mecca cigarettes. These signs take up a great deal of valuable space in candy stores that do not sell any kind of tobacco. The United Cigar Stores sell their tobacco at cut-rate prices in order to keep the Greek candy stores from becoming formidable rivals. When the Greek stores devote space to advertise commodities sold by their rivals, they are helping them make profits; and at the same time, they are cluttering up their stores with posters and displays.</p>
   <p>We are very proud of the success of our Greek businessmen, and we are not afraid of giving them some needed advice, in order that they may be even more successful. Therefore, we ask that all advertising material be removed and forever banished <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>from the display windows of Greek candy stores.</p>
   <p>The windowpanes should gleam with cleanliness; instead of displays of Turkish cigarettes with half-nude figures on them, we suggest slogans or mottoes, such as "Homemade Candies". Tell the world that your candies are made in accordance with the requirements of the pure food laws.</p>
   <p>The suggestions we have made are excellent, and we hope they will be accepted as such.</p>
