   <p>For the first time in the history of any large American city, a group of men representing the Greeks of Chicago asked for, and were granted, an interview with the mayor of the city.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison is kindly disposed toward the Greek race. He was imbued with love for Greece by his father, who was a great traveler and who spent much time in our country. Accordingly, the Mayor kindly consented to give an audience to a committee of thirty Greeks from every walk of life.</p>
   <p>Among those present were: Mr. Christ Damascus, editor of the Saloniki; Mr. B. Georgakopoulos, president of the Holy Trinity Parish and a good friend of Mr. Harrison; Mr. C. Salopoulos, Dr. C. Kalliontzis, James Sellis, and G. Damascus. The remainder of the group was composed of the most active and most respected men of the Greek community. Mr. Georgakopoulos addressed the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Mayor, thanking him for having consented to hear their complaints; he also introduced to the Mayor the various Greek men of note who were present.</p>
   <p>Following this introductory speech, Mr. John Illiopoulos, who frequently writes in Saloniki, and who has a thorough knowledge of the English language, began to speak. He made reference to the insulting articles which had been appearing in the Chicago papers. He branded them as untrue and misleading, and appealed to the Mayor for their repudiation. He told the Mayor that the Greeks of Chicago do not intend to tolerate such aspersions and insults, and that they expect their Mayor to act justly in this matter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harrison listened to the eloquent plea of Mr. Illiopoulos, and gave his promise that the Greek name would be cleared of the mud which the papers have unjustly thrown upon it. He shook hands with all present and thanked them for calling upon him in behalf of such a worthy cause.</p>

   <p>Thus, the first step toward recognition has finally been taken. As usual, its leader was the editor of Saloniki, who leads most of the progressive movements of the Chicago Greeks. Now that we have the support of our Mayor we shall be able to force the newspapers to stop their unfair attacks upon us.</p>
   <p>However, Mr. Damascus did not stop there. He carried the fight right into the enemies' territory. The first place visited by the editor was the offices of the Day Book. This book had been publishing slanderous articles concerning the Greek restaurants of Chicago. It had hurt the business of fifteen hundred Greek restaurateurs of Chicago. Mr. Damascus went directly to the Day Book's publisher, Mr. Cochran, and denounced him for his biased and prejudiced attitude toward a respectable, hard-working group.</p>
   <p>The publisher finally admitted that it was unfair to judge fifteen hundred <span class="page-break">\4</span>business men by the negligence of three or four who were incompetent. He said that he personally ate in the "Astor Lunch", despite the fact that he lived in the La Salle Hotel where the restaurant is easily accessible. He also said that he knew that Greek restaurants are sanitary, and that they serve wholesome, appetizing meals.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cochran placed the blame for the articles on the Public Welfare Bureau. It seems that a few inferior eating houses were examined by the Bureau and found unclean; as a result, all Greek restaurants were attacked. He mentioned a few other reasons for this obvious antagonism, but since we are unable to verify the truth of these statements, we will not print them.</p>
   <p>The activities of Saloniki will not stop here. We shall continue to fight for recognition and respect in behalf of the three thousand Greek businessmen of Chicago. The American public must be made aware of the power of this group. They must be made to realize how much these business people contribute <span class="page-break">\5</span>to the growth and prosperity of this great city.</p>
   <p>This recognition can only be achieved through untiring and ceaseless efforts, such as this visit to the Mayor and the showdown with Mr. Cochran. We must follow the example set by other foreign groups who have known their group strength and have not hesitated to use it. Now they hold high positions, and control large fortunes. Although the Jewish people actually have no native country, they are well represented in the government and business life of every country they inhabit.</p>
   <p>Shall the Greeks--brilliant and energetic in the arts and the professions; hard and tireless workers in every type of business and labor; born politicians--refrain from entering these fields because they are aware of a social prejudice against them? Are they to stand aside and watch other national groups become powerful and wealthy? Of course not!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>This interview with the Mayor was a step forward in the right direction. Saloniki will continue until we achieve our goal.</p>
