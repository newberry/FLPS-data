   <p>p. 1. "Representing the United Greek Press of Chicago, I wish to express my sincere and deep esteem for Hon. Henry Morgenthau and convey to him the cordial greetings of the Greek newspapers and publications.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morgenthau is an eminent citizen of this great Republic, and an honorary citizen of the wreath-wearing Athens, as well as a great philanthropist, who has gained the esteem and gratitude of all Greeks. In defending the rights of the Greek race, before the League of Nations, he succeeded in saving the lives of 1,500,000 refugees, and achieved a Herculian victory.</p>
   <p>In collaboration with the Greek government, and the great and noble American Philanthropic Society for Relief of Christians in the Near East, which was organized on American method and system, was able to overcome epidemics, give first aid to the refugees, and prepare them to become a great production power in Greece.</p>
   
   <p>Of all the allied armies, the Greek army was the first one to break the invincible German lines on the eastern front, in the glorious battle of Sera, and wear the wreath of victory. The battle of Sera, which distroyed the German morale, and very much contributed to German defeat on the western front, could be called comparable to the Battle of Thermopolas. On the other hand, the former Prime Minister of France, Mr. Briand, paid his gratitude to Greece with the treacherous treaty of Angora, by supplying the barbarous Turk with guns and ammunition for the destruction of the Greeks, who for thousands of centuries had been the natives of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>That secret treaty of France with Turkey will stand as an historical event of utter treason against her friend, Greece, who fought and shed her blood for the salvation of France.</p>
   <p>Old Turks, young Turks, and modern Turks, never have altered their savage nature. The leopard may change its coat but never its nature.</p>
   <p>Three million Greeks and Armenians were savagely slaughtered in Asia Minor when Greece was betrayed and the ancient Greek city of Smyrna became the prey of the barbarians, who were secretly assisted by double crossing friends of Greece, who openly favored the Turks.</p>
   <p>The allied armada, at the quay of Smyrna, apathetically observed the great conflagration and stupendous man-slaughter. Officers and sailors of some of the men-of-war rejoiced at the aspect of Dante's Inferno, by taking pictures of the calamity, or dancing the dance of the cannibal, celebrating the slaughter of the decendants of Homer, Herodotus, Hesiod, Aspasia, and many other poets and philosophers who, born in Asia Minor, scintillated on the poetical horizon of Greece.</p>
   <p>On the seaboard of Asia Minor were hundreds of thousands of refugees, in a miserable condition and hopeless, seeking salvation from the united naval armada of the allied fleet, but their supplications fell upon deaf ears.</p>
   <p>When every spark of hope was gone, and no human hand of civilization and Christianity was extended to save them, those hundreds of thousands of Christian refugees, in despair, retired to their fate, waiting their turn to be butchered or burned alive.</p>
   
   <p>Then the heavenly firmament revealed to the hopeless and despairing refugees that the flag of mercy, civilization and Christianity flying in the air above all flags, was coming to save them from destruction. The forty-eight stars of the American flag, whose brilliancy overshadowed the brilliancy of the sun, was the flag that scintillated on the horizon of the catastrophe. These hundreds of thousands of human beings knelt down and, from the depths of their hearts, thanked God for this angel of mercy. This angel of mercy, the stars and stripes of America, saved the refugees and transported them to Greek islands, and other parts of Greece. When this divine deed was done, the Greek population and the 1,500,000 Greek and Armenian refugees in unison, prayed to God for the glorification of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>This Herculian and noble deed of the Hon. Henry Morgenthau will be written in Greek history with golden letters. The United States and Mr. Morgenthau gained the everlasting gratitude of the Greek race."</p>
