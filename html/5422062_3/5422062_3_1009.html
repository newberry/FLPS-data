   <p>Again behold Proodos, which visits you after six months discontinuance, now in tabloid size, and read the statement that it will continue as a monthly periodical, for reasons very well understood, with the same program and same policy as in the past and with magnificent plans and dreams for the future.</p>
   <p>The demands for reports on our social, political, religious, and other affairs will not be neglected by Proodos, and if the wishes expressed by the public, the effort of Mr. Const. Psalidas, and the felicitations of Messrs. Geo. Kyriakopoulos and Const. Mammon are of any moment, which we do not doubt, this writer's expectation of maintaining uninterrupted the publication of the paper will be realized.</p>
   <p>The temporary discontinuance of Proodos has been another of the writer's sad experiences and another incident in the adventurous career of his journal. Unfavorable conditions were the cause of it, and we hope that better times will again permit the weekly issue of Proodos or even the daily issue of which we dream.</p>
