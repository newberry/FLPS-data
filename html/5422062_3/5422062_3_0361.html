   <p>After many months of touring eastern cities, Basil Gretchis, distinguished violinist, returned to Chicago, his home town.</p>
   <p>Last year the youthful artist was engaged as Concert master and assistant Conductor for the musical production, Countess Maritza, composed by Calman, and conducted by the famous maestro, Pier de Reader.</p>
   <p>His musical talent as a Soloist, is considered to equal those who, from time to time, have appeared in musical productions of Vienna's Academy.</p>
   <p>Due to his excellent mastership, the Contess Maritza Company engaged him to conduct one of its plays which will be presented during the winter period.</p>
   <p>During the summer months, Mr. Gretchis will continue as a Professor of music at De Paul University.</p>
