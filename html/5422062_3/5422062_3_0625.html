   <p>p. 5 Last Sundays' performance at the Civic Theatre was a great success. "Maria Doxapatri" was performed by the students of Plato School who acted like regular troupers. They were all enthusiastically applauded for their superb acting. After the play, girl students of the school danced Greek. P. Bournas played the mandolin. Misses Haloulou and Kattenis recited a duet. Miss Filiotis sang. George Kambas played a violin solo. His orchestra played several selections. Lastly A. Becharas sang "Gero Dimo".</p>
   <p>We were proud to see the Greek Youth take such interest in the plays and songs of our mother country. Congratulations to all of them!</p>
