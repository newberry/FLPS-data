   <p>In the Art Institute, standing in a half restful position, with the right foot firm on the ground and the left leg slightly bent at the knee, is the statue of Diana of Gabii. The original was found in Gabii in 1792 and is attributed to that master of sculpture, Praxiteles.</p>
   <p>Her attire consists of a pair of sandals, a chlamys or chiton, and a ribbon encircling her hair which is curly and neatly arranged. Her right arm is bent at her elbow towards her shoulder where she holds the back part of her chlamys.</p>
   <p>The other arm is bent in about a sixty degree angle in front of her body where she holds the front of her chiton. The face depicts sweetness, calmness, and geniality.</p>
   <p>As we gaze upon the beautiful statue of Diana, we are carried back a few thousand years into a realm of fantasy.</p>

   <p>The Greek world of mythology and history. The age of Homer, the age of Pericles, Socrates, and Plato are some of the stops we make on our journey. Here we see Athens, Sparta and Thebes struggling for supremacy; we see Socrates calmly teaching his philosophy to his disciples; and we witness the beauty and splendor of the ancient world in our visit to Athens during the reign of Pericles. Here we see the Goddess Diana, or Artemis as the Greeks called her, reigning on earth and subduing the wild beast with her arrows; On heaven, where she is worshipped as Lunaor Selena, she enlightens the all with her rays; and in Tartarus, where she is known as Hecate, she keeps all ghosts and other evil spirits under subjection.</p>
   <p>She is the heroine of "Endymion," that beautiful story of love and passion which inspired so many poets. Diana seeing the handsome shepherd Endymion on a mountain, fell in love with him. But as no union as marriage could be consummated, she being a goddess and he a mortal, she put him into eternal sleep on the mountain where she could always have him before her and pet his curly locks with her golden rays.</p>

   <p>This story and many others were instrumental in augmenting the imagination and intensifying the sense of the beautiful in the ancient Hellenes; and the inagination and sense of the beautiful were the guiding spirits were led the Greeks to become leaders of civilization. Art, in those days was studied for its sake and not for material gain. The Parthenon, The Theseon, and the Stadium, majestically imposing, beautiful and serene, were the results of the soul's expression - a soul of artistic temperament. What a difference to-day!</p>
   <p>Not only was love of beauty an integral part of a man but also love of country was interred within every citizen's bones.</p>
   <p>When the city, State called him to arms he immediately and willingly responded.</p>
   <p>To him the sovereignty of his city, States was supreme. These were no attempts at evasion of duty.</p>
   <p>Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans chose to fight a glorious defeat than to retreat and save themselves.</p>

   <p>That was bravery! That was self-sacrifice! What a difference to-day!</p>
   <p>There were no crazy jazz tunes then. Nor were there any "Charlestons," "Black-Bottoms", or any other brain stupefying dances. The rythmic tunes and marvelous classic dances were of ethereal beauty.</p>
   <p>Dance and thought harmoniously blended into a combination of unexcelled strangeness, fascination, and beauty.</p>
   <p>This and other thoughts flicker in our minds; and our imagination is transported from city to city of ancient Hellas in our mythological journey as we stand before the statue of Diana of Gabii.</p>
