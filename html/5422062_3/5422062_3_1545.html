   <p>p. 2- Having arranged a dance and athletic exhibitions for Sunday evening, June 7, in the New Masonic Temple, 32 West Randolph Street, the Greek Olympian Athletic Club of Chicago begs the executive councils of the various communities and other organizations to take this into consideration so as not to arrange their affairs for the same day. This is the only way to insure success for the affair of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club, which has been working for the benefit of Greeks for the last twenty-five years.</p>
