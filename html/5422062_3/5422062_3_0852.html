   <p>A very enjoyous and pleasant picnic was given at Grand View Gardens by the Brotherhood of Falanthos. In this small but beautiful park had gathered all the members of this organization with their friends.</p>
   <p>The Falanthian country, whose lands are closed in by fir-trees, is characterized by the manliness, hospitality, and courage of its people.</p>
   <p>Among the many parties in progress was that of Mr. K. Augerinos and family who were entertaining the George Chiagouris family, Mrs. Helen P. Papa-giannopoulos and children, sister of Mrs. Augerinos visiting from Detroit, Dr. Michael, Paul Javaras and his sister Paraskevoula.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the president, D. Parry, and the other members for this splendid event.</p>
