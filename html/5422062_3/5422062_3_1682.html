   <p>p. 3.- Ionian Hall of the Masonic Temple, Logan Square, was transformed into a vivid panorama, last Thursday, June 18th, by a throng of Greek ladies who gathered there for afternoon tea, given by the Tripolis Society in honor of Mrs. Helen Giannopoulos, President of the Society Tripolis, whose indefatigable activities of the passing year put the philanthropic Society in the first rank.</p>
   <p>During the tea, various musical selections were played by a bevy of young Greek girls. Miss Georgia Bouloukos, who recently arrived from Tripolis, Greece, played the first selections on the piano. The sympathetic Miss Chambilomates played the Greek and American anthems. Then beauty after beauty alternately displayed not only musical talent but charm as well.</p>
   <p>Mrs. L. Maliris, Chairman, in her soft and pleasant voice, thanked the Presidents of all the Societies, who had honored the event, as well as the rest of the ladies and girls who had attended.</p>
