   <p>Mr. G. Barbaretos, in an article published in the Ethnos, (Newspaper of Athens, Greece), in regards to Golf played in Greece, refers to golf as being a Game of Greek origin.</p>
   <p>Many countries dispute the issue as to the place of origination of golf. The French claim it is of French origin; the Italians that it is of Italian origin; the Hollanders maintain that the very name of the game originates from the Dutch word Kolf meaning cane, rod, and the game is played with rods.</p>
   <p>The Englishmen consider it of Scotch origin. They say that golf was played in Blaketh for three hundred years and was the favorite game of Jacob VI of Scotland. On account of this in the 15th century the playing of the game had been prohibited by a royal decree.</p>
   <p>Frenchmen claim that the game has its origin in the game Kulp (Koulp) that was played during the 14th century. The Italians go as far back as the time of Christ to prove that the game is theirs. From a 3rd century fresco in Verona the Italians attempt to prove that golf is an Italian game.</p>

   <p>In this race to claim the origin of golf, Greece only did not participate. But Greece, the country that claims Napoleon the Great, George of England and Batista of Cuba did not let the claim as to the origin of golf go to any of the other nations. A few years ago, excavations took place, in Greece, and a beautiful Bass-relief was found by which two ancient Greeks are depicted playing golf.</p>
   <p>Golf, therefore, is not English, Italian, Hollanders, or French in origin, but Greek, very Greek.</p>
