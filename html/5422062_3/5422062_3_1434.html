   <p>As was announced in the Greek Press, Mr. George Mylonas spoke at the Sherman Hotel last Friday. The Professional Men's Club is to be congratulated on the select speakers it presents to us from time to time.</p>
   <p>The most brilliant and extraordinary speaker was presented last Friday night. Mr. Mylonas, whom we have come to look upon as our own, was introduced by our well-known dentist, Evangelos Despotes. After a few words about the lecturer's career, Mr. Despotes states, on behalf of the Professional Men's Club, that they were honored to have Mr. Mylonas as a guest speaker.</p>
   <p>Prof. Mylonas speech was, as usual, uncomparable. It showed that he was well acquainted with his theme, yet he didn't bore us with technicalities of speech.</p>
   <p>After the lecture everyone had a chance to congratulate Mr. Mylonas and to wish him a pleasant journey as he is leaving us at the end of this month.</p>
