   <p>p. 5. The first number of the monthly publication of the Greek professionals of America is published. The periodical is titled with the pseudonym, Parnasos.</p>
   <p>The themes of the Parnasos will be very beneficial, practical, and comprehensive to all. Dr. Polyvios Koryllos, chairman of the publishing committee of Parnasos makes an appeal, which we publish verbatim.</p>
   <p>To the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>The Greek professionals of America, through the Federation of the Societies of Greek Professionals, send to you all brotherly greetings via the publication Parnasos.</p>
   <p>The publication of our periodical, Parnasos, is the fulfillment of a deep desire, of our Greek Professionals.</p>
   <p>The honor and credit of the achievement is not ours, but belongs to our predecessors, and especially to the gigantic progressiveness of the Greek population of America in recent years.</p>
   <p>The necessity of a periodical, even though it is published monthly and edited by Greeks of America, for Greeks of America, is today imperative as an instrument of communication. It is a periodical that will be utilized for the education and elevation of the Greeks of America, a periodical that will be devoted to subjects concerning the vital organism of Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>The Greek element of America is not any more in its infancy, but is matured and robust. It is not any more the unorganized mob of manual laborers, who had no thought of their own and who followed the thoughts and minds of those in the old country which latter are usually divided by political frictions.</p>
   <p>Today we form one great big family in our adopted country, which functions independently in finance, intellectual growth, and in strong organizations, without being directed and guided by the Old Country. Nevertheless, we love and will always go the assistance of our former mother country.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of the Old Country do not thoroughly know the Greeks of America.</p>
   
   <p>They have just a slight conception of our sociological, financial, and intellectual development, and no conception at all of the radical change of our new generation born in this country. They do not consider at all, that the new generation has begun to develop and to create an entirely new Greek race. A new race, that keeps intact the basic foundations of the old race, eliminating many defeciencies, and adding merits of the American race, in whose midst this generation is brought up; merits that are entirely new to the old race of Greece.</p>
   <p>The Greek of America--and I'm writing this for the guidance of those fellow Greeks in the Old Country--has developed a knowledge of his rights and of his duty towards society and his nation. He has learned to respect the individual and personal merits of each of his fellow men, without being influenced emotionally by the awe of the person's aristocratic name. He has learned to esteem industriousness and work, without being bothered with patricians and plebians. He has learned, self reliance, cooperation, and above all, to think and decide for himself.</p>
   <p>These are the main characteristics of the new Greek race, which day by day develops power and vitality and tends to create a future which we cannot as yet forecast.</p>
