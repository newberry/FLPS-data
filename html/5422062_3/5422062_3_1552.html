   <p>p. 1.- Next Thursday night, April 16th, Chapter No. 46 of Ahepa will present to the public in the State and Lake building an exhibition of wrestling and boxing followed by music. This affair has been arranged by the Greek Olympic Athletic Club under the sponsorship of the 46th chapter of Ahepa.</p>
   <p>If we take into consideration the enthusiasm and great interest of the public shown in the first affair of this sort, some weeks ago, in the same place, it is predicted that the attendance will be very large next Thursday.</p>
   <p>The boys of our Athletic Club will exhibit their progress made in athletics, and should be honored by the presence of many fellow nationals.</p>
