   <p>The concert of the Hellenic Mandolin Orchestra of Mr. [Panaq] Vournas last Sunday was one of the high lights of the year's Greek events. In fact it was conspicuous among the presentations we have witnessed.</p>
   <p>The three hundred select music-loving people who gathered to hear this prize-winning group passed a delightful musical evening. It is true that this mandolin orchestra has reached a lofty pinnacle of attainment; and this, of course, is due to the ability, skill, and artistry of Mr. Vournas. Each player is an artist in his own right and, therefore, deserves a share of the praise.</p>
   <p>The interest of the audience was kept at zenith for over an hour and a half by the spellbinding music. Our ardent support of this group was amply justified by their performance. The audience was enthusiastic and applauded Mr. Vournas and the others wildly.</p>
