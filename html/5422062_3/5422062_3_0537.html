   <p>p. 5.- The Greek Mandolinist of Chicago, headed by P. Bournas, gave a concert last Tuesday, in honor of S. Bekatoros. The program was beautifully arranged, but we missed our well known Greek songs. Mr. Bournas introduced the maestro, S. Bekatoros.</p>
   <p>He was enthusiastically applauded. A volley of applause followed each selection that he conducted. How else could the audience show its great appreciation?</p>
   <p>Mr. Bournas brought the house down when he played a solo. Shouts of "encore" could be heard everywhere.</p>
   <p>Everyone hastened to meet and congratulate the players after the performance. This showed that the finer arts are appreciated by Chicagoans. We should have more of them.</p>
