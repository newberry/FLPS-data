   <p>p.-2-.........St. George's School wishes to inform the Greek public of Chicago and suburbs that it will exhibit the picture "Holy Places" on the cinematographic screen to-morrow at 8 P.M., that is, on Sunday, March 20. The production of this film was made possible by the generosity of a Greek, Mr. Zaharios Lantzourakis, and by the eminent skill of an Italian cameraman, Mr. David Coronil. The expense of travel and equipment was defrayed by Mr. Lantzourakis, and the technical experience required to produce the picture was supplied by Mr. Coromil.</p>
   <p>All the places sanctified by the presence of our Savior Jesus Christ will be shown in this film: Bethlehem, where He was born, and the very spot, the Cave of His Nativity; Nazareth, where He passed the obscure years of His childhood; the river Jordan; the tomb of the Virgin Mary; Golgotha; and the Holy Sepulcher. Following the example set by our Saviour in washing the feet of His disciples, the aged patriarch, Father Damianos, will be seen washing the feet of twelve priests. The ceremony of the Resurrection will also be shown. In short, all those places in which Jesus spent His life will be shown, including those in which He expounded the great truths recorded in the Bible and that in which He spilled His blood for man's salvation.</p>
   <p>It is our duty as Greeks into whose hands our Savior has intrusted His Holy Sepulcher to see these places - even if they are only pictures on the cinematographic <span class="page-break">2</span>screen - so as to transport ourselves spiritually to these hallowed scenes.</p>
   <p>Admission is one dollar, and tickets are available at the office of St. George's School, 2701 Sheffield Avenue.</p>
