   <p>The purpose of the Spartan Philanthropic Brotherhood to be organized in Chicago, is to weld together all those in the United States and Canada from Lacedaemon and Epidavros-Lymeras, in order to inspire the membership with the spirit of solidarity, to support needy members, to develop good will toward our American fellow-citizens, and also to insure members of the Brotherhood against lack of burial expenses and to give any financial aid which they may require, without contract or obligation, of course, on the part of the Brotherhood, which will help only insofar as the finances of the organization permit, and the decisions of the Executive Council allow.</p>
