   <p>When uneducated, unprincipled, and unscrupulous people, ready to do anything for money, become publishers, we must expect that nothing good, useful, or beneficial to society will emanate from their publications. The scrap-paper Saloniki of Chicago is a unit of the yellow press, possessing all the above named attributes, and the publisher directing that yellow sheet is Christ Damaskos, an illiterate man with no other means of expression than the bray of the jackass, ready to be sold for a plate of lentils. It is a pity that a person of his type should be endowed with a Greek name.</p>
   <p>Four months ago this paper Saloniki pocketed $50 for an advertisement given out by the German propaganda of New York which endeavored to persuade the United States to cease to send ammunition to Europe and Greece. Had this been successful, Greece automatically would have been left without ammunition and at the mercy of her enemies within and without. Saloniki played the role of pacifist, declaring that no country could slaughter people without ammunition. Hypocrites, shame on you! Did you care for humanity <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>or for the $50 advertisement?</p>
   <p>Now this scrap-and-trash Saloniki again comes to the fore, this time wearing a new garment, the garment of patriotism, and criticizes the Greeks of America for not showing enthusiasm for the recruiting order of King Constantine, who wants to throw Greece over to the side of his brother-in-law the Kaiser, contrary to the will of the people. Saloniki says that a hundred thousand American Greeks should respond to the call of the king and fight against the Allies.</p>
   <p>This yellow sheet is either screw-loose, or, as we said above, ready to do anything for money.</p>
   <p>Common sense will show any one that this paper wants to blow hot and cold at the same time. It cannot be done. Four months ago Saloniki advocated pacifism and urged (for a $50 advertisement) the United States to stop <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>sending ammunition to Greece so that Greece might not be able to slaughter Turks and Bulgars, and now it complains that these hundred thousand American Greeks who are of service age did not show enough patriotism in response to the call of Constantine to go to Greece and fight on the side of the Turks and the Bulgars against the Allies.</p>
   <p>How could these hundred thousand Greeks be equipped for war if shipment of ammunition to Greece had been stopped by your ($50-in-pocket) advocacy of the German propaganda?</p>
   <p>Shame on you, jackass! The public possesses intelligence enough not to be deceived by your thoroughly yellow policy. Iscariot, the public knows you by this time!</p>
