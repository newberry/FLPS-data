   <p>As was announced in the Greek Press, Mr. Spiridon Dimitrios, representative of the Athenian organization--Panagios Tafos, last Friday presented moving pictures of the Holy Land at the Waverley Theater.</p>
   <p>All Halsted Street was present. In a driving rain about 1,000 good Christians came to see the religious scenes everybody has heard so much about. Famous religious paintings were shown as well as the Holy Land. Everyone was more than satisfied and we are trying to get Mr. Dimitrios to show it in other parts of the city so more good Orthodox Christians will get to see this movie.</p>
