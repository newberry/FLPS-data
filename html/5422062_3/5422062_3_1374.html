   <p>p. 5.- The Sons of Pericles were exceptionally honored by the presence of the Most Rev. Athenagoras, Archbishop of North and South America, who, upon the invocation of the Ahepa Chapter 94, consented to deliver the announced lecture at Govan Hall.</p>
   <p>The profundity of the prelate's speech cannot be overestimated. The liberal-minded Hierarch of the Greek church said, "The day has entirely passed when religion, science and philosophy can be regarded by any well-informed persons, as three distinct branches of human interest, because we now know that they are so completely inter-related that one can hardly be considered rationally without implicating the others.</p>
   <p>"Religion may properly be regarded as primarily ethical, as its object is to elevate the moral nature and conserve morality; but science in the persons of its most distinguished exponents is seeking the same results, while philosophy is, properly speaking, the meeting place of love with wisdom.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"Religion is properly a force, a force that unifies, a force that holds together the moral interest of society and reunites those who for any cause become estranged or separated.</p>
   <p>"Science only means knowledge, exact knowledge, we can say, therefore, many sciences are frequently enumerated including theology and anthropology.</p>
   <p>"As for philosophy, when Plato declared in his famous 'Republic,' that in an ideal civic state philosophers would be the only rulers, his statement becomes thoroughly acceptable to the most enlightened modern ears and, directly, philosophy is regarded as balance as equilibrium. Life on this planet is entwined with religion, science and philosophy. If we can free our mind from bias, from self-deception and self-hypnotism, undoubtedly we will then be able to appreciate the progressive work done by religion, science and philosophy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The laws of nature, established by the omnipotent intelligence of the Creator, which science endeavors to unravel, could never contradict or confute the existence of God.</p>
   <p>"The biased mind of a scientist or a devotee of religion could never make any progress in enlightenment, because each side has made up its mind to uphold and maintain its own grounds at all risks, and therefore each seeks to square facts with preconcerted theories rather than construct new ones, if need be, to coincide with newly discovered facts."</p>
   <p>The prelate, in closing his lecture, repeated to the Greek-American boys that the biggest fortification and equipment for their life's career is an unshakable faith in God, in Orthodoxy, and the Greek traditions as to the forming of Greek character.</p>
   <p>Aside from the "Sons of Pericles," the audience which came to hear the Archbishop was fascinated by the speech of the Hierophant of Greek Orthodoxy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Indeed the Greeks of America must be envied for having such a learned prelate among them.</p>
