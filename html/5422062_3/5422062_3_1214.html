   <p>P. 3 - That the Chicago Greek Star is read all over the United States is evident from its great circulation, but that it should reach the Greek capital, which has an abundance of journalistic talent, and should draw commentaries from two of the foremost Athenian dailies, was unexpected.</p>
   <p>The editorial articles of this newspaper have been extensively commented on by the Nation and the Eastern Mail, two of the best dailies of Athens.</p>
   <p>Both these sister-papers have published colorful comments on the patriotic, educational, and pro-American articles of the Chicago Greek Star.</p>
   <p>This unexpected attention of the press of the Greek capital to this Greek publication of Chicago is a sign of acknowledgment that the Greeks of Chicago and throughout the United States are not to be lightly considered nor underestimated as to their hidden potentialities.</p>
   <p>The Star warmly appreciates the comments of the Athenian newspapers and is glad to know of their interest in the Greeks of America.</p>
