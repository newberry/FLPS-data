   <p>p. 5.- Yesterday evening, at the Sherman Hotel, Mrs. Ifi Tanagra Kopadis gave a lecture on "Feminism". Because of the great heat, many did not come to the lecture. By doing so, they missed a very pleasant and enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Katzios introduced Mrs. Kopadis, praising her for her wonderful talent. From the moment she began speaking till an hour and a half later when she ended, she held the attention of the entire audience. The tremendous applause she received showed the enthusiasm of the crowd.</p>
