   <p>p. 5.. Last Monday at 9:55 p. m., Mr. Theodoros Pallamidis or Fallas, who is well known and very highly esteemed as the scion of an eminent Greek family, a highly educated, vivacious, and very progressive compatriot of ours, left the gates of our windy city of Chicago for Los Angeles, California, on a Santa Fe express train.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pallamidis in the many years of his residence here has worked in two of our city's largest banks and has demonstrated not only his native ability, but also his individual interest in our Greek colony, for which he deserves the commendation of us all.</p>
   <p>Because of his romantic personality and his close contact with Mr. Merrick, formerly president of the bank for which Mr. Pallamidis worked, he is leaving us to establish himself in Los Angeles, where he will deal in real estate or engage in some similar business.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greek colony wished Mr. Pallas a hearty farewell, and many of his friends presented themselves at the station. Mr. Constantions <span class="page-break">2</span>Paleologos on behalf of all these pronounced a fatherly prayer, wishing for our compatriot the same honor and esteem in Los Angeles which he has enjoyed in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Saloniki also adds its good wishes to those expressed by Mr. Pallas' other friends.</p>
