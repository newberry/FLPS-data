   <p>A lecture with a background of interpretative music was given by Mr. Angelo Desfis, under the auspices of the Greek Mens' Professional Club. It was enjoyed by over a hundred people last Sunday in one of the halls of the Sherman Hotel. The audience paid strict attention to the entire lecture and the interpretative musical selections sung by Mr. Desfis himself.</p>
   <p>First he made a brief analysis of the compositions, which were demotic in nature, and then he followed his singing with a short resume of their historical background.</p>
   <p>He was introduced by Dr. A. Despotes.</p>
