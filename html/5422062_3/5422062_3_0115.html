   <p>Mr. Themis Haliotis and Mr. D. Arahovitis opened a new and up-to-date printing establishment last week.</p>
   <p>It is located at 775 South Polk Street, and is called the "Odyssia".</p>
   <p>The owners have installed the finest equipment and are able to take care of all the printing requirements of the community. These two men are highly respected and well known; therefore, it is unnecessary for us to recommend them to the community.</p>
   <p>We congratulate them and wish them every success in their new location.</p>
