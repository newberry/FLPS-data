   <p>Prophecy of a restoration of ancient Greek boundaries, made by Clarence Darrow, started applause in the Blackstone Theater last night which marked a five minute climax to a gigantic Greek demonstration in honor of the first anniversary of the entry of Greece into the war.</p>
   <p>Twenty thousand Americans of Greek descent had marched through the loop. They had waited until only the 2,560 who could find seats within had obtained entry to the theater, not to hear the program, but to be seen in the crowds as those who gave 100 per cent loyalty to their new home, America.</p>
   <p>The meeting was unusual throughout. No audience in Chicago ever before saw Samuel Insull, dominating factor in the electrical industry in the Middle West, lead a crowd in singing "The Star Spangled Banner."</p>

   <p>No group of spectators ever before saw him and Mr. Darrow applauding each other's speeches from the same platform. No other group ever beheld Miss Thetis Zetas, daughter of the Grecian consul in Chicago and a noted beauty, leading a native-garbed chorus of school children singing the Greek national anthem.</p>
   <p>The demonstration was organized by the Greek committee of the foreign language section of the State Council of Defense.</p>
   <p>Governor Lowden sent a stirring message when he could not come. Addresses were made by Felix J. Streyckmans, Consul S. Pezas, the Rev. C.H. Demetry, and Alderman Bernard W. Snow. Resolutions were adopted to be sent to the President, and Premier Venizelos of Greece, pledging the last flood of the descendants of those who fought at Thermopylae and Marathon to the democracy now fought for by the first republic in the world-America.</p>
   <p>They also urged Greeks to join the American army, whether in the draft or not.</p>
