   <p>The Chicago Greek Olympic Athletic Club, publicly declares, for the good name of the Club and all concerned that the two Greek boys who were killed recently were not members of this club.</p>
   <p>We are compelled to make this declaration due to the fact that rumors were spread right and left that the two boys killed were charter members of the club. The morality and dignity of the members of the club is beyond reproach. The by-laws of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club specifically state that any member of reprehensive conduct should immediately be expelled.</p>
   <p>Those who deliberately or otherwise spread these rumors are warned to be careful.</p>
   <p>Greek Olympic Athletic Club of Chicago.</p>
