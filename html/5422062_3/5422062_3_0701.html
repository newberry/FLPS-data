   <p>A contemporary model of Helen of Troy--that beauteous gal of ancient Greek legend, who possessed the "face that launched a thousand ships," will be chosen tonight when members of the national Greek organization, Ahepa, gather at the Aragon ballroom. Womanly characteristics......the poise, grace and intelligence that the original Helen possessed, rather than sheer beauty, will be considered by the judges as they select the "princess" and her two attendants, "Miss Helen of Sparta" and "Miss Penelope".</p>
   <p>Ten thousand Ahepans, led by the national finalists in the "Helen of Troy" contest, gathered in the loop for the grand parade this afternoon.</p>
   <p>The second convention session of the Order of Ahepa, yesterday elected Constantine Chagrados, Detroit attorney, as the new convention chairman for 1937.</p>
