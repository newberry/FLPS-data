   <p>As we had previously announced in the Greek Press, George Mylonas gave a lecture last Thursday. The lecture took place at the lodge hall of the Ahepan Chapter No. 46, which was overfilled with people. Among those present were the University of Chicago students in Prof. Buck's New Greek classes.</p>
   <p>The president of the chapter, Mr. George Porikes, opened the meeting and introduced the head of the Educational committee, D. Parry, lawyer. Mr. Parry introduced one of Prof. Buck's students, J. M. Rife, who spoke a few words and in faultless Greek. He was followed by Prof. Buch who is well-known and a good friend among the Greek people. He told us of his first trip to Greece in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> as well as one of his following trips. On his first trip he toured Greece on a mule while his latest trip was accomplished by automobile. Prof. Buck then presented Mr. George E. Mylonas.</p>
   <p>Near the small stage had been placed as enormous map of Greece. All the seats were filled and many people were standing. All those who did not know Mr. Mylonas, were curious to see what the professor looked like.</p>
   
   <p>His youthful appearance did not promise much speaking ability, but after the first few words, everyone set up in amazement. Their ears, unaccustomed to the fresh Greek language, welcomed his words with delight.</p>
   <p>For ten minutes he spoke on the Greece of today. In ten minutes he covered ten years. He presented us a picture of past-war Greece, her successes and failures, her glories and misfortunes. He put these together and gave us our country, not a far off, forgotten thing, but a living, thriving native land which became etched in our hearts.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm with which Mr. Mylonas spoke made us wonder if a mistake hadn't been made somewhere. Wasn't he to speak on archeological finds? We were anxious to hear him continue in this vein of Modern Greece but we didn't know what was in store for us.</p>
   <p>The lights were turned off. On the screen was shown a city of the classical era.</p>
   
   <p>"I will take you, now," the speaker said, "to an era already past, but which is recovered for us by the spade. We are going to Ancient Greece, which Pavsanias described in his ten volumes."</p>
   <p>He started at Athens, took us to Akrokorinthom, to the Mykinas, to Nemean, where there are good wines and where the train is always late in leaving because nobody gets enough.</p>
   <p>We went to Epidauron, to Sparta, to Messinia, ending at Olympia. The trip ended there. It took the audience a few minutes to realize it was back to Chicago after being taken to the top of Parnassus--in a little over an hour we had traveled through Greece and had come back again.</p>
