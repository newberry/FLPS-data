   <p>Saturday, March 9, at Kimball Hall, a violin recital was given by Miss Helen Kanellos, under the auspices of the Greek Women's University Club of Chicago. Despite her youth, Miss Kanellos has reached enviable heights in the artistic world. She has been the soloist with the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra and with the Sioux City Symphony. During the last three years she has been first violinist and concertmaster of the Cleveland Institute of Music.</p>
   <p>Her program, in addition to selections from well-known classics, included new works by Greek composers.....The program was well balanced. This young artist's execution is amazingly eloquent.....</p>
   <p>The sponsors of this affair are worthy of praise in that they provided so worth-while an entertainment. The Greek community of Chicago has never before seen a Greek girl play a violin with such superb artistry.</p>
