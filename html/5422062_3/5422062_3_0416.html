   <p>p. 5.- We would like to remind the Greek public that "Zombie" is still playing at the Adelphi Theater. The reason we are interested in this theatrical is because of George Rigas, who is the only Greek playing in a popular American show. All Greeks should avail themselves of the opportunity to see this promising young man. There may not be another chance.</p>
