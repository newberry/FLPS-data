   <p>The Crystal Ballroom of the Sherman Hotel was filled to overflowing last Sunday by an audience gathered to hear the symposium arranged by the Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago.....</p>
   <p>The president, A. Despotes, opened the program with a short but brilliant speech.....He then introduced the guest of honor, Mr. Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow is loved by the Greek people because he has certain philosophical characteristics which they appreciate greatly. He, in turn, introduced the speaker of the day, Mr. T. V. Smith, professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smith discussed his impressions gained from traveling in Greece; but since he remained in the country only ten days he stated that it would be impossible for him to give a complete picture of modern Greece.</p>
