   <p>More than five hundred Americans were present at the concert of the Greek artist, Mr. Constantine Petropoulos, which was held in the Midway Gardens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petropoulos' program was well chosen and pleased the audience tremendously. This Greek artist included the Greek demotic song "Gero Demos" in his program. It was enthusiastically received by the audience, although many of them were probably hearing Greek music for the first time.</p>
