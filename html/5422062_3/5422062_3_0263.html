   <p>p. 1.- During the week we received a letter from our patriotic Greek, J. Sakellarakis, secretary of one of the biggest market houses in Chicago, the market owned by the Giannakopoulos-Coorlas-Calvert (Kalabritinos) trio. These men are important factors in our bringing about a Panhellenic Union. With their help our project will gain much ground, we hope. During our ten years of journalism in America, we have always tried to bring before the reading public the exact opinions of leading men in the community. We have interviewed three important men and are truthfully publishing the contents of the interviews in our paper. These well-known men are Messrs. Giannakopoulos, Rifakis and Prokos. We believe that these interviews will give several new slants on the Panhellenic Union question and will clear many clouds that hang over our heads.</p>

   <p>AN OPEN LETTER</p>
   <p>Dear Loxias:</p>
   <p>In order to be truthful one must admit that you are a patriotic man, one who is extremely interested in the progress of our nation in a strange and powerful land.</p>
   <p>I congratulate you on your present work, writing every day, pounding incessantly on the same subject, not only because it is your own idea, but because it is a good idea and a patriotic one. We are referring, of course, to the Panhellenic Union, the uniting of all the big commercial concerns of our countrymen into one large corporation where all may reap similar profits.</p>
   <p>By this unison we will all find what we are looking for, what we came to this strange land for, - PROGRESS. This progress we will never make if we insist or fight among ourselves and be jealous of our neighbors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Two years ago Athena suggested that the South Water street district be united. Competition and jealousy overruled this splendid suggestion and it came to naught.</p>
   <p>Let us forget our community and our nation for a while. Our nation has a king and a government to look after it. The Community a governor and officers. Our duty and our problem does not concern them. It concerns us and our progress in the United States. After we insure success for ourselves we can help our community and our nation. Now we are too helpless to do anything. Let us all pull together and gain strength in unison.</p>
   <p>Keep up the good work, Loxias, do not let your brothers down.</p>
   <p>John Sakellarakis.</p>

   <p>In what way can the Greeks of Chicago bring about a union in the fruit business? The following dialogue should clear up some hazy points.</p>
   <p>Eutaxias - "Have you any idea, Mr. Giannakopoulos, as to the number of fruit concerns in Chicago and the nationalities of the owners?"</p>
   <p>Giannakopoulos - "Yes, there are 100 fruit concerns. Four are Greek and the rest are Italian, Jewish, and Irish."</p>
   <p>E. - "Where do these fruit come from?"</p>
   <p>G. - "California, Michigan, Missouri, and Colorado."</p>
   <p>E. - "How many Greeks come to the markets to buy fruits daily?"</p>
   <p>G. - "Over 2,000."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>E. - "Do all these men have their own stores?"</p>
   <p>G. - "No, about 500 have their own businesses. The rest have stands, trucks or wagons to sell their fruit."</p>
   <p>E. - "Could you tell me please how many men of other nationalities can be found buying fruit daily?"</p>
   <p>G. - "About 5,000, Italians; Jews, and Irish."</p>
   <p>E. - "If we asked you whether Greeks buy from Greeks or men of other nationalities, what would you say?"</p>
   <p>G. - "My answer would be this - Every Greek has a right to buy where he chooses. His purse-strings tell him where to go. If he is not satisfied with the Greeks, he buys from Italians or even from Jews."</p>
   <p>E. - "How do you buy your fruits, Mr. G?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>G. - "By auction, for instance, the highest bidder for bananas gets them."</p>
   <p>E. - "Do men of other nationalities come and buy for fruit-stands and peddling purposes?"</p>
   <p>G. - "That is a monopoly of the Greeks. Other nationalities all have stores of their own."</p>
   <p>E. - "Are fruits so in demand that both store-owners and peddlers can do a thriving business?"</p>
   <p>G. - "No, store owners do not make much money on fruit. Peddlers are more in demand, because they sell better fruit for less money."</p>
   <p>E. - "If that is true, according to the number of Greeks at the market, and according to the business they are doing; why don't Greeks support Greeks? Why don't they buy their fruits from Greeks instead of filling the pockets of the Italians, Jews, and Irish? Can't their union do anything <span class="page-break">7</span>for the mutual benefit of both?"</p>
   <p>G. - "There is one correction I'd like to make, my friend. You asked why the union doesn't do anything. The simple reason is - because there is no union."</p>
   <p>E. - "What? You have no organization? You let the Italians and Jews take all that money? I am ashamed to hear that about the Greek people. Don't you think that an association for all Greek fruit dealers in Chicago would be of advantage to all?"</p>
   <p>G. - "Yes, I have often hoped for that, but the Greeks do not find it easy to get along with each other. We can't do it."</p>
   <p>E. - "But can't we try, at least?"</p>
   <p>G. - "Yes, by all means, it will be a great thing, Mr. Eutaxias. I am with you 100% in anything you propose."</p>
   <p>The Interviews with Mr. Rifakis and Mr. Prokos will follow.</p>
