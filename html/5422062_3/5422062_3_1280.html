   <p>Beginning with Sunday, June 7, the Greek Hour will be a weekly feature over Station W.J.J.D., Palmer House, at 6-7 every Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Steven E. Chapin and E. A. Gregory of 160 North La Salle St., who have charge of this feature, pointed out that the Greek Hour will be a distinct departure from the usual foreign hours and its programs will be designed to render this feature attractive to all listeners, Greek and Americans alike.</p>
   <p>The Greek Hour orchestra will be under the direction of Eddy Varzos, the popular young violinist, who has directed both the Aragon and Trianon orchestras and is known to nearly all Chicago music lovers. The program will be predominately of the concert type, with Greek operettas, vocal and instrumental selections and Byzantine chorus, while the announcements for the most part will be in English.</p>
