   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The theater was packed with the elite of American and Greek society. The most prominent families of Chicago attended. The box-seats, the main floor, the balcony, and the gallery were filled to their capacity, and the spectacle was magnificent with elaborate costumes and costly jewels of the Byzantine Era.</p>
   <p>We were very glad to see that many of our countrymen were present, newspaper reporters, businessmen, professional men, and many others.</p>
   <p>The curtain went up at 8:30 p. m. The first part of the program represented the ancient Greek period in music and tableaus. The divisions of the first part were: (a) A hymn to Apollo; (b) Festivities in honor of Dionysus; (c) A second hymn to Apollo; (d) A Greek dance; (e) Spartan women; (f) A third hymn to Apollo; (g) The satyr and the nymph; (h) Cassandra; (i) Spring; (j) The song of Anacreon; (k) A poem to Phoebus; (1) A prayer to Nemesis; (m) The prologue of the "Oedipus"; and (n) A hymn to Night with ancient Greek dances executed by nymphs and other dancers.</p>
   <p>The second part was a representation of the Byzantine Era, and included: (a)</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Hymn to the Virgin Mary; (b) A scene from the life of the Emperor Theo-philus with Cassiani; (c) The repentance of Cassiani and her church in the desert; (d) The witness; and (e) Dances and festivities in the Byzantine palace.</p>
   <p>The third act consisted of pageants with typical Greek costumes. The May celebration with Greek and Cretan dances was presented as well as the Dance of Zalongis by Greek girls and students of the Socrates Greek School. Other Greek dances were danced by the Greek Young Women's Musical Association. All these dances were accompanied by music played by Mr. G. Gretses and Mr. Stamos' orchestra, and they charmed the audience, especially the Americans, by the sweetness of their melody.</p>
   <p>The festival, to judge by the comments of the Americans, was a magnificent success; it certainly aroused the enthusiasm of all who attended. The second part especially, which represented the Byzantine period, made a profound impression upon the audience.</p>
   <p>Congratulations are due not only to the ladies and gentlemen of the Greek <span class="page-break">5</span>colony who helped to make this national affair successful, but also to the Americans, who worked hard to get the festival started. This advertisement of the Greek race was of benefit to us nationally as well as commercially.</p>
   <p>The Greek Government upon this occasion sent the following cablegram, which was read by Mr. Taft, the chairman of the committee: "We are sending to you by cable a communication from the Greek playwrights:</p>
   <p>'Upon the occasion of the first presentation of dances and scenes of Greek life by the Drama League of America, we warmly salute the League in the name of the Greek intellectuals. It is very fortunate that so great a country as America. is perpetuating the artistic traditions of the ancient Greek spirit.</p>
   <p>Laskaris, President.</p>
   <p>Lidorikes, Secretary.'</p>
   <p>Alexandres, Secretary of State."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Let us hope that this national achievement an auspicious omen for our future life in America, will attract the attention of our kinsmen in Greece and that this recognition of and their rights accorded by a civilized people will turn their attention to foreign countries and especially to America and develop a system of propaganda for the rights and the defence of Greeks for the sake of the benefits which ancient Greece conferred on humanity.</p>
   <p>In this way other nations may be induced to study the wonderful people of Greece whom heretofore they have not noticed or considered. But to make this dream come true, the Greeks who live here must get out of the environment to which they have become accustomed, an environment which chokes all intellectual aspirations, and take advantage of all the beneficent and the priceless powers of the truly brilliant Greek nature.</p>
   <p>While cheap politicians are in power in Greece, aand the majority of Athenians are animated by their ideas, conditions cannot be improved there, and the fate of the present Greek generation will remain a matter of doubt. Unfortunately <span class="page-break">7</span>the fate and the rights of our generation in Greece are in incapable hands.</p>
   <p>The Greek population in foreign countries has always submitted to sacrifices and has never refused to work for the country of our origin. It is the duty of the homeland also to do its part.</p>
