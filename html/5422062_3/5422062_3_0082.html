   <p>Last week the Greek Confectioners Union of Chicago held its elections. The members elected to office are some of the finest business men of our community.</p>
   <p>Mr. D. Papantoniou is president; Mr. N. Johnson, vice-president; and Mr. J. Adinamis, who is also an undertaker, is the secretary.</p>
   <p>Saloniki congratulates the above persons upon their election, and hopes that by their energy and progressiveness the Union will become even more successful than it has been in the past.</p>
   <p>This Union, when organized and governed in a better manner, can become a solid foundation for business to be built upon.</p>
