   <p>The Hanging Gardens in the Horticultural Building of the Chicago World's Fair was the scene of a beautiful Greek program two weeks ago. The entertainment was a marked success, and was attended by over eight thousand people "A Day in Athens," as the spectacle was entitled, drew spectators from every walk in life. Rich and poor, common people and outstanding personalities--all alike flocked to this affair, and all were delighted with the performance.</p>
   <p>The dancing was under the direction of the well-known Greek dancer and teacher, N. Tsoukalas. Everyone marveled at the artistry and beauty of the presentations of the ballet. The choristers, directed by the lovely Marion Schroeder Booras, completely amazed the audience with their remarkably beautiful renditions of ancient and popular Greek songs and hymns. Minas Booras thrilled his audience with his beautiful solo renditions. The entire group was attired in typical Byzantine dress; and, of course, the costumes of the large ballet <span class="page-break">\2</span>were of great beauty and added much to the lovely effects.</p>
   <p>The director of the entire program, Nick J. Matsoukas, was everywhere at once and kept everything moving smoothly. He and the active participants in this artistic presentation have performed a service for the entire Greek community of Chicago. They have enabled us to show the American people that we, too, are capable of presenting beautiful programs, even if we are a comparatively small minority. We are happy to inform our readers that because of the success of "A Day in Athens" there will be another Greek Day at the World's Fair during September.</p>
