   <p>p. 4. That part of our community which loves the finer things in life and appreciates good music will have an excellent opportunity to hear Maria Parissi, soprano, in a song recital on Sunday at the Concert Hall of the Lyon and Healy Building on Jackson and Wabash.</p>
   <p>The program includes seventeen selections in all, and Mrs. Parissi, with her exceptional musical talent will give us all an enjoyable afternoon.</p>
   <p>Included in Mrs. Parissi's program will be our beloved singer, Andrea De Parry. We should all be present, as the proceeds will be donated to a fund for the needy Greeks of Chicago.</p>
