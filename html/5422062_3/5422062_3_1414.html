   <p>p. 4.- We don't know who it was that gave Michael Iatrus the idea of delivering a lecture, but we are grateful to him just the same. Mr. Iatrus is one of the few Greeks in America who can be both informative and entertaining on any subject he speaks. His theme will be, "The Greek Race from Origin to the Heroic Ages." It will take place at the Sherman Hotel, Friday, May 23, at 8 o'clock.</p>
