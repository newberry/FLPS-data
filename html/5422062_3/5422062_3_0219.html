   <p>A great number of the Greeks of America can be found in the fruit business. It is a large field and could be worked profitably for the Greeks if they only had the sense to know it.</p>
   <p>Greece is a willing market for apples, lemons, etc. Why shouldn't the Greek fruitmen get their products from Greece? The cost would be just the same and as countrymen we would be helping each other.</p>
   <p>Fruitmen of other nationalities have their eyes open and are taking our opportunities away from us. We who are asleep are losing out. While other fruitmen are making fortunes for themselves, the Greeks barely make a living.</p>
   
   <p>We should long ago have become organized and systemized in our business dealings. Many fruithouses make plenty of money but overhead and needless waste keep them down. There are no better lemons, pears, citrons and apples, than those that come from Greece. Why can't we avail ourselves of this golden opportunity?</p>
   <p>The Greek steamship lines approve of the idea and the cost of transportation isn't much. What is stopping you, fruitmen? Go ahead!</p>
