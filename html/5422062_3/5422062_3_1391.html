   <p>Ahepa chapter 46 invites the Greek people of Chicago and suburbs to attend a lecture given by Prof. Harold R. Willoughby of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The topic of the lecture is "Calligraphy of the Greek Handwritings of the Epech of Paleologoe".</p>
   <p>We call the attention of the Greek public to the fact, that Thil-Hellenic Professor Willoughby is an authority on the subject, and the lecture will be a very educational lesson from a historic-national point of view.</p>
   <p>The lecture will take place, June 4, at 190 N. State Street. Free admission.</p>
