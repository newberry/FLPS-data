   <p>Every Greek in America is familiar with the name of George Dillboy who served with the American army in France and was given a medal by the government for his outstanding bravery. Many American Legion posts have been named in his honor. One of these is composed of World War veterans in Hines, Illinois, where the Hines Hospital is located.</p>
   <p>One of our Chicago Greek veterans, Mr. C. Melas, has a position of authority within the Hospital, and he does as much as he can to alleviate the situation for the Greek veterans in the institution. In addition to his hospital work, Mr. Melas has undertaken to have a memorial statue built in the honor of this Greek hero [George Dillboy]. To accomplish this purpose, an organization called the George Dillboy Memorial Foundation has been formed. Its objective is to raise funds for the statue. Without doubt, the memorial will <span class="page-break">\2</span>be placed in the central garden of Hines Hospital.</p>
   <p>The organization has already outlined a plan for raising the necessary amount. Soon, the general public will be asked to make its contribution.</p>
