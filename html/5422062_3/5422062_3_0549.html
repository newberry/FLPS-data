   <p>The 46th chapter of Ahepa will give a concert to-morrow night at Kimball Hall, 25 E. Jackson Blvd., under the direction of the mandolin artist and founder of the Greek mandolin orchestra of Chicago, Mr. P. Vournas, who has given us so many successful concerts as to guarantee the complete success of to-morrow's performance.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this affair will be used as the starting fund for the inauguration of a Greek band of fifty pieces, of which the community is much in need.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vournas as well as the 46th chapter of Ahepa are worthy of congratulations for their initiative, and music-lovers will hasten to the support of the enterprise.</p>
