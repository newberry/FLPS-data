   <p>The newly organized society of Greek students, Elikon, held a debate, last week, at Ahepa chapter No. 94, Govan Hall, Wilson Ave. and Broadway.</p>
   <p>The topic of the debate was "Whether the Greeks of America Will Maintain Their National and Religious Traditions."</p>
   <p>Two American born Greeks,debated the subject with two Greeks born abroad. The pros were; Paul Kokinakis, President of the society, Elikon, and law student of De Paul University, and Andreas Andrew of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Cons were; George Livanos, law student of De Paul University and Basil Belogiannis of Loyola University.</p>
   
   <p>Presiding member of the debate was Theo. Constantopoulos, law student of De Paul, who in a brief speech said, "The object of the debate is not to reach a conclusion, but to create thoughts upon the subject. Although two of the debators were born here, and never have seen Greece the debate was held in the Greek language. It was really astonishing to hear the American born Greek students speaking the difficult language of their forefathers.</p>
