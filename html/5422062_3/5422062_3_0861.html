   <p>Last Sunday, the picnic of the Eptanisian Society Allilovoithia took place.</p>
   <p>This organization began in 1919 with the purpose of mutual aid and has performed many good deeds with their 250 members always helpful and willing. It was so progressive that another chapter was organized in Gary, Indiana.</p>
   <p>The balance of the first six months of 1929 showed a clear profit of $5,000. The board of directors are: George Kokkalin, president; A. Pagoulaton, secretary; A. Mourikin, assistant secretary; H. Zerbos, treasurer, and T. Galiatsaton, assistant treasurer. The trustees are: A. Dimitriadis, H. Tsakis, P. Tasimatos, N. Batistatos, P. Basileiadis, and J. Chondromaras.</p>
   <p>The outdoor gathering brought out one thing: all the guests of the club felt as if they were at a large family gathering. Every table was a private dining room with songs and laughter. Mr. Kokkalin, the president, worked very hard to achieve this success. He expressed his appreciation in a short speech at about 7:30, to the folks gathered there. After a gloriously, happy day, the guests started leaving at 10:00 P.M.</p>
