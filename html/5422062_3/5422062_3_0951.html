   <p>Mr. P. S. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Publisher of the Greek Star, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir :</p>
   <p>The very brief outline of your address on "Lincoln and Pericles," delivered at the Hamilton Club, which appeared in the Daily Telegram of this city on February 12, convinced me that it was worthy of a more complete report, for characters like these should be brought more prominently to the attention of readers, particularly of those of school age.</p>
   <p>I regret that I did not hear your address; however, something of it was echoed in the press as noted above.</p>
   <p>Yours in admiration,</p>
   <p>H. A. Soder,</p>
   <p>446 Hornor Avenue,</p>
   <p>Clarksburg, West Virginia.</p>
