   <p>We request all those who have been receiving The Star to send us their subscriptions. We are forced to repeat this request because we are planning to increase the size and number of our issues.</p>
   <p>Our friends and subscribers realize that the publication of a newspaper, which is nation-wide in scope and which has undertaken the task of keeping thousands of Greeks not only in Chicago but throughout the United States informed about developments in Greece and the life of the Greeks in America, demands a considerable expenditure and much effort.</p>
   <p>We hope that our people in Chicago will appreciate the importance of the work which is done by this newspaper and that they will support us financially.</p>
