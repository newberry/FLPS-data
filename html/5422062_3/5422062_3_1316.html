   <p>The Greek Bishop of Chicago, the most Rev. Philaretos urged by the success of the Sunday School of the North Division of the Church, established similar classes in a few more churches, and the result is that at St. Constantine's Church, there is a Sunday School of 135 pupils; at the Northern Branch, a Sunday School of 75 pupils and at St. Basilis, a Sunday School of 101 pupils. The teachers of such classes are educated ladies and gentlemen, who willingly offer their services to mold and inspire the souls of our youngesters. Both the Greek and English language are taught in the classes. The program of such classes is praiseworthy, because it includes, Religion, Discussion, Visual Education. Social Activity and Knowledge of Immigration. The Diocese will organize a mothers branch, and also a publication branch, which will soon publish a periodical called "Voice of Orthodoxy." The formation of a Boy Scout branch is underway.</p>
   <p>The Greek Diocese of Chicago is determined to keep a vigilant eye on the welfare of its people.</p>
