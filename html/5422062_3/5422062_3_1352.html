   <p>Before a crowded house last Wednesday night, Dr. George Gavaris gave a lecture based upon his impressions of Greece. Dr. Gavaris has recently returned from a sojourn in his native land. The tour was conducted by Gapa, of which he is treasurer.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gavaris transported his audience to Greece, and retraveled the route taken by the Gapa Tour over the country. He spoke in coordinated sentences and with expressive words, making his audience feel that they, too, were seeing with him the famous beauty spots of their beloved Greece. His general impressions of the country were favorable.</p>
   <p>"Greece," he said, "is a rapidly-developing country, and its large cities are outstandingly modernized."</p>
