   <p>The well advertised ball and athletic exhibitions of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club took place, last Sunday, in the Auditorium of the New Masonic Temple.</p>
   <p>The exhibitions, which electrified the fans, began at ten o'clock and lasted one hour.</p>
   <p>The Greek Olympic Athletic Club completely mobilized for action and prepared to give the participating fans an exhilarating evening, first presented the fighting Photopoulos brothers. These youthful fighters, weighing seventy and eighty pounds, respectively, and ranking as top-notchers among the youth of the club, displayed such skill and dexterity in fighting, that the capacity crowd was "thrown off their feet." The seventy pound youth shot a long prodigious left which made his brother show signs of cracking, but being heavier he collected himself and swang a powerful direct right to his brother's abdomen, which made him take notice.</p>

   <p>The fans became so concerned about the match of the two brothers, that dissension broke out and heated words were exchanged. Although no blows were struck, animosity existed during the three round exhibition of the brothers. No decision was made, both youths breezing along undefeated.</p>
   <p>The second and third pair of fighters, composed of Petros vs. Keros and of Flambouras vs. Ryan, light-weight fighers, thrilled the audience with their rights, lefts, and uppercuts.</p>
   <p>The wrestling pairs, Andrew Kalas versus H. Olezos and G. Kontales versus B. Thomas, gave such an exhibition that many of the fans loudly remarked, that Jim Londos is only an amateur compared with the boys of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club.</p>
   <p>The excitement, animosity, and turmoil of the fans subsided when the athletic exhibition was ended, and hilarious dancing followed until the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>The executive committee and members of the Greek Olympic Athletic Club are to be congratulated for originating this exhibition.</p>
