   <p>Dear Readers:</p>
   <p>On the occasion of the New Year 1918, after wishing each and every one of the subscribers of Saloniki a happy and prosperous New Year, I will take the liberty of asking everyone of our subscribers to read this letter carefully, for it is a special, personal message to them.</p>
   <p>With the beginning of a new year it is time to make new resolutions and formulate new guiding principles, if one is to profit from the opportunities which the days of the new year will bring. Of course, we are not writing this letter for the incorrigible, or for those who have not yet understood that they should use 1918 and not persist in writing 1917.</p>
   <p>We are writing to the progressive individuals among whom we number almost all the readers of Saloniki.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Because there may be some, however, who will think that we are trying to flatter our friends and readers, we seek a good testimony of the confidence the readers of Saloniki have in us, and their progressive ideas. This testimony can be secured by the readers sending their subscriptions to the offices of Saloniki accompanied by letters and articles concerning the affairs of the Greek people of America, particularly of Chicago, as well as the affairs of our fatherland, or articles on general social problems.</p>
   <p>Thus, an excellent opportunity will be afforded the management of Saloniki not only to think about the letters and articles of its readers and formulate the policy of the newspaper for the new year, but at the same time an opportunity is given the Saloniki to see how many subscribers belong to that exceptional group of people that fulfills its obligations and which has the disposition to offer its support for the progress of a sincere, national journalism, which is ably represented by Saloniki.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Here is a thought which I submit to every reader with the hope that before he finishes studying this letter everyone of us will send his subscription in cash and contribute material for thought as well. I take this opportunity to extend cordial greetings and wish a happy New Year to all.</p>
   <p>Saloniki.</p>
