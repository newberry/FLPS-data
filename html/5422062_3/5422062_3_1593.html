   <p>The most progressive club in Chicago is the Young Men's Athletic Club. It is a truly patriotic body that wants to help our Motherland as much as possible. The members are not all rich and educated, but they are all true Greeks who want to do their duty. It is a shame there aren't more like these brave, patriotic, young men in Chicago.</p>
