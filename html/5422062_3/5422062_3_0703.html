   <p>The Beauty Contest.</p>
   <p>The Beauty Contest between girls of our Community is so attractive as to set, and justly so, them into motion and emotion. There are so many beautiful Greek girls in Chicago, that the Award Committee will be placed in a very difficult position as to who to choose as the winner.</p>
   <p>It is quite natural that such a contest should provoke the ambition of the maidens and the interest of our boys, for, fundamentally, it surrounds them, inasmuch as, every girl is destined for some young man, and every young man is ambitious to win the most beautiful girl. Every mother also wants her daughter to be the most beautiful of all.</p>
   <p>In any case we are in need of motion and emotion, and the organizers of the contest deserve praise for conceiving the idea. We have no doubt that the whole community of Chicago shares these thoughts.</p>
