   <p>On the 6th of November the Greek Restaurant Association, Hermes, is giving its first annual dance at the Coliseum. All Greeks must be present at this dance because it signifies a huge family gathering of a united people.</p>
   <p>This association was organized in March; it adopted the name of Hermes and made out its canonisms. Much ground has been covered since last March. At that time the Greek Restaurateurs found themselves in great peril of being swept aside by other forces. The price of meat and other food products was going up and competitors were trying to run them out of business. The Restaurant Association put an enormous task upon itself.</p>
   <p>This task is by no means completed. The Restaurateurs have barely made a start but it is a good start. All Greek restaurant owners have found much benefit from this association and they will continue to do so.</p>

   <p>The members have shown that they mean business and all are cooperating magnificently.</p>
   <p>The dance is being given to further the progress of this successful association. When the aims and purposes are made known to the Greek people of Chicago, all will hasten to the first affair they are giving. We need everyone's support.</p>
