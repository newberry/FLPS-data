   <p>P.3--The Chicago Greek boy, Basil Demetrelis, who not very long ago was handling produce in a commission-house, to-day handles wrestlers as if they were sacks of potatoes. His latest victory was won over the English champion who had been wearing the belt coveted by the wrestling world.</p>
   <p>This young Greek, who looks and acts like one of the gods worshipped by his ancestors, has already defeated fifteen American wrestlers who had been considered better grapplers than Demetrelis.</p>
   <p>Next Saturday night, June 30, Demetrelis will wrestle with H. Landin, champion of Sweden, at Brand's Hall, 162 North Clark Street. Undoubtedly the Greek boy will win.</p>
