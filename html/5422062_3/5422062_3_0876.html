   <p>In a very suitable park at Devon and Crawford Avens., the women of the Philanthropic Club of St. Basil church, gave an enjoyable picnic, last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The park was filled with people at an early hour. Many came and brought their families. The Greek spirit reigned everywhere. All day and far into the night everyone joined in the songs, dances, food and drinks provided by the club.</p>
   <p>This picnic has proved that in order to be a big success, outdoor gatherings of this sort must have the woman's touch.</p>
   <p>This success has been entirely due to the Women's Committee of which Mrs. G. Cokins is president; Katina Mouzakiotis, vice president; Georgia Dedakis, treasurer; Julia Stratigos, secretary and A. Konstantin, A. Trapsanis and F. Kapantis are advisors.</p>
   
   <p>Among those present were the most Reverend Bishop Filaretos, Rev. Chatsimitrios, Arch Rev. Tsourounakis, and the families of Dimitriadis, Triantafilos, Chatsimitrios, Kapsalis, Mavros, Geocaris, Mouzakiotis, Poulos, Gorgia, Mexis, Poulakis, Sellas, Belonis, Dallas, Kanelis, Chousmas, Petropoulos, Chikouris, Tulupan, Kelavos, Depakis, Hatsos, Magdaline Cokins, Karahalis, etc.</p>
