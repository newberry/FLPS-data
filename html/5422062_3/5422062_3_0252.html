   <p>A day does not pass that we do not hear some complaint against us. Many of the complaints are made against our candy store and restaurant owners and operators. Accidentally, we met an American businessman who made many complaints against his Greek clients. On the day before yesterday we received a letter from another merchant asking for the addresses of numerous Greek creditors of his. Also, only a few days ago, we had a businessman visit us asking our advice on a method of collecting several sums of money which were owed him by Greeks.</p>
   <p>In short, this is very regrettable because such dishonest dealings jeopardize the reputation and the interests of honest and decent Greek businessmen. Even the good name and honor of all the Greeks is thus seriously injured. Because of this accusation against us, we were forced to pen these few lines with deep regret and shame. However, we must make a vehement protest in behalf of all honest and fair-minded Greeks everywhere. They must take active steps to get rid of those unscrupulous and dishonest Greeks who disgrace themselves, who drag the Greek name down, and who injure our common interests.</p>
   <p>With the exception of only a few of our businessmen, it will be noticed that very few of us who are in business have adopted a suitable and systematic method of granting and obtaining business credit. If we check any business inventory or official black-lists we will be surprised to notice that only a small number of Greek businessmen have a good credit rating. In spite of this, however, American business institutions--big companies and wholesale houses--did not hesitate to open credit accounts with most of us whose names and businesses were not on the Chicago Businessmen's Register. Naturally, this took place; first, because they relied upon the personal honesty and integrity of the Greek businessman. They also had accepted the recommendations and good references which they got from other reputable businessmen among us.</p>
   
   <p>Unfortunately, however, today's results and reports prove that there are many irresponsible and unprincipled countrymen of ours in whom honesty, integrity, and good faith have been found lacking in the American market. On the other hand, we may be encouraged by the fact that there are also many honorable and honest Greek businessmen who are a credit to the Greek name and to the high standing of the Greek Community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>For these reasons we wish to emphasize that honesty and clean deals are the main prerequisites for progress and a promising future. It is on such a basis that the happiness and prosperity of everyone rests.</p>
   <p>When, fifty years ago, John D. Rockefeller Sr. was starting in business as a young man in Cleveland, Ohio, he needed $2,000 to promote his business enterprise; he went to a bank and asked for a loan. The banker asked if he could bring an endorser who could give a guarantee; if not, some sort of collateral was required of him. Rockefeller could not comply with these requirements. However, after a long talk, the banker was convinced of his honesty and integrity, and promptly granted him the $2,000 without any security or collateral whatever. Today, Mr. Rockefeller's fortune and his huge oil industries are estimated to amount to about two billion dollars.</p>
   <p>By this example we wish to say that the individual's personal integrity and honesty are the only means with which to establish and create any kind of business regardless of its size. It is in this way that capital and fortunes are made.</p>
   <p>Consequently, it becomes necessary to see that our business is systematized. It is necessary that we always be faithful to our obligations to our creditors. This necessity is imposed upon us by our individual and collective interests. A day will and must come when every Greek will be distinguished by his honesty. It is then that we shall see our reputation being improved; only then will the horizons of successful activities be widened and extended.</p>
   <p>Honor and esteem, then, to those who are doing business in an honorable way; shame and dishonor to those who use lies and practice deception, to those who blacken the Greek name.</p>
