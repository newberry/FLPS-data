   <p>p. 4- Our business, as the result of the sincere and honest service which we render to those who deal with us, has rapidly increased to such an extent that we have been compelled to expand the house of Karavelis and Boosoolas by establishing a branch office in Salt Lake City, Utah, located at 533 West Second South Street. An additional office will be established in the immediate future in Athens, Greece, concerning which we shall make an announcement later.</p>
