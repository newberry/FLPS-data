   <p>Next Sunday the cornerstone of the new edifice of St. Constantine's Church of the South Side will be laid with magnificent ceremonies in the presence of four archbishops, the Consul-General of Greece, and the members of St. Constantine's community. The buildings, St. Constantine's Church and Korais School, will cost $250,000 and will be erected on the same lot where church and school formerly stood. We have always been ardent supporters of the erection of St. Constantine's Church, regardless of our convictions concerning the church question, and we urge each and all to support the project because it belongs to all Greeks, more than ever now when the day of the desired solution of the matter that is keeping us apart cannot be far off, and the community of St. Constantine will soon be united with all the communities of Chicago under the governorship of the Church of Greece and all the Greek churches in America.</p>
   <p>...... If we disagree on ways and means, we agree on the final object in view, which is the preservation of the Greek language and religion, and this is the aim of St. Constantine's Church and Korais School.</p>
