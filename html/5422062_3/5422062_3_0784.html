   <p>p. 1.- Great efforts are being put forward by the ladies and gentlemen of Gapa lodges for the success of the entertainment, Monday, May 11th, at the Aragon, for the benefit of the Greek day school, Socrates.</p>
   <p>Young men and women are very busy rehearsing, so as to present something beautiful and complete that night. The program is a beautiful one, rich and concise. The dance will start at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>At 10 o'clock a guard of honor, consisting of young boys and girls in uniform with swords in hand, will welcome the officials: Supreme Grand-President of the Organization, Dr. Asteriadis, who is here by invitation; Mr. Soterakopoulos, the Grand-Governor; and the Presidents of the Lodges.</p>
   <p>Then the girls will sing Gapa songs, and the Grand-Governor will introduce the Supreme-Grand-President who will address the gathering briefly. Many songs will be sung, poems recited, and classical and modern dances enjoyed.</p>
   
   <p>Different episodes of natural beauty in which peasant costumes will be worn are to be acted.</p>
   <p>The part of the shepherd boy will be assumed by Mr. Sinonis, President of the North Side Lodge, Thermopylai, who will play the shepherd's flute. Miss Soundre will play the part of the shepherd girl, who will go to the fountain to get some water. There, the boy laying down by the fountain and playing the flute, falls asleep.</p>
   <p>In his dream he sees twelve fairies dancing, one of whom Miss Harrisi is dancing the spring dance. Then the fairies see the shepherd boy and call on the God of Love who wounds the boy as well as the girl.</p>
   <p>The fairies disappear, the girl sings while filling up her jug with water, the boy wakes and sees the girl with whom he falls in love. He plays the flute and the girl in turn falls in love with him. At this moment, many shepherd girls enter with their jugs to get water. They notice the lovers, set down their jugs, and start a dance with the boy and the girl as principals.</p>
   
   <p>It is to be hoped that all these efforts to present something worthwhile, will be appreciated by the members of our Chicago community by their attending the affair to see for themselves, with pride, their boys and girls as performers.</p>
