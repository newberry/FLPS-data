   <p>P.3--We are glad to hear that N. D. Papadakis, a member of our community, has been employed as a clerk by the First National Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Papadakis was trained in banking before he came to America. He is well educated and possesses that essential characteristic of the good banker, willingness to serve. Greeks in Chicago will honor their race by patronizing the newly employed Greek clerk.</p>
