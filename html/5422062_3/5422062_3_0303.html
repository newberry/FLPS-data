   <p>P. 3- Last Thursday, Evstatios Karavelis, well known and well liked member of the firm of Karavelis and Boosoolas, general agents for steamship and railway companies left for Athens, Greece, with the intention of establishing there a branch office of his Chicago house. Mr. Karavelis, who has been in Chicago for the last eighteen years, intends to stay in Greece six to eight months before he returns to Chicago.</p>
   <p>The new expansion of his firm in Greece is to serve the interests of our fellow-Greeks who wish to emigrate to the United States, and the office in Athens will have a staff of experienced and well informed Greeks from America.</p>
   <p>The Star wishes Mr. Karavelis bon voyage, success in his proposed business, and a happy return to our city.</p>
