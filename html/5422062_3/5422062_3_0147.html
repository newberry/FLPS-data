   <p>Dear Fellow Countrymen: We hereby take this opportunity to inform you that our firm, Mouzakiotis and Company, has bought the entire stock of the Greek Kapandais Company. Our new company will henceforth be known as the Mouzakiotis and Kapandais Importing Company. Our business is going on as usual with new service facilities to supply our customers with all desirable imported or domestic goods.</p>
   <p>The new company is owned and operated by Tom Mouzakiotis and Nicholas Govostis. It will make every effort to meet the demands of its clientele.</p>
   <p>The merchandise, especially the imported goods, of our house is of the finest quality, and our prices are very reasonable.</p>
   <p>A visit from the readers of Saloniki will convince them of the high standing of our company.</p>
   
   <p>Thanking you all in advance, we remain</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Mouzakiotis and Company.</p>
