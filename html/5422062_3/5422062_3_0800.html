   <p>Since noon last Sunday till midnight all Greeks from the West Side as well as from other parts of the city enjoyed themselves at the Kimisis Tis Theotokou picnic.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Board of Directors for the splendid success of this picnic. We know they worked hard to make it a success and their efforts have been rewarded. What surprised and pleased us most was the large number of young people that took part in the Greek dancing. It shows that they are interested in Greek affairs and customs. We can hardly believe that the Greeks in America are losing their consciousness of nationality when we see such patriotic demonstrations as these.</p>
