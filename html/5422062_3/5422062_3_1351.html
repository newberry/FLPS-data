   <p>Last Friday night, Mr. Speios Kotakis gave a lecture on the "Language Question" before a select audience of Greek men and women; select, because the topic was of such a nature that it attracted only those of the professional groups, students and persons of good education in both Greek and English.</p>
   <p>For an hour and a half Mr. Kotakis analyzed the problem of language, which has always been a source of much discussion and argument. He defended the literary or "Kathare Vousa" language as befitting the Greek people and their philology and philosophy better than the "Demotic". At the close of the lecture he answered various questions put to him. If time had permitted, a linguistic symposium would have taken place. The audience was much enthused by Mr. Kotakis' address.</p>
   <p>His personality is so clever that he causes men to change life-long opinions easily.</p>
