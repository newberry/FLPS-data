   <p>The one hundred members of the Prosperity Club, of the Illinois Athletic Club, requested Mr. D. Poulakis, manager of the Chicago branch of the Bank of Athens, to give a lecture regarding the progress of the Greek immigrant.</p>
   <p>Mr. Poulakis brought out the naked truth concerning the Greek immigrant, how he came to America, poor, without a vocation, not knowing the language of the land, not being familiar with the American habits and customs, and having very little education, if any at all; how he brought with him the undying Greek spirit of industry and progressiveness. In an incredible short time you find him among the better class of society. You find him as a lawyer, a doctor an engineer, an architect, a professor in a university, and active in other arts and professions. In regard to business the Greek, taking into consideration his short period of residence here as well as the handicaps of the immigrant is leading in his line of business.</p>
   
   <p>As a citizen, he is considered among the very best. Right here in Chicago millions of dollars are in the hands of Greeks, who a few years ago were poor immigrants. Artists, architects, doctors, lawyers, and educators, you find in Chicago among the Greek element.</p>
   <p>It was the first opportunity given to such a select circle of Americians to know how the insignificant immigrant of yesterday became the significant citizen of today. The lecture of the Greek banker was very much appreciated by the one hundred present. Each one shook hands with Mr. Poulakis, who was cordially requested to deliver another lecture before them at some future time. The date for such a lecture is already set.</p>
