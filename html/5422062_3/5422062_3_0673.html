   <p>The title of this patriotic drama is in itself enough to stir the heart and soul of every Greek. The "Dance of Zallogou" is a living page in the undying history of 1821. It is the clearest and holiest mirror in which future generations will be able to see the faith, the self-sacrifice, the self-denial and the honor of the Hellenes. This dramatic and holy event, which took place ninety-eight years ago in the Golgotha of Souli in the mountain fastness of Zallogou, will never be repeated even in many thousands of years.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago, are invited to attend a reproduction of this event, upon the stage. The heroes and heroines are not actors, nor are they the usual amateur performers which we are accustomed to see. They are the small girls and boys who attend the Socrates School, which is directed by the Reverend Leon Pygeas and Mrs. C. Kantzou.</p>
   <p>We will not cause tears to come to the eyes of the readers by describing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the rehearsal which we attended. We will say, however, that Chicago has never before had the opportunity of witnessing such a performance as will occur on Sunday, May 11, in the Auditorium Theater. Despite the size of this theater we are sure that the Greek community will fill the theater to overflowing.....The drama will be followed by a musical program.</p>
