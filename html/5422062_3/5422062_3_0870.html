   <p>One of the largest, if not the largest, of this year's picnics was given last Sunday by the Tegeatan Club of America.</p>
   <p>It is hard for a person to believe that one club can gather together so many people. Yet, as we know, their group is well-organized and has many members. The Tegeatans have worked hard for their success, headed by their president, George Katsan.</p>
   <p>Credit is to be given to John Ganas, vice-president; Christ Nicholopoulos, president of the Social Committee; N. Ganas, treasurer; F. Geokaris, Social committee; J. Kotsiopoulos, secretary, and A. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>alesis, Social committee.</p>
   <p>Among the ladies, we saw Mrs. Mary Douris, Mrs. Theodorou, Miss Georgia Priobolis, Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Karkasis, Mary Soundris, Mrs. Papaspiros, Mrs. Papatheodorou, Mrs. K. Andriopoulos, the Misses Likouris, Mrs. Haralampopoulos and many others.</p>
   
   <p>The climax of the day came when pictures of Greece were shown. Afterwards the thousands of people disbanded. Some went to the bar, others to the dance, others to tables and everyone stayed till late at night. Hundreds of Arkadians were present.</p>
   <p>The Tegeatan Club gave this affair to finance a school to be built in Tegea, Greece. The school is to be for girls only where home economics are to be taught to the future housekeepers of Tegeas. This tends to educate the future mothers and contributes to the progress of our mother country.</p>
   <p>This work which the Tegeatans are trying to carry out, is for a noble true cause.</p>
