   <p>The official opening of the new Athenian Hall, which is located above Constantine Salopoulos' pharmacy, on Blue Island Avenue and Polk Street, was celebrated with a magnificent ceremony and a sumptuous banquet.</p>
   <p>More than two hundred guests from among our most prominent businessmen and members of the professions took part in the magnificent banquet, which was given by the owner and manager of the hall.</p>
   <p>This excellent and spacious hall was sorely needed by our Greek community on the West Side. It will no doubt become the meeting place and a social center of our people.</p>
