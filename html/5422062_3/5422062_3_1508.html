   <p>P. 1 - The Greek community of Chicago for the last two months has been entertaining a distinguished visitor, Countess De Rillee, a direct descendant of the famous Colocotronis family of the Peloponnesus.</p>
   <p>Mme. De Rillee is visiting all the Greek communities in America and delivers lectures on "The Organization of the Greeks in the United States."</p>
   <p>Her lectures, delivered in all parts of the country,have brought results, since many societies and associations are being founded and organized. She and her noble husband will remain in Chicago for some time and will then return to Greece.</p>
   <p>Most of the dailies in Chicago eulogize Mme. De Rillee and her good work among the Greeks. One newspaper, after the christening of ten Greek boys sponsored by Countess De Rillee, said among other flattering things, "If the Greek lady prolongs her sojourn in Chicago for six months, every unchristened baby in the city will be baptized by Her Grace."</p>
