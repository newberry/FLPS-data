   <p>p. 1.- The Greek community of Chicago is extremely proud of the newly organized Athletic Club. In one month, 200 members have enrolled and the treasury has over $1,000. The young men prove that there can be a progressive Greek club in our city without jealousy, arguments, and petty trifles to break it up. Athletics are very important in the present day era and the Greeks of Chicago are leading in this field. We are very confident they will continue the good work and cover themselves with glory.</p>
