   <p>The much publicized performance of the play "Esme" took place Sunday December 15, at the Eighth Street Theater. It was performed by the Sophocles amateur dramatic group, composed of people from the parishes of the Evangelismos and St. Demetrios Churches.</p>
   <p>The evening was a success both financially and artistically. Since it was given for the benefit of the Greek schools of the parishes there is added joy in its financial success.</p>
   <p>"Esme" is a lovely romance written by Peresiadis [Athenian novelist], in which the customs and ideals of Greece are poignantly portrayed. The time of the play is set in 1821 when Greece was struggling for her independence.</p>

   <p>We do not intend to explain the plot because the Greek people have been familiar with it for many years. Therefore, when "Esme" is to be performed a large audience gathers to relive for three hours the life they left behind them.</p>
   <p>All the amateur performers managed to feel the spirit of the play and to interpret it artistically.</p>
   <p>The play was directed by Mr. Viangos Kouvarakos, who also was the protagonist. Mrs. Aviadne Kagglis played "Esme" charmingly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Minas Booras was worthy of a larger role, for he is one of Chicago's finest artists.</p>

   <p>The dramatic performance was enriched by....the singing of Miss Sophie Bexis, well-known Greek lyric soprano.</p>
   <p>During the intermission, Mr. Spyro Stamos, world-acclaimed cymbalist, played Greek selections which delighted the audience.</p>
   <p>These two parishes are to be commended for taking such ways of raising money for their schools.</p>
