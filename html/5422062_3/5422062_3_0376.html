   <p>On January 30, in the West End Womens' Club, a recital was given by the young violin artist, Mr. Elias Methenitis. It was apparent that he is a complete master of his instrument, and will probably go far in the music world. His musical aptitude and ability, if cultivated to a greater degree, will make him an outstanding artist.</p>
   <p>The Greek community has had as yet no great violinist, and we hope that that place will be filled by Mr. Methenitis.</p>
