   <p>As if to remind us of its importance, the Greek Olympic Athletic Club comes into prominence again with two victories for its members. In the fifty mile marathon race last Saturday, John Kallas won in six hours 18' and 3 inches, thus breaking the world's record.</p>
   <p>S. Vorris in a wrestling match defeated Genon, who was champion.</p>
   <p>This serves to show that we must support the athletic club more earnestly and more generously.</p>
