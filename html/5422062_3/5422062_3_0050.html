   <p>The Galanos brothers have, by their industry and worthiness, gained a prominent place in Chicago's business world. Their business grew so rapidly that they built this huge candy company to house their "Temptation Chocolates" which are so well known. The chocolates are made in this clean and airy candy factory by expert candy makers. A certain type of chocolate is used that does not melt during warm weather. We recommend the brand to all Greek confectionery dealers not only because of the superiority of the chocolates, but because the concern is a Greek one. By handling it,the dealer, the concern and the community will be benefited.</p>
