   <p>Just as the general press constitutes the greatest strength in directing opinion and in helping to shape the lives of the members of the community, so does the Greek Press attempt to influence the lives of the Americanized Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, through the Greek language, serves the Greek people in an advantageous way, to the greatest degree.</p>
   <p>It is the messenger of commerce and industry and the indispensable conjunction of commercial exchange and economic progress of the Greek world in America.</p>
   <p>Observe the Greek newspapers published in America and you shall see that the completeness of their announcements and advertisements shows how priceless is the service which the press renders to commercial and industrial Greeks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Especially in this land, where antisocial forces carry out racial competition, in which the strong attempt to dominate the weak. The Greek Press holds the position of vigilant guard and true protector of the Greek element which in the last few years has been feeling the destructive force of this competition.</p>
   <p>Other foreign newspapers in America offer these same services to their racial groups.</p>
   <p>This practice of Greek journalism correspond to the mission of the general American press that deals mainly with commercialism.</p>
   <p>The destiny of the Greek Press is far beyond the limit of the material.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, carries inextinguishable, the lamp of Greek light, leads the spiritual progress of the American Greeks, guides their perceptions and opinions, strengthens them in maintaining the Greek nationalism, kindles the worship of the beautiful ideals of Greece, magnifies the national ideals, <span class="page-break">\3</span>realizes their political convictions, promotes community education and makes them more perfect as men and women and as American citizens.</p>
   <p>But, above all, the Greek Press teaches respect for the Greek-American ideals and speaks continually to the Greek-American generation of duty towards the mother tongue and of the superior spiritual faith which they represent.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, published in the Greek tongue, believes that those people who feel the vibrations of Greek blood in their veins and whose minds are lit by the brilliance of the Greek spirit, no matter where they go, will speak and read with pride the Greek language and will teach it to the coming generations. While the Greek people are mastering the American language and are becoming good American citizens, many Americans are trying to bring the Greek language into their universities and colleges.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press, in the Greek language for the Greek speaking people, believes that like the family, school and church, it, too, must be added as a fourth factor towards teaching the Greek tongue and strengthening it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Greek Press asserts that the perpetuation of the Greek tongue is not only for honor and fame for the Greek-American but also to serve as a necessary element in the progress of our adopted country, America.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press realizes that the teaching and learning of Greek and the utilization, thereof, is a true basis for Americanism. The learned Americans consider the teaching and learning of Greek as an essential element of the new modern world and as such, are concerned very much with the teaching of it, not only in their universities, but also in their high schools.</p>
   <p>The space in this column is insufficient to permit us to invite universal authorities to give their opinions concerning the Greek language and convincing us that without the Greek language, it would be impossible to build up new eras in the various stages of history.</p>
   <p>However, we shall present, in short, the opinion of one of the most conspicuous of American scholars, Mr. Andrew Kennedy. Following is a small precept of one of his many articles on the Greek language:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"The teaching of Greek in American high schools is increasing astonishingly. I am very sorry that there are some pressure groups that do not treasure Greek. These forces misunderstand the spirit of eternity. The Greek language is entitled to priority among many other possibilities, according to learned scholars, and is considered the most important element of true and complete education. I believe that the Greek language should be accorded the rights that it so much deserves. The Greek language should be preserved for posterity. England is preserving those rights at Oxford University in the form of literature for the entire world."</p>
   <p>That is why we say, that, just as in the home, school and church, the Greek Press for Greek-speaking people, has an enormous duty to perform in America, a duty that is practical and spiritual. This duty will be greatly simplified with the aid of schools!.</p>
