   <p>p. 1 - The Greek press of America should tell all of our countrymen that as soon as they pay their taxes they must help the mother country. Taxes are the most important things in the world. They must be paid!</p>
   <p>If there is money left over, we must not try to spend it on luxuries or amusements. The favorite excuse is that one has left Greece years ago. Does his duty stop? No, it increases. We have decided that a man ought to pay for every year he has been away. It doesn't mean much to him, but it can save Greece from the clutches of the Turk.</p>

   <p>Some say they are afraid to give anything because they are ashamed to have a small amount published in the paper. This has surprised us. Greeks should give their money quietly and secretly. A small amount is just as helpful as a big one. This is virtue, to give without expecting glory, honor, and publicity. The Greeks of Chicago, and all America, have much to learn in the way of duty and virtue. It is up to the Greek Press to wake up our fellow countrymen and see that they do what is right.</p>
