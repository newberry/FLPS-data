   <p>The Religious and Ethical Greek Orthodox Brotherhood is giving its regular lecture Sunday, December 2, 1923, at 8:00 P.M., on the first floor of Hull House, which is located on the corner of Polk and Halsted Streets.</p>
   <p>Our Brotherhood has managed to secure the Panhellenic Church speaker, Mr. Michael Galanos, who was recently established in our Chicago colony. Mr. Galanos is making his second talk on the broad and serious subject "The contributions of the Greek Orthodox Church through the centuries to the world, and the most serious duties of the Greeks in America."</p>
   <p>We are interested in seeing our professional men present, so as to strengthen their religious faith and interest.</p>
   <p>All are invited. The doors will open at 7 P.M. Admission is free.</p>
