   <p>Last Friday evening, the Young Women's Literary Club of Chicago gave a dance which exceeded our wildest expectations. Their patience and hard work have been rewarded because the dance was a huge success. Everyone felt at home due to the hospitable ways of the charming president, Alexandra Tulupan.</p>
   <p>At the door we were greeted by Nina Perdikes who pinned a rose on each and ushered each one of us into the salon. There we were greeted by a bevy of beautiful girls, all eager to welcome us. Among the beautifully dressed women were: Mrs. Maria Vatsinea, Martha Roussi, Mrs. Ligeri Marantis, Mrs. Chronopoulos, Mr. P.
