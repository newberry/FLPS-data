   <p>The Greek community welcomes the new newspaper, The Independent, published by the well-known Spiros Kotakis. It is a four-page weekly containing much fine literature and many essays, with a number of articles by the editor himself. The writings of Mr. Kotakis are very worth while and should be read by the entire Greek community.</p>
