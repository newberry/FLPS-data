   <p>p. 1- The popular demand among the Greek communities of America for the Greek theater in this country has prompted the formation of numerous groups of amateur performers throughout the United States who have presented various dramatic performances in the modern Greek language for the purpose of supporting community enterprises.</p>
   <p>Although these amateur groups have paved the way for professional productions of much higher type, they have not satisfied the aspirations of the Hellenic element in this country, which has long desired to see established in America the genuine Greek theater with a staff of talented players capable of presenting stage productions equal to those of modern Greece.</p>
   
   <p>This long desire of the Greeks in America has finally been fulfilled by the arrival from Greece with her theatrical troupe of Mrs. Pantopoulou, who has thrilled Chicago Greek audiences for three successive seasons by her skilled presentation of modern Greek dramas.</p>
   <p>Other Greek theatrical troupes have followed the example set by Mrs. Pantopoulou and have come to America to act before Greek-American audiences, and we are informed that there are already such troupes in the City of New York.</p>
   <p>To compete with the other three troupes, Mrs. Pantopoulou immediately took measures to improve her own troupe by sending her manager, Mr. C. Tavularides, to Athens in search of better talent. He was successful in obtaining some of Greece's most talented actors and combined them with the other players of the troupe, creating a much-improved Operetta Pandopoulou, of which he himself is the impresario.</p>
   <p>Included in the list of new members of this theatrical troupe are Mr. P. Kyriakos, an outstanding personality in the theatrical circles of Athens, the distinguished tenors, Messrs. N. Afentaki and A. Maliagrou, the Theban Duo, and many other artists. Beyond a doubt, the Operetta Pandopoulou has been greatly fortified and improved by this recent acquisition of new talent, and in its present form it stands unrivaled.</p>
   <p>We are informed that Mr. Tavularides, with his enlarged theatrical troupe, plans to remain in New York City during the entire winter season, playing in one of New York's largest theaters, the Manhattan Opera House, twice a week. We wish for our esteemed friend, the talented impresario, the greatest success.</p>
   <p>We of the Greek community of Chicago, however, feel that New York City is well supplied with Greek theatrical troupes and beg the Operetta Pantopoulou to continue to favor our city with its dramatic presentations during the coming season. We have not the slightest doubt that the citizens of Chicago will accord their hearty support, as they have done in the past, to this troupe, the first professional modern Greek theatrical unit in America, by their continued attendance at its performances, especially now that numerous additions have brought into the company some of Greece's most eminent theatrical artists.</p>
   
   <p>The appeal which we are making to Mr. Tavularides is beyond doubt seconded by every member of the Greek community of Chicago who feels that he has a claim to the impresario's consideration because of his loyal attendance in the past at the performances of the Operetta Pandopoulou. Moreover, Mr. Tavularides knows how well Greek Chicago appreciates and supports well-organized Greek theatrical troupes when these troupes justify by their superior acting to be considered distinguished artists.</p>
   <p>The existence of a genuine Greek theater in America is considered to be of the utmost importance and is really an imperative necessity, for it serves to bind together in closer community of culture the Hellenism of Greece and the Hellenism of the United States.</p>
