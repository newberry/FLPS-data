   <p>The Byzantine ensemble, making its first appearance at the Tsoukalas Little Theater of the Dance last night has gone in for something rather out of the ordinary in musical programs. It is a song group of two women and eight men, and it confines itself largely to Greek music, but Greek music of all ages.</p>
   <p>For example, its first groups last night covered nearly 2,000 years of time. It is said that Greek music has affected many other countries, and one can easily believe it.</p>
   <p>Marion Schroeder Booras is the musical director of the organization, and Spiro Stamos, arranger of much of the program, plays upon the Sanduri, an instrument of 140 strings played with padded hammers. Mr. Stamos was both agile and expressive in solos on the instrument, and produced a quite unexpected number of different tone colors. The 1932-33 musical season thus begins with an interesting novelty.</p>
