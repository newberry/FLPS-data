   <p>The Greek Community of our city acquitted itself admirably last Sunday at the reception given for Spyros Matsoukas. We had been waiting for him a long time, and, when he finally came, our enthusiasm was unquenchable.</p>
   <p>More elated were we when we heard that he has sent, in his 18 months, here, over $103,000 home to Greece. He raised $103,000 from the Greeks of America and he sent $103,000 to Greece. He is working, without any personal gain to himself, for the cause of Greece.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek press in America has dubbed him a thief, a liar, a usurper, etc., but if this were so, would he send $103,000 of the $103,000 to Greece? Wouldn't he keep a goodly portion for himself? Would he be working so hard among so many obstacles if he weren't the genuine thing?</p>
   <p>That is only one mistake of the Greek press. Among our Greek newspapers the Atlantis collects $70,000 annually from subscribers, the Pan Hellenic collects $40,000, the Athena $5,000, and Immigrant $2,500, making a total of $117,500 a year or $235,000 in two years' time.</p>
   
   <p>Greeks of America, we are throwing $235,000 away every two years to worthless newspapers. Of that $235,000, how much was sent to Greece? How much was used to improve the Greeks of America? How much was used to preserve Hellenism? None!</p>
   <p>The press says that it does much good for the Greeks of America and should be paid accordingly. What has the press done?</p>
   <p>1. Has it cooperated to solve the immigration problem?</p>
   
   <p>2. Has it shown the young people how to become systemized in their occupations?</p>
   <p>3. Has it ever helped the church?</p>
   <p>4. Has it been used to find employment for our countrymen?</p>
   <p>5. Has it ever tried to build a hospital for the ignorant Greeks who cannot speak English?</p>
   <p>6. Has it explained the Greek religion to its readers so the common people can understand it?</p>
   
   <p>7. Has it told the 3,000 Greek merchants how to unite and become more progressive?</p>
   <p>8. Has it said anything about church officials who rob the poor of their last cent by promising them a holy blessing?</p>
   <p>9. In a community of 25,000 Greeks, has it tried to establish a gymnasium, or club rooms, or a school for the younger people?</p>
   <p>10. Has it tried to explain American politics and the duty of voters to the uneducated Greeks?</p>
   
   <p>11. Has it told them what patriotism and duty is?</p>
   <p>12. Has it tried to naturalize them?</p>
   <p>These are only twelve mistakes of the Greek press in America. $235,000 bi-annually is a lot to pay to people who make such costly mistakes. Wake up, countrymen!</p>
