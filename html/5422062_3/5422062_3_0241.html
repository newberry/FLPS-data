   <p>p. 1- Many people say that the reason we Greeks can't get along is because we form too many clubs. This is not true. If we look around us in Chicago we see all nationalities having clubs that exceed ours in membership. In other American cities, the same situation prevails. We Greeks know what is wrong with us but we are ashamed to admit it. We like to be "boss", preferring to live blindly rather than be told what is good for us.</p>
   <p>We Greeks don't realize the advantage of uniting all restaurateurs or confectioners into one gigantic association. Instead of going forward we are going backward and we will soon disappear as leaders of the restaurant world.</p>

   <p>Our present clubs are organized to build churches in our native land. Our native land has done without magnificent churches for many years. We can afford to wait a little longer, but we in America cannot. We are in an American world and must do what Americans do. We are losing profits and opportunities by not organizing.</p>
   <p>The restaurateurs of Chicago are making a feeble attempt at becoming organized. We congratulate them and wish them lots of strength to reach success and prosperity. We are asking the help of all the Greeks of Chicago in this endeavor. Please don't let it fail! It means the salvation of the Greek nationality in American.</p>
