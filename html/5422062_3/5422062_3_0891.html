   <p>p. 3.- With best anticipations for its future activities, the recently organized Hellenic Refugees' Society Homer, gave last Sunday its first afternoon festival at the Stevens Hotel.</p>
   <p>Due to Mr. Kokkinos' endeavors and energies, the affair will remain unforgettable. The program was performed with great success. Music was provided by the Misses M. Bouras, K. Zeras and E. Varzos. Master of ceremonies was Mr. Dem. Poulakis. Among the many speakers who delivered brief speeches, was the Right Rev. Philaretos, bishop of Chicago, who with fatherly suggestions extolled the noble work of the society Homer.</p>
   <p>The above society, besides its other beneficent aims, includes in its program, the elimination of the prevalent idea of Localism, which still exists among the Greeks from ancient times. The discrimination between Greeks from Old Greece, New Greece and refugees, must be entirely wiped out, and we must be recognized as children of one and the same mother, regardless of topical expansion.</p>

   <p>We cordially congratulate the initiators of the idea and the founders of the society and we assure them of our undivided support. Saloniki further suggests to Greeks belonging to the countries of the refugees to become members of the society Homer, and support the society in its aims.</p>
