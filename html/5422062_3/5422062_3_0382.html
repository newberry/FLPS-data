   <p>Last Sunday Mr. Petropoulos gave a mandolin recital in Hull House. Many people attended in order to hear him play.</p>
   <p>Since we were not present at the recital we are not qualified to write a criticism. However we know Mr. Petropoulos to be very unappreciative of other people's support. He feels that people are required to attend his recitals.</p>
   <p>He intends to give recitals in other cities. We recommend that he be treated accordingly [sic].</p>
