   <p>All the picnics of our communities and clubs--this summer--were very successful in forwarding the aims of their respective organizations. Up till last year, picnics were considered an unnecessary social burden to our communities. Today, they are looked forward to with anticipation and joy.</p>
   <p>Among the many Greek clubs in Chicago, there is a Tripolitan organization, Kolokotronis. The Tripolitans got together last Sunday and celebrated as only Tripolitans can celebrate. The Greek spirit was joyfully upheld by those who come from the heart of Moria. The greatest characteristic these people have brought from Greece is their brotherly love.</p>
   <p>And yet, this wasn't just a picnic for enjoyment. The purpose behind it all was to send money to the hospital, Evangelismos, in Tripoli, which is in great need of aid. That is why the Tripolitans treated one another to food and drinks and threw money around like rose-petals. This generosity was more noticeable at this picnic than at any other. Friends tried to outdo each other in getting rid of their money.</p>

   <p>While parties were in progress at the bar and at the tables, the five-piece orchestra, led by Mr. Gretsis, was in full swing. What took place in the pavilion is indescribable! All available space was filled with people eager to get into the Greek dances, throwing dollar after dollar on the floor, remembering, no doubt, the hospital in the old country.</p>
   <p>The Treasury of the organization was overfilled and its purpose was accomplished in a more than satisfactory way.</p>
