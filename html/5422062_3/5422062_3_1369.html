   <p>The Greek Professional Club has invited George Pappas to give a lecture on Jan. 22, Friday, at the Sherman Hotel. There were many arguments as to whether Mr. Pappas should speak in Greek or English. It is inmaterial to him because he has ably mastered both languages. His theme will be Aristotte and Modern Physics. Many Greeks are interested in this subject so a large crowd is expected. The lecture will start promptly at 8 P.M.</p>
