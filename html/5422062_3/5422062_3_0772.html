   <p>The Cretans of Chicago and suburbs, tomorrow, Sunday, will give their annual picnic, at Grandview Gardens, 6401 West Grand Ave. on the estate of Nicholas Stathopoulos.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Cretan Fraternity, which was founded twenty years ago, and today has a membership list of over 300 names is a chapter of the Pan-Cretan Federation in the United States.</p>
   <p>This Pan-Cretan Society has evolved today into a grand Greek organization composed of 5,500 Cretan members. Under its banner 300 Cretans recently, on a good will expedition, visited many Greek cities as well as their native Crete.</p>
   <p>The virtues characteristic of this Pan-Cretan organization are undivided devotion, mutual assistance, love for their mother country, and perpetuation of Greek traditions in conjunction with their Cretan customs.</p>
