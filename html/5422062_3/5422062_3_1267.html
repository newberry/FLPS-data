   <p>Last Sunday afternoon the major networks of the American broadcasting systems carried a half-hour broadcast of the Greek-Day program presented at the Fair. Fortunately the program lasted only half an hour. And it is unfortunate that the broadcast was very unworthy and inferior, to say the least.</p>
   <p>We believe that our silence and our failure to condemn certain so-called leaders have encouraged various upstarts to undertake the organization and supervision of projects they are entirely incapable of directing.</p>
   <p>First of all, this important and virginal presentation of a Greek program on the radio was minus a capable announcer: a person capable of explaining in perfect English that which he sees and hears so that the listening audience can understand.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul Demos, chairman of this affair, deserves to be congratulated upon his success in having a day set aside for our small country. We feel, however, that he chose traitorous associates to help him. He apparently placed too much confidence in people of doubtful ability.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demos' speech was brief and to the point; but in the interest of the many non-Greek listeners he should have given the program into the hands of a trained announcer. No one individual can possibly possess every accomplishment. His weak voice, poor expression, and terrible pronunciation were disheartening, and might easily have provoked ridicule. All those who heard him on the broadcast nearly collapsed in shame. They felt as if they were present at their mother's funeral. For, after all, did it not affect their beloved motherland?</p>
   <p>The prayer of Bishop Callistos was all right. But did those monotonous, unmusical blessings have any place on a radio program? We all know that Reverend Tsourovnakis has a voice like honey, because we hear it often enough in lengthy speeches at St. Andrews. It was entirely unnecessary to include his rather worn-out speech on the air.</p>
   <p>The first inkling we had of the unworthiness of the associates of Demos came with the first bars of the beloved hymn " Ti Ipermahou". The singing was a horrible cacophony of unpreparedness and incapability. The beauty of the Byzantine music was destroyed. It was a dramatic struggle, not a religious hymn. The struggling voices, the wild efforts of the sopranos to outsing all the others, the spasmodic entrances of the altos and basses all added to the confusion. Should the singers be blamed? Of course not. First of all, they were too few in number, and in the second place they had neither proper nor sufficient training. It certainly is a shame, for the American music critics had formed a favorable and entirely different opinion of Byzantine music after the concert of the Byzantine Chorus, which was given last winter.</p>
   <p>The brilliant speech of Mr. Simopoulos compensated, in part, for the rest of the program. Both his Greek and his English made the Greek people happy. They were pleased to have such a man representing them in Washington.</p>
   
   <p>However, that was too good to last. The Greek chorus made its appearance under the direction of the Italian maestro, G.D. Somma (it seems as if our Greek maestros, S. Becatoros and S. Varzos, were not capable). They sang lustily in behalf of the Greek hero Gero Demos--lustily, but not always in the right key. The broadcast ended with this rendition, and if it had not been rended [sic] (torn apart) so often, perhaps the listeners could have heard more of the demotic songs, which were tolerable.</p>
   <p>All those who found it impossible to attend the Greek Day program in person were greatly disappointed with the radio presentation.</p>
