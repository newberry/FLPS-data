   <p>Mr. Andrew Karagiannis and his partners surprised the patrons of art with the erection of the Trianon ballroom, which is an object of admiration to the aristocracy of Chicago. It is considered one of the most luxurious dancing halls in the world. For the realization and completion of this wonderful, artistic and immense ballroom, the enterprising Greek owners spent more than a million dollars.</p>
   <p>The opening of the Trianon was celebrated by a magnificent and spectacular dance, given by Chicago's elite. The success of this dance was astounding. The ball was given for a charitable purpose and yielded a net profit of thirty thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Winter dancing began last Wednesday evening when more than six thousand dancers from all parts of Chicago attended. The orchestra delighted the dancers, who showed their great admiration.</p>
   <p>Chicago may well pride itself on acquiring the most beautiful and magnificent ballroom in the world.</p>
