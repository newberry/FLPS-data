   <p>Among the many affairs of Easter week, we must name the Baltetsian picnic, which took place Sunday afternoon at the New Grand View Gardens. Hundreds of Baltetsians, their friends, and members of other clubs and organizations, helped make it a very successful picnic.</p>
   <p>All afternoon the Greeks danced, sang, ate, and were merry under the shade of the trees. Many lambs were barbecued as is the custom in Greece. A program was arranged for 6 o'clock. There were such notable speakers as N. Salopoulos, M. Tatros, K. Tsapralis, and A. Blachos.</p>
