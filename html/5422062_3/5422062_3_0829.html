   <p>The immortal Hermes sculptured by Praxiteles, and other classic art treasurers, are to grace Chicago's 1933 World's Fair, under plans drawn by Century of Progress officials and local Greek leaders.</p>
   <p>Permission to bring the ancient masterpieces across the Atlantic for Chicago's hundredth birthday anniversary, will be formally requested of the Greek Government this summer by Charles S. Peterson, city treasurer and vice president of the World's Fair, and Dr. Allen D. Albert, assistant to President Rufus C. Dawes of the Fair, it was said. Support of the two largest organizations in this country - Ahepa and Gapa - in this undertaking will be sought.</p>
   <p>Plans were also made for unifying efforts to advance interests of the fair and observe the Greek centenary of Independence this year among the Greek groups.</p>
