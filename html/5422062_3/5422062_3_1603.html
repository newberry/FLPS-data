   <p>We call the attention of our fellow countrymen, especially those that live on the West Side, to the excellent and completely equipped gymnasium in Hull House, which is open to everyone. Recently, quite a number of our young men have registered in physical education classes. The number of Greeks who have registered is increasing from day to day; therefore, when all the present classes are filled, the management of Hull House intends to form a new class.</p>
   <p>The fee is seventy-five cents monthly, or $2.80 for the remaining part of the year; in other words, all those who pay $2.80 in advance will save fifteen cents a month from January to May.</p>
   <p>The young athlete and gymnast, G. M. Velerio, has undertaken to direct and supervise all athletic activities. This young man is well known to the Greek people on the great West Side for his interest in and devotion to all phases <span class="page-break">2</span>of physical education which is offered at Hull House.</p>
