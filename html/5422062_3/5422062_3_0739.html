   <p>One of the most representative of all the series of "National Days" will be that scheduled for this Sunday, when the official "Greek Day" is celebrated. The program is unusual, because it so well combines the religious, civic and cultural achievements of the ancient and modern Greeks, as interpreted by those members of the historically famous race who have become American citizens. Joining with the local Greeks in great numbers will be their relatives and friends from all parts of the nation. The Minister of Greece to the United States, His Excellency, Charalambos Simopoulos, the Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, His Eminence, the Most Reverend Athenagoras, and Gov. Henry Horner of Illinois will all participate in the ceremonies held this afternoon in the Court of the Hall of Science.</p>
   <p>The Greek Choral Society of Chicago, directed by the noted Maestro, Gulielmos Sommas, formerly of Salonica, Greece, and an outstanding conductor <span class="page-break">\2</span>in both Europe and America, will sing the Star Spangled Banner and the Greek National Anthem. Mr. Paul Demos will then introduce Archbishop Athenagoras, who will offer prayers, assisted by the Right Reverend Callistos, Bishop of San Francisco, and fifteen priests.</p>
   <p>An extensive and unique program of songs, orchestra numbers and native dances should particularly interest the general public. The Greek Choral Society and orchestra will present a number of very ancient and famous hymns and odes, which include:</p>
   <p>"Lord Save Your People"- a Byzantine hymn to Almighty God, composed in 628 A.D. by the Emperor Heracleus, upon the recovery of the "Holy Cross" from the Persians; "Sti Leventia Sas," a hymn to the bravery of the mountaineer soldiers; "The First Pythic Ode," composed four hundred years before Christ by Pindor, Greece's most noted poet, and "Hymn to Apollo" - written about 300 B.C. in the Doric tongue, and discovered in manuscript in 1893, and noted for its deep insight into ancient Greek melody.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>One of the most interesting of the dances will be the "Dance of the Zalogon," which originated with the women of Souli, Greece, who followed this dance by leaping into the river rather than become hostages of the Turks during their country's fight for freedom. Maidens and young men who came from the Isle of Crete will also give a Cretan dance.</p>
   <p>In presenting this modern interpretation of the ancient culture of their land, whose annals are the brightest in all the cultures of the world, the Greek-Americans of Chicago have endeavored to show that the continued interest in their nations' past has not been overshadowed by the present "Struggle for existence" which is the common lot of the citizens of Chicago and other large cities.</p>
