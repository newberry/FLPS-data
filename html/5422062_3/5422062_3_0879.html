   <p>Last Sunday the third annual picnic of the Baltetsian-Arachamitiotan Club took place at the Desplaines River Resort.</p>
   <p>This third annual picnic of the Baltestian Club, whose purpose is to aid Baltetsians and Arachamitiotans, was a great success due to the energies of the Board of Directors of whom Nick Palivon is president.</p>
   <p>Many people who came intending to stay only a little while remained the entire evening. Some friends told us of the good time they were having. Mrs. Antonia P. Koffina (Koffman) told us that she looks forward to our picnics every year and hasn't missed one yet, nor does she intend to miss any.</p>
   <p>Among those who honored us with their presence were lawyer Michalopoulos with his wife and their son, George, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nickoletsea, Geo. Drosos, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Kotakis and daughter, Archrev. Dimakopoulos, Christ Boulokos and Sister Katina and the Javaras brothers.</p>
