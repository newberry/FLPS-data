   <p>p. 3.- Gapa's presentation on the stage, last Monday, at the Eighth Street Theater, was enjoyed by all. Had not we in mind the recent impressions from the plays presented by the "National Stage" professional performers, we would have said that the play was done by a professional group.</p>
   <p>We are sure that improvements are to be effected, and short-comings to be corrected, and that in a brief time Gapa's troupe will be able to respond fully to the expectations of Chicago Greeks.</p>
