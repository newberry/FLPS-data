   <p>The benefit dance, given last Sunday at the West End Woman's Club for the purpose of raising money to help the Socrates Greek-American School to continue to function, was a tremendous success. All the available space was filled to overflowing by people who recognized the value of the work done by this Greek School.</p>
   <p>Dancing was continuous, including the popular Greek dances. The entire Board of Trustees of the Holy Trinity Church was active in its endeavor to see that every one had a good time. Despite the fact that many of the younger people present were American born, the spirit of the evening was purely Hellenic.</p>
