   <p>p. 3.- Last month a new weekly was issued and circulated in Chicago. It is the Greek Press, rich in contents, edited and published by P. Javaras and L. George. Two better men for the job could not have been found.</p>
   <p>Both have lived and grown up in the Chicago Greek Community. They know the needs and hopes of the Greek people and feel it their duty to help through the publishing of a newspaper. We know they will carry high the flag of journalism.</p>
   <p>The entire community of Chicago welcomes them and wishes them success.</p>
