   <p>Despite the very bad weather a large group of people gathered in the hall of St. Andrew's to hear the noted Greek professor, Dr. Nicholas D. Cheronis, speak. He came at the invitation of the ladies' society of that parish, and his topic was "Our Synthetic Civilization". He brilliantly analyzed the progress of civilization from man's earliest days up to the present. He enthralled his audience with his magnificent oratorical power.</p>
   <p>He also gave predictions, based on his opinion, of what will happen to the future of Hellenism in America. This was especially interesting to his Greek audience. After the lecture the audience held a round table discussion based upon the latter part of Mr. Cheronis' lecture.</p>
