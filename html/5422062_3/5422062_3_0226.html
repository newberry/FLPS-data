   <p>p. 1.- The twelve Greek bakers of our city have taken our advice and will meet this week to lay the foundation for a corporation. If the Greeks will cooperate with one another and last a year, we will call the corporation a success. Otherwise it will go the way of other Greek enterprises.</p>
   <p>We don't want to repeat everything we have written previously. The bakers are grown men and should be able to make their own future. Whether they succeed or fail rests with them and them alone.</p>
   <p>Our only suggestion is that you bakers should take American business methods as an example to follow. If you want your corporation to succeed, you must use the same means that Americans use. We are suggesting nothing impossible. It can and should be done.</p>
