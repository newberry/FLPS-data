   <p>p.-3-....Mr. De Parry, well known in our Greek colony, will give a concert in cooperation with other artists on Sunday, April 22, 1923, in Cohan's Gran Opera House.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petropoulos is known throughout America, for he has sung in many great theatres. He uses the name De Parry in order not to be confused with other Greek artists of the same name.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petropoulos has with noble generosity offered his services and sung without compensation in all our great nationalistic and philanthropic coventions, in particular in the Auditorium on the occasion of the address there delivered by Patriarch Meletios of Constantinople .</p>
   <p>We have no doubt that the Greek colony will support this eminent and popular artist.</p>
