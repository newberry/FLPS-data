   <p>Mr. J. Teles, one of our most industrious Greek Chicagoans has opened the Genese Candy Co.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all Greek candy and confectionery dealers to support this company by giving it their orders, not only because its candy is of superior quality, but also because it is a Greek concern.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry Pithos is the Greek representative of the company.</p>
