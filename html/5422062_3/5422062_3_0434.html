   <p>p. 2.- In advancing, an individual, a community, a nation, must go through certain stages. These stages are from the materialistic to the spiritual and from the practical to the ideal. For example, first you build a house, then you furnish it. First you plant an apple tree, then you think of roses. First you plant a grape vine, then you train them to cover the bare walls. After you furnish the essential neccessities of a room, you get books, pictures, and flowers to complete it.</p>
   <p>What happens in an individual's life happens also in a nation's. When the first Greeks in America built a church, they made it just a place of worship. As years passed by they enlarged the church, made it more beautiful and improved it. The same happened with the schools. The next step should be the theaters.</p>
   <p>The three performances given by Mr. Jacobides show that the Chicago Greeks are thirsting for the theater. Yet we cannot seem to get started towards making it a regular phase of our winter activities. Mr. S. Melas <span class="page-break">\2</span>has told me that his aim is to settle in some theater in America and give regular performances starring Mrs. Kibelis or Mrs. Kotopoulos. If Chicago had its own theater, wouldn't it be a good idea? Or perhaps we haven't the financial means?</p>
   <p>There isn't a single doubt but that the Greeks of Chicago will heartily endorse a good Greek play. When Chicago says good, it doesn't mean light, amateurish, comedies and operetta, nor does it mean these plays to which a man is ashamed to take his mother, wife, or sister. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we Greeks of America have not become as civilized as the Athenians who take their mistresses to such plays.</p>
   <p>It is time for somebody to start a theatrical movement here. Clubs, organizations, and newspapers have time and opportunities to seriously discuss this question. Mr. A. Papanickolopoulos is going to give a lecture on this subject before the Greek Professional Club of Chicago. Let us all do our best to promote the Greek theatricals!</p>
