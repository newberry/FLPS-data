   <p>The directors of Saint Basil Church, instead of giving an outdoor picnic organized a magnificent boat excursion to Milwaukee, last Sunday. The organization and its guests engaged themselves thoroughly as one grand family-gathering during the hours they were on the boat. The excursion started at 10 A.M. During the entire day except when they docked at Milwaukee, the folks enjoyed the cooling breezes of Lake Michigan, laughing, singing and dancing to their hearts content.</p>
   <p>Everyone was more than satisfied with this trip and heartily congratulated their hosts on the splendid affair.</p>
