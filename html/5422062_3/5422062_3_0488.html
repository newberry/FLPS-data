   <p>Vassos Kanellos, premier dramatic dancer of Greece, and his wife, Mme. Tanagra Kanellos, arrived, here last week from the Greek Theatre of the University of California, and presented in Chicago three periods of Hellenic Art. The Hellenic festival took place at the Goodman Theatre, Art Institute.They presented the arts of ancient Greece; its drama, dance, and music, after which, they left for Athens to appear in the Theater of Dionysos; the first moderns to do so.</p>
   <p>The ancient Greek modes of music, which are considered so highbrow amongst modern musicians, are living joyously among the people of Greece today. Greek drama is music; its music is drama; it is one. It looses its music and metrics when translated into other languages. It would be a translation of spirit if Greek drama, dance, and music was performed in other language.</p>
   <p>Tanagra Kanellos, the wife of the dramatist, is an American girl, born in Manitowac, Wisconsin, Charlotte Markham. She was a painter, and was for six years associated with the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Greek music," she said, "and the American music bears evidence that the Greek and Americans love the wide open spaces; sunshine and nature."</p>
   <p>The Greek dancers moves to the rhythm of poetry. In ancient Greece the poet always wrote his poems to be danced or sung.</p>
   <p>The festivals were very successful and the Greeks of Chicago will remember them for years to come.</p>
