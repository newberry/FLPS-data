   <p>Under the auspices of the students' club Plato, the first English lecture of this organization was given last Sunday night.</p>
   <p>Doctor K. Theodore, well-known member of the community, was the lecturer, and for three hours he held the attention of his audience. He discussed hygiene and its relation to our health.</p>
   <p>The lecture was enjoyed to such an extent that it was decided to have a lecture every Sunday for the benefit of the Greek community. These lectures would be given by the various scholars and professionals of the group. It should be noted, however, that in order to have a mental rebirth of our people, the co-operation of not only the clubs and schools is needed, but the church must also lend its support.</p>
   <p>Let us all go forward.</p>
