   <p>While negotiations are still in progress (though from all indications the accomplishment of their object is near at hand) to unify the Chicago Greek societies and fraternities, the Phoenix Greek Society is striving to obtain some share of the honors and the credit which have been accorded to the Panhellenic Society, hitherto regarded as first in philanthropic and patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>After the recent installation of its new officers Phoenix resolved that, since the Society has among its members many spirited and talented young Greeks, a dramatic performance should be given with the object of raising money for the national defense fund of Greece. The drama "Golpho" is to be played in the West Side Auditorium at a future date; announcement will be made through the press.</p>
   <p>This Society, so avid of honors, has become the talk of the community for its generous contributions to local and racial affairs and for its genuinely philanthropic activities, wearing as its motto not "epea akra-anta" (words of no effect) but "am epos am ergon" (with the word). The retiring officers and their successors are to be congratulated on their unselfish interest in the Society's activities. And all the members of the Society are to be commended, for they are the source of the power and the energy of the fraternity which works these wonders.</p>
