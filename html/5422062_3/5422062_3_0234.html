   <p>p. 1.- The American unions are the most powerful in the entire world. They are all well off and everyone is satisfied because they cooperate with one another. When a Greek opens a store he does it to take business away from another Greek or else the second Greek opens one to take it away from the first Greek. How do the Greeks expect to progress by doing business this way? They will never get anywhere at the rate they are going. The American firms are progressing because they are united and powerful. They all reap the same profits instead of ruining one another's chances. Why can't the Greeks profit by the example of the Americans? When they are busy quarreling with one another, how can they escape being crushed by American businessmen who are powerfully united? The Greeks must wake up to the fact that "in union there is strength".</p>
