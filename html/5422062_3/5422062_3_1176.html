   <p>All the Greeks of America must admit that the Greek has gone far in journalism in America, because there are many Greek newspapers which are published in nearly every great city in the United States. But, to these journalists, to these moralists of society, whose experience and work have influenced every true, every noble sentiment, every ideal which purports to benefit our Fatherland, we owe so much. These servants of society are sacrificing everything on our country's altar. However, there are a few who have intruded in the field under the pretext of being willing to submit to public criticism and who hope that through their organs a suitable occasion may arise whereby old hatreds and passions can be fanned into a destructive social fire. They thus hope to create a chaotic condition by dividing our patriotic Greek citizens.</p>
   <p>In these efforts of theirs they have spared no one; they have stigmatized all; <span class="page-break">2</span>they have blackened the reputation of upstanding citizens; they have attacked our simple, hard-working people; they have revealed disgraceful family scandals; and have not forgotten to injure the good name of our worthy leaders and excellent organizations. In general, they have debased their journalistic pen, which properly should be used rather to cover up and silence these open wounds and social evils.</p>
   <p>The object of true journalism is an ideal one. Therefore, the one that uses the pen does not belong to himself, but to society. The masses of the people expect the editor, the publisher, the writer, and reporter to teach, counsel, and indicate how evils among us can be remedied. The journalist is the man who has been appointed by the public to judge and criticize the wrongs and injustices in our social, economic, and political life. He is another Lygeus, [Translator's note: A Greek mythological character,] who with his unlimited sets of eyes seeks to penetrate into and comprehend the inscrutable mysteries of the universe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The journalist, the newspaper man, can have friends, but not allies. A journalist must not have any hatreds toward any one, because, as we said, his body and soul belong to the public, whose thoughts and opinions he must reflect.</p>
   <p>But, when the members of the press subject themselves to other necessities and other principles, then they must not be called journalists; they must not bear this title, which is sacred and which they desecrate by bad example and unbecoming conduct.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the Greek press of America and particularly of Chicago, with a few exceptions, has not escaped the fate and disrepute to which the above newspapers have fallen. The press of Chicago is following, in many cases, in the footsteps of other newspapers which have now disappeared for reasons easily understood. Undoubtedly, there is no more deadly means of destroying our national interests than a weak, corrupt, and inefficient newspaper. The entire Greek press of America must see that while it spends its time and energies in civil and civic <span class="page-break">4</span>strife and war nothing beneficial can result either for ourselves or for our general national Greek interests.</p>
   <p>In every democratic state, and even in a monarchy, the press is indeed one of the most important forces of safety and security. A British sociologist said the following about the press:</p>
   <p>"Just as the lever has become the instrument or device with which we lift heavy weights, so, the press has become the most valuable instrument for a society that wants progress and the advancement of its highest interests. All depends upon it. The people, the government, the kingdom are subservient to it in many respects. For these reasons the journalist, the publisher, must be wise, prudent, efficient, and endowed with superior principles and character."</p>
   <p>The Greek press of America, and especially the Greek press of Chicago, with a very few exceptions of course, is likened to those women, who, after doing their <span class="page-break">5</span>domestic work and duties, sit around in a circle at noontime commenting on and gossiping about their neighbors. No one can fail to liken the Greek press to these pitiful women, for, instead of attempting to do and write about something good and worthwhile, it resorts to insults and sycophantic attacks against its colleagues. Instead of this, our press throughout America should strive to help and support its colleagues, both Greek and American. Instead of digressing from its rightful duty, it should attend to its high calling, which is the enlightenment and education of the Greek people in the United States. And we all know that our people, not only in Chicago, but in all the states of the union are in sore need of much and speedy education and guidance. For reasons independent of its will, which we shall not discuss here, our people have not been able to receive the necessary and proper instruction and training in the past, in order to carry on its many social, economic, political, religious, and intellectual activities effectively and successfully.</p>
   <p>The Greek press of Chicago, specifically, has a great mission to perform. It <span class="page-break">6</span>really must carry a heavy burden and inescapable responsibility. In order to do this, it must receive and offer support to other newspapers, so that, it will be enabled to work in harmony and with an eager patriotic spirit for the fulfillment of its noble purpose--the education of all the classes of our people in the state of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of foreign-language newspapers are being published in the United States, all of which are well represented in this metropolis; however, in not one of them will the reader find any hint or abusive remark directed against another colleague, much less against the persons who publish the newspaper. Although most of these foreign-language publications believe in various political principles and forms and practices in government and in life in general, they respect and appreciate each other and the countries from which they come. That is one of the main reasons why these news organs have become rich and powerful political, social, and cultural forces in the American community. That is why the rest of the foreign-language press is making such rapid strides forward and <span class="page-break">7</span>these are the results of co-operation with and consideration for the rights of other newspapers.</p>
   <p>Now, read the Greek newspapers and what will you see? Insults, abusive language, revolting and disgusting remarks, before which even the lowliest social derelict is offended.</p>
   <p>How then, can we expect the average Greeks of America to improve themselves, when we, the supposed leaders of public opinion, lack proper rearing and education? How can we demand that the Greek people achieve great things, while by our conduct and attitude we prevent it? So, if the evils which are afflicting us are to be remedied, we must apply the remedy at the top; we must start at the top, with our leaders, and not from the bottom with the great masses of the people. It is necessary that we realize that we must improve our ways and accept many reforms. Afterwards, as a natural consequence, our people will be enlightened and educated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Probably these remarks will shock some of our colleagues in Chicago and in America generally. Very probably we shall make quite a few enemies among them. We do not worry about this; it is sufficient that we have the Greek people on our side; this is the healthiest and strongest social factor of our community--that we know how to reward the good and punish the evil.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we wish to make a final appeal to our esteemed colleagues and competitors in Chicago. They are hereby informed if they do not know it, that in various ways they are working against the best interests of the Greeks of America. They are thus lowered in the estimation of the people, who have no regard or respect whatever for them. It is commonly admitted that their thoughtless and foolish actions, their shallow and misdirected policies and principles have done great harm to the progress and prosperity of our fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that in the end the spirit of peace, love, harmony, and unity will prevail among us, in order that we may thus win the favor and support of the <span class="page-break">9</span>people. In this way we will benefit our poor, struggling homeland with all our might while it is going through one of the most critical periods in its history.</p>
