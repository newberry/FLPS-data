   <p>p. 5 The University of Chicago recently bought from a Greek, Michael Briskos, who resides here, a manuscript gospel of the 10th Century. It is of great value, and the oldest gospel manuscript the University possesses.</p>
   <p>The gospel is regulated for liturgies of the church and contains psalms marked with red musical characters. It is written upon parchment with 145 pages of big size, and the titles are written in golden letters. The cover and some pages are missing, nevertheless it has tremendous value and is a masterpiece of Byzantine calligraphy.</p>
   <p>According to Michael Briskos, the gospel was in a church in Argos. During the revolution of 1821 the infidel Turks despoiled the churches and removed the cover of the gospel which was of gold. Briskos' great-grand-father took the manuscript which has remained in the family ever since.</p>
