   <p>P.2--Messrs. A. Kostakos, L. Vasilakos, and M. Goutos, operating three big dairies in Chicago, believe in the adage, "In union there is strength," and they have united their enterprises in one.</p>
   <p>What a wonderful thing it would be if Greek individual enterprises were united under one roof! Our fellow-Greeks above mentioned are to be congratulated, and we hope that their example will be followed by others.</p>
