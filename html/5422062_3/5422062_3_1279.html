   <p>p. 2.- Since last Monday, our well-known Greek director of the Balaban and Katz theater's orchestra, Leon Andrian, (Leonidas A. Methenitis) can be heard with his fifteen players over Radio Station WIBO.</p>
   <p>From two to four in the afternoon and six to ten in the evenings, his musical programs are presented. We are especially proud of Mr. Methenitis because at the age of eleven he played in the Chicago Theater orchestra. He is now a director and only nineteen years old.</p>
