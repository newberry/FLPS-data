   <p>Words cannot describe the performance of "Esme H Tourkopoula" (Esme the Turkish Girl), which was given last Sunday evening at the Eighth Street Theater. The 1100 spectators sat in rapt attention, through the entire four acts of the play and were sorry to see it end.</p>
   <p>The actors were chosen from the Greek Olympic Athletic Club and the actresses from the St. Barbara Club. Of all the dances, theatricals, parties, and affairs given this winter, Esme seemed to be the most successful. It was the first time most of the players appeared behind footlights yet they acted their parts like troupers. Miss I. G. Skoutela was Esme, P. A. Malapis, President of the Olympic Club, was Drosos, and K. Oikonomos was Mbirkos. These were the three principal characters.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press congratulates the president of St. Barbara Club, Mrs. M. Nikolaropoulos, and the president of the Greek Olympic Club, Mr. P. Malapanis, for giving <span class="page-break">2</span>us such a wonderful performance.</p>
