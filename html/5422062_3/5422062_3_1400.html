   <p>p. 4.- Dr. Lambros Diamesis, President of the Society of Stereoladiton gave a very successful lecture at the Sherman Hotel, last Friday evening. The lecture hall was filled by participating members of the Brotherhood, and many other friends who respect Dr. Diamesis' learning.</p>
   <p>He kept the audience interested for more than two hours with the theme, "Pre-historic Man". The lecture was accompanied by photographic plates, and in his next lecture, Dr. Diamesis will speak on "Man's Arrival on Earth." The Brotherhood of Stereoladiton should be congratulated for sponsoring educational lectures such as these. There will be many more.</p>
