   <p>p. 1.- We have something to say to the Greeks in this issue concerning the market. But first we will begin with an old, old, story:</p>
   <p>A father wanted to impress his seven sons with the need of cooperation among them. He asked them to bring seven rods, which they did. He tied them together and asked his sons to break the rods. Of course the boys couldn't do this. He then gave the boys one rod apiece and soon all seven were broken.</p>
   <p>We are printing this in our columns as an example to the Greeks in the market business.</p>
   <p>There are many Greeks in this type of work, but they are ruining their own and everybody else's business by refusing to cooperate with one another. The Greeks could do much in this line if they wished.</p>
   
   <p>It is in their power to build up one of the biggest trades in Chicago if they would go about it in the right way. Among the most prominent men at the market are John Procos, John Rifakis and James Giannakopoulos. They should all get together, talk things over and cooperate with one another. If they do this, no one will be able to break them.</p>
