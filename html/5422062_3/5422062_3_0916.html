   <p>p. 1- Yesterday's activities in our community are memorable. It was not only the Pan-Hellenic awakening which drew so many thousands to the Coliseum to express their patriotic sentiments. There were secondary events which took place and were equally important and vital, and if it had not been for the magnitude of the protest mass-meeting at the Coliseum which obscured them, they would have attracted the interest of the whole community.</p>
   <p>In the first place there were the graduation exercise of Socrates School of the West Side, unfortunately though not intentionally appointed for the same day on which our national protest meeting was held. About 1,000 persons attended the exercises and witnessed the progress made by our West Side children.</p>
   <p>Another noteworthy event which took place yesterday was the election of officers of the Liberal Club. Four hundred votes were cast. Mr. Paul Demos was elected president and Mr. Aristotle Damianos, vice-president.</p>
