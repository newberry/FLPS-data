   <p>Last Sunday, Kostas Kairofilas gave a lecture at Hull House. It was attended by many notables of the community and also by Mr. Drakopoulos, secretary of the Greek Consulate in Washington.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kairofilas spoke about the political situation in Greece; and he brought to light the many intrigues and barriers put in the way of Venizelos in connection with the Smyrna situation. Venizelos, like Ulysses, was able to conquer all obstacles by his diplomatic abilities. The audience was very enthusiastic about the speech of Mr. Kairofilas.</p>
   <p>After him, Mr. C. Palaeologos spoke, saying that it was the duty of all the Greeks to work together to insure the success of this gigantic national struggle under the leadership of Venizelos. His speech was inspiring and received great appause.</p>
