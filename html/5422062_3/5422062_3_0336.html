   <p>The Greek Press is very happy to announce to its thousands of readers that as a result of the courage of Mr. John Voumrakis, the city of Chicago will have a new opera company, The Peoples Opera Company. As soon as the company was formed the management hurried to secure the finest talent available for the direction and presentation of operas.</p>
   <p>They were fortunate in acquiring the great Jacques Samossoud to direct the orchestra, and John Charles Thomas and other well-known artists to sing the operatic roles. This new opera company makes its first appearance next Saturday night, February 10 in the Chicago Stadium. The popular prices will make it possible for all the Greeks to satisfy their hunger for good music sung by fine artists. The prices are from 40 cents to $1.50, so that everyone can easily attend.</p>
   <p>We urge the Greeks especially to attend the performances of this group because <span class="page-break">\2</span>it is a Greek enterprise and its success will be a tribute to the Greek name.</p>
   <p>The first presentation will be "Cavalleria Rusticana" and "Pagliacci," and internationally known artists will perform.</p>
