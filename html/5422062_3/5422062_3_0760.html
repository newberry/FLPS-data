   <p>p. 5. - Our Greek boys and girls are interested in keeping alive the nationality and ideals of our forefathers. The various affairs they give show that they are clinging to the habits and customs handed down to them. We need not fear that the Greek language is dying in Chicago. As long as our young people are proud to speak it and willing to learn it, there is no danger of losing our mother tongue.</p>

   <p>The Ahepans are always working with this purpose in mind, and they have handed their enthusiasm down to the Sons of Pericles.</p>
   <p>And so, the Lord Byron chapter of the Sons is arranging for a group of the young talented Greek boys and girls to give a theatrical performance on Sunday, March 13, at the 8th Street Theatre.</p>
   <p>The play is titled "Agapitikos Tis Voskopoulas" (The Shepherdess Lover). The entire Greek community of Chicago should attend this inspiring performance to show that we appreciate what the Greek boys and girls are doing.</p>
   <p>The Lord Byron chapter always produces successful affairs and this one will be no exception, we are sure.</p>
