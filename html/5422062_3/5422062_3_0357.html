   <p>p. 5.- Of the young Greek generation there are many who are doing things which bring pride to the Greeks. One of these is Edward Varzos, son of Nick Varzos, the music master. For over a month, Edward has been leading the orchestra at the Uptown Village. Every evening at 11:00 he can be heard over radio station WMAQ.</p>
   <p>This progress is an honor to him, to his musician father who gave his sons a musical education, and to all Greek people who look with pride upon such a young man who has made his name a bright light among the Americans.</p>
