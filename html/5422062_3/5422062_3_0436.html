   <p>An important consideration in preserving our Hellenism in America is the Greek theater. The church, the school, and the various organizations are the most important agencies. The Greek theatre adds the trimming, or final touch to the whole.</p>
   <p>As in the classical period of Greece, the theatre made a necessary contribution to the culture of the people, so it does today, in the case of other nations. The Jewish people who have succeeded to a greater degree than any other nation in preserving their social identity, owe much of their success to the theater which has made great progress among them. The performances they give will go down in history. Many of their plays are world-famous.</p>
   <p>We, the Greeks, who gave birth to the theater, should be the leaders, in the theatrical movement, not trailers behind. Merely because everybody else lags behind. Why don't Greeks wake up?</p>
