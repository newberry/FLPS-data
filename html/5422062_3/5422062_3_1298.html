   <p>The Chicago Daily News of Saturday, October 22, will devote the entire second page of the Rotogravure Section, Radio Photologue, to"Greece, Old and New," by Brainerd P. Salmon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Salmon, on Saturday evening at eight o'clock, over station W.M.A.Q., will discuss the growth of the Greek Republic. He will refer especially to the Centennial Anniversary of the Battle of Nauarino, which brought to a victorious close Greece's long struggle for independence against the Turks. It was on October 20, 1827, that the Turkish and Egyptian navies of eighty-nine ships were annihilated by the British, Greek, French and Russian Flotilla of twenty-four war craft commanded by the British Admiral, Sir Edward Codrington.</p>
   <p>Mr. Salmon, who is head of the Hellenic information bureau, of Athens and Washington, D. C., is an authority on Greek affairs, and spent the last twelve months in travel through Greece and the Balkans. Consul General George De Pasta will introduce Mr. Salmon and extend greetings to fifty thousand Greeks in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We wish to advise those of our readers who have radios to buy Saturday's Daily News, turn to the Radio Photologue on the second page of the Rotogravure Section, and place this page before them during Mr. Salmon's talk.</p>
