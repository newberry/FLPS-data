   <p>P.3--Just because our ice-cream is the best in the market, and our service is the most excellent, our business is increasing so much that we have been compelled to enlarge our factory and our stables. Try our ice-cream once, and your customers will verify our statement. We handle nothing but the best.</p>
   <p>Our delivery service to any part of the city can not be beaten. In our stables, which were recently enlarged, we have forty wagons and one hundred twenty-five horses. In the summer season we never close. Delivery day and night. Special orders are shipped to any part of the country.</p>
