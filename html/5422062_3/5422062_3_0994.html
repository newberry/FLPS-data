   <p>Sepulchers of Greek Newspapers in Chicago and America.</p>
   <p>Why Greek Newspapers of Chicago and the rest of the country are dying away, by Mr. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star: There are two types of Greek press, the Greek press of dignity and integrity, and the Greek press of parasites belonging to the classification Racketeers. Racketeers of the Greek press fall continually, and will fall because they have extortion as their aim. A newspaper man mustpossess politeness and dignity in order to become respectable, in his writings, to produce fruit. He must be an example for others. The newspaper man must publish facts worthy for the public to know. If such an attitude is not maintained by a newspaper, such a paper loses ground and sooner or later its requiem would be heard.</p>
   <p>Some of the Greek newspapers of America that already have died are as follows: Greece, Athena, Flag, Thermopylai New Life, Panhellinios, Phoenix, Sparta, Metanastis, Nomotagis, Patris, National Post, New World, Arcadia, Transoceanic, Acropolis, Lowell, Pacific, Loxias Evzonos, Averof, Guard, Greek Daily Saloniki, and Progress.</p>
