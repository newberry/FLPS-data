   <p>Dear Sir: We hereby beg to call your attention to the following new and original features adopted by our paper.</p>
   <p>First: We arrange all of the advertisements in such a way as to occupy both sides of almost every page; the middle columns of which are reserved for reading matter only, so that the reader in turning to any page will not fail to see the advertisements.</p>
   <p>Second: We thought to establish the "Page of Presentation" on the fourth page of our paper. There we present to our readers the names of the new advertisers, with the Editor's comments and recommendations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Third: We will leave a blank space when a new advertisement is to appear, with an announcement that the space has been reserved for the advertisement now being listed on the "Presentation Page".</p>
   <p>These three features make this paper an ideal and effective advertising medium; because of its selected reading matter, which attracts the attention of the readers. We therefore take the liberty of soliciting your advertisement, and offer you our facilities for our mutual benefit.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki</p>
   <p>Editor, C. Salopoulos</p>
