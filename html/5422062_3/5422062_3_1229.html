   <p>The history of the Greek race is the history of its various colonies, which were formed outside of Greece, with the progressiveness and vitality of the race. The three thousand year perpetuation of the Greek race, is mostly attributed to the new blood of the colonies, which was transfused to the Mother Country when she was at the portals of death. When the Mother Country bent her proud head to barbarian invasion most of her sons who had scattered themselves all over the world came back, transfused with new blood, and saved her life. But never before was Greece able to have better blood transfused for her perpetuation, than she has today, from the new Greek race of America. This new race, in the near future, will surprise the wrinkled face of Greece and the rest of the Greeks all over the globe.</p>
   <p>For that reason, therefore, we must not be fettered and bothered by those old heads of over yonder, so we can continue our progress in our new American way, in which we breathe and live.</p>
   <p>Today, with great delight, we dedicate to the Greeks of America and especially to the young generation, the Parnasos, and we sincerely desire and hope for the continuation of the progress of our new generation in forming and developing the new Greek race of America. Polyvios Koryllos, President of the publishing committee.</p>
