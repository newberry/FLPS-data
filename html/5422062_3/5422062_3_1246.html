   <p>p. 4- Last Sunday Sanida, a Greek satirical paper, began publication in Chicago, and from what we read in its first issue we judge that it is going to be a sensation.</p>
   <p>In sarcastic and blistering phrases Sanida exposes the known but unpublished acts and machinations of some of the so-called high-hat members of our community. If you wish to enjoy a good hearty laugh, read this new satirical paper.</p>
   <p>The Star welcomes Sanida.</p>
