   <p>Last Thursday, January 31, the annual exhibition of painting and sculpture opened at the Chicago Art Institute. For the first time in the city's history, two Greek artists of Chicago have been invited to exhibit their work. They are the refined and truly Hellenic Nina Perdikes, and the well-known artist, Constantine Pougialis.</p>
   <p>Miss Perdikes' easel is number 151, in room G-60. Her production is a still life of exceptional beauty and charm.</p>
   <p>In room G-57 is the painting by Mr. Pougialis. It is the picture of a young girl in tragic despair, like a butterfly which has been burned by the fire which it courted. This painting was so well liked for its strong appeal that the judges awarded it the Bromer Prize of three hundred dollars.</p>
