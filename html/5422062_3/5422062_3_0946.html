   <p>"Everyone must give account of himself to God",</p>
   <p>But to which God, the believer does not say.</p>
   <p>Though to ask him with an irreverent nod,</p>
   <p>Is as if to seek to lead his soul astray;</p>
   <p>Yet so many Gods have been made out of clod,</p>
   <p>By faithful who prostrate themselves to pray,</p>
   <p>That to name them all, in legend, fable and song,</p>
   <p>Is to name each star in the heavenly throng.</p>
   <p>Now every race has its own pious prayer,</p>
   <p>And every nation its own holy shrine;</p>
   <p>The Greeks had installed many a deity as fair,</p>
   <p>As the dew of the morn on the hue of the brine;</p>
   <p>They sculptured their Gods with genuine care,</p>
   <p>And they feasted them on ambrosia and wine,</p>
