   <p>The first annual dance of the American Hellenic World which, as we have already announced, will take place at the new Aragon ballroom, Monday evening, September 20th, is becoming, if we are to trust daily reports that reach our office, the talk of the town. This entertainment will certainly mark a day of the greatest enjoyment that ever was offered to the Hellenic people of Chicago, and its success will be far the greater because the affair is being supported by practically all the local Hellenic organizations. The program will be so arranged that it will certainly surpass the expectations of the public. Of course, this thing is made possible largely because of the kind and enthusiastic cooperation of the three young ladies' society of our community.</p>
