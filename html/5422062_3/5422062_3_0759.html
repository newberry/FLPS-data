   <p>The Women's Club of Koimiseos Tis Theotokou held a beautiful and artistic May festival two weeks ago. It was a marked success.</p>
   <p>The program, which began at 4 P. M., consisted of recitations, dialogues, and musical selections. The outstanding singer was Miss Eugenia Triantafillou, who sang well-known operatic arias. A famous ballet artist, known far and wide, enthralled the audience with his art. This artist was, of course, Nicholas Tsoukalas.</p>
   <p>The large hall in Columbus Park was filled to capacity. The artistic program overwhelmed the entire audience with delight. After the final number, cakes and sandwiches were served on the balcony. Later on, dance music was furnished by Mr. Varzos' orchestra, and everyone danced a perfect evening to a close.</p>
