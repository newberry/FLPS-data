   <p>p. 6.- The Woodlawn, Ahepa baseball team, has finished the crucial League Schedule of 1936 in successful style with thirteen games won and four lost. They defeated the Mates team on Labor Day, score 8 to 7. Going into the ninth inning the Ahepa team was losing 7 to 4 but the test of Grecian youth proved aggressive and courageous and they just couldn't be stopped. Sotos walked after Mistos had singled, then successive hits by Woods, Conteas and Nichols brought three runs across and tied the score. The game continued until the 11th inning when Ahepa scored the winning tally. Thanos singled, stole second and third, and scored on Sotos'long hit which ordinarily would have been recorded as a triple.</p>
   <p>The Ahepa team will engage the strong St. Adrian team in the battle for the Amateur Baseball Championship of the City of Chicago this Sunday, September 13th.</p>
