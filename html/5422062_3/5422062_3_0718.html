   <p>The opening of the Greek Pavilion at the World's Fair, last Sunday was imposing in every respect. Thousands of Greeks gathered in the court in front of the building to share in the general pride and rejoicing of their people and their country's achievement. They sat for two and a half hours, under a blue sky which resembled the blue of the Grecian sky, and lived over again the past achievements of their nation.</p>
   <p>The Hellenism of Chicago came in response to an inner voice.</p>
   <p>John Mantas is one of those who carry the creative fire within their breast. He is a person of benefit and value to his people and his community. In this particular circumstance he showed himself to be superior to all the other <span class="page-break">2</span>influential and patriotic Greeks of Chicago--in fact, even to the Greek Government itself. If the work done by John Mantas does not attain great heights, it is not because of any neglect, or inefficiency on his part. It is due to the shortness of time and to the well-known indolence of the Greek officials and exporters in making arrangements for moral support and material aid. So far, the first has been accomplished; but the latter is sadly lacking.</p>
   <p>We know that Greece recently spent millions of dollars in order to display properly the works of Greek artists at the Exhibition of Vienna. We do not doubt that it was money well spent, since Greece has first-class artists, worthy of the fine support given to them by the Government. However, how much more beneficial it would have been, had the Greek Government been as generous to the Greek Pavilion of the Chicago Fair! Even if millions of dollars were to be spent for advertising at some other time or place, Greece could never get so much space and so many people to discover and buy Greek products. We do not know just how much money the American public will spend at the Greek <span class="page-break">3</span>Exhibit. That is of secondary importance. We are certain that which is of primary importance will occur: the American people will discover and appreciate the many Greek products, of which so far they have not been cognizant. They will see many things in the way of Greek art and sculpture which have been admired and talked about for centuries. People will be interested in the Greek exhibits because nine tenths of them have a tremendous interest in the ancient glory of Greece.</p>
   <p>John Mantas, by his generous gesture, gave the Greek Government a chance to arouse in thousands of American people a desire for a trip through Greece. Despite the attractiveness and the interesting features of the Greek exhibits, the true glory and art of Greece has not been sent to the Fair. The patriotism and great-heartedness of John Mantas make him indifferent to laurels and words of praise. He did that which he considered his duty. The Government ought to support his endeavors, and the Greek community of Chicago should also give him its whole-hearted support, so that he may have the courage to continue.</p>
