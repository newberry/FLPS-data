   <p>If the degree of civilization is judged by the number of books bought by a nation, the edition of the Encyclopedia Lexicon, by the Elefteroudaki publishing house, would place Greece in the first position.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Tsiritas, salesman representative of the Lexicon to Greeks in America, is visiting our offices with a copy of this unusual work. Everyone is astounded at the completeness of material to be found in this volume. You can be rest assured, if you buy this edition, you will never regret it.</p>
