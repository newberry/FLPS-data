   <p>The musical talent of George Kambas is so highly respected by his teachers and colleagues that Mr. Hoffman, head of the Hoffman Preparatory School, sent us the letter published below. It refers to the performance by Mr. Kambas at the Columbus Day celebration. Mr. Kambas is now on the teaching staff of the Metropolitan Conservatory of Music .....</p>
   <p>"On Columbus Day, at an artistic performance given by the Hoffman School, we had the opportunity of hearing Mr. Kambas perform on the violin. His playing is unforgettable. He aroused the emotions of his listeners as only a fine artist could. The audience sat as if hypnotized while the strains of his violin filled the hall with exquisite sound.</p>
   <p>"The school wishes publicly to congratulate Mr. Kambas, and is proud of having had him as a pupil. He is a true artist and musician, one who has devoted his whole life to music.</p>
