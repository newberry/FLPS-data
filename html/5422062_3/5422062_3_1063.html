   <p>p.3-.....On last Monday a new Greek daily newspaper began its career under the title Tachydromos (Post). This is the fifth Greek daily to be established in this country. The editor of the Post is our dear friend George Halepas.</p>
   <p>The Post has as a correspondent in Athens, the distinguished politician and journalist Eustratios Kouloumbakes. We wish for the Post the best of luck, which it will surely have since its purpose is to fight for the common good, the right, and social purity.</p>
