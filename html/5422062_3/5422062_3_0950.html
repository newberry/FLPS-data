   <p>The modern Greek language is a dialect of the ancient Greeks, and the literary language of today is a continuation of the main literary dialect of ancient Greece, the Attic, as modified by passing through the Byzantine period. The modern Vernacular is sometimes called Romaic. At the present time there is a tendency among the Greek authors to return more closely to the ancient form of the language.</p>
