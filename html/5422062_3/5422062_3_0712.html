   <p>From information received, big progress is being made in Greece, and it is officially affirmed that Greece, alone, among nations of Central Europe, is economically sound, yet her exhibit in the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago is so poor that every Greek, who visits the so called Greek pavilion, feels as if Greece has made no progress agriculturally or industrially.</p>
   <p>The fault lies wholly with the Greek government which, while having decided to participate, officially, in the Exposition did not take the necessary steps to have exhibits sent that would represent the progress of Greece in the last century.</p>
