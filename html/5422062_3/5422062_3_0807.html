   <p>Thousands of Tegeatans are going to their annual picnic next Sunday at Schiller Park. They remember last year's picnic and will not miss this one for anything. Every Tegeatan in the vicinity of Chicago on Sunday, August 20, should consider it a duty and a pleasure to be present at Schiller Park, so that he will be able to see again his fellow countrymen and spend an enjoyable day with them.</p>
