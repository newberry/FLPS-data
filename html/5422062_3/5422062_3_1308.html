   <p>The pupils of Koraes Greek-American School held their annual Halloween Party, Tuesday, October 30. Costumes were worn by some of the youngsters. The after noon was spent in playing games and eating! (Um--- can those kids eat!) All agreed that they had a grand time.</p>
   <p>Much credit is due to the teachers of the school who labored greatly to make this party a huge success.</p>
