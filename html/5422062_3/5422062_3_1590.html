   <p>We have been informed that the two Greek-American athletic clubs of Chicago have united. The clubs are the Greek-American Club and the Hercules.</p>
   <p>The Greek youths were very wise to combine the two organizations. Now the one club will have over one hundred members and will have much more influence than the two separate organizations.</p>
   <p>They have challenged many prominent American athletic clubs. These boys are capable and earnest. They are going to bring honor and glory to their community.</p>
   <p>We extend our sincere congratulations.</p>
