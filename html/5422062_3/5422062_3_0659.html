   <p>Last Sunday evening, the theatrical company directed by Mrs. Delenardou gave a patriotic performance in honor of our Greek national holiday [similar to American Fourth of July]. The whole performance merited the vigorous applause it received at the finish.</p>
   <p>That, however, is not the point we wish to emphasize; it is the following we wish you to note well.</p>
   <p>Because the performance was entirely patriotic, Mr. Chronopoulos,a dentist was asked to relate a summary of the history of Greece as is customary on such occasions.</p>
   <p>The Royalists in the audience, fearing that the man they knew to be a <span class="page-break">2</span>liberal and liberty lover would criticize the present regime in Greece, began to make noise and in general were unruly and impolite. Even the various school groups were allowed to whisper, talk, and create a disturbance.</p>
   <p>At the close, we are informed that the director of the show, had the nerve to immediately recall the noisemakers to their classes (sic). This article was written in the interests of truth.</p>
