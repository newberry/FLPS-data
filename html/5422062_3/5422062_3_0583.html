   <p>Eight hundred people gathered in the Eighth Street Theater last Sunday night to witness the performance of "The Lions of Chicago". This satirical play was written by the well-known journalist, Mr. Elias Janettis. The audience was unusual, being composed entirely of the older, more well-known Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In his play, Mr. Janettis sought to satirize the most active and popular Greek personalities, and he certainly accomplished his purpose. The characters were represented by the members of the Athenian Dramatic Group.</p>
