   <p>Although we have written on this subject many times, our voice has produced only an echo, but this will not stop us from preaching on education, truth and justice.</p>
   <p>A person may read a certain newspaper from day to day without realizing the danger it holds. Slowly but surely, as the poison does its work, the reader absorbs the ideas and suggestions found in these papers. There is great power in a newspaper but this power must be used for a good cause. The Greek people of America avidly read their Greek newspapers, and, like simpletons, blindly believe everything that is written whether it is true or not.</p>
   <p>Much of the Greek press in America is good but there is also much that is bad. These bad papers are hindering the Greeks from progressing. They are hindering them from becoming united and cooperating with one another. We must get rid of this bad element in the Greek press of America.</p>
