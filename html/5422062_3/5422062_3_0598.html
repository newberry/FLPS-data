   <p>For the first time in the history of Hellenism in America, a play written in English by a Greek, will be presented. This opportunity is given to us by the Hull House players and the author, Mr. Mihalaros.</p>
   <p>The title of the play is, Theodora, and it is regarding the life of the much heralded, Theodora, wife of the great Justinian, Byzantine Emperor of the 6th century, A.D.</p>
   <p>The play is based upon historic facts and, in the main, on the famous Nika rebellion when the followers of Theodora, the "Venetians" came in conflict with the "Greens" and 50,000 people of Constantinople died. Even Justinian, himself, would have lost his throne if it had not been for the intervention of Theodora.</p>
   <p>A psycho-analysis of Theodora, is presented in an accurate and artistic setting.</p>

   <p>To make the affair a success no efforts were spared by the committee whose chairman is the well known artist of our community, Mr. Nickolas Economou. The Committee used every means to provide necessary funds as well as capable players to enact the difficult drama.</p>
   <p>Regarding the Hull House Players who are to assume the roles of the twenty active parts in Theodora, they are famous for their ability and artistic comprehension, not only in Chicago, but all over America.</p>
   <p>The play will be presented at the Studebaker Theater, Sunday, May 23, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>Besides the American players, there will be a Byzantine choir of fifty or more, under the direction of Mr. D. Papageorge.</p>
