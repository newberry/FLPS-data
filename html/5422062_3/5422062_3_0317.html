   <p>p. 2- Not long ago Greek fruit-peddlers in Chicago were made the target of a war to the finish, directed by the Grocers' Association. The street fruit-peddlers were accused of taking trade away from the legitimate grocers. The Greeks, reinforced by the housewives' cooperation, won the war, and in order to avoid further attacks, they have organized themselves and have become members of the Fruit-Dealers' Association, which includes all the Greeks who deal in fruit.</p>
   <p>Star's notice:</p>
   <p>If, according to the Grocers' Association, might is right, the fruit-peddlers, in the future, will not be molested, since their association is the stronger, and on the other hand, if right is might, the fruit-peddlers again will not be annoyed, since their action is lawful and just. So in either case the housewives will continue to buy their fruit and vegetables of the Greek peddlers if quality and price are better than what the grocers have to offer.</p>
