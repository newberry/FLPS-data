   <p>An icon, beautifully painted in gold and blue and red of primitive design, and believed to date from the fourteenth century, has been found in a modest Greek home at 620 S. Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Daniel Catton Rich, assistant curator of painting and sculptor at the Art Institute, has placed its possible age at 700 years, although an absolute date cannot be established without some research. Its value has been variously estimated from $3,000 upward.</p>
   <p>It was discovered in the home of George Galineas, 65, who, with his wife, and three children, came to America seventeen years ago.</p>

   <p>In true Greek fashion, Galineas settled on South Halsted street, bringing with him the objects of worship which had hung in the holy corner (iconostasi) of his home in Athens.</p>
   <p>Hangs Up Treasure</p>
   <p>In the holy corner of the $20-a-month Chicago flat, he hung the red Kandila (lamp), the picture of St. Demetrios killing the dragon; of St. Catherine in embroidered robes of red and gold; St. Stephen reading from the holy scriptures painted in a Byzantine style, and the most popular of all Greek saints, the "Holy Finder", canonized less than 100 years ago.</p>
   <p>Among these holy paintings, none more than 250 years or eight generations old, hung the truly ancient icon with its Byzantine dome and gates, completely covered with gold leaf, opening upon the small carefully executed painting of the Mother and Child. Standing on the right could be seen St. Dionysus, on the left St. Spiridon. Above is depicted the Holy Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost shown as a small dove.</p>

   <p>How this valuable icon came into the hands of a South Halsted street coffee-house proprietor was told by Mrs. Photini Galineas.</p>
   <p>"It has been in our family, according to tradition, since the iconostasic war of the middle ages," she said today.</p>
   <p>"About 200 years ago four of my great aunts, several generations removed, were all taken slaves to Turkish harems. One of the sisters by the name of Mary carried the icon with her. When she was later freed by one of her own brave countrymen, who recaptured and married her, she brought the icon back to Greece.</p>
   <p>"It has been passed down from generation to generation and was part of my dowry when I married."</p>

   <p>Has Miraculous Power</p>
   <p>No one could convince Mrs. Galineas that the icon cannot work miracles. It hangs with the others in the corner of her son's bedroom, whose life was once saved by its power. The boy, Demetrios, now a husky young pugilist, was pronounced as dying of tuberculosis at the age of seven. The family, newly arrived in America, sent the boy to the hospital, then gathered to pray at the icon.</p>
   <p>"We saw the icon turn black and its portals close," Mrs. Galineas said today. "We knew that our son was going to die, but still we prayed, and two days later the portals opened and the face of the Mother and Child shone forth again. Shortly after, our son returned home completly cured."</p>
   <p>Photographs of the icon are being sent to all the authorities on Byzantine iconography by Nicholas Matsoukas, who discovered it.</p>
