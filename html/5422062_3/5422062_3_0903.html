   <p>My dear Mr. Mammon:</p>
   <p>It would be possible in a formal letter of thanks to express our appreciation of all that you have done to promote the success of the Greek Festival. Of course we realize that without you our success would not have been possible.</p>
   <p>May we extend to you, in behalf of the League and of the Festival Committee, our most grateful thanks for your splendid leadership and your unfailing zeal and enthusiasm.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We feel that it has been a great opportunity for us to come in contact with you and the other leaders of the Greek people and we shall hope for future opportunity to serve.</p>
   <p>With much gratitude for your brilliant marshalling of your workers to the assistance of the cause.</p>
   <p>Very appreciatively yours,</p>
   <p>Drama League of America</p>
   <p>Francis Nelson, President,</p>
   <p>Hellenic Art Festival Committee, Lorado Taft.</p>
