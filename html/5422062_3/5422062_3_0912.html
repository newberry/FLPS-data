   <p>The first part of the program consists of the Dionysia, a festal procession depicted on ancient Greek vases. The god of wine, Dionysus, followed by satyrs and other mythological creatures, leads the procession, which winds up in a festival at which aromatic wine flows freely, while the satyrs perform elaborate dances in honor of Dionysus and Aphrodite.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program is an imposing Byzantine drama "The Emperor's Bride," of which the scene is laid in the Byzantine palace near the shore of Bosporus. Byzantine magnificence and Byzantine costumes with their rich and variegated colors make a marvelous spectacle.</p>
   <p>This presentation is of great nationalistic importance because besides its main purpose, the revival of Greek art it will contribute to the social and commercial uplift of the Greeks of Chicago, who will undoubtedly be present with their American fellow citizens to pay their respects to glorious and immortal Greece.</p>
