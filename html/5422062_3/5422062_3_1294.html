   <p>Our community will have a chance to see movies this coming Thursday, presented by E. Fousianes of Gortynia. This movie has been shown in many of America's large cities and has met with instant success. There are 12,000 feet of scenes of the most beautiful ports of Greece.</p>
   <p>The movie, "Greece in her Glory," will be shown continually from 1 to 11 o'clock, at the Waverly Theater, 527 S. Halsted St. We hope all the Greek people will be present to see this exceptional film.</p>
