   <p>Since picnics seem to be the order of the day, the church of St. Constantine was not to be left behind. Thousands attended its picnic which was given last Thursday.</p>
   <p>All the old timers, as usual, were to be seen at this gathering, enjoying themselves to the utmost. Mr. Nikitas Nomikos thought he had to look after everybody personally. Mr. Theodore Spirisson invited everybody present to join his party. Everybody was in a jovial mood, including the good Rev. Marcus Petrakis, who enjoyed himself as much as anyone else.</p>
