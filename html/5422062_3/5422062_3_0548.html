   <p>Thousands of lovers of music and opera will be glad to hear that Ravina Park opens its doors Saturday evening. In that open theater there will gather, every evening during the entire summer season, thousands of lovers of music to enjoy some of the great masterpieces.</p>
   <p>The number of Greek people going to Ravinia Park is, according to the proportion in population, higher than any other nationality--with the exception, of course, of the Italians. That shows that the Greeks are lovers of music.</p>
   <p>This season's session starts with the well known and beloved opera of Puccini-Manon-Lescant. Aside from the woderful selection of Manon Lescant for the first night, the directors of the Park will present two of the best opera singers--Giovanni Martinelli and Miss Lucrezia Borei.</p>
   <p>We would advise any of our own people--and we know hundreds of them--who would like to go hear two truly great stars on Saturday night, to leave their occupations and spend a few hours in the land of music.</p>
