   <p>p. 6.- Rivalry among Greek basket-ball teams will reach a shooting climax Sunday, April 7, when fourteen Middlewestern quintets clash in the Fifth Annual Hellenic Invitational Basketball Tournament at Loyola University. The teams invited are from the Chicago area.</p>
   <p>Intense competition among Chicago teams centering around the Lord Byron Chapter of the Sons of Pericles, Apollo, Gapa, and Sons of Plato, promises to keep action at its peak throughout the tournament.</p>
   <p>Of the Chicago teams competing are the St. Andrews, Ypsilanti and Pindaros fives. The Lord Byron five, 1934 champions, boast a clean slate during the current season and are expected to make a strong bid for the Hellenic crown April 7.</p>

   <p>Captain Danakas, Giannakopoulos, Drummer, and the Bookas brothers' team are to present to the North Siders a formidable array.</p>
   <p>The Sons of Plato on the West Side have built their title threatening five around Tom Bouzeos, Austin highlight, Jim Collias, flashy Crane Tech lightweight; Harry Jordan, Morton High, of Cicero, Ill., and Lou Koch.</p>
   <p>Pindaros, on the other hand, is expected to upset advanced dope by spilling the favorites with Samaras and Mankin leading the parade. A team that will bear watching in this tournament is Dubuque, Iowa. The Iowans, despite their abbreviated appearance in last year's meet, were undisputably the most colorful quintet in the tournament.</p>
   <p>Capt. Petrakis, in addition to receiving favorable comment in Ripley's column for his "Free Throw" ability (he caged 128 consecutive shots), is a classy ball handler and threatens to become the outstanding star of the tournament's history.</p>
