   <p>The Tripolitan society Kolokotronis held its annual picnic at Grand View Gardens last Sunday.</p>
   <p>This society, with its historic name, is composed of hundreds of members, natives of the famous city of Tripolitza, who were among the first Greeks to establish the Greek colony in Chicago. Many prominent Greeks participated in the affair. Messrs. John Raklios, Geor Becharas, B. Trakas, Dr. Salopoulos, and many others were present.</p>
   <p>The affair, thanks to the organized preparation of the executive committee, was a brilliant success.</p>
