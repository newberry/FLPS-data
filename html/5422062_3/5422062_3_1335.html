   <p>On February 23 at 3:30 P.M. Mr. J. K. Harvey, representative of an anti-Fascist organization, will give a lecture in the Greek Workers' Educational Club at 1648 West Van Buren Street.</p>
   <p>His subject will be "Is Fascism a menace to America, and what can we do to halt its progress?" We are sure that everyone who can possibly do so will attend this lecture, as we are all undoubtedly enemies of Fascism.</p>
