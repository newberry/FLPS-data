   <p>A year ago, when a committee of prominent Greek businessmen met in an effort to secure funds for the erection of a Greek exhibition building at the World's Fair, the Greek Press offered all its resources for the success of their undertaking. The economic situation of Greece did not permit such an expenditure; and the severity of America's economic crisis made it impossible for the committee to raise sufficient funds for the purpose. So this patriotic ambition was not realized.</p>
   <p>When the matter was reconsidered this year, and the Greek Government asked the Greek-Americans to give material aid, the economic problem again came up for solution. Due to the sagacity of one of the promoters of this idea, this difficult and apparently hopeless problem was solved. This person studied the entire situation and made various estimates. He then presented the case in its entirety to the well-known promoter, Mr. John Mantas, and asked him to sponsor <span class="page-break">\2</span>the building.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mantas, with his usual foresight, carefully examined the situation from all aspects, and urged by his strong patriotic feelings, he finally decided to provide the money needed for the erection of a Greek exhibition building at the Chicago Fair. Mr. Mantas' offer was made known to the Greek Government through the leaders of the Greek Church in America, and was gladly accepted. The Government also announced that Greece would make every effort to provide the finest exhibits of its art, culture, and industries for the Greek Pavilion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mantas then accepted the leadership of the entire project and immediately sent his brother George and Mr. John Vovmvakis to Greece. They were to arrange for the exhibition of liquors, oils, exported foodstuffs, and regional productions of beauty or interest. Notices received from these two men, show that the Greek exporters and manufacturers are enthusiastic concerning participation in the Fair, since it will advertise their products to millions of people, and may open greater markets.</p>

   <p>No less is the activity in Chicago. The immense task of erecting an exhibition building before March 26, 1935, is under the personal supervision of Mr. Mantas, a highly experienced contractor. The Greek community of Chicago and the Greek Government will be forever indebted to John Mantas.</p>
