   <p>"In unity there is strength." This should be the motto of all Greeks if they wish to become successful. Unification and co-operation are an integral part of American life and thought. American people work as partners and as groups--not as individuals. This does not mean that individuality is discouraged; it simply means that two people working together can accomplish more than one working alone. Therefore, if fifty or a hundred individuals co-operate, the results will be multiplied proportionately.
