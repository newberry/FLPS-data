   <p>p. 4- Forty young Greeks attending colleges and universities in Chicago met last week and after exchanging views and ideas decided to form a fraternity of their own, which will be known as the Philomaths' Fraternity.</p>
   <p>The aim of the newly-formed circle is to provide mutual cooperation and mutual assistance in spreading scientific knowledge by lectures, debates, and other similar affairs, thus disabusing the superstitious minds of the misinformed and ignorant public.</p>
   <p>Credit and honor are due to these young philomaths, and their title is correct, for their inclination for learning and their love of it will eventually open for them the door into that hall of polymathy which they aspire to enter. Although the newly-founded fraternity is unique in the life of the Greek community in Chicago, it has nevertheless had predecessors in Greece.</p>
