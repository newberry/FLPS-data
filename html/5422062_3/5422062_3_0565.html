   <p>p. 5--Without equivocation or reserve Greek feeling displays its full greatness when occasion arises. Excuse, subterfuge, and evasion are words not to be found in the vocabulary of Greeks when things of importance are to be done.</p>
   <p>On last Sunday the concert of the Greek Philharmonic Society of Chicago took place as announced at Hull House, and the Greeks of Chicago showed by their attendance their appreciation of the Greek amateurs who recently formed the Society with the specific object of serving the Greek community gratis.</p>
   <p>The concert was given for the benefit of the young musicians so that they may equip themselves with uniforms and the paraphernalia proper to their avocation.</p>
   <p>The attendance and the receipts were so large that the members of the Philharmonic Society can dress themselves in regal style. Well done! They deserve it.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Dr. N. Salopoulos, Greek consul general in Chicago, honored the concert with his presence and delivered a very enthusiastic address. A monologue was recited <span class="page-break">2</span>by Attorney S. Kotakis, and poems of his own composition were read by Mr. Kovtoumanos.</p>
   <p>The satisfaction and pride were mutual; the Philharmonic boys were perfectly well satisfied and proud because of the attention which the community has paid to them, and on the other hand the community felt flattered to have boys so unselfish and so talented among its members.</p>
   <p>All in all, the concert was a brilliant success from every angle, Greeks know how to appreciate and how to show their appreciation.</p>
