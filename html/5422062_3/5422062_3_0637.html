   <p>This season's social life was filled to the brim with dinners, dances, teas, etc. The only thing lacking was a theatrical performance, and that is now given here by the St. Helen Women's Club of the South Side.</p>
   <p>Their purpose is to fill the treasury which is always being emptied by one philanthropic deed or another. The have concerned the original idea of giving "Aggelon Malipierin" a play by Victor Hugo. The leading role is very ably filled by T. Pofantis who has worked hard to make it a success. The play will be given this Sunday at the Eighth Street Theater. A small comedy skit will follow the play "Nifi and Forada" (The Bride and a Horse") and Mrs. Pofantis and Miss Stamos will take leading parts.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows the good work St. Helen's club has done in the past. We must support them now, so that they can continue and surpass themselves with their philanthropic activities.</p>
