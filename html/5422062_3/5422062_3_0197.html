   <p>The Greek community of Chicago was shocked and upset when it became known that the Greek-American Bank had closed. The following notice was put on the Bank's doors:</p>
   <p>"Due to the disturbed world conditions which have affected our financial status, we find it necessary to close the Bank.</p>
   <p>"A. Geokaris, G. Stamatides, F. Papakostas, G. Douras."</p>
   <p>Among the investors are some of the finest Greek businessmen of Chicago. Unfortunately, the Saloniki lost $378.99 in this bank failure. We will print further details of this scandal.</p>
