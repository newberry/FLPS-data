   <p>p. 5.- This is to remind everyone to be present next Monday at the lecture given by Mr. K. Argyropoulos. We are sure that a select crowd of Greeks will be at this gathering on March 17, at the Masonic Temple. The theme, "What America Contributed to the War of 1821," will prove to be an interesting one.</p>
   <p>Everyone should be present!</p>
