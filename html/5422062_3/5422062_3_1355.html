   <p>Just one more voice raised in protest against the lack of interest and the indifference on the part of the Greeks of Chicago toward the finer, the cultural, the more gracious things in life. I raise my voice, knowing that it will fall upon deaf ears. The actual reproach and protest were made by Mr. Chronopoulos, inspired by the lecture given by Constantine Argiropoulos [a famous Greek poet]. I only desire to add a little postscript. Here it is:</p>
   <p>It is true, that our Greek community is large. In fact, it is so large that if we segregated ourselves in one section of Chicago a Greek city larger than Patras or Pireaus would result.</p>
   <p>However, except in population, we cannot compare ourselves with any Greek city, no matter how small. We lack the cultural concepts of existence, so apparent in the old Greek city. It seems that we here in Chicago feel that life goes on just the same whether we trouble ourselves with cultural pursuits or not. No matter what our status or position in society happens to be, we are all impregnated with the same indifference toward our spiritual and intellectual growth. I became convinced of this during the two years I had the honor of being president of the Greek Mens' Professional Club. I have learned it from observing every shadow of the cultural movement in our community.</p>
   <p>As president of the Professional Club, I desired to arouse interest in the educational and progressive aspects of culture. Therefore, I approached the most capable and most intelligent men in the Club and asked them each to give a lecture upon some theme of social importance. All were willing to cooperate in this venture. Lecturers could be found. What nobody could find, however, was a sufficiently large audience! The lectures were advertised through every available medium. Papers carried bold announcements, the Greek radio hour heralded them many times, thousands of tickets were sent to supposedly interested persons. And the result? The admissions collected were not enough to pay the hall rental!</p>
   <p>This aroused no dismay in the breasts of the professional men. The businessmen betrayed not the slightest alarm. And the indifference of the younger generation was far more marked than that of their elders. They are not interested in such dull affairs! Now, if a bridge party, or a dance, or a golf tournament had been arranged, every one--even the sick--would have been present. But a program designed to make them think sends the barometer of interest down below zero. The Greek women are no different than the men in this respect. The indifference of their children is traceable to maternal training and advice. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
   <p>And to conclude this protest, I wish to state my considered opinion of this indifferent attitude: We live in a city, but we are not cosmopolitan or civilized. We lack the inner spirit that makes great minds and great talents. We are without doubt the Babbits of the society in which we live. The truth, unfortunately, is bitter, but it is still the irrevocable truth.</p>
