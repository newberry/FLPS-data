   <p>The Saloniki is very happy to announce that the progressive Mr. Athan Belonis, of our community, has opened a new rental library at 627 South Halsted Street. It will contain fifteen hundred Greek books, including historical works, fiction, poetry and other types of reading matter. These books are to be rented for very small fees and will be available to all who desire them.</p>
   <p>Those interested in this undertaking--and all Greek people should be interested, especially the young people--should visit this bookstore. If it is impossible for you to visit the store, then drop Mr. Belonis a card, and he will send you a complete catalogue of his stock. This catalogue will enable you to choose a list of good books to enhance your pleasure and your knowledge.</p>
   <p>Mr. Belonis deserves congratulations for opening such a fine shop, and we wish him much success.</p>
