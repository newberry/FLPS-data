   <p>p. 2- Our beginnings three years ago were small, but the Star to-day is printed on eight large pages. Everything else has changed, but our policy has remained the same; that is, to serve the public honestly and sincerely. This will never change. Our prosperity is the result of the good will of the people. We shall continue to strive to the best of our knowledge and ability to serve the people's interests. We have made numerous enemies by revealing the truth, but we cannot deviate from our course. We shall continue to be the faithful servants of the public.</p>
   <p>On page three we print some of the hundreds of congratulatory messages sent to the Star by distinguished American and Greek personages.</p>
   <p>From the bottom of our hearts we sincerely appreciate the support of our subscribers, advertisers, and all who read the Chicago Greek Star.</p>
