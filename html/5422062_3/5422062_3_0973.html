   <p>Last night, the Association of Scientists gave a banquet in honor of the Consul General of Greece in Chicago, at the Athenian Cafe of Psychare Bros., on the occasion of his arrival in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Fifty professional men were seated. Mr. Despotis, president of the association, was the Toastmaster who addressed Mr. Yannes on behalf of the professionals. He was followed by Paul Javaras, manager of the Greek Press; Mr. Metaxas, manufacturer of Metaxas brandy, who is here on a trip from Greece; Mr. S. Kotakis, and Mr. J. Dritsas.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Yannes, in turn, thanked every one and said: "Day before yesterday, I had the pleasure to attend the entertainment given at Trianon, have seen the fast development, progress, and social evolution of the Greek Community, here, and hasten to express my gratification and national pride.</p>
   <p>"Today, however, my joy is still greater, because the opportunity is given to me to ascertain that the Greeks who immigrated to America were not all of <span class="page-break">\2</span>them absorbed by the worship of the God of Profit, Hermes. Some of them, selected ones, and they are many if I judge by the number of those present, have preferred the road to the temples of Themis, Asklepios, Athena, and the rest of the Goddesses of Art and Sciences.</p>
   <p>"And so I am happy, today, to be amongst you--the intellectuals, the flower of the Greek Community, the ones that honor by their culture the Greek name abroad, which is to prove, for the millionth time, that the Greek wherever he finds himself expatriated has the cell and the seed wherefrom spring the future generation of the Greek Intellectuals of Chicago.....</p>
   <p>"I would not try to arouse your sentiment, nor to invigorate your mind, nor point out to you the need of preserving the nationalism of the Greeks here through the schools. All these you are in a position to understand better than I do, and you can talk about them in a more convincing way than I can.</p>
   <p>"That which I will ask of you is your valuable cooperation. Because you, being a part of this community, in coming in closer contact with it, and comprehending its deficiencies and needs better than anybody else, are in a position to point out to me what is possible to be done for progress and <span class="page-break">\3</span>development. And rest assured, that this authority of the Consulate will listen with closest attention and do everything in its power to fulfill its mission here, of which it is very Conscious....."</p>
   <p>Hearty applause followed the speech and all present expressed their joy at the arrival of Mr. Yannes.</p>
