   <p>Practically all of us saw "Madame X" when it was presented upon the American stage. But aside from those having reserved seats, the Greek version of the play was seen only by those fortunate enough to arrive in time at the Eighth Street Theater to buy the few remaining tickets and standing room. In all probability, the Greek Operetta Company--beg pardon; we hope it will be, in the future, the "Chicago Greek Operetta Company"--will have to give another performance of the great tragedy, "Madame X".</p>
   <p>The theater is a medium of education and progress, and the Greeks of Chicago are in as much need of a good theater group as they are of a good school. At last we have found such a group, and we should all support it enthusiastically. If that is done, Miss Lena Dorou [famous Greek actress and producer] and her company will be able to acquire capable professional artists to fill the places of the amateurs she is forced to use--who, however, have been doing <span class="page-break">2</span>a very creditable piece of work.</p>
   <p>An example of the fine amateur acting in "Madame X" can be found in the performance of Dr. G. Karaflos, who played two roles. He convinced us that he made a great mistake in neglecting to study the drama for a career, and by entering the medical profession instead.....</p>
   <p>As for the acting of Miss Dorou, all we can say is that the author of "Madame X" had this capable actress in mind when he created the role of that sad, tragically-brave woman.</p>
