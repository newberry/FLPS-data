   <p>Some vultures in our community are going around saying that Mr. C. Damascus, editor of the Saloniki, is on the verge of death. The purpose of these liars and exploiters, who are afraid of the shadow of Mr. Damascus, is to dishearten the friends of the Saloniki, and to cause them to cease the fight carried on by this paper for the last four years.</p>
   <p>To the thousands of friends of the Saloniki we say that Mr. Damascus is still recuperating at the North Chicago Hospital, and is in no danger. He will soon be well enough to continue his battle for decency, which has put the Saloniki high in the respect of the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>To the vultures who tremble because of the truths printed upon the pages of the Saloniki, we say: Due to the failing health of its editor, the paper has been run by the next in command. Having over fifteen capable men on the staff, the Saloniki is in no danger of collapse, even if the editor and fourteen members <span class="page-break">2</span>of the staff die simultaneously.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki is waging a sacred war. For this it has gained the love and respect of the world; and so the Saloniki shall continue to exist to the joy of decent society, and the great grief of the cheats and exploiters whose prayers are never answered by God.</p>
   <p>This has been printed because of the great number of telephone calls we have received, inquiring as to the health of Mr. Damascus. Therefore, we again say that he is in no danger and will soon be back at his desk.</p>
   <p>To the vultures we say, "Don't worry so much, he is not at death's door".</p>
