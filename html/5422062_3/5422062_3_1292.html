   <p>p. 3.- Mr. E. Fousianis deserves hearty congratulations for his presentation of the Greek movies last Friday night.</p>
   <p>The thousands of Greeks who saw the first presentation stated that it far exceeded their expectations. They asked to have it shown again, so that others might have a chance to see it. The thousands who saw the second performance seemed more delighted if possible, than those who saw the first.</p>
   <p>This successful reception by the Chicago Greeks has prompted Mr. Fousianes to give a third performance on March 13.</p>
