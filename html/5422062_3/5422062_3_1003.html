   <p>Recently there has been an epidemic of self-advertising among the various journalistic organs, and since we do not want to be marked as immune from it, we gladly copy from the Review, its opinion of this paper, expressing our thanks and appreciation, at the same time, to its editor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Constantine Sakelazakus, printed in his new publication, the Review in Detroit, the following about the Proodos-(Progress):</p>
   <p>"We do not violate truth and veracity in stating that our Detroit Greek Community misses its newspaper the Proodos-(Progress).</p>
   <p>"It was the oldest Greek newspaper of Detroit. Its career and journalistic life was entirely independent, always fearless in its attacks like thunderbolts.</p>
   <p>"But while Proodos was attacking bitterly and seemed so violent and severe, its publisher-editor, Mr. George Laskaris, was entirely different.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>He has the virtues of an innocent and unoffending individual, pleasant friend and is a very agreeable debater and conversationalist.</p>
   <p>"We are very pleased to report to our Community that the newspaper Proodos, will start publication in Chicago again under the direction of Mr. Laskaris, the Attorney-at-Law. The Review extends its best wishes and congratulations to the Proodos for its reissue."</p>
