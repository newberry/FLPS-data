   <p>The "Woodlawn" Ahepans played their second game of the season last Wednesday, and showed the Sons of Pericles that they weren't so hot after all. The Sons were trounced by the score 30 to 7. Although they were without some of their stars, the score showed a great improvement in the team. The leading scorers for the Ahepans were Gus Poulos, with six baskets and Johnny Nichols with four baskets.</p>
   <p>The Ahepan team looked very good. Pres. Mgr. Ted Varvares and Capt. Dan. Manos, both playing a good game at guard; Gus Poulos, center; and Peter Williams, and John Nichols at forward.</p>
   <p>The Ahepans invited every one to come out and inspect their new uniforms, and also cheer them on to victory. The admission is free at all times.</p>
   <p>The Ahepans will play the 63rd Street All Stars next Wednesday, Dec. 20, at George College, 63rd and Drexel at 9 P. M. The admission is free so <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>come out and see the boys in action.</p>
   <p>For the past three weeks there have been rumors that the choir girls are going to organize a basketball team. I believe the South Side possesses athletically inclined girls as well as boys and it's a great sport. What are you waiting for, girls?</p>
