   <p>p. 5.- In addition to the four Gapan chapters, there is a women's and misses lodge called Kypseli. Immediately after organizing the chapter, the ladies gave an afternoon reception at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>A great number of Greeks were present in the Rose Room of the hotel in response to the cordial invitations of the Kypseli members.</p>
   <p>Tea and refreshments were served. Then came the program. Dr. G. Gavares, after a few words on the purpose of Gapa, presented the president of the women's club, I. Skoutela.
