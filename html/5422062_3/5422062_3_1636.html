   <p>Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>In addition to the previous contributions by the "Greek Star" for the benefit of our suffering brothers, the Italians, I take pleasure in enclosing herewith another check for $40.00, collected from the Greeks for the same purpose.</p>
   <p>Please accept same as a token of sympathy extended by the Greeks of Chicago to our Italian brothers. I beg to remain,</p>
