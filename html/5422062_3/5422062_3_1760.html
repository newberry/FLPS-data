   <p>At the Olympia Hall, last Sunday, the Cretan Society of Chicago and the suburbs held its annual banquet and dance which was a great success. Greeks and Americans participated in the event to witness the rhythmic dances and the sweet songs of the Cretans.</p>
   <p>The Cretan society, which is a branch of the Pan-Cretan's Union, a national organization, is headed this year by Mr. D. Betinin, an enterprising Cretan, who will follow the progressive work of his predecessor Dr. John Yolicos.</p>
