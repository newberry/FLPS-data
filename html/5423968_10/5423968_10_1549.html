   <p>"Love of one's country, second only to love of God, is one of our most sacred duties and most noble emotions; from it springs a tendency toward nationalistic work. Until now such work in America has been conducted almost exclusively by older people. Why? Is our youth, the Polish youth, to remain in the background? Does not the same equally fervent love for our motherland inflame our hearts? We, the Polish youth, raised on this free American soil, love our motherland as intensely as do our brothers beyond the sea. We are always ready to take our places in the struggle, side by side with our brethren.</p>
   <p>"A sound spirit in a sound body--that is our motto. Guided by this, hoping one day to strengthen the ranks of the fighters for our cause, we have organized the athletic society, Polish Falcons. We train our bodies, keeping our spirit in mind, thinking of Poland and of sacrifices for her.</p>
   <p>"Polish youth! Let us unite and work together!</p>
   
   <p>"Last Sunday, July 23, the Polish Falcons number 2 held a picnic.....It was a pleasure to look upon the Falcons, playing today, ready for battle tomorrow. Everyone felt himself a Pole--amongst his own kind--contented.</p>
