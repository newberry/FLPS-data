   <p>Sztandar (Banner), a paper published for young people and an official organ of the Alliance of Polish Young People in America, has for some time been published under a new editorial policy, which, however, does not seen to have benefited it very much.</p>
   <p>The last few issues of this publication seem to be filled with a spirit that does not do credit to a paper supposedly devoted to educating young people, a spirit of quarrelsomeness and of inclination to incite revolt among the communities. Sztandar openly attacks the priests and wishes to awaken among its young readers a feeling of hostility and disgust toward the servants of the Church and, undoubtedly, toward the Church itself.</p>
   <p>The last issue of Sztandar illustrates this plan of action. In three separate articles <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it publishes severe, unjustifiable attacks on the priests. Especially wild and infamous is the article entitled "Who Are They?" in which, to the shame of our Polish community, the author, "N", represents to his readers certain Polish priests as the root of all evil.</p>
   <p>This is not the proper attitude to take. This is not the way to educate the young Polish people. You do not wish to urge it to patriotic efforts, to make it better respected and wiser, but to make it sink to the lowest level. "God and Religion" has been the national motto for ages. Our forefathers rushed into battle with the cross and the sword to fight for their ideals, Polish and Christian. There should be no other path for our young people. Whoever wishes to poison them with anarchistic ideas, whoever casts the most hideous insults on the servants of the Church, is their enemy, not their friend.</p>
   <p>Sztandar, which publishes these odious attacks against the priests, is in reality not the [proper] guiding light for our young people.....They should reject such leadership.</p>
