   <p>In accordance with the plans submitted in our paper, a conference preliminary to the projected Polish Catholic Congress in America will be held tomorrow in Detroit, Michigan. A large group of Polish Catholic priests and laymen from all parts of America will participate in this conference.</p>
   <p>This preliminary conference is to be held for the purpose of deciding on the place and the date of the Congress, and also to formulate rules as to the representatives to be admitted to the Congress, and, finally, and most important, the program to be discussed at the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>We wish our respected priests and laymen the most successful and most far-reaching results in solving our most difficult problems; and because this issue of the Dziennik Chicagoski will be distributed in Detroit during the conference, we take the liberty of once more making a few suggestions as to the method of arranging the Congress. These suggestions will not be new by any means, for they are really a synopsis of the many suggestions made in the articles published by us regarding the Congress.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the Congress should be held in either Buffalo, Cleveland, or Detroit. The central location of each of these cities would suggest this.</p>
   <p>Every Polish priest, as the guardian of our Holy Faith, ought to be a member of the Congress, as ought also the administrations of the Polish Catholic organizations. Every Polish society should have one delegate for every fifty or one hundred members. The parishes also should have a representation.</p>
   <p>The program of the Congress, should be carefully decided on in advance. We consider it most important to include the following points in the program.</p>
   <p>1. Organization of the Polish Catholic Clergy in America.</p>
   <p>2. Condemnation of the so-called "Independent" churches.</p>
   
   <p>3. Support of the Polish Immigration Home.</p>
   <p>4. Organization of the spiritual seminary.</p>
   <p>5. Formation of an all-embracing Polish Catholic labor organization in America on the federation method, for the purpose of spreading enlightenment and participating in labor matters.</p>
   <p>We believe that these specific problems should be settled at this Congress.</p>
   <p>Other matters, such as that of a Polish bishop, the regulation of schools conducted by the school brothers, the census of Polish population, etc., could be initiated at this session of the Congress and entrusted for further consideration to various committees. Still other matters, such as condemnation of the evil press, etc., could be disposed of at the Congress by appropriate resolutions.</p>
   <p>The question of a teacher's seminary, which Reverend Pitass, of Buffalo, is establishing at his own expense, could be dispensed with.</p>
   <p>Not a voice should be raised at the Congress to condemn either the Polish National Alliance, the Rapperschwyl Fund,or any other institution.</p>
   <p>Naturally, after deciding on this or some other program, the conference should entrust the preparation of specific points to special committees.</p>
   <p>No matters should be discussed beyond those decided on in advance.</p>
   <p>Finally, at tomorrow's conference a central committee should be selected to make arrangements for the congress in the city where it is decided it will be held; also local committees in all settlements should be organized and the financial question should be discussed.</p>
   <p>These are the problems, in our opinion, that face tomorrow's conference in Detroit.</p>
   
   <p>In publishing these suggestions we do not mean to force our opinion on anybody. Our main interest is in the meeting, and we have only been giving a brief synopsis of various problems that have often been discussed with the most sincere motives in the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
