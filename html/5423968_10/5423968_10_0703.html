   <p>The leaders of the independent church movement [free from the jurisdiction of the Pope] have made another stop in their tour of Chicago relative to promoting their doctrines. Last night the band wagon and its excommunicated leaders, Kozlowski, Kolaszewski, and Kaminski, stopped in Town of Lake.</p>
   <p>This trio brought their entire "guard" with them and, with the help of some local persons who have fallen away from the local parish [St. Joseph], and some enemies of the Roman Catholic Church, arranged a so-called meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paczkowski, one of those who for a long time wanted to start discord and trouble in this parish, but to no avail, presided at this session.</p>
   <p>Derogatory statements were cast at the clergy of the Roman Catholic religion; slanderous and brutal words flowed like water from a fountain..... The events that took place were literally a repetition of those that took place in St. <span class="page-break">\2</span>Adalbert Parish the day before yesterday. This time, however, Kolaszewski surpassed himself. He took complete charge of the comical performance....His gesticulations and diction indicated that he could make a large profit as an actor--naturally, as a comedian.</p>
   <p>The people that attended this "performance" virtually rolled with laughter--and beat a thunderous applause.....</p>
   <p>If one wishes to believe the story written by a reporter of the local Chronicle, a slight misunderstanding created a disturbance during the meeting. Several, or perhaps a score of individuals, followers of the true Roman Catholic religion, began to protest loudly when they became offended by the scandalous remarks made by the excommunicated priests. Others from the audience pounced upon them and escorted them from the hall.</p>
   <p>Shortly afterwards a brick came flying through a window into the hall, according to the report in the Chronicle. The identity of the person who threw the brick <span class="page-break">\3</span>was not established.</p>
   <p>Both of these meetings indicate that the Catholic people are beginning to lose their patience with these agitations which the condemned priests are continuing.....This has been anticipated. Today we exorcise our people not to stray from the true path; but at the same time we appeal to the excommunicated agitators, who have come from God knows where, to discontinue their sowing of dissention and discord among us, and to put aside their hatred, if they do not wish to be responsible for the various conditions which may arise from this type of activity.</p>
