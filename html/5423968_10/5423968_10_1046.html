   <p>Yesterday, Monday, December 25, a Christmas play was held at the Sisters of Nazareth's. As usual, the older and younger girls of the Sisters' school gave a dramatic portrayal of the happings before and during the birth of Christ. The young girls spoke their verses and sang very nicely; their enunciation was correct and pure; their actions showed they understood their roles, which they played with sincere feeling. Miss Jaroslawa Weclewska (as Simeon) and Miss Mary Barzynska (as Bartosz) were exceptionally good. The other girls deserving of mention are Angeline Wisniewski, Bertha Keller, Sophia Szajkowski, Agnes Suwalski, Anna Gorynski, Mary Kopytowna, Martha Dejewski, Hedwig Smolinski, Barbara Mazur, Mary Usewicz, Mary Szulc, Louise Rybczynski, and Mary Chodur. These girls portrayed the shepherds. Besides them, the following boys took part in the Christmas play as pages: Vincent Suwalski, John Zielinski, Vincent Suhultz, Walter Gogulinski, Zepherin Kadow, and Sylvester Klosowski.</p>
   <p>The Christmas play was a complete success. The big crowd, largely composed of children, was completely entranced by the spectacle.</p>
