   <p>The dedication of the St. Michael's parish service flag was celebrated [in the church] on Sunday, September 22, 1918. The affair was attended by an overflow crowd. When the service flag was brought into the church, the figure 388 sewn upon it could plainly be seen. This signified that there are 388 members of the parish now in active service either in the American or in the Polish armed forces. Immediately below this figure were six gold stars, signifying that six former parishioners have sacrificed their lives upon the altar of freedom.</p>
   <p>The flag was blessed by the pastor of St. Michael's Church, the Reverend John M. Lange, assisted by the Reverend Fathers Francis Walczak and I. Renklowski.</p>
   <p>After the dedicatory ceremony the Reverend K. Szudzinski, assistant pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, delivered an inspiring sermon. In it the reverend speaker praised the heroism of our Polish youth, asking all those present to remember out gallant soldiers and to keep them in mind in their daily prayers.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the church ceremony the people repaired to the parish hall. A meeting as large as this had never before been witnessed in the annals of St. Michael's parish, and it is wonderful whether there ever will be one to exceed it. The meeting was opened with a prayer by the Reverend Father Lange, the paster, who then called upon the president of St. Michael's civic committee, Mr. Adam Lulinski to act as chairman of the meeting, and on Mr. J. Guzowski to act as secretary. After this the audience rose and sang the American anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner. The first speaker was the Reverend E. Kowalski, president of the South Chicago Civic Committee. The audience rewarded his inspiring speech with a burst of enthusiastic applause. He said that just as Polish heroes in the past defeated the Swedes, the marauding Knights of the Cross, and the Moslem Turks, despite great numerical odds against the Polish forces, so now we find our boys bravely facing the enemy of humanity, fighting under the American colors and under their own Polish banner. There can be not doubt that our forces as well as those of the Allied nations will be victorious in the end. We must admit here that the oratorical efforts of this patriotic priest in behalf of the Polish cause equal the efforts of those who fight in arms.</p>
   <p>The next on the program was St. Michael's choir, directed by the parish organist, Mr. D. Kowalski. They sang "The Insurrectionist's Farewell". Every one who knows this song will admit that few equal it in beauty. Next came a speech by Lieutenant J. Rozicki of the Polish Army. In the course of his speech the lieutenant stated that only recently he had been in Washington, where he met a certain French general who had come to America to discuss financial matters. The Frenchman told of the heroic deeds of the Polish army, stating that in his forty-three years of soldiering he had seen many armies in action, but that there was none to equal the heroism of the Poles. He urged all those Poles who had been placed in the fifth classification in the American selective service to enlist in the Polish army and thus prove their true patriotism. Finally, he requested that every one assist the cause financially as much as possible, since the Polish army is in need of everything, and any contributions will be cheerfully accepted. His speech was frequently interrupted by uncontrollable bursts of applause, and it is certain that some of his words were deeply impressed on the hearts of many of the audience.</p>
   <p>After the speech a solo was sung by the popular Polish singer, Mme. Helen Tykowski. So successful was her first aria that the public would not cease to applaud until an encore was sung.</p>
   <p>Then followed a voluntary collection among the audience. The exact result of this is as yet unknown, but if the size of the crowd and a glance at the offerings may serve as an indication, we might say that the meeting netted several hundred dollars in behalf of the Polish cause.</p>
