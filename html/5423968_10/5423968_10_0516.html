   <p>A cause so important as the Polish Catholic Congress should interest all Poles to the greatest degree, and it is the duty of the Polish press to discuss it very thoroughly and to take notice of every forward step made.</p>
   <p>The Polish press is interested in the Polish Catholic Congress, but some of them do not believe in its lofty mission or in its success, but prophesy, in advance, that it will come to nothing, or they scornfully remark that "the mouse wants to bring forth a mountain," etc.</p>
   <p>Naturally, these are the tactics employed by the non-Catholic papers.</p>
   <p>Such articles endeavor to weaken the meaning of the Polish Catholic Congress, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to create disbelief, and to curtail the energies of the more ambitious. It is proper, therefore, that the Polish Catholic papers repel the attacks of the enemies of the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>It surely is not necessary to answer such prophecies as "the mouse wishes to bring forth a mountain".</p>
   <p>Every person possessing his five normal senses will recognize that only a person bearing ill will would make such remarks about a gathering in which all Polish priests and good Polish Catholic citizens are to participate.</p>
   <p>To the assertion that the Polish Catholic Congress will have no meaning and will not include the entire Polish nation, we find a ready answer.</p>
   <p>Several attempts have already been made to unite all the Poles in America <span class="page-break">\3</span>so that they will work together sincerely in the name of love of country, but it has been shown that love of country can be found only on the tongues of some of our so-called "patriots". This dead and selfish love of country did not permit them to make even the slightest sacrifices; it did not impel them to make compromises; it did not help to unite us. Because of a few words, because they disliked one paragraph in the constitution, a great and noble cause was dropped and all efforts were made to condemn and destroy it [the Polish League].</p>
   <p>Can there be any talk about love of country and a true desire for uniting the Poles in its name, if, when the time comes for action, those who shout loudest of their love are unable to make any compromises, or any sacrifices?</p>
   <p>Let us not, therefore, fool ourselves, but let us frankly confess that the mass of the Polish people in America can only be united under the banner <span class="page-break">\4</span>of faith.</p>
   <p>This banner will not stop us from being--or feeling ourselves to be--true Poles, who love our country and are willing to make sacrifices for it. Quite the contrary; this love will be strengthened, it will become vibrant, alive and fruitful!</p>
   <p>That there should be outside the pale of this organization a few hundred or even a thousand Polish Catholics who do not subscribe to the Catholic doctrines, who cannot bring themselves to co-operate with the priests, and who refuse to stand under the banner of faith--is a minor matter.</p>
   <p>They represent only a small percentage in comparison to the hundreds of thousands united in a single thought, the same blood, and the same faith.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Let them go ahead and do the best they know how according to what their own conscience and love of country dictate.</p>
   <p>The majority, the great mass of the people, will follow the lead of their spiritual directors, for to them this meeting of the Polish priests is of tremendous importance.</p>
   <p>It is only necessary that all the Polish priests take part in the Congress and carry out its decisions, which, no doubt, will be good and noble. We hope that this will be accomplished, and that the committee in charge of arrangements will see that it is done. In this regard it would be best to enlist the help of the local bishops.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee will probably make an appeal that will be <span class="page-break">\6</span>considered satisfactory to all the bishops in whose dioceses Polish priests reside, pointing out to them the beneficial purpose of the Congress, and invite them to participate in it and to support it.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, the local bishops, in view of the many parochial disturbances and the ever increasing strength of the schismatic monster, will understand the benefits to be derived from such a Congress, and will urge all Polish priests to participate actively in its deliberations. This is most important.</p>
   <p>If all of them gather, then surely, with God's help, they will act as one person, and will accomplish much, very much that will benefit our faith, our country, and our Polish people in America.</p>
