   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka parish fair will be brought to a close by a special benefit dinner party suggested by several leading parishioners. The proceeds will go toward the purchasing of clocks for the new church towers, which will be illuminated at night. It is estimated that the cost of the clocks and a bell will come to over two thousand dollars; the cost of the illumination apparatus was placed at one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>The dinner has been arranged for Thursday, November 24. It will be held at the school hall at 1:30 P.M. Tickets are five dollars a couple. Those who will attend are assured a wonderful time; in addition, they will be doing a good deed.</p>
   <p>The clocks on the new church towers will lend prestige to the entire parish; therefore, all those who reside in the parish ought to attend this benefit dinner. It is worthy of support.</p>
