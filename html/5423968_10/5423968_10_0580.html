   <p>According to the various opinions expressed by the Polish clergy concerning the Polish Catholic Congress in America, the question of a Polish bishop or a papal delegate for the Poles in America seems to be the most delicate, although not necessarily the most important. We have noticed a certain pessimism concerning our own affairs. To us, the situation of the Polish Catholic Church in America does not appear as black as some people claim.</p>
   <p>In a comparatively short time we have accomplished a great deal of good. We have much good material, exceptional strength, and the will to do things among our Polish Catholic people, who need only to be shown the way.</p>
   <p>The evil which already exists, and which always will be among us, was caused <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by the division of our Polish clergy into small and large camps.</p>
   <p>When the Polish priests in the United States come to the realization that all dissension is so much more oil for the fire of the enemies of our Church, then will come the greatest remedy for all evil. Let peace reign, peace that is sincere and Christian in spirit, for love of God, our neighbors, and our own souls.</p>
   <p>If the Congress should devote, even as a side issue, any time to the baring of our wounds, not yet completely healed, we can guarantee in advance that it will be a fiasco.</p>
   <p>Peace in his own mind, and the desire for peace with others, is what each one should bring to Buffalo, and he should not expect to look for it there. No higher authority, no bishop or delegate can propose any kind of reform; reform should, in the final analysis, come of itself.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Now let us consider the need of a Polish bishop:</p>
   <p>1) A Polish bishop, exclusively for Poles, is something we cannot expect, because this would be contrary to the organization of the Catholic Church, especially in the United States. Rome has never permitted the separation of certain parishes into different dioceses, under the jurisdiction of different bishops. An exception was made in the case of Galicia (Poland), where Catholics of different religious practices live next to each other. Here the boundaries of the Latin diocese encroach on the boundaries of the Russian diocese, and in Lwow itself three Catholic archbishops reside, each heading a different diocese. The Russian question in the United States was solved by placing the Russian priests under the jurisdiction of the American bishops. Catholics in the United States, Germans, Irishmen, Frenchman, Poles, etc., perform the Latin rites. All the bishops will oppose the proposal that a bishop be appointed exclusively for the Poles. Anarchy would result from it, because other nationalities would demand the same consideration, and then under whose jurisdiction would the parishes in farming districts be, where Poles, Germans, and Irish attend <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>church? Finally, no bishop, knowing America, would care to shepherd and control parishes from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts, and from Canada to the Mexican border. We, therefore, advise that this idea of a bishop exclusively for the Poles be abandoned.</p>
   <p>2) What can we do then? We complain, and in a way justly, of the lack of higher protection in church affairs. According to our opinion, Pope Leo XIII himself pointed to the right road, by appointing a delegate to the United States. The authority of this delegate is as great as the authority of the bishops in individual dioceses. If the Poles were to accept their own delegate, other nationalities would demand similar representation, and the above-described difficulties would be repeated. We can be certain that the popes will appoint only proper personages as delegates. But for the unique position of the Polish Catholics in America, we could petition the Holy Father for a subdelegate for Polish affairs, who would be subject to Cardinal Satolli, the Papal Delegate. We are mainly interested in the idea that the Catholic Church understands our difficulties and will give them proper consideration. Added to this is the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>knowledge of our language, and a knowledge of our organizations, our press, and our lives.</p>
   <p>Such an assistant Papal Delegate would, therefore, be a link joining us closer to the Church. It would not be absolutely necessary that he be a bishop, although, if he were, the influence on our people would be greater. The authority of the church would not be violated. The bishops, as heretofore, would remain our first judges, and from their decision an appeal could be made to the Papal Delegate; the Polish assistant Papal Delegate would be the best judge of our affairs.</p>
