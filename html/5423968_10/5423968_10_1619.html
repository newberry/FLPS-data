   <p>We have witnessed a wave of radicalism reaching unto the very Halls of Congress. To-day we are in the throes of pacifistic propaganda aimed at the very foundations of our Government. As a Nation we are beset with a nightmare of "anti-immigration" and its possible "horrible" consequence to our country. We are told that unless immigration is checked, this nation will become a dependency of some European State. At least such a conclusion is justified from the "immigration hysteria" ranging throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>We have read a great deal in our magazines of the preferences for immigrants of Nordic and Anglo-Saxon stocks, classifying them as the most desirable because they assimilate more rapidly than others. We see the peoples of southern and eastern Europe placed in the category of the least desirable immigrants because of their slow amalgamation, and charged with the "crime" of adhering to the language and customs of their respective countries. All these effulgent articles and treatises deal in generalities, conlusions, rumors, hearsay and falacious statistics, analyzed and juggled to suit, in many instances, the convenience of the writer. We <span class="page-break">\2</span>have neither the time, nor is it our province in this limited and meagre publication to counteract the unfair and biased opinion of overzealous and misguided "patriots for hire.</p>
   <p>The great difficulty with these writers and self-styled 100% Americans is, that they have viewed the situation from a narrow selfish view point rather than from the broad human aspect, taking into consideration the environment, language, and creed of the people under discussion. Even the writers need not go back more than from one to four generations to find that their ancestors came to these shores to seek freedom of religious worship and to better conditions for themselves and their descendants. They obtained their American citizenship without effort or sacrifice and this they would deny others who came, as their ancestors came, willing to make sacrifices to attain the privileges and prerogatives of American citizenship. The Americanization or assimilation of our immigrant must follow in an orderly fashion, by evolution rather than revolution, by a campaign of encouragement and not of persecution, by education instead of compulsion.</p>
   <p>The fact that the immigrant must adjust his life here to new conditions and customs, learn a new language, the root of which is other than the language of his land. It <span class="page-break">\3</span>is no wonder that the immigrant, whose language is not a Nordic or Anglo-Saxon language, and who must adjust himself to the intricacies of our distinctive mode of existence, requires a longer time to become amalgamated than does the Nordic and Anglo-Saxon whose languages have the same origin as that of the English language. The trouble with the reformer is that he would attempt to change the sphere of the immigrant over-night. It cannot be done, because the influence of centuries of cultural development cannot be eradicated in from two to five years. A generation or two of proper and careful attention alone can bring the desired transition about.</p>
   <p>Whose fault is it that the evolution is slow and halting, and who is to blame for the so-called lack of assimilation of our immigrants? We Americans and our Federal, State, and Local Governments are primarily to blame, because we are not doing our full duty to our Country, to ourselves, or to our immigrant. It is our duty to interest ourselves in the immigrant, give him aid, encourage him in learning our language, and assist him in acquiring a knowledge of our institutions. These duties have been partially assumed by individuals genuinely interested in the "foreigner" and his Americanization and by some of our settlements in a limited and necessarily <span class="page-break">\4</span>circumspect measure. This work should be undertaken by special Government agencies in a systematic and scientific manner, and carried on through competent instructors especially trained and having a knowledge of the people with whom they are to deal, preferably Americans of the origin of the immigrants they are to educate and prepare for Americanization.</p>
   <p>We, who are sons and daughters of the immigrant, one and two generations removed and know that the statements made about us and our ancestry are unfair and unjust, should use our good offices as Americans to refute the injustice done the immigrant and his descendant. We have made nothing to conceal, we are loyal to our country, the United States, we have made our sacrifices and have done our full duty in the late war. We have no apologies to make about our Americanism and resent the imputation that we are less desirable American citizens because we have not sprung from the Nordics Anglo-Saxons.</p>
   <p>It will be interesting to know what some of our writers will say of the pacifist movement in our American Universities, of the outrage to our flag in Evanston, Illinois, an ideal Nordic-Anglo-Saxon community, which permitted an un-American slacker to vilify our Country and belittle its flag.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We have noted with some satisfaction and pride that among the "38" at Evanston there were no Americans of our extraction, while the majority of them were of Nordic and Anglo-Saxon descent. We have no doubt that American writers will attempt to cover up that fact by failing to mention the "100% Americans".</p>
   <p>Instead of attempting to restrict good, honest and healthy immigration, it would be well that our reformers and lawmakers in Washington, of Nordic and Anglo-Saxon origin, direct their attention and energies to the Americanization of our un-American Americans in our American Universities, instead of slandering and belittling the wellmeaning, earnest and honest immigrant and his descendants who have in the past contributed to the welfare of this country, and who are now helping to maintain it in the forefront of civilization.</p>
