   <p>Through the combined efforts of all the societies of St. Adalbert Parish, a benefit ball will be given tomorrow, starting at 4 P. M., at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>According to an understanding reached by the delegates of the societies, one-third of the proceeds are to go toward Pulaski Hall and the other two-thirds toward the church and school of St. Adalbert Parish. This hall will also serve as an example of the unity, harmony and co-operation of the Polish societies of the parish.</p>
   <p>A program will take place before the dancing begins. A speech of welcome will be given by W. J. Pijanowski. Reverend John Radziejewski, pastor of St. Adalbert Parish, and Casimir Zychlinski will also speak.</p>
   <p>Invitations were sent to all societies, including those of the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Roman Catholic Union. A capacity crowd is expected.</p>
