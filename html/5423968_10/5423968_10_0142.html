   <p>The Resurrectionist Fathers have a church in the 16th ward under the name of Saint Stanislaus. They have a large hall near that church. In that hall they have balls. In the church they conduct a business by selling "the holy sacraments" and eternal salvation and in the hall at the balls they sell beer, whiskey and cigars. All for the glory of God.</p>
   <p>In this manner the time passes very pleasantly. Neither Socialists nor Freethinkers or any other Masons could penetrate into the stronghold of the "Rise from the grave" in the Saint Stanislaus parish. They could not get there because they were not able to hire a hall in which they could teach the humble lambs heretical doctrines.</p>
   <p>Consequently, the lambs know only the church and the bar of the Resurrectionist Fathers, nothing else besides that.</p>
   <p>Then the city of Chicago decided to set up a park in the 16th ward, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>domain of the Resurrectionist Fathers.</p>
   <p>"The park? For what purpose? We do not need any park here," argued the reverend Fathers. "Our parishioners have plenty of saloons, they have even a church with a bar; there they may breathe the fresh air. For what do they need a park?"</p>
   <p>They protested against the building of a park, but all in vain. The city decided to build a park with a recreation building and a large lecture hall. Isn't that horrible?</p>
   <p>That was too much for the pious Resurrectionist Fathers. The church would certainly lose on account of that. Some people instead of going to church and offering something to God or drink beer at the parish bar, would go to the park and breathe fresh air instead of the word of God. Besides that, the city will build a lecture hall where all kinds of infidels will try to undermine the very foundation of the Holy Faith.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Never! We are the masters here," proclaimed the pious Fathers. "We will not allow a park hall to be built, because we have our own with beer and whiskey. The church cannot be deprived of income. You, citizens, should not allow it."</p>
   <p>But those desperate persuasions brought only one man and a few women devotees. There shall be a park and a lecture hall. There shall also be lectures in that hall and the parish bar of the Resurrection Fathers will be a thing of the past.</p>
