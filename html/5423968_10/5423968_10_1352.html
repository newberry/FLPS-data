   <p>All those Polish-American veterans who served in the World War are urged to join the Haller Legion. Many opportunities are offered its members. Recently a telegram was received from Poland informing us that the government has donated 1,600 hectares of land for farming. This land is to be used by our organization. Its sole purpose is to be for the use of invalids. Orders further state that work on this land must be started next year. In the spring 500 Polish-American volunteers will be eligible for land.</p>
   <p>An intensive program is being planned by the organization to assist its members in establishing themselves in the agricultural field. This service will only be rendered to members. Those wishing to take advantage of them should join the organization.</p>
