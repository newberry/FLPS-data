   <p>The thought of a Polish Catholic Congress in the United States has electrified all Catholic people.</p>
   <p>Just as, once before, Reverend Kordecki, the prior of the Jasno Gora monastery, struck the most vital spot in the life of our Polish nation by appealing to the Most Holy Maiden (Holy Mary) for protection in the midst of an avalanche of Cossack and Swedish attacks, so do we, the Polish Catholics in the United States, seeing that awful monster of irreligious, "independent" church-social politics, say to ourselves: "Enough of this; we are Catholies, and will not permit ourselves to be dragged down by the evil influences attacking the rock of Peter!"</p>
   <p>Thus come the thought of a Polish Catholic Congress, quickly heartening and urging every Polish Catholic in America to co-operative endeavor. What is a Congress?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Catholic Church, under all forms of government, whether it be czar, emperor, king or monarchial constitution, or even under the rule of the Turks or pagans, is able to take care of itself. The Church, of course, unaware of any distinction in the human body before God, (sic) is indifferent to the form of government, providing the immortal souls do not suffer in their search for salvation. Therefore the Popes endeavor to co-operate with whatever form of government rules each individual country. They make treaties with monarchs, they receive the support of Catholic parties in various parliaments, as in Germany and in Belgium, or they appeal directly to the Catholic people, so that there may be no interference with the work of saving immortal souls.</p>
   <p>We, the Catholics the United States, are not represented in the Congress of the United States by any Catholic party. Heretofore, there was no need of one. We are represented by our bishops and priests, our churches, schools, homes for the aged, orphanages, societies, and larger organizations. To these, <span class="page-break">3</span>therefore, Pope Leo XIII speaks: "Gather in the name of Christ, to teach each other, to consult each other, to defend ourselves against the enemies of our faith!"</p>
   <p>The Catholics in Austria met not long ago in Vienna, the Germans have been meeting for over fifty-three years in various cities, the Irish-Americans met in Washington, and the German-Americans in different places for many years. Now we Polish Catholics are called to such a Congress.</p>
   <p>This is not to be a gathering of members of the Polish Union, or the Polish Roman Catholic Union, or any other single faction, of which we have plenty, but it is to be a gathering of all good-thinking Catholic Poles, without regard to which Catholic party they have heretofore adhered.</p>
   <p>Such is the thought of this Congress.</p>
   <p>We, also, from the viewpoint of the Polish Catholics in Chicago will permit ourselves to make a few observations. This is not the first time we have <span class="page-break">4</span>been invited to a gathering. We know from experience how the wheel of fortune turns at such affairs. If a program is prepared in advance, in a sensible manner and with peace in the heart, then it is possible to pass practical motions, which will, sometime in the future, be useful to all. But how many such gatherings have brought benefits only to the railroad companies and the hotels?</p>
   <p>And this has oftentimes taken place in the name of Catholicism!</p>
   <p>We, therefore, reserve for ourselves the right not to propose frivolous programs, but will offer some suggestions, some proposals, that we honestly believe may bring a measure of good to all the Poles in America:</p>
   <p>1) Our position regarding the influence of so called "independent" churches needs, first of all, proper historical clarification. The Catholic Church, at all times and everywhere has condemned the activities of "independents", because they insult Christian motives and harm the mission of the Catholic Church. It is not like the study of a science, where frequently new discoveries <span class="page-break">5</span>are made.</p>
   <p>2) As to social and labor questions: Our Polish people in America are composed principally of workingmen. All around us are unions and industrial organizations, permeated with the spirit of socialism. Have we not here a large field for the sowing of the seed of true christian enlightenment?</p>
   <p>3) As to the Polish Catholic Youth organizations: In twenty or thirty years these youths will dictate public opinion. As we educate them, so will they be. If we were considering calling a Congress for the Catholic Poles from the old country, then we would rather not waste paper in such a cause. We are interested in laying a foundation for organic work among our young people which shall flourish when all of us oldtimers will be resting in our graves.</p>
   <p>4) We urge active support of the Immigration Home.</p>
   <p>Let this suffice for the time being.</p>
