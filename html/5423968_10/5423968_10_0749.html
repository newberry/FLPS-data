   <p>At the Polish Roman Catholic Union convention held on September 17, at South Bend, Indiana, new officers, most of whom were from Chicago, were elected to office. The only outsider was Reverend Paul Gutowski, spiritual counselor, from Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Because the individuals chosen from Chicago are outstanding representative individuals, Dziennik Chicagoski is giving a short biographical sketch of each.</p>
   <p>The vice-spiritual counselor of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of the largest Polish parish in America, St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, a man who is admired and respected by all Chicagoans. He was born on September 20, 1838, in Sulislawice, Sandomir, Russian Poland.</p>
   
   <p>Reverend Barzynski completed his studies for the priesthood at the Seminary in Lublin, and was ordained by Bishop Baranowski in 1861.On October 28, 1861, he was sent to Tomaszew [a city in Russianoccupied Poland]. In 1863 he took an active part in the January rising a against Russia. It was because of this that he was compelled to leave the country and find refuge in Galicia. He was interned by the Austrians for ten months at Olomuncu and Iglawie, where he finally received a passport to leave Austria through Switzerland. Reverend Barzynski did not hesitate and quickly left for Paris. Through the influence of Reverend Jeloniski, the refugee priest entered the newly established congregation of the Resurrection. And on March 1, 1865, Reverend Kajsiewicz blessed him at Rome as one of the members of the Congregation.</p>
   <p>After a stay of eighteen months in the Italian capital, he was sent to America. Reverend Barzynski arrived at San Antonio, Texas, on October, 1866. There he worked diligently for eight years. In September, 1874, he came to Chicago and since then has accomplished a great deal in the spiritual and national fields. He was one of the founders and pillars of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America.</p>
   <p>The new president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is Clement J. Bielinski, one of the oldest and most active members of this organization. He was born on November 23, 1853, at Posen, Prussian-occupied Poland, and was educated in the public schools. After completing his studies he plied the trade of a tailor.</p>
   <p>At the age of seventeen he came to America, where he worked in Brooklyn, Hackensack, New Jersey, Oneida, New York, and Radom, Illinois. Finally he came to Chicago. Soon afterward he married Hedwig Nowakewska, a widow, Being very industrious, he managed to work himself up the ladder of success. At first he worked as a laborer, then as a constable, a railroad conductor, driver of a patrol wagon, owner of an undertaking business, etc. All this did not interfere with his personal interests and education. He found time to study law at Lake Forest University, and in less than two years received his degree.</p>
   <p>For many years he has been living in the vicinity of St. Adalbert Parish. He is considered an outstanding citizen and an example of a self-made man.</p>
   <p>Joseph Jablonski, vice-president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, resides in St. Hedwig Parish. As a businessman he is considered one of the leading contractors of that vicinity. He was born at Swarosin, near Danzig. Young Joseph studied to be an expert carpenter. At the age of 22 he came to America and settled in Chicago. Mr. Jablonski married in 1882. For three years he worked as a carpenter and then opened his own business as a building contractor. He owns his own home, which is located on Hamburg Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jablonski has been a member of St. Hedwig Parish for the past nine years; he belongs to the St. Hedwig and Holy Cross societies and is treasurer of the former organization.</p>
   
   <p>The new treasurer of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Albert Jedrzejek, is considered one of the wealthiest Polish citizens of Chicago. He was born on February 21, 1850, at Wienebock, Prussia, and came directly to Chicago in 1869. At the present time he is considered one of the "old Polish settlers."</p>
   <p>Young Jedrzejck married in 1872. At first he worked as a laborer and later as an inspector in a wood shop. In 1880 he opened his own grocery store at Bradley and Holt Streets. Through saving and careful investments, Mr. Jedrzejck has built up an estate from $75,000 to $100,000. At present he operates two grocery stores, and one saloon, which is located at Dickson and Blackhawk Streets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jedrzejek has been a member of the Polish Roman Catholic Union since its founding. He has already served as its president and treasurer. His record shows that he is an outstanding citizen among the Poles of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>The new secretary general Francis Wleklinski, is not a new member in this organization. For the past three years he has acted as treasurer of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, performing his duties like a veteran.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wleklinski was born on September 22, 1851, in Powidz, Posen. At the age of nineteen he came to America and worked at whatever job he could find. Although on strange soil he never forgot to do his part of his faith and fatherland. For a number of years he has been the proprietor of a modern bakery on North Ashland Avenue, where he employs ten people. Through his earnest work and inborn ability Mr. Wleklinski has managed to accumulate an impressive estate. Besides the two buildings that are used for his bakery, he owns a three-story brick buidding in the vicinity of St. Hedwig Parish, next to Humboldt Park and a number of lots.</p>
   <p>F. Wleklinski has been married for some time and is the proud father of five children. Since 1884 he has been a member of the Holy Trinity Society and for the past six years he has been its financial secretary. He is well known in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>Four Chicago Poles were also elected as trustees of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. These four are: Thaddeus Klajn, Francis Benka, Albert Wachowski, and Isadore Komarowski.</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Klajn, of St. Josephat Parish, was born on June 17, 1838, in the village of Lasine, near Danzig. He came to Chicago in 1867 and today is considered one of the old Polish settlers of this city. His first work was in the shipbuilding industry, and later he worked in various factories. He toiled like a true son of the soil and managed to save a few pennies of his carnings. After this he was proprietor of a saloon for fifteen years. In 1883 he began putting up buildings. Today his possessions are valued at $75,000. He also owns a clothing store.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Klajn became a member of St. Stanislaus Kostka Society in 1869. A few years later he became one of the pillars of St. Josephat Parish. It is here that he has been enjoying membership in two societies and is also the treasurer of a building and loan association. Mr. Klajn resides on Fullerton Avenue. He is well known and respected in his parish.</p>
   <p>Francis Bomka is a member of St. Mary of Perpetual Help Parish. He was born on April 16, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in Wejherow, near Danzig. In 1871 he came to America and stayed at Belviders, New Jersey. A few months later he came to Chicago, where he worked as a laborer for many years. It was not until five years ago that he opened up his own business. He is one of the founders of St. Stephen Society and has been its president. Mr. Bemka is also a member of other Polish societies.</p>
   <p>Albert Wachewski is a member of St. Casimir Parish. He was born in March, 1858, in one of the old villages of Posen. He came directly to Chicago in 1882. At first he worked as a carpenter, then as a grocery agent, and then he entered into various businesses of his own. He continued his education where he left it off in Europe. At the present time he is a notary public and operates an insurance office.</p>
   <p>Isadore Komarowski comes from St. John Cantius Parish. He is a little over thirty years of age. At first he worked as a laborer, and for the past few years he has been a policeman on the Chicago police force. Mr. Komarowski has been a member in good standing of the Polish Roman Catholic Union for many years.</p>
   <p>All these people are faithful Catholics and ardent Poles, and they deserve their ranking.</p>
