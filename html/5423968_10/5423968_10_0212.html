   <p>Fellow countrymen:</p>
   <p>The Holy Father, Pope Pius X, fulfilled the desires and pleas of the American Poles, and Cardinal Merry del Val, of Illinois, on the 17th of May, placed the most beloved, the highly praised and best suited reverend father for the order of bishop of Chicago archdiocese, Rev. Father Paul Rhode, (in partibus infidelium).</p>
   <p>Therefore we have the first Polish bishop in America, a bishop of our own flesh and blood, of our longing and suffering.</p>
   <p>Among us he was born; in a Polish college he was educated; in the Polish parishes he worked in earnest, helped establish two new parishes and worked in behalf of all Polish Catholics at all times.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He brought with him from Poland the strife and teaching of his parents in his mind, which he in turn expects to teach to us Polish parents and children.</p>
   <p>The first thought of our new bishop was to mingle with us, to shake hands with the hard working people, to talk and encourage them, bless them and offer consolation to the families for their efforts; to the old, young and the little ones.</p>
   <p>When the committee from all the Polish parishes assembled to meet the bishop and talk over plans for the consecration program, the bishop said: "I agree to everything that the committee resolves, but I ask of one favor, Lead me among the Polish people, among all my people, among all their different groups and allow me to rejoice with them in their hour of happiness as is best fit and suited for all the Polish people."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To fulfill this request of our first Polish bishop, the committee, composed of citizens from different Polish parishes, agreed unanimously yesterday that on July 29, the day of the consecration, the first line of people will be composed of prominent Polish business and political figures.</p>
   <p>On this day, at 7 P. M., Bishop Rhode will arrive at the parish of St. John Cantius; from there in triumphant fashion he will be escorted to the parish of Holy Innocence, then to Holy Trinity, from there to St. Stanislaus, where the people are awaiting the arrival of Bishop Rhode. The hall of St. Stanislaus is not large enough to accommodate all the people; therefore the people will meet in the open field adjoining the parish, which will be beautifully decorated. Here the delegates and deputations will receive the bishop; here is where Bishop Rhode will bless all the people in his first official bishop blessings.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>We are requesting all the Most Rev. Fathers, the whole Polish clergy, all the church and parish administrations, choirs and church orchestras with love and ardor to busy themselves and organize a beautiful church procession with their respective banners and take their places among the groups from St. Stanislaus and St. John Cantius.</p>
   <p>We are requesting all Polish organizations, no exceptions to the rule. The Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Polish Mothers, the Polish Women's National Alliance, the United Order of Falcons, all detachments and companies of the Polish army, organization of Polish and Lithuanian organists, Order of Polish Foresters, Circle of Youngsters, together with all the Polish people to take an active part in this great celebration.</p>
   <p>We are asking that all the nearest Polish parishes send as large groups of their parishioners as possible, and those parishes far away, to send all their members that want to represent their respective parishes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Every true-blooded Pole should take part in this great manifestation and consecration of the first Polish bishop in America.</p>
   <p>For many years the Poles have hoped and tried to have one of their fellow brothers hold a higher position, and at last their prayers were answered as is the case of Bishop Rhode.</p>
   <p>We are calling the attention of all Polish editors and publishers to take active part in informing all the Polish people through their daily or weekly newspapers about the progress being done in regard to this blessed consecration. We take this opportunity to thank you in advance for all you can do to make this a huge success. This is the greatest day for the American Poles in many years.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of affairs are: Leon Szopinski, President; Ignatz Kowalski, secretary; Stanley Kuns, Steve Govecki, N. L. Piotrowski, Dr. A. Szwajkart, Julius Smietanka, Stanley Behnke, Michael Swientkowski, Bernard Maciejewski and Leonard Wegner.</p>
