   <p>A great picnic is being arranged by the St. Joseph Young People's Society from the parish of St. Stanislaus, for Sunday, July 19, at the Mayfair Park Grove, located at 1481-85 Montrose Avenue. The picnic will start at 1 P. M.</p>
   <p>The tickets are 25 cents per person. The music will be furnished by Mr. Ignatz Skowronski.</p>
   <p>The proceeds from this picnic will be used to purchase new books for the school library. Therefore we feel sure that the public will respond to our plea and support us wholeheartedly.</p>
   <p>The best way to get to the grove is to take the Elston Avenue street car to the end of the line, which is Montrose Avenue. The grove is right there on the right-hand side.</p>
