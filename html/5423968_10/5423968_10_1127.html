   <p>Perhaps someone will be surprised to hear us say that religious indifference is one of the important causes of our national and political stagnation in America. In order to express ourselves more clearly, we state at the very outset that we will speak here of the indifference of the Poles in America toward the Catholic religion, that is, their indifference in fulfilling the obligations prescribed by this religion.</p>
   <p>In this connection some of our people claim that the Catholic religion has nothing to do with the Poles as a nationality, that it has nothing in common with politics, and that there are many non-Catholic Poles who, despite their religious indifference, are good Poles.</p>
   <p>This claim is not a product of the imagination--it has its origin in <span class="page-break">2</span>supposedly historical fact given out for public consumption by some Polish newspapers in America. Whoever has read these newspapers will admit that we are not paltering with the truth. One of them has gone so far as to say that the Poles who are solicitous for the welfare of religion are nothing but church-mongers, and it denies the name of Polish associations to the Catholic societies, calling them ecclesiastical.</p>
   <p>These claims, therefore, do exist. They have been brought forward, and some of the Poles in America stubbornly adhere to them. Let us look closer at these claims and see how much truth there is in them.</p>
   <p>To be a Pole one does not necessarily have to be a Catholic; that is true. Yet the least indifference to Catholicism is harmful to our nationality. Many things enter into [the character of the people of a given] nationality--love for the homeland, its language, its customs, and its traditions, handed down through history. Loving Poland and using the Polish language do not make one a good patriot. To be that one must have something of the Polish <span class="page-break">3</span>tradition in oneself, one must cling to Polish custom. The children of Germans residing in Poland were born there, speak Polish, and even love Poland, yet, notwithstanding all this, they are not Polish patriots in the full sense of the word. We have seen such people even in Cracow. They disregard Polish traditions and never adapt themselves to Polish customs. The most important Polish tradition is the Catholic religion.</p>
   <p>Certain histories of Poland, which evolved as an individual and separate nation out of the Slavic people, begin with Ziemowit. From then on, Poland's history is enlightened with the torch of Catholicism, which was introduced into Moravia, and carried from there into Poland, by the Catholic missionaries Cyril and Methodius. King Menceslaus I, baptized in 965 A. D., recognized in Catholicism a strong defense against the Germans and a strong lever for the Polish people. Catholicism gave Poland the rank of a European nation and the right to exist politically. Yet <span class="page-break">4</span>some say that Catholicism has nothing to do with politics. Had the Poles accepted the Eastern creed, and with it the Slavic liturgy, the Polish language would have never been so well developed as it is today, for then it would have been deprived of the Latin influence brought into it by Catholicism. It would have remained as undeveloped as other Slavic languages, and our literature would have never had its golden era as early as the Sigismund dynasty.</p>
   <p>Since, as we have just shown, even our language is greatly indebted to Catholicism, there is no gainsaying the fact that this religion was very useful for our nationality. The Poles who have renounced the Catholic faith for the Protestant novelties asserted at one of their meetings that, even if the Republic of Poland were to fall, they would retain the Augsburg Confession. Only a traitor could say that--only one who has deserted both Poland and Catholicism. Indeed, Poland would have fallen had <span class="page-break">5</span>not our immortal Skarga converted the majority of the nobility to the Catholic faith of their fathers, instilling in them a love for Poland. The love for the fatherland, which had been killed in their hearts by Protestantism, was revived again by Catholicism.</p>
   <p>And yet some say that religion has nothing to do with the Poles as a nationality! True, neither is stearine a flame, but a flame cannot last without it. Just as a flame can be sustained with fat or oil, so, perhaps, some would like to sustain the Polish nationality with Protestantism and schism, instead of Catholicism. Why, even today a schism causing a transition from Catholicism to Protestantism would be equivalent to denationalization!</p>
   <p>We have seen, and we know from history, that Catholicism is closely interwoven with the Poles as a nationality and that our nation has gained much through Catholicism. Nor is it necessary to present lengthy proofs to sustain the fact that indifference toward Catholicism is harmful to us, <span class="page-break">6</span>even if only for the reason that it would be a denial of our Catholic past.</p>
   <p>Any Pole in America wishing to preserve his nationality should avoid doing anything that is detrimental to it, and hence should not manifest indifference toward the Catholic religion. We are in the midst of a storm which rages about us in the form not only of a strange language but also of the materialism and socialism of other nationalities. This storm will engulf us if our small boat is not fastened with a staunch chain to the anchor of love for Poland and our nationality. This chain is composed of various links, the cutting of one of which will undoubtedly make us perish. One of these links is the Catholic religion.</p>

   <p>Why, then, do many of our brothers ignore the obligations of the Catholic <span class="page-break">7</span>religion and at the same time claim that they are good Poles?</p>
   <p>The religious indifference of many Poles in America is manifested particularly in two ways. The first is a disregard for Easter Confession and Holy Communion. This attitude is in itself equivalent to disregarding a religion so meritorious to our nationality, and thus brings harm to our nationality and causes our national and political stagnation. A Pole that attends Easter Confession and Communion is like a silent reproach to the one who neglects this obligation. The one tolerates the other and they are supposedly friends, but it is improbable that the latter would be completely sincere to the former. For appearance's sake, even if without venom and bitterness, nay, with a smile, the latter will call the former an "ecclesiastic", so that there can be no true love and unity between them. We all lament the separation that exists among us in America, a separation which is harmful to us politically. And the cause of this separation is only one--the disregarding of the obligation to receive the sacraments of Easter <span class="page-break">8</span>Confession and Communion, which constitutes a grave religious indifference. The Poles who know the significance of this obligation cannot neglect it, because they would expose their souls to damnation. These Poles are criticized by others who do not want, because of their sinful and reproachable religious indifference, to submit to this obligation. Hence all our discord, the termination of which could be achieved only through an awakening from this indifference. People who are false to this obligation create parishes that have no priests, and schools that claim to be parochial, at the same time taking vigorous steps against the Polish Catholic parochial schools. They even have their children baptized in German Catholic churches, thus diminishing the number of Poles. All of this harms our nationality and weakens it politically; and the source of our difficulties is religious indifference.</p>
   <p>Besides, this religious indifference breeds disregard and contempt toward the Polish clergy. A Polish priest is just as good a man as any lay Pole, if not better. That the strife among the Poles is harmful to our nationality <span class="page-break">9</span>is recognized even by W. W. As it is, we already have two camps in our midst--the churchmen and the non-churchmen, or, rather, the Catholics and the non-Catholics. The non-Catholics are still fighting with the Polish clergy, the very same clergy that has contributed so much toward the development of our nationality in America. This fight with the clergy leads to disorder, to a confusion of ideas, as if the clergy should be governed, not by the bishop, but by a few atheists and liberals who pretend to be Catholics. This covers us with shame in the eyes of people of other nationalities, who consider us some sort of wild and uncontrollable rabble.</p>
   <p>He who publicly attacks the Catholic clergy acknowledges that he is not a Catholic, for he disrespects religion who disrespects its servants. This applies, for example, to W. W., who is without faith.</p>
   <p>We could offer more proofs to show how much religious indifference contributes to our national and political stagnation in America. Let us, <span class="page-break">10</span>therefore, cast out from our midst this harmful religious indifference, brother Poles, and our national and political stagnation will soon turn into progress.</p>
