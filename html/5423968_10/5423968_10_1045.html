   <p>I hereby wish to extend my sincerest thanks to all the faithful, and especially to the parishioners of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish for their wonderful turnout at the ceremonies of blessing the lower church of the St. John Cantius Parish. I wish to thank especially the members of the choir directed by Mr. Andrew J. Kwasigroch, for their beautiful singing, which in a great measure helped elevate the ceremonies. I wish also to thank the administrations of the various societies that assembled in such great numbers.</p>
   <p>Reverend John Kasprzycki, C. R.</p>
