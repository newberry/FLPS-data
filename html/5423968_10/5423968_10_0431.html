   <p>...."There can be but one truth, the truth as preached by Jesus Christ, who said, 'I am the truth and the life!' This truth is to be preached until the and of the earth, and that is why Jesus Christ delegated this matter to human beings. Choosing those apostles and scholars who should do this, He separated them fron all others, built His Church and gave it the God-like attribute that it cannot err, that in it is the truth and the life because Our Lord Jesus Christ is with it."</p>
   <p>These were the introductory words of the Most Reverend Peter Wawrzyniak's speech.</p>
   <p>He then explained very clearly that not everybody accepts this, that many claim God is everywhere and that it is of no consequence where a person prays; <span class="page-break">\2</span>also that there are some who refuse to obey the Church because it is more convenient for their souls to do so. Then he mentioned various nations, their religious beliefs and sects, and proved that all sects oppose one another because what one believes, the other denies. He went on to show, that unity and truth, and true and unchangeable faith, are only the prerogatives of that one Church which Christ established as the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>There cannot be two truths, because if the adherents of Luther and Calvin are right, we are not: there is only one truth, and one salvation in that church in which God exists.</p>
   <p>We often blunder, and entire nations leave the path of truth. This is because our Heavenly Father gave us freedom and a free will, permitted each person to fight, to recognize, and to gain the truth for himself, permitted each person to be either bad or good, to accept God or oppose Him. It is no wonder then that voices are raised, that some people are opposed to the Catholic Church, because God permits this, but Jesus Christ also foretold that "the gates of <span class="page-break">\3</span>hell shall not conquer the rock of Peter".</p>
   <p>Then the Most Reverend Wawrzyniak told how various sects and schisms were organized, how the Anglican Church was founded, and showed that all of these were founded by people, that the Roman Catholic Church, which lost whole nations (England--Henry VIII), did not deviate from the rules and laws established by Jesus Christ, and that is why only the Roman Catholic Church is the one true Church which God Himself founded, and not ordinary mortals; in which truth and the teachings are unchangeable; whose shepherds are the lawful followers of St. Peter.</p>
   <p>He further explained how enemies are endeavoring to undermine the rock of Peter, and how, finally, they are forced to retreat in shame. He explained at length how certain things happened in Poland formerly--and at the present time in different sections. He then glanced at America and expressed his joy, that here the Poles stand solidly by the Holy Faith, that they retain this faith and the language of their fathers.</p>

   <p>There is only one blot here, and that is represented by the "independent churches".</p>
   <p>A soldier, no matter how brave and courageous, if he does not obey his superior, if he attacks without orders from his superior, must suffer death. This same stands true with the church. The priests must obey the Holy Father and his assistants, the bishops. This disobedience--the independent Churches--is some kind of revolt of the wicked angels, which will end as the first revolt ended: evil will be conquered and God's truth will be triumphant.</p>
   <p>He explained very eloquently and convincingly that the independent churches have no reason to exist, that they have not truth or salvation; that it is necessary to obey the Holy Father, the Pope and his bishops, because "although I have been a priest for a quarter of a century and am a Chamberlain of the Pope, if I wished to listen to your confessions, I could do so lawfully only if the local bishop permitted it and granted me the right to do so.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"Do not be surprised that among thousands of priests there is found one who betrays, who goes along the evil path and is able to delude the people, because from the twelve chosen by Jesus Christ Himself as his disciples, there was one traitor; there was Judas.</p>
   <p>"Do not condemn those of your countrymen who were deluded, but love them and pray for them, because they know not what they are doing, because it is not their fault that they were taught so little of the catechism. With God's help they will also see the light. God's grace will enlighten them, and you should pray for them and remain faithful to the Roman Catholic Church, remembering that God, for the sake of a few faithful followers, was willing to forgive Sodom and Gomorrah. So perhaps for your faith, for the faith shown by all of you, God will also forgive, even if only partly, these lost sheep."</p>
