   <p>Rapid progress is being made with the establishment of a new Polish parish and the construction of a new church. The land on which the church will be built--approximately twenty lots on the southeast corner of Chicago Avenue and Carpenter Street--has already been purchased. The parish school will occupy the corner lot, while the church will be built on Carpenter Street. The first plans have been prepared by the architect Druiding and have been accepted. The church, which will carry the name of St. John Cantius, will be of Roman architecture, with one great tower in front. Besides this, there will be a smaller tower, on which will stand a figure representing St. John Cantius, patron saint of the new parish. Construction of the building will begin soon.</p>
