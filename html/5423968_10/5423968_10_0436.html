   <p>The Most Reverend Chamberlain Wawrzyniak, a distinguished guest in Chicago, does not waste a minute of his time. He is getting acquainted with persons, conditions, and situations amongst us--and sincerely tries to help us.</p>
   <p>Yesterday morning our guest visited the Convent of the Sisters of Nazareth and celebrated Mass in their Chapel. In the afternoon he visited the St. Adalbert and St. Casimir parishes, where he was cordially greeted by all the parishioners.</p>
   <p>Today the Reverend Chamberlain visited the St. John Cantius parish, our own editorial offices and printing establishment, and the Polish Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow he will be at the St. Hedwig parish to deliver a sermon in the morning, and in the afternoon he will be the guest of honor at the celebration in the large St. Stanislaus Kostka school hall on Bradley Street.</p>
   
   <p>Next Tuesday, Reverend Wawrzyniak will visit Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a day or two. Some of our Polish priests will accompany him there.</p>
