   <p>In passing through Chicago Mr. V. Fronczak, former co-editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, paused here for a few hours that he might visit his friends and relatives and bid them farewell, since he expects to be sent to France shortly. Mr. Fronczak enlisted in the American Army and was attached to the medical corps stationed at Camp Jefferson. He feels that he is now sufficiently well acquainted with hospital work to bring first aid to wounded soldiers. Consequently he is needed at the battle front, where he will be able to bring relief to many who have been wounded in battle in defense of the democracy of the whole civilized world. Mr. Fronczak received a special furlough to leave for his home and to bid his friends and family farewell before embarking for France. Grateful friends and acquaintances bade him fond farewells, wishing him good luck and a successful return to continued work and study in the field of law.</p>
