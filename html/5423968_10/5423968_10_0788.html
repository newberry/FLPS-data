   <p>Conditions in the St. Hedwig Parish are looking brighter with each passing day. Respect and co-operation have been won by the new pastor from his flock, and peace now reigns in the parish.</p>
   <p>Contributions to the church are also growing. Kochanowski's Dramatical Circle has contributed fifty dollars. The St. Hedwig Parish Choir has donated $192.15 for a new organ. Proceeds from the picnic given for the parish school children at Irving Park recently, netted $113.14.</p>
   <p>All those who contributed toward these undertakings are tendered sincere thanks by the pastor.</p>
