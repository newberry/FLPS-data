   <p>Tomorrow, the 16th day of October, at 10 A. M., Archbishop George Mundelein will consecrate the new St. Hyacinth Polish church.</p>
   <p>Rev. J. Sobieszczyk, the pastor of St. Hyacinth parish, has invited many priests who will participate in this ceremony. Many church and national societies, as well as guests from other parishes, will take active part in the celebration.</p>
   <p>The old St. Hyacinth's church was built by Rev. W. Barzynski in 1894; it was located at Milwaukee and Central Park Avenue till 1900, when it was moved to the present location. The first holy mass in St. Hyacinth's church was celebrated on Christmas Day, 1894.</p>
   <p>Rev. Jan Piechowski was the first pastor of St. Hyacinth's church. He was appointed to another parish and his place was taken by Rev. Joseph Gieburowski, who built the rectory and stayed there. After a year, Rev. E. Siedlaczek took charge of the parish and in two years' time improved it. He was replaced by Rev. Babski, who in ten years built it up entirely with the exception of the church. He was replaced by Rev. J. Szczypta in 1908. The next pastor was Rev. John Zdechlik, who blessed the lot for the new church on the 12th of Dec. 1920.</p>
   <p>Rev. Jan Sobieszczak, C. R., a former professor of St. Stanislaus College, finished the work which has been begun by his predecessor. This new temple will be solemnly consecrated tomorrow.</p>
