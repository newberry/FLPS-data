   <p>The omniscient and omnipotent King of Kings, God of Heaven and Earth, has sent a cross for the Saint Hedwig Parish to bear. You all know what is paining us the most, dear compatriots: the devil has sent a fallen priest into our field of pure wheat to sow weed, separate husband from wife, child from father, brother from sister, and this fallen priest pays no attention to the horrible example given by the Lord when He condemned the dissatisfied angels to the bottom of hell. And so, within our own midst, people have arisen who are opposed to the teachings of the Lord and against the religious beliefs of our forefathers. But we also know that God often experiments with the faithful by putting them through temptation and misfortune in order to test their faith and virtue.</p>
   <p>Understanding this, we have stood like a rock beside our religion, and although Satan is smearing our work, we are working and going forward in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>name of God.</p>
   <p>The Holy Mary and the crucified Lord, Jesus Christ, look our faith, and upon our work, bless us, and send us help.</p>
   <p>But, dear brother, all this has been made possible through our patron saint, Saint Hedwig, who has protected and guided us through our trials and tribulations, and is still keeping constant watch over us. And we thus far have not demonstrated our thanks to her.</p>
   <p>In other parishes beautiful homes of God pierce the skies--and in ours.... services are being held in the school building.</p>
   <p>We have a beautiful place for a new temple of God, but through the misfortune that has been sent down upon us by God, we have not been able to avail ourselves of this land. In reality, the church property, which is valued at between $125,000 and $130,000, has a debt of $40,000, which we are striving <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to pay. When this is done, we will be in a position to build a new church.</p>
   <p>In order to come closer to the realization of this, we are arranging a bazaar, which will begin on September 4.</p>
   <p>Dear brothers, we are doing our part, all that is within our power, but you know that we cannot accomplish miracles, and what is difficult for one person alone is much easier for a crowd. It is for this reason that we turn to our compatriots and fellow Catholics and beg them to support this affair. Your Polish and Catholic hearts recognize that our parish needs the greatest support since it is continually in difficulties.</p>
   <p>We feel confident that you will not deny us your help, for you follow the same principle we follow, that every good deed for the glory of God is repaid a thousandfold by the Almighty God in heaven.</p>
   <p>Counting upon your generous hearts, we are turning you over under the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>guidance of our great patron saint, Saint Hedwig.</p>
   <p>In the name of Saint Hedwig Parish,</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Piechowski, C. R.</p>
   <p>Pastor.</p>
