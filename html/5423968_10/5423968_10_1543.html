   <p>On Thursday, December 14, we organized a new society for the young Polish people under the name of "Future". Our principal object is to awaken a love for education and mutual improvement through entertainments, debates, and educational talks; also to increase social activities among our young Polish people.</p>
   <p>Realizing how far fate has separated us from our mother country, we have not forgotten, in our program, of the spiritual union of our youth here with the studious youth in the old country, and we therefore decided to contact them and keep in closest touch with them.</p>
   <p>These are very lofty objects, and we appeal to our young people and hope that they will co-operate with us in our work. In order to facilitate matters, we have eliminated all initiation and other fees.</p>
