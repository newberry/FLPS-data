   <p>A very solemn ceremony took place yesterday in St. Adalbert's parish. Misunderstandings, which for some time have been dividing the Poles there, have been settled, God grant, forever. All of the Polish Catholic societies have returned to complete harmony with the parish, and yesterday this reunion was celebrated during the consecration of the banners of three societies: Sacred Heart of Mary, Holy Name of Jesus, and St. Dominick's Mutual Aid.</p>
   <p>All of St. Adalbert's parish was beautifully decorated with banners and flowers. A colorful procession issued from Pulaski Hall, especially decorated for the occasion, at about one o'clock in the afternoon. The precession was led by the Krakus Society, followed by the Knights of St. Casimir and the Falcons. These were followed by the "Polish Group," the Polish Commerce and Tradesmen's Association, and other parish societies. Behind these marched the three societies with their new banners, youth societies, and delegates from the societies of other parishes. Finally, bringing up the rear, a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>great number of beautifully decorated carriages. It was a magnificent spectacle. Bands played, banners waved, and the national colors glistened in the sun. The procession marched in a great circle, and returned to the church.</p>
   <p>With the church filled to overflowing the memorable ceremony began at three o'clock in the afternoon. Solemn vespers were celebrated by the Reverend John Radziejewski, who also consecrated the banners. The Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek, of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, delivered a beautiful sermon, appropriate to the occasion. Expanding upon the words In hoc eight vinces, he urged his listeners to....persevere in their faith and in their nationalistic work.
