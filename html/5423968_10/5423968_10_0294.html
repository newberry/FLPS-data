   <p>Often we hear even from prominent people, that the priest should not mix with politics because it leads him out of the bounds of duties. His work and duty, they may, should deal with confessions and the pulpit, but the concern in public welfare, especially politics, should not the least concern him.</p>
   <p>Politics as we know is bad and false and yet we have the real and the sincere kind. The bad and the false politics depend upon hypocrisy, and unrest. Instead of working together for the benefit of the citizens, it leads us to dissensions, wrath, anger, debates and irritation among us. In this sort of politics there is no place for a priest, and no one shall find him there. No one yet has been the priest seducing the voters, or deceiving them with lies. So for this and many other a reason politics should concern only those who love to fish in muddy waters.</p>
