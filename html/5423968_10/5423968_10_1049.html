   <p>A revived Jacob Wajer Society under the protection of St. Francis Xavier, No. 1, held its annual meeting on Tuesday, December 12, during which a new administration for the year of 1894 was elected, as follows:</p>
   <p>Hubert Abraham, president (third term); John Jarzomber, vice-president; Theodore Jarzomber, recording secretary (third term); August Bobkowski, financial secretary; Frank Chwarczynski, treasurer (third term); Anthony Jarzombek, first marshal (sixth term); Valentine Manikowski, second marshal; Albert Block, August Jarzombek, and John Roda, trustees; John Drezgson, messenger; John Borski, sergeant at arms; John Block, Joseph Stromski, Joseph Piewkowski, Frank Stromski, Joseph Berman, and Anastasius Zaydler, Church-flag bearers; Andrew Witkowski, American-flag bearer.</p>
   <p>Two years ago this society was on the way to be dissolved, but through the efforts of Mr. Abraham it continued on intact. Through his efforts the society purchased a church flag at a cost of three hundred dollars. Mr. Abraham deserves sincere thanks for his troubles and work from the society. We are also deeply grateful to our pastor, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, for his efforts and good will.</p>
   <p>Theodore Jarzombek, secretary.</p>
