   <p>The ownership of the local weekly Sztandar has been transferred--as we have already announced--to the Polish Young Men's Alliance Of America. At present this paper is edited by Mr. Stanislaus Osada, former editor of the Buffalo Reforma (Reform), a defender of the Independents' schism in Buffalo.</p>
   <p>A very significant statement by Mr. Osada in the last issue of Sztandar reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"It has been proven in practice that Independent churches never enter the realm of ideals. In the ranks of the priests and civilian leaders of this movement there are too many contemptuous individuals who think only of their own pockets. Sad, but it is true".</p>
   <p>We repeat, such an assertion by Mr. Osada is interesting. We are glad however, that the Polish Young Men's Alliance of America, which is quite progressive, has announced in its own organ that it has nothing in common with the Independents.</p>
