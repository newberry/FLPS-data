   <p>The financial condition of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is eminently satisfactory in spite of the lies and calumnies cast upon it by anarchistic pamphlets and the Senator's organ in Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>The report for the fourth month after the convention, published in the last issue of Wiara I Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland), is sufficient proof.</p>
   <p>This report is as follows: In the fourth month, that is, from December 1, 1895, to January 1, 1896:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Income</td>
     <td>$7,580.36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Expense</td>
     <td>7,212.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Balance from December</td>
     <td>368.31</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Balance from first quarter</td>
     <td>$1.698.50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Net balance, as of Jan. 1, 1896</td>
     <td>$2,066.81</td>
    </tr>
   </table>

   <p>This is convincing proof that all talks to the effect that the Polish Roman Catholic Union is failing are deliberate and shameless falsehoods. Cash on hand is growing greater, and when the debts are paid this balance will be doubled.</p>
   <p>Jealous complaints, lies, and accusations cannot stop this.</p>
