   <p>The Pulaski Park Stamp Club held its initial meeting at Pulaski Park on Monday. The meeting was marked by an attendance of fifteen boys of Polish extraction. The interest manifested seems to indicate that the club will be successful in educating and instructing the youngsters in a useful and worth-while hobby.</p>
   <p>It is hardly necessary to point out that stamp collecting is of great value in teaching the stamp enthusiast geography, history, and facts about the peoples and countries all over the world.</p>
   <p>The newest branch of the stamp collecting hobby is the collecting of air mail stamps, of which a surprisingly large number has been issued during the last ten years. Some of these stamps are already rare and valuable.</p>
   
   <p>Roman Renowski, who is the organizer of the Pulaski Stamp Club, has been collecting stamps for a number of years and has an air mail stamp collection that is practically as complete as any in existence, and is worth several thousand dollars. Stamp collecting pays profits and gives cultural benefits as well. Boys who are interested are requested to attend meetings every Monday, at 7:30 P.M., at Pulaski Park.</p>
