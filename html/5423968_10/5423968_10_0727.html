   <p>Residents of St. Hedwig Parish--on the anniversary of the hanging of the Chicago anarchists--were witnesses of an unusual spectacle at which some looked on with smiling compassion and others with disdain, while still others looked on with painful hearts.</p>
   <p>Early in the morning many saloonkeepers, followers of Coxey's Army, with headquarters on Lubeck Street or on adjoining corners, hung out German flags, revolutionary French flags or banners of the "red" Socialists. This example was followed by their "customers" who decorated their homes with varicolored banners.</p>
   <p>These "businessmen" know what they were doing.</p>
   <p>Their "business" was flourishing with tattlers from all over than since early morning; beer and impressions flowed freely; steins and glasses circulated without restraint; humor began to grow. About noon all the saloons were crowded.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At about 2 P.M. musical bands began to make their appearances on Robey, Hoyne and other streets. When the blare of horns were heard all patrons of the saloons began to clear out. Some of the tipsy guests formed rows and began to waddle after the American flag-bearers.</p>
   <p>This parade went towards Lubeck Street where a large crowd was already gathered before the newly erected "All Saints Church". Four "compatriots", who formerly were Roman Catholic priests but who had fallen to such a degree that they were dropped from the ranks by the church authorities, awaited the paraders. These ex-priests were Kolaszewski of Cleveland, Klawiter of Buffalo and Kozlowski of Chicago, and an unknown ex-priest of Irish descent.</p>
   <p>To this foursome was added a fifth priest, Kaminski, a knight from Omaha, Nebraska, allegedly consecrated by Villate. This quintet was awaiting a certain Reverend M-----, who apparently decided not to take part in the "blessing" of this "Independent Church" in this metropolis bordering on Lake Michigan.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In the meantime it was decided that the five "priests" would be sufficient.</p>
   <p>Surely there was no other concern than to show the Poles, Germans and Irish that these so-called "priests," despite their excommunication by their local bishops, that they were "righteous Catholic priests," that they have the right to build "Catholic churches" and "bless" them just the same as bishops do.</p>
   <p>In accordance with this psychology speeches were made in Polish, German and Irish [sic] to a handful of befuddled persons--and a crowd of inquisitive individuals who wanted to see the comedy. The befuddled attendents, and in part influenced by....drink, loudly applauded the "priests"; while the sober persons smiled ironically and did not trouble to remove their hats during the sacrilegious ceremony.</p>
   <p>The new style "priests", in conformity with their own sacrilegious practices, "sprinkled" [pleased] the assembly, not forgetting about one thing--money <span class="page-break">\4</span>[apparently reference to making a collection]. They walked among the crowd and asked for contributions in God's grace.</p>
   <p>After the "Blessing" of the "new Catholic Church" of the independent followers of Coxey, forty-hour devotional services were started, to which all the wranglers from all Catholic parishes were invited. Those who will attend these services will receive perpetual forgiveness for all their sins, mortal and venial, under the following conditions: that they renounce connection with priests who are complacent to the orders of the bishops and the Pope in Rome; that they must not make offerings to the true church but only to the "holy temple" of the schismatics; that they must make a declaration that only the "churches independent of Rome" are the true "Rome Catholic Churches".</p>
   <p>This is a summary of the events that took place yesterday in the once pious, proud and peaceful St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>Goodliness, sottishness, wrangling and subversiveness ran rampart in this community from early dawn till sunset.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Is everything lest at St. Hedwig Parish?</p>
   <p>O, no!....things are not as bad as all that.</p>
   <p>Beside this group of confused and evil-thinking people live in a large group of righteous members, true Catholics, of St. Hedwig Church.</p>
   <p>As is customary, the peals of St. Hedwig Church bells called its flock in orderly fashion for the three divine services. All masses were attended by capacity crowds. The local servant of God [the Reverend John Piechowski, C. R., pastor of St. Hedwig Church], after an example of the Pope, who during the manifestations of the Masons in Rome went to the grave of St. Peter to offer prayers for the faithless, explained to the faithful the useless deeds of the devil. Seeing their pastor fall to his knees, the congregation fell to its knees and beseeched the Lord to forgive those that have strayed from the true faith.</p>
