   <p>....Our Polish youth will not permit itself to be caught by the current of influences which are supported in part by bewildered people who are in the hands of self-appointed prophets. These prophets are in the service and pay of the Muscovites the schismatic enemies of our religion and nation. The road which we should follow is shown by our cardinals, such as Cardinal Ledochowski, and by our archbishops and the thousands of priests appointed to the service of God by the bishops. These are the servants that are true to the Pope at Rome and who show us the light. This is the only faith that our Polish youth understands and they should be taught no other.</p>
