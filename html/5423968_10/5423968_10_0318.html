   <p>The parish district between the Stanislaus and Jadwigian churches, contained many Irish but with the N. M. P. church proclamation it began to populate largely with Polish families. The Stanislau church couldn't accommodate its people, due to the coming of new parishioners, therefore at the meeting of the church committee, Fr. Winc. Barzynski moved to organize a new and larger parish, between the Stanislau and Jadwigian. The committee agreed on the proposition of starting a new parish and Fr. W. Barzynski recommended that Fr. Andrew Spetz and Fr. Francis Gordon seek a suitable place for the new church. The search was successful. They found a large place - free from buildings - between Paulina and Wood Streets, Bloomingdale Road and Clybourn Place - totaling 96 lots, namely, two blocks. The owner of this land didn't want to sell part of this plot.</p>

   <p>Furthermore, Fr. Winc. Barzynski together with the Stanislaus committee on looking the place over, decided to buy the two blocks, but first they had to get permission from the Archbishop, to construct a new parish, and to buy the land.</p>
   <p>On November 22, 1898, Fr. Andrew, C. R. went to Archbishop P. A. Feehan and obtained permission to construct a new parish and purchase the land. The owner of the land was Mr. Swift, living in New York. His agent was the firm Haberar &amp; Delfose.</p>
   <p>On November 30, 1898, Fr. A. Spetz concluded the buying contract, for the sum of $60,000.00 and the commission agents $1,500.00.</p>

   <p>YEAR 1899.</p>
   <p>January 18, 1899, after transfering the papers through an attorney, Mr. Swift in the presence of his agents and Fr. Francis Gordon, transferred the right to the land - with the permission of the Archbishop to Fr. Andrew Spetz, who gave Mr. Swift a bank check for $60,000.00 and the agent a check for $1,000.00, whereby they gave their commission of $500.00 for the good of the new church.</p>
   <p>The money to buy the land was borrowed from the bank for 4 months at 4 1/2 per cent yearly. Archbishop P. A. Feehan and Fr. Francis Gordon as pastor of the new church signed the note for the money.</p>

   <p>TITLE OF THE NEW PARISH</p>
   <p>The new name of the church and parish was "Blessed Mary Virgin Angelica."</p>
   <p>The name was chosen because of:</p>
   <p>1. There was no church under such name in Chicago.</p>
   <p>2. That this holyday falls in the summer months, when it is easy to obtain help.</p>

   <p>PARTITIONING THE LAND</p>
   <p>The land purchased was divided into two parcels, one block between Hermitage Avenue, and Wood-Clybourn Place and Bloomingdale Road for the use of the new parish and the other between Paulina and Hermitage was offered for sale - the money to be used by the new parish to build an edifice, which would contain: church, school, hall for the societies and a big hall for gatherings and performances, at the same time a temporary home for the priest.</p>
