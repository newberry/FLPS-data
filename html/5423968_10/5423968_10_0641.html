   <p>The projected Polish Catholic Congress of America is progressing very satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>We are authorized to announce that during the forty-hour devotion at the St. John Cantius Parish in Chicago, the contemplated Catholic Congress was very thoroughly discussed by all the priests (including a few from out of town).</p>
   <p>Everyone, without exception, thought well of the project and promised his heartiest support.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously we read in the Gazeta Katolicka:</p>
   <p>"The project of calling a Polish Catholic Congress in America is creating a great deal of interest even in the old country, as we have been able to infer <span class="page-break">\2</span>from a letter received from Wielko Polska (Greater Poland), which assures us that the Congress can be sure of full support. Several prominent Catholic men have expressed their willingness to come to America to participate in the deliberations of the Congress."</p>
   <p>Briefly, when we examine all these comments of the Polish press, the assurances by the priests, the applications of societies and other similar expressions it becomes clear that the necessity of and the benefits to be derived from such a Polish Congress Of Catholics is perfectly understood by them and loudly proclaimed by all who desire the welfare of the Poles in America. This Congress should therefore become a fact.</p>
   <p>In view of all of this, isn't it time to get to work, to actual preliminary preparations for the Congress? That is the question which we place before all good-thinking people.</p>
