   <p>Whenever a society is organized for the purpose of training children, either physically or morally, the parents should take an interest in such an organization, support it and urge their children to become members.</p>
   <p>It is expressly desired to draw attention to the Cadets' Society of Holy Trinity Parish, organized three years ago by the pastor, Reverend Casimir Sztuczko. When Mr. Czechowski was appointed teacher of the local parish school he was also entrusted with the care of this society, which numbered eighteen members at that time. Because of Mr. Czechowicz's military training and ability to handle children he succeeded in more than doubling the number of members. It is expected that the present membership of forty will be increased to a hundred.</p>

   <p>This number, however, is inadequate. The writer is familiar with an organization in Chicago that has over six hundred children enrolled, for which the parents pay two hundred dollars annually as membership fees. The above-mentioned society offers free instruction. Why cannot our children take advantage of this opportunity and attend classes twice weekly?</p>
   <p>It certainly is much better to be a cadet with something to do than just to run about the streets at random. The former gets basic instruction, the latter cannot possibly pick up anything constructive on the streets.</p>
   <p>The parents of Holy Trinity Parish should remember the Cadets' society. Officers of this organization are: J. Wasiderski, captain; J. Mallek and J. Gorny, assistant captains; J. Kowalski, sergeant; M. Dyniewicz, T. Litewski, and L. Lechert, corporals.</p>
