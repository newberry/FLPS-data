   <p>I wish to thank the societies of The Immaculate Conception Parish of South Chicago, as well as the societies from my parish, for their generous offerings made during the celebration of the anniversary of the November Insurrection held on November 29. The collection amounted to $27.85 of which I gave $13.95 to the treasurer of the Central Committee of the Lwow Exposition and $13.90 to the Sisters of Nazareth for their hospital.</p>
