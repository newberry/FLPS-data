   <p>Reverend John Radziejewski, the well-known and greatly respected pastor of St. Adalbert Parish, yesterday celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his work in the Lord's vineyard. It was a holiday in St. Adalbert Parish.</p>
   <p>Many clergymen participated in the celebration. There were two priests of other nationality--Reverend Molitor, a Bohemian priest who, years ago, organized St. Adalbert Parish, and Very Reverend Jaeger, about of the Bohemian Benedictine Fathers. Chicago was represented by the following priests: Very Reverend S. Kobrzynski, Reverend W. Barzynski, Francis Szulak, J. Barzynski, Francis Lange, A. Nowicki, J. Kasprzycki, M. Pyplats, Casmir Sztuczko, W. Zalewski, Fuhrman, Byrgier, T. Ruszynski, B. Zmijewski, S. Cosimi, T. Szypkowski, J. Pidchowski, F. Mathuszewski, J. Gieburowski, A. Kozlowski.</p>
   <p>From out of town came: Reverend Dabrowski, from Detroit, Michigan, Reverend Wojtalewicz, from Hammond, Indiana; and Reverend Slominski, from Joliet, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Almost all Polish clergymen of Chicago were present. At 10 A.M., a solemn High Mass began. It was celebrated by Reverend John Radziejewski. He was assisted by Reverend Molitor as deacon, and by Reverend Joseph Barzynski as subdeacon. Reverend Slominski, former assistant to the celebrant, was master of ceremonies. Reverend Dabrowski, of Detroit, Michigan, a former colleague of the celebrant at the Polish college and seminary in Rome, delivered a beautiful sermon. In touching words, the preacher recalled the past, and told the audience about the hard work and hardships which the celebrant had experienced.</p>
   <p>After the church service, the clergymen gathered at the rectory and congratulated Father Radziejewski.</p>
   <p>Then, dinner was served, during which toasts were made in honor of the pastor of St. Adalbert Parish, and public affairs were discussed. The first toast was given by Father V. Barzynski. Short complimentary speeches were also made by Reverends F. Szulak, A. Nowicki, Dabrowski, Slominski, and others. Attention should be given to two Polish speeches delivered by an Italian, Reverend S. Cosimi, and a Bohemian, Reverend Molitor.</p>
   <p>A venerable missionary, Reverend Francis Szular, spoke very ardently about the Polish League, and, assisted by Reverend F. Lange, took up a collection for the benefit of that institution. The collection brought thirty-two dollars and sixty-nine cents. All participants donated very gladly, and promised to support the League.</p>
   <p>During the dinner, a letter of congratulation, and a beautiful poem, sent by the Polish Women's Central Society in America, were read. The poem was written by Mrs. T. Smolinski, president of the Society. The Abbot, Reverend Jaeger, presented the letter to the assembly, and Reverend V. Barzynski read it.</p>
   
   <p>Many telegrams and letters of congratulation were received. One was sent by the Sisters of Nazareth from Rome, and another from Reverend J. Pitass, of Buffalo, New York. Others were from the Polish Theological Seminary, Detroit, Michigan; Stanislaus Slominski, vice-president of the Polish National Alliance, Chicago, and so forth.</p>
   <p>A suitable celebration was held at the school hall in the evening. Parish societies congratulated their pastor, and the children staged a play.</p>
   <p>The jubilee was a great success.</p>
   <p>We wish to add that Father Dabrowicz [elsewhere spelled "Dabrowski"], from Detroit, Michigan, who will also celebrate a silver jubilee of his priesthood in August, invited all participants to join him on the occasion.</p>
