   <p>The charges which appeared in the Dziennik Zwiazkowy of September 26, 1916, in the matter of the legal action taken by the Polish Roman Catholic Union against Messrs. Szepinski and Krolik, its former president and secretary respectively, are definitely without foundation. Further arguments before the master in chancery will not be heard until October 2, 1916, at 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>Attorney N. L. Pictrewski accuses Messrs. Szopinski and Krolik of unwillingness to explain the charges made against them. This charge is unfounded because they were ready to answer the accusations at the very beginning. They even went to the convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union which was held at Syracuse, New York,traveling at their own expense, but were not permitted to have the floor because Mr. Piotrowski was all set with his own decision. Mr. Pictrowski is not in a position to pronounce any judgment since he did not conduct the prosecution and had very little to do with the matter. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>prosecution was conducted by the late Attorney Bumphrey, who acted on behalf of Mr. Piotrowski. Attorney Bumphrey conducted the case until even he became disgusted because of the lack of evidence and finally decided to give it up, stating that he was only Mr. Piotrowski's assistant. He was notified on several occasions to appear before the court, but all to no avail. And what did Mr. Piotrowski do during that time? He was traveling in Europe and did not follow the court proceedings.</p>
   <p>The case came up before Judge Foell. Attorney Bumphrey asked that it be postponed until Mr. Piotrowski's return. The judge, however denied the motion, and the defense was also against postponement, since Mr. Piotrowski himself had never conducted the prosecution. His presence would have had no bearing on the matter, he being merely an interpreter. As a result Judge Foell has correctly sent the case back to the master in chancery.</p>
   <p>According to the latest report of the master in chancery it appears that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Szopinski has answered all the charges except that concerning the disposition of some thirty-five dollars, and Mr. Krolik has accounted for two checks, one for a thousand dollars and the other for $222.42, for which the master in chancery requests a clearer explanation.</p>
   <p>It seems that Mr. Piotrowski profited the most from the whole process, since he exposed the Polish Roman Catholic to huge expense. The Union thus far has paid out six thousand dollars to prosecute the case, and Mr. Piotrowski claims that the organization still owes him money. And for what?</p>
