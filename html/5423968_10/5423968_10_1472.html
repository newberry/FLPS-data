   <p>These groups have promised that May 30, Memorial Day, they will visit the cemetery where many of our brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers are resting in peace;the most important part of their march is to visit and decorate the grave of our most Rev. Father Vincent Barzynski, a true Polish patriot.</p>
   <p>The program for the march is as follows: At 7 o'clock in the morning the Society of Cadets of St. George at the parish of St. John Cantius, will join the Cadets of St. Stanislaus, and then march to St. Hedwigs where they will join the Cadets of Kosciuszko. At the Norwood Park station they will unfold their flags and Polish banners and march to pay tribute at the monument of the Most Rev. Father Vincent Barzynski, where the cadets will hear a mass and a sermon, after which the cadets will fire a salute to pay honor to our most reverend father and to our Polish veterans, they they will pay honor to the heroes of American wars by firing a volley at their graves.</p>
