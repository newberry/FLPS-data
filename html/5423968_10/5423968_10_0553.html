   <p>In the last issue of Polak W Ameryce (The Pole in America), among a number of opinions and expressions regarding the scope and program to be undertaken by the future Polish Catholic Congress in America, we find an article written by Mr. Clemens J. Bielinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union (under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus).</p>
   <p>Mr. Bielinski endorses the following points that must be settled at the Congress:</p>
   <p>1. Solidifying peace and brotherly love among our Polish Catholic clergy.</p>
   <p>2. Condemning the "Independent" churches.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>3. Condemning liberal-patriotic societies that are inimical to the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>4. Combining all Catholic organizations.</p>
   <p>5. Perfecting the parochial schools.</p>
   <p>6. Organizing a seminary for priests.</p>
   <p>7. The question of a Polish bishop.</p>
   <p>8. Condemning immoral and scandalous newspapers.</p>
   <p>9. The Polish Immigration Home.</p>
   <p>10. A census of the Polish population in the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In addition, Mr. Bielinski proposes that we secure at least one Austrian consul of Polish extraction in the United States of America. Such a consul could be of great service to the Poles who come here from Galicia, Poland.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bielinski's letter touches on practically all of the important questions that should be submitted to the Congress, and it was written in beautiful style.</p>
