   <p>"The Patriotic Organization of St. John Cantius Parish in Chicago has undertaken a very important cause and is asking for the help and co-operation of all Poles in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Taking into consideration the fact that the Polish workingmen in America, having to associate at work with people of all kinds of principles and convictions, are exposed to various temptations and to the danger of losing their faith, their morality, and their national spirit, the Patriotic Organization has decided, with the consent of Reverend J. Kasprzycki, pastor of the parish, to organize a Polish workers' society.</p>
   <p>"The Patriotic Organization has been forced to this quick action by the circumstance that anarchic propaganda is being spread among the Poles, <span class="page-break">2</span>propaganda which, as we know, usually creeps among the working class first.</p>
   <p>"In order to counteract this tendency, the Patriotic Organization of St. John Cantius Parish has chosen a special committee to take charge of this matter. The committee consists of Anthony Chabowski, Basil Kowalski, Robert Czaja, Francis Osuch, and Joseph Kielczynski.</p>
   <p>"This committee met on March 18, 1894. The meeting was opened with a prayer by Reverend Florian Matuszewski, after which Anthony Chabowski was named chairman and Basil Kowalski secretary.</p>
   <p>"After a short debate, the committee, at the suggestion of Reverend Florian Matuszewski, decided to name the newly-formed body "Towarzystwo Katolickie Polskich Robotnikow" (Catholic Society of Polish Workers).</p>
   <p>"The purpose of this new society will be to combat anarchy, to provide sick benefits, and to find work for its members.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"In order to attain its objective, the Society will give speeches and lectures at its meetings; it will also organize workers' societies and will maintain an information bureau.</p>
   <p>"At the suggestion of Father Matuszewski, it was resolved to contact all influential persons in Chicago who understand the situation, asking them to co-operate with the committee; to appeal to the Polish working people in Chicago, and to support this cause at the coming Polish mass meeting [to organize the Polish League of America].</p>
   <p>"The meeting then was closed. The next meeting will be held on April 5, at St. John Cantius School hall.</p>
   <p>"The Patriotic Organization asks all to support this good cause.</p>
   <p>"Anthony Chabowski, president;</p>
   <p>"Basil Kowalski, secretary</p>
