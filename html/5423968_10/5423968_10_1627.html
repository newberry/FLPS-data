   <p>Readers will recall that we thoroughly discussed the immigration question when it was being debated, and that we and other Polish newspapers as well as the non-Polish press that was directly interested in this matter warned of fatal consequences and odd and silly situations that would be brought about by the passage of the immigration bill in Congress. The bill limiting immigration to our country for some time in the future has been passed, as we all know. We remind you that this new law limits the quota of immigrants from each country that may be admitted to the United States, and that a number is fixed which cannot be exceeded in one year. And so for us Poles the quota has been set and is being strictly adhered to.</p>
   <p>We remind you again that while fighting the bill limiting the immigration into this country, we argued and showed what odd and absurd circumstances might, <span class="page-break">2</span>nay must, result from so silly a law, making of America a kind of Sesame opening to some charmed word of bureaucracy and actually treating human beings as cattle. They will count them by heads and bunches, divide them in groups, sort them out, admit, separate, send them back, and so forth--to this at least points this grand theory with all its possibilities and consequences. It may so happen, we wrote, that a husband will not be permitted to bring his wife here, that families will be separated and divided, and that the silliest and most immoral eventualities will be created, thanks to this "enlightened" law which in theory should serve as a floodgate for the trough carrying water to the millwheel of Americanization; when there is enough water for a certain time, or when it flows too fast, the floodgate is let down, the trough is closed, and the intake is down to zero. Let us suppose that a big fish and a little fish, its daughter, are swimming in this current; it may so happen that the old lady will make the grade and be carried over the dam, but the little fish will remain on the other side of the obstruction--not admitted, deprived of protection, it will finally die.</p>
   <p>This comparison, clumsy as it is, finds many parallels because of the monstrosities caused by the new immigration law. The immigration officials, in <span class="page-break">3</span>order to control and facilitate their work, have divided yearly quotas into monthly allotments, and acting exactly like our lawmakers, they have cut up human groups into smaller groups which are permitted to enter every month, and not a soul more. A fine mess! And so in practice, much sooner than it was expected, the following incident occurred. A certain Polish woman who had lived in America for a long time went with her children to the old country for a few months to visit her relatives. The woman left with four children, and the husband remained in Chicago. Now the wife is returning to America, but with a somewhat enlarged group, for while she was in Poland, her fifth child,was born, which she, of course, is taking with her to its father in Chicago. It so happened, as an evidence of the brilliant mentality of the lawmakers, that the Polish quota for that month had already been exhausted; this woman has been registered with four children, and after proper arithmetical calculations the result was so many heads. For the fifth child, above the Polish quota for this month, there is no room. The unfortunate mother is dragged to Ellis Island and there is told that her two-month-old baby cannot be admitted to the "free land of Washington". The unavoidable <span class="page-break">4</span>consequence is that the child must be returned to the place from which it came--to Europe. Such is the law, such the rule: But as they say, every law can be evaded; so in this case a way was found to get around the law. With the intervention of the proper authority--a cabinet officer--the Polish baby was admitted to the United States.</p>
   <p>This matter has finally been settled. But this is not the important question; the important part is that here the senselessness of this law has been shown in all its fullness, creating monstrous complications and situations which necessitate evading the law if [those in authority] wish to listen to their consciences and be human. The only alternative would be to drive a child or a whole family away or to separate it, even if it be against the rules and principles of morality, which are enforced here to their hypocritical limit and with Puritanical exactitude. What can one think of such a law? Nothing else but that it is legalized lawlessness, that it is sanctioned wrong. What can one think of the lawmakers who make such laws? Nothing else but that they are just plain jingoists unequal to the high demands of their noble <span class="page-break">5</span>calling.</p>
   <p>All this grievously harms the dignity of the country and of its authorities. It is impossible to arrive at a different conclusion.</p>
