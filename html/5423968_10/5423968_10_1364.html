   <p>A Federal employment bureau has been established in the Polish Roman Catholic Union building. Its office hours are from 8:30 A. M. to 4 P. M. and from 6 P. M. to 9 P. M. daily except Saturday. On Saturday the bureau is open from 8:30 A. M. to 12 M. Those in search of employment may be interviewed in Polish, since only Poles are employed in the office. The manager of this bureau, or rather the examiner, is Mr. Max S. Weber, a Pole, born and reared in St. Hedwig's parish. He is well known because of his activities. The best proof of this is the fact that although he is but twenty-three years of age, he has been intrusted with so important a position.</p>
   <p>Every person who wishes to obtain Government employment should file an application at the office and thus [be in line to] secure a well-paying position. It is a well-known fact that there still are many of our people who receive meager renumeration for their work. This condition should be <span class="page-break">2</span>remedied in view of the present high cost of living. Consequently, if any one is in such a position and wishes to better himself financially, he should turn to the above-mentioned Federal bureau of employment. Thus he may obtain a better and more lucrative position. In addition, he will by working on a Government project aid this nation to win the war.</p>
   <p>Work can be obtained either here in Chicago or at some location outside the city. That depends upon the applicant, who when he applies to the bureau will be properly served by people of his own nationality employed in the office. These office employees endeavor to give to every one who applies the best position [available].</p>
   <p>Our people are therefore urged to make use of so unusual an opportunity to assist themselves and at the same time to aid the American Government to win the war.</p>
