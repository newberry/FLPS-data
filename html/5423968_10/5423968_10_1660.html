   <p>At the time when the representatives to Congress debated the matter of the President's veto of the proposed Smith-Burnett Anti-immigration Bill, the Polish society established for the purpose of combating unjust immigration limitations paused to consider what methods to apply to make certain that the newly-proposed bill does not become a law. The meeting of this society was held at the La Salle Hotel in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Casimir Zychlinski, the president of the Polish National Alliance, presided, and Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, Election Commissioner and the secretary of the Polish Immigration League, kept the minutes. The delegates to Washington, the Reverend J. Sobieszczyk and Miss Emily Napieralska, gave a report of their activities. They received an enthusiastic ovation for sincerely and capably representing the group in their interview with President Wilson.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Attention was then directed to the enemies of immigration, since there is still fear that the chauvinists will not give up. There is a possibility that they will employ every method to make Congress override the President's veto and make the Anti-immigration Bill a law.</p>
   <p>"The Poles in America," said one of the speakers, "cannot count upon what other nationalities will accomplish for us. To them we are only a number of votes; to those who do not know the soul of a Polish immigrant we are good only at the time of elections, when we are needed. But when there is a question of sincere and proper representation of interests of immigrant Poles, we must do the work for ourselves, because no one will do it for us. Someone must be in the capital of the United States who will watch the interests of Poles, who will not allow congressmen, senators, and other influential officials to be misinformed concerning Polish-Americans. Other nationalities have their representatives, while we Poles--especially now, when even the eyes of warring European powers are turned upon the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>nation's capital--have no one there. In accordance with what has been related by the delegates, and in view of what has been said by previous speakers, I make a motion that this society choose a delegation to appear at the nearest meeting of the Polish Central Relief Committee. The delegation is to present this matter and request that this highest Polish immigrant institution today recognize the question of sending a representative to the Capitol as most urgent. The Polish Central Relief Committee should, therefore, pause before sending a delegate to Washington."</p>
   <p>The motion was passed and the selection of delegates followed. The following delegates were chosen: Mr. Lesnicki, Attorney L. Mallek, Mr. Dalkowski, and the Reverend John Sobieszczyk. They will appear at the nearest meeting of the Polish Central Relief Committee to present the matter. When Secretary Czarnecki was reading the names of the delegates he received information by telephone that the Congress had sustained the President's veto. The news was received with a thunderous wave of applause. Miss <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>E. Napieralski then made a motion to send a telegram of thanks to the President immediately. The motion was passed unanimously. The following committee was named to prepare a proper resolution: Miss E. Napieralski, Reverend J. Sobieszczyk, and Attorney L. Mallek.</p>
   <p>The telegram sent to the President is as follows:</p>
   <p>February 4, 1915.</p>
   <p>To Honorable President Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>President of the United States,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to you upon Congress' sustaining today your veto of the Immigration Bill, which contains the inhuman, unjust, and un-American literacy clause. Representatives of organizations of American citizens <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of Polish birth and descent, in a meeting assembled today, in the Hotel La Salle in Chicago, join in voicing their earnest thanks and sincere appreciation for your just and patriotic veto of the bill. We and the four million of our fellow citizens of Polish birth and descent throughout the United States are happy with you over your victory in Congress.</p>
   <p>The Right Reverend Bishop Paul Rhode, president; Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, treasurer; Election Commisioner Anthony Czarnecki, secretary. Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance; Peter Rostenkowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Mrs. Anna Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, and Attorney Leon Mallek, Attorney Louis Pinderski, Attorney Alexander Smietanka, Attorney Peter Mindak, Attorney Peter Schwaba, Attorney Joseph Lisack, Reverend Francis Gordon, Reverend John Sobieszczyk, Reverend Louis Grudzinski, Reverend Francis Karabasz, Attorney Julius F. Smietanka, Attorney August Urbanski, Miss E. Napieralski, Dr. Alexander Prominski, Joseph Magdziarz, John S. Konopa, Frank S. Barc, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Dr. Adam Szwajkart, Frank Dalkowski, Louis Lesnicki, Stephen Kolanowski, Thomas Lasecki, Charles Szczerbowski, Stephen Napieralski, Dr. T. M. Napieralski, John Zawilinski, Stanley Szwajkart, Stanley Orpiszewski, Leon Zamorski, Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>The deliberations were continued, although the matter of the amendment to the immigration laws was not removed--as Election Commissioner A. Czarnecki justly avers. In thirty days new people will come to Congress whom the chauvinists will again be able to approach with dishonest propositions of restricting the immigration laws. This new Congress must also be informed on Polish matters from the Polish point of view and not from the standpoint of American chauvinists and lobbyists of labor organizations. The masses of these labor organizations are certainly not in accord with the restrictions, although the lobbyists always call upon them and always protest in their name.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Many members of the League expressed the fear that the lobbyists wishing to enact the Anti-immigration Bill at any cost would not rest. The members then considered the best ways to inform the general public of any such chauvinistic attempts. A motion was finally passed that a committee be chosen for the purpose of informing the labor masses of foreign descent of the dangers of combating immigration by the union lobbyists. This committee will prepare a plan to oppose the anti-immigration efforts, which are not in accord with the American spirit and the interests of Polish immigration.</p>
   <p>The following members have been selected to serve on this committee: Louis Lesnicki, F. S. Barc, Charles Szczerbowski, Attorneys Peter Mindak, August Urbanski and Louis Pinderski.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Neuman then made a motion to express the League's sincere gratitude to Commissioner Anthony Czarnecki for seeing to it that those present at this meeting were informed by telephone of the results of the <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>vote in Congress. The motion was carried unanimously. In view of the fact that all business matters of the Polish Immigration League were exhausted, president C. Zychlinski adjourned the meeting.</p>
