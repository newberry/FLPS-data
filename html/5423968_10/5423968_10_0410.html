   <p>Dear compatriots! It is sad, to say the least, when one looks upon what is occurring in our parish.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago the solemn blessing of the flags of the Bohemian Knights' Society took place. Many Polish societies took part in this affair. The pastor of the Bohemian parish, located at 18th and Allport Streets, delivered a beautiful sermon to Poles and Bohemians. In the course of his address he spoke thus:</p>
   <p>"He who is Polish is a Catholic; he who is Bohemian is an unbeliever."</p>
   <p>This statement can no longer be repeated in our parish, for many of us are becoming unbelievers. But our unbelievers are quite different from the Bohemians, <span class="page-break">2</span>who merely stop being Catholics, for the Poles immediately wish to pass for better Catholics, better than our bishops and priests and all their followers.</p>
   <p>They are severing their connections with our religion, for which nine centuries age St. Adalbert died as a martyr, and for which St. Stanislaus lost his life, defending the principles laid down by Christ. Because of this they are being excluded from the Roman Catholic Church, which is guided by the vicar of Christ at Rome, to whom the entire Polish nation pledges obedience; for that nation is proud to call itself Catholic and Polish.</p>
   <p>And whom will they recognize as the shepherd of their souls? A wild perverted goat [one who opposes religious beliefs, i.e., Roman Catholic beliefs] from Lagiew, a city of occupied Poland, leaders from Biedrus and Schoehousen [also cities of Poland]. We are well acquainted with these gentlemen, especially with the collector who was executing his "mission" in the St. Casimir parish community, and who has enlisted a committee of some kind in this parish for the purpose of getting money from the parishioners to build some sort of <span class="page-break">3</span>idolator's puppet show.</p>
   <p>Helpers from Lagiew, Biedrus, and Schoenhousen also took part in this drive. They expected to collect thousands of dollars; however, they gathered a sum that would not be sufficient for treats in a saloon. Our faith in St. Adalbert's parish was not allowed to be covered in shame and disgrace.</p>
   <p>Dear brothers and compatriots! Let us remain what we have always been: true children of the Roman Catholic Church! Let us not permit ourselves to be duped by false speeches or by polemic papers. We have enough reading material in the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Wiara I Ojczyzna [Faith and the Fatherland], or even the Narod [People]. Why don't we throw out the newspapers from our homes that tend to sow discord instead of harmony, to confuse us instead of enlightening us! For they make us look like animals rather than children of God. Let us all cry in unison, as Poles and as Catholics, before the steps of our altars:</p>
   <p>"From fire and famine, from pestilence, war, and independent schism, good Lord, <span class="page-break">4</span>deliver us!"</p>
   <p>A Parishioner of St. Adalbert's </p>
