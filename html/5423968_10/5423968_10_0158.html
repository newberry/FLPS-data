   <p>The St. Cecelia's Choir, of St. Adalbert's Church, gave a concert last Sunday, October 29, at 8 P. M., in Pulaski Hall, 1711-15 South Ashland Avenue. The most outstanding singers took part in this concert, and as a result the program was very satisfactory. The proceeds from the concert were donated to a very noble cause, namely, to the construction of a new St. Adalbert's Church; therefore, a great many people attended, arriving from various districts of Chicago. They applauded the singers enthusiastically. The members of the arrangements committee were: Reverend K. Gronkowski, honorary president and treasurer; B. Kujawski, president; J. Rybicki, L. Bonk, F. Witt, A. Kempska, and A. Serdynska.</p>
