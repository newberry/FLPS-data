   <p>This Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, has for some time been writing upon the question of what influence the World War of 1914 will have upon immigration. Today we also have the [views of] American newspapers, which [recently] sounded an alarm, prophesying that with the termination of the war all hungry Europe will invade the United States and deprive its citizens of employment. These newspapers are now beginning to change their opinion. They are beginning to regard this matter from our point of view.</p>
   <p>In fact, one of the American newspapers even devotes a long article to this very important matter. The article is supported by statistics, and the writer comes to the conclusion that the war will lessen immigration considerably and will even cause the return of the most desirable and most useful immigrants, which can only result in a great loss to this nation. The author's premises are contained in the following deductions: In the first place, it is a certainty that the nations now at war will use every method <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>available to hold back from emigration their priceless human material. Secondly, it may be expected that Europe, pressed by lack of working hands, will endeavor to take away the laborer from America, which on the one hand will avert the calamity of unemployment but on the other hand will be a great loss to the capitalistic exploiters. Thirdly, the nationalistic and racial elements in American immigration will change, and the change will be for the worse for America.</p>
   <p>The author substantiates this third statement by referring to statistics. He points out that it is exactly the countries involved in the war which provide the most useful immigrants for the United States. He places Poles, Bohemians, and Slovaks at the head. In the number of marriages they exceed more than threefold the Germanic element and sixfold to sevenfold the other nationalities and races. In the same way the statistics on real-estate purchases place these Slavonic people in first place by a great majority. This demonstrates their sense of economy and their civic intelligence.</p>

   <p>In one word, the author considers these Slavonic people the best material for American citizens, especially since their linguistic abilities and the ease with which they adapt themselves to their environment have no equal. It is exactly these immigrants that America will lose, and in return it will receive more Italians, Hollanders, Irish, Scandinavians, and immigrants from the Spanish peninsula and from the East. According to Mr. Howe, the Immigration Commissioner at Ellis Island, the reports show that the flow of immigrants has decreased to one third the number which arrived last year. In this number there is a complete absence of Poles, Bohemians, and Slovaks, those who have always been considered the strongest and most diligent workers. America faces a very important problem, the author concludes.</p>
