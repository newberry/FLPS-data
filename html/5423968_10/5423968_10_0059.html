   <p>Yesterday, at four o'clock in the afternoon, the body of the late Archbishop Joseph Weber, who died Sunday [Mar. 24] at the Resurrection Fathers' Home in Cragin, was moved from St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Church, where it had lain in state since Monday, to St. Stanislaus Kostka Church on Noble Street.</p>
   <p>The body was moved by Reverend Stanislaus Swierka, pastor of the Church in Cragin, and his assistants, Reverend John Zoechlik as deacon and Reverend Leon Siess as subdeacon. The casket was carried by Reverend B. Cieslak, John Sobieszczyk, V. Swientek, Stephen Kowalski, Francis Siara, and W. Filipski, all of the Resurrection Order.</p>
   <p>At St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, the body was received by Reverend Pastor F. n, after which the priests and organists sang requiem vespers. After vespers, the body was laid in state and viewed by the faithful until very late at night. It can easily be said that thousands of people came to St. Stanislaus Kostka Church to pay their last respects to this Polish priest.</p>
   <p>Funeral Ceremony</p>
   <p>The funeral services began at ten o'clock this morning, with hundreds of people in the church, many of whom came to the funeral from outlying districts.</p>
   <p>At ten o'clock, the priests sang the Wigilia, after which Archbishop George W. Mundelein, D. D., celebrated requiem mass. He was assisted by Reverend Francis Gordon as archpriest, Reverend L. Grudzinski, diocese consultor, as deacon, and Reverend Stanislaus Siatka as subdeacon. Reverend F. Wojtalewicz was honorary subdeacon, and Reverends Dennis J. Dunne, D. D., and Leon Jasinski, D. D., were masters of ceremony. In addition to these, there were a number of bishops and prelates who had been invited to the ceremony in the presbytery.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the wishes expressed by the deceased shortly before his death, no speeches were made either in church or at the cemetery.</p>
   <p>Upon conclusion of the services in church at about twelve o'clock noon, the funeral cortege left the church, led by Reverend Stanislaus Nawrocki. The funeral procession was a simple one, in accordance with the wishes of the deceased, who, on a number of occasions before his death, requested of his confreres that his funeral be a modest one. It should be mentioned here, however, that a great many Polish priests, even from outlying districts, came to render their last service to this outstanding churchman and Pole.</p>
   <p>Bishop Paul Rhode of Green Bay, Wisconsin, arrived yesterday afternoon. A great many priests of other nationalities also attended.</p>
   <p>The funeral procession, led by Reverend Sobieszczyk and M. Ligman, moved down Noble Street to Division Street, then via Division, Dickson and Leavitt Streets to Fullerton Avenue and thence to Milwaukee Avenue [to St. Adalbert's Cemetery].</p>
   
   <p>At the cemetery, the funeral cortege was led by Reverand W. Zapala, rector of the St. Stanislaus Kostka High School, assisted by Reverend Siatka and John Obyrtacz. The same priests who carried the casket from the church in Cragin were pallbearers at the cemetery, while the guard of honor consisted of members of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish committee.</p>
   <p>The body of the late Archbishop was laid to rest in the Resurrection Order's mausoleum at the St. Adalbert Cemetery in Niles.</p>
   <p>From the life of the deceased Polish churchman two facts are outstanding. First, he was a priest whose heart and soul were in the Polish cause; he worked for Poland, and when the present war broke out he often expressed the wish that Poland would very soon be free and independent again. Every setback of the Poles pained him; he feared that, should the Prussians win the war, not only would Poland lose its chance of ever regaining independence, but the Polish people would be subjected to annihilation by the Germans.</p>
   
   <p>The second fact worthy of vote is that he was a man of great piety, given to frequent prayer. He was seen in church almost daily at five o'clock in the morning. On Saturday, a week before his death, he spent the whole day and evening hearing confessions, and on the following day he said two masses and held two Sunday school classes.</p>
