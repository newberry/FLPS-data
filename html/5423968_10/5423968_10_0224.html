   <p>A certain Pole, who was in America not long ago, finding himself in a very difficult situation - hungry and penniless, without family or friends, not being able to secure employment, applied for help to Father Wojtalewicz, a Polish pastor in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>How was he received? Not only was he refused assistance, but the pastor like some great magnate, spoke to him through a mouthpiece, an assistant priest. He sat as on a throne, scoffing and jeering at the misery and misfortune which had befallen him.</p>
   <p>This priest does not enjoy the good opinion of the people in South Chicago. He is inhuman and unapproachable, and beats his parishioners as though he were some despotic prince in the old country.</p>
   <p>Is this man, whom we honor by calling him a priest, a Pole, a patriot, a Roman Catholic clergyman, who preaches every Sunday about the Christian neighborly love?</p>
