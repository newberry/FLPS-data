   <p>Yesterday at 3 P. M. the Reverend A. Morrisey, president of Notre Dame University, South Bend, Indiana, with the assistance of the Reverend F. Byrgier, A. Schott, chaplain of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the Reverend E. Raczynski, C. S. C., and the Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of Holy Trinity Church, opened the ceremonies for the blessing of the two new bells of Holy Trinity Church.</p>
   <p>The larger bell, weighing one thousand three hundred pounds, was named after St. Casimir, and the other, weighing six hundred and seventy pounds, was named after St. Florian.</p>
   <p>After the consecration ceremony, the Reverend Morrisey delivered an address in <span class="page-break">2</span>English. He lauded the people for their ardent belief and support of the faith and urged everyone to continue to adhere to the religion of their ancestors. The visiting priest concluded by saying that a good Catholic will always make a true patriot.</p>
   <p>He was followed by the Reverend Byrgier, who expressed his hopes that the tolling bells would remind the congregation to offer prayer for the souls of the dead. "The sound of the bells", he said, "should also remind you that death is awaiting you; therefore, you should live piously so that you may have a happy end."</p>
