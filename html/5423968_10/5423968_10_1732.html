   <p>A new wind is blowing and a new era is prevailing in the United States.</p>
   <p>Despite the protests of some persons who have lost their sense of smell, because of catarrh of loyalty, we feel that our duty is to call the attention of our people to the changes in American politics, which changes, we regret to say, are to our disadvantage. We don't want to ridicule either the government or the American people, but, being good and loyal citizens with an idea of improving the life of human beings, we have a right to criticize.</p>
   <p>If America wants to remain a free country, she ought to respect the ideas written on her flag, for which, like our ancestors, we are always ready to fight.</p>
   <p>To demand of us silent approval of changing democracy into a state of semi-slavery, is the height of stupidity.</p>

   <p>Perhaps very few of our journalists and writers possess enough courage to write the truth about this ticklish question; most of them are afraid of jeopardizing their career. Some writers are satisfied with their positions, which enable them to secure personal advantages by misdirecting and fibbing their readers. But our paper, serving honestly our people, shall not and will not go that way. It cannot change its policy, and it must tell the readers the truth regardless of the fact that it may please, or displease, some people. Even a man with a bird's brain would understand the challenge which is implied in sending again to Congress the famous Dellingham-Burnett anti-immigration bill. The bill is pointed against us in the first place, limiting our immigration by adding to the bill an education clause. Do not forget how many of our countrymen came to this country unable to read or write; yet, owing to their Slav perseverance and the opportunities they had to acquire education, many of those hard working illiterates now can talk and write both English and Polish, and are good, useful and loyal citizens.</p>
   <p>Today our Polish immigrants, despite all handicaps, working hard in places where others can't endure, are able, being thrifty, to buy homes. Many of <span class="page-break">3</span>them are longing to return to their homeland because of their love for their country, and also because of the wrong attitude towards foreigners in general prevailing in this country.</p>
   <p>If this burdensome bill will pass in Congress, our immigration to this country will be reduced to very little. Italy will also be forced to look for another country to send its surplus of population.</p>
   <p>We think that a new anti-immigration bill will cause a lot of political complications.</p>
