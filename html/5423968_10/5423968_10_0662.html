   <p>I wish to thank the amateur actors, men and women, who so generously contributed their time in the performance of the very laughable comedy "Dwoch Gluchych" (The Deaf Two), on January 12, for the benefit of the St. Hyacinth Church in Avondale, and especially Miss M. Sikorski, whose antics pleased the audience very much.</p>
   <p>Reverend Gieburowski, pastor.</p>
