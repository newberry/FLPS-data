   <p>The process instituted by the schismatics against the opening of St. Hedwig Church was aired today in Judge Payne's courtroom. Judge Payne, after hearing both sides of the issue, lifted the injunction issued last Saturday, June 15, and, after reprimanding the accusers for their disgraceful conduct, announced that St. Hedwig Church can be opened next Sunday.</p>
