   <p>The chairman of the committee, the Reverend Father John Pitass, and the secretary, Mr. S. Slisz, sent the following letter to all the members of the committee, in which certain motions regarding the projected Polish Catholic Congress in America were submitted.</p>
   <p>"Buffalo, New York,</p>
   <p>"March 31, 1896.</p>
   <p>"Dear Reverend Father:</p>
   <p>"In order to help the committee authorized to call the Polish Catholic Congress in its work, we have decided to submit the following proposals regarding the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>future delegates to the Congress. These are:</p>
   <p>A. All the priests, in deference to the positions they hold, may be delegates to the projected Congress.</p>
   <p>B. The editors of Polish Catholic newspapers have the right to vote at the Congress, regardless of whether or not they were chosen as delegates.</p>
   <p>C. Every Polish parochial school may send one representative to the Congress.</p>
   <p>D. Parishes are entitled to one delegate for each one thousand parishioners.</p>
   <p>E. Every parish, even if it has less than one thousand members, may send one representative to the Congress.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>F. Every Society will be allowed to have one delegate to each one hundred members.</p>
   <p>G. Societies having less than one hundred members, may elect one delegate.</p>
   <p>H. Each delegate is entitled to one vote only.</p>
   <p>I. The Polish Catholic Congress is to be held on August 18, 1896.</p>
   <p>"If you agree to the above proposals please place your signature at the bottom of this letter and return it to the secretary. For any of the proposals which you do not consider proper you may substitute a different suggestion. As soon as answers are received from all priests, parishes, and societies, we shall be able to announce the manner and number of delegates to be elected.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Expecting an early reply, we remain,</p>
   <p>"Sincerely,</p>
   <p>"Organization Committee."</p>
   <p>We received replies to the above letter from all of the members of the committee, and an analysis of the replies convinces us that a great majority agree with these proposals.</p>
   <p>The second and third proposals encountered opposition from a majority of the committee, so we are forced to cancel them.</p>
   <p>Among others, many members gave as their reasons for rejecting the second proposal the fact that it would be difficult to decide which papers are Catholic and whether their editors are Catholics. Even such papers as Wiarus, Jutrzenka, and Glos Ludu are trying to hide under the Catholic banner, although <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>they have entirely renounced the Catholic doctrines. If an editor is a Catholic he no doubt belongs to some Polish Roman Catholic society, where he should be able to earn the confidence of the members and thereby be elected a delegate to the Congress.</p>
   <p>As to the school representation at the Congress, these will be represented by the priests and parish delegates, in any case; hence any additional representation is unnecessary. And then in some of the schools they have sisters for teachers, and they cannot act as delegates to the Congress.</p>
   <p>The male teachers, if they are good Catholics and are members of Polish Catholic societies, may like the editors, be elected delegates to the Congress by the members of their societies.</p>
   <p>The sixth proposal was changed by the members of the Committee to read, "Every Polish Roman-Catholic society, etc".</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>As to the date of the projected Congress, two members are in favor of a later date, and one of an earlier date, but because a large majority agreed to August 18, 1896, the Committee does hereby announce that the Polish Catholic Congress of America will be held on that day.</p>
   <p>In a few days a conference of all the members of the committee will be called, and at this conference various subcommittees will be formed, and all the preliminary preparations will be divided among them.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, continue to work honestly and continuously, and God will bless our endeavors. Finally, we beseech the members of the conference committee to answer as soon as possible, because haste in these matters in most important. If we are to perform our duty properly, we must remember that we can do so only if you and others help us sincerely and willingly.</p>
   <p>Reverend Father J. Pitass, president,</p>
   <p>St. Slisz, secretary.</p>
