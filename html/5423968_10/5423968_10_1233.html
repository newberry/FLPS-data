   <p>The Patriotic organization, under the auspices of the St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish, is the only one of its kind in the United States whose only aim is to elevate the position of the Pole to a higher plane, and to instill a better patriotic feeling. This society held its second meeting of the year Sunday at the parish headquarters.</p>
   <p>Members of this group do not gain any material profit by being part of this association. Many times they make small voluntary contributions for patriotic purposes. The activity of these men is carried on without much publicity, however, their purposes are praiseworthy.</p>
   <p>It is not surprising to discover that where there is in operation a project without remuneration for the benefit of the people, there will not be found any noted patriotic haranguers. There will be found only a small handful of people who offer their services willingly, who understand the need for patriotic teaching, and who pursue this work quietly.</p>

   <p>There are slightly over two hundred persons belonging to the Patriotic Organization. We have called such a group a small handful because we feel that out of this great parish there ought to be twenty thousand represented in this club. For criticism and reproach, there are found many times this number, but for an altruistic endeavor, such as this organization is performing, there are hardly over two hundred. This hurts. Although we must admit that our ranks are growing daily, we feel that it is at too small a rate.</p>
   <p>Besides the routine matters, the committee of the Patriotic Organization ratified the constitution of the Dramatic Club, a branch of this group, during the last meeting. The question of the library was settled. It was decided to call it a "parishional library," because it was felt that all the members of the parish would benefit by it if it were open to them.</p>
   <p>Father Vincent Barzynski announced that a special committee would be appointed to take charge.</p>

   <p>Friday February 5, was set aside as a day of prayer for the oppressed Poles in Russia. The Polish Welfare organization has been asked to participate. All the Poles are urged to take part.</p>
   <p>The newly confirmed Dramatic club, according to an accepted resolution, will stage a three-act play sometime this month. A committee has been appointed to make plans for the debut.</p>
