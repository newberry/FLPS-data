   <p>In the last issue of Wiara i Ojczyzna (Religion and Fatherland) there is an article entitled as above and reading as follows:</p>
   <p>"It is a pleasure to announce the glad news to the members of the Polish Roman Catholic Union under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, that our brethren in Mt. Pleasant, Schenectady, Wilkes-Barre, St. Louis, and other localities are organizing and forming new societies; that even in the smaller communities there are signs of awakening life; and that, despite the intrigues and libelous articles of newspapers hostile to us, the Polish Union continues to grow. Concrete evidence of this is the St. Joseph Society newly organized in Houtzdale, Pennsylvania, which has joined our Polish Union.</p>
   <p>"This convinces us that our brethren are beginning to wake up in all of our Polish communities, and that, with God's help, once we dispose of some of our loud-mouthed enemies, we will grow in numbers, and be proud of ourselves. We will prove to all the world that we know how to fight our traducers, and then we will go peacefully forward shoulder to shoulder.</p>
   <p>"We will give our young people a good example so that they may also join our organizations. After that we can look to the future peacefully, knowing that our young generation will love our national traditions and will not permit the loss of its nationality here in a strange country.</p>
   <p>Father Wleklinski,</p>
   <p>Secretary of Polish Union."</p>
