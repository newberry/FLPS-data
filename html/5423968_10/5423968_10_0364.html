   <p>About fifty children of the St. Hedwig School received their first Holy Communion on Sunday, June 27. Solemn services marked the occasion. This was made possible through the efforts of the Sisters of Nazareth and the local organist, Emil Wiedeman. The church was gaily decorated for the occasion. A crowd was on hand to see this memorable event.</p>
