   <p>How can we prevent Americanization of our youth? There you have a question which all that have that have the future of Poles in America within their hearts should reflect upon. It is a problem which many an editor has worked hard to solve.</p>
   <p>Our youth is being drawn into organizations of other nationalities, listening to the eloquent suggestions of salaried agitators where they lese first their faith, than their Polish language and Polish traits.</p>
   <p>How can we prevent this? How can we destroy the temptations to our youth? By organizing Polish youth societies and drawing them under the standard of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>This is a plan which yields an abundant crop because it will not only prevent our Polish youth from becoming Americanized and losing their faith, but will contribute to help place them on a true Catholic foundation. Let us draw the youth of the Union.</p>
