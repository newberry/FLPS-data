   <p>In recent years, emigration from Canada to the United States has greatly decreased, however, this trend of emigration has reversed itself.</p>
   <p>Statistics indicate, that in 1926, 200,000 people emigrated to Canada, from the United States. Emigration from England, to Canada, is due to unemployment resulting from the world war, and is increasing the population of Canada very rapidly. Other European nations are following the example set by England, emigrating by the thousand to Canada. This is promoting a program of rapid progress for the development of economics.</p>
   <p>United States would never be the richest nation in the world, were it not for the labor of the immigrant. Immigration will without doubt create wealth in Canada, which, in the near future, will take its place beside that of the United States, as a rich country.</p>
