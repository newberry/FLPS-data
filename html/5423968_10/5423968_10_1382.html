   <p>Yesterday, as was previously announced, a banquet was held at Hotel La Salle at which seventy-five nationalities living in Chicago were represented. The purpose of the banquet was to express the loyalty of all foreign national groups as well as of Americans of foreign descent to the American flag and to President Wilson and his policies. Probably not a single nationality was unrepresented in the hall on the nineteenth floor where the banquet was held--all possible languages could be heard spoken there. A diversion was caused by the appearance of a group of real Indians, who whooped and yelled in the manner of true American Indians, to the great merriment of the gathering. Their costumes aroused great interest. Also present at the banquet were negroes, Hindus, and so on. The Poles, however, were most numerously represented. It would be difficult to enumerate all those that were present at yesterday's banquet, but we can safely say that Chicago's Polonia was so well represented as to deserve special mention. It seems as if not one well-known Polish citizen was missing. The Polish National Alliance was represented by the entire Central Administration with its president, Casimir Zychlinski, at its head. Also present were representatives of the old and new administrations of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, representatives of the Polish Falcons' Alliance and other Polish organizations. A great many well-known Polish citizens were present with their wives. Under the leadership of K. J. Wiechecki, recruiting officer of Recruiting Center II, and Sergeant Szubert of the same Center, a number of volunteers, dressed in their uniforms and armbands, marched into the hall. Wherever one looked, there were Polish faces.</p>
   <p>The banquet itself, at which there were more than a thousand persons, was diversified by choral numbers by our capable and tireless Philaret Choir under the direction of Professor B. Rybowiak. They sang "The Song of the Philarets" and "Memories." Each number was rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
   
   <p>A Swedish chorus also sang, but we can say here that they would find it difficult to equal the Philarets.</p>
   <p>The program of the evening was opened by a short address by H. H. Merrick, president of the Security League, under the auspices of which the banquet was held. Mr. Merrick appointed John F. Smulski as chairman of the evening. The chairman then called upon various speakers. Joseph C. Grew of Boston, former first secretary to Gerard, the American ambassador to Berlin, spoke on German "Kultur" and the beginnings of the war. The next speaker was Judge Harry Olson, who finished his address with the hope that those two great nations, Poland and Sweden, would accomplish great things in the future, when freedom and peace have returned to the world.</p>
   <p>The chairman himself, John F. Smulski, then spoke. He was followed by Peter Lambros, one of the best-known Greek journalists in Chicago. His address had a very favorable effect on the gathering despite the fact that his English was not very good. He spoke of the services of this country to humanity and to the immigrants who came here to live in peace and freedom--which they could not do across the ocean.</p>
   <p>The longest and most interesting speech was made by Bainbridge Colby, President Wilson's personal representative, member of the Shipping Board, politician and great statesman.</p>
   <p>A Letter From the President</p>
   <p>"Allow me to express, on the day of this unusual gathering, my sincerest regards and best wishes. At the same time, allow me to express my joy that a gathering consisting of representatives of so many nations shows its loyalty to the American flag and to American ideals. Let me be permitted to express also my pleasure at the decision of the representatives of all these nations to support our government and this administration.</p>
   <p>"Woodrow Wilson"</p>
   
   <p>It is needless to say here that when the President's representative read these few words of greeting the hall shook with applause for President Wilson. It was a long time before the applause ceased, which in itself showed the gathering's loyalty to the greatest President in the world, who in such troublous times expressed himself for freedom, justice, and equality among all the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>Colby spoke further of ruined France, of the need for preparation for a war which will not end until America and the Allies reach their desired goal. The gathering rewarded his words with frequent applause.</p>
   <p>We have already mentioned the singing of the Philarets and the Swedish choir. We will add here that the real spiritual treat of the evening was provided by our capable and tireless artist-singer, Thaddeus Wronski, who, for the past few months, has been inspiring American Poles to nationalistic work by traveling to all Polish settlements with his Polish military band.</p>
   
   <p>Wronski appeared this time as an operatic singer, singing an aria from Verdi's "Simon Boccanegra," which made a tremendous impression on the audience, and drew forth long-sustained applause. As an encore, he sang Moszkowski's "Stach," which renewed the storm of applause. At the banquet's conclusion, Wronski sang the "Marseillaise" in French. He was forced to repeat this number twice at the audience's demand.</p>
