   <p>The death of Rev. Father Barzynski, a member of the Resurrection Provincial convent, and the Most Rev. Father at St. Stanislaus, caused a change in three parishes.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father John Kasprzycki, of St. John Cansius, will take over St. Stanislaus parish; Rev. Father Eugene Sedlaczek, of Avondale, will take over the parish of St. John Cansius, while Rev. Father Anzelma Babski will occupy Father Sedlaczek's parish.</p>
   <p>Therefore, three parishes will have new rectors. We have high hopes that the church members will feel the same towards the new rectors as they have for their former ones.</p>
