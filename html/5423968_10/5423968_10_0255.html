   <p>Last Sunday Feb. 18, there was a concert held consisting of all parochial choirs under the direction of Mr. A. Mallek, a well-known musician and president of an organist organization.</p>
   <p>The concert proved very successful. A vast gathering witnessed this concert at the Walsh Hall. From the numerous musical numbers selected for this program we appreciated most hearing from the opera of Grosman "Palatine Soul," likewise the hymn for the father Archbishop Simon. Mr. Jan Mallek showed great ability as a violinist.</p>
   <p>The proceeds from this concert are to be contributed for the purchase of the organ for the new Holy Trinity church.</p>
