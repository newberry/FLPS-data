   <p>Unemployment, which after the war began to oppress important European centers and from which the prosperous and underpopulated United States has not escaped, proved to be an important factor in immigration, especially affecting those who lost their work in their native country, and turned to some other new-born country to solve their problems. The major ports of Canada, Australia,and United States, have closed their doors to these immigrants, who previously so eagerly swarmed their gates.</p>
   <p>Today this has become a topic of broad discussion in economic circles. The possibilities of its solution have been studied. It has been suggested to open the countries which have vast areas of unpopulated territory for colonization to those who find themselves victims of unemployment due to overpopulation in European countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>These groups of people could easily be absorbed and the overload in Europe could be relieved.</p>
   <p>Many economic research workers are of the same opinion. They all assert that, at the present time the world, as a whole, is not in the least overpopulated. According to statistics, there can easily be found room for eight billion people. These people would be able to find living a pleasure. At present there are about two billion people living in the world. Consequently, this population can live without tribulation.</p>
   <p>The only difficulty at the present with the over-populated European countries, is to find for these people suitable places of livelihood. The statisticians hold that there are many such territories.</p>
   <p>In the tropical countries there can be found vast tracts of land suitable for colonization. Equatorial Africa is a good example. Although communication with the rest of the world is poor, it must be remembered that these poor surroundings are almost completely uninhabited.</p>

   <p>The rich and useful land lies within the Sudan regions. This is the central part of Africa. One of the reasons why this part of Africa was never colonized by European countries, is because existence under prevalent conditions would be unbearable. The Jungle, the desert and the arid regions would handicap the best of people.</p>
   <p>However, today technology has been so greatly developed that it is now possible to transform this land into suitable colonies. The desert sands, the arid regions, and the jungles can now be put to use for man by modern technology, thereby making possible new land and work for the over-crowded Europeans.</p>
   <p>A great obstacle to colonization was then the intense heat. This also has been overcome. It has been proven that the organism of the European, when crucial circumstances arise,can adjust itself to high temperatures.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Under the conditions of the Sudan regions, the conditioning of these Europeans people would not prove to be very trying.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, it must be pointed out that the territory in Africa, if converted, could take care of five hundred million inhabitants. This number is so great that the greatest and the most crucial unemployment problem becomes a mere trifle.</p>
   <p>Besides the vast territories in Africa, there are many possibilities for colonization in South America. This continent is also greatly under-populated. The one hundred million population leaves much room for the over-crowded people of Europe. Through proper steps of colonizing, over a billion people could be accommodated.</p>

   <p>In South America, as in Africa, working conditions would be trying. The virgin forests would have to be cut before the land could be cultivated. The climate is almost on par with that of Africa. But despite this, here can also be found great possibilities for work, for new colonies, for new life.</p>
