   <p>The entire Polish Roman Catholic element in America was stirred by an unheard-of injustice perpetrated by Bishop Hoban in the diocese of Scranton, and the resistance, with the support of the Reverend Iwanowski, of our countrymen belonging to the Holy Trinity Parish of Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. The issue involved concerns the objection of the parishioners to the transfer to the bishop of the title to the property of the church. The parishioners rightfully maintain that through their parish committee they can take better care of the property, which was bought with their hard-earned money, than the bishop can. Besides, there are many examples of unfair treatment of Poles by bishops after such transfers have been made. Therefore, the parishioners are unwilling to submit to this bondage, fearing that later on there might be some misunderstanding with the dignitaries of the church and that they might even be evicted by the police from the parish grounds and jailed.</p>

   <p>As long as the Holy Trinity Parish of Nanticoke was in financial difficulties and had debts to pay, the bishop was not particularly interested in that property; he did not seek a transfer of the title because he did not wish to take any burdens upon himself. Now, however, that the debts of the parish have been paid as the result of good management on the part of the parish committee--the parish property is worth $75,000--he is trying to grab this property from hard-working people by transferring its title to himself. The parishioners--apparently enlightened people--refused to obey the bishop, and concurring with them was the Reverend Iwanowski, the priest of the parish. He did not disobey his superior, the bishop, but as an honest man and as a good Pole, moved by the injustices meted out to our people by church dignitaries, he is also of the opinion that the property of the church should belong to the people and not to the bishop.</p>
   <p>What did Bishop Hoban do then? The bishop sent the Reverend Iwanowski a letter in which he demands that he and his parishioners submit to the bishop's orders. At the same time the bishop removed the sisters from the Holy Trinity Parish School, and declared that no priest in his diocese <span class="page-break">\3</span>will be allowed to perform any church functions in that parish until the parishioners submit to his demand and transfer the property.</p>
   <p>This action on the part of the despotic and greedy bishop brought results contrary to those he expected, for the parishioners at a mass meeting declared unanimously that under no circumstances would they transfer the property of their church to the bishop. They have engaged regular teachers for their parochial school, and the priest, who supports the cause of the parishioners, is performing the duties of a pastor for them. Thus, the threats of the bishop are without effect.</p>
   <p>At that mass meeting the following resolution was adopted:</p>
   <p>"We declare that we are loyal and faithful members of the Roman Catholic Church and that we have the intention of remaining so; but no one except ourselves can force us to transfer our earthly possessions to some one else, which is in accordance with the laws of the state of Pennsylvania." Indeed, <span class="page-break">\4</span>this resolution of the enlightened parishioners is a wise one. They are not breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church only to jump from the frying pan into the fire; they remain true sons of that church, but they are not willing to obey a greedy bishop in wordly affairs.</p>
   <p>"Prayer and the salvation of the soul are one thing, but church property bought with hard-earned money which is rightfully ours is another thing," say the sensible Poles of Nanticoke. "If there is any misunderstanding because of financial or religious matters between the members of the parish and their pastor, the bishop, instead of visiting the parish as a good father would do in order to make an impartial investigation himself to pass a just judgment, sends the police with clubs, and the poor parishioners are beaten for their hard-earned money." At last our people are waking up; they are beginning to see that church dignitaries are seizing by medieval-like terroristic methods church property belonging to hard-working people.</p>
   <p>This injustice to our people has been brought to light by us many times; we have protested several times against the greed of privileged bishops, and <span class="page-break">\5</span>now we are glad that our people at last understand the intention of progressive newspapers and demand their rights. We also admire our countrymen's wisdom and prudence in handling this matter in an orderly and cool-headed manner. They did not create disturbances nor did they organize a new religious sect, thereby creating hatred among our brothers. They adhered to the faith of our fathers and protected the possessions which they had acquired by the sweat of their brows, just as our brothers in our native land protect the heritage of their fathers against the greed of the Germans and the Russians.</p>
   <p>There have been many examples among our people of such strong determination in protecting church properties. Bishop Gorlick of Duluth, Minnesota was not allowed to deprive them of their church property; and in South Bend, Indiana, transfer to the bishop of title to their cemetery was refused. In other Polish settlements, also, our people are demanding their rights, and according to the decision of Judge Fuller,they are within the law in doing so.</p>
   <p>Church properties belong to the people who bought and paid for them, and they <span class="page-break">\6</span>even have the right to take it away from a bishop after he has acquired it by a transfer.</p>
   <p>The case is clear and our people can legally and rightfully demand the return of their church properties from the greedy Roman Moloch. Our people are capable of taking better care of their property than any bishop can. Polish priests should co-operate with their parishioners as the Reverend Iwanowski is doing in Nanticoke, but they should also obey their bishops in religious matters. When it comes to church properties, however, they should side with the people and not allow the bishops to expropriate their property. No one can condemn them for taking such a stand. But our priests very seldom do co-operate with their people; rather, they are usually arrayed against them.</p>
   <p>Our people are awakening and will free themselves in the near future.</p>
