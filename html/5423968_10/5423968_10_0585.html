   <p>(We have received the following correspondence about the Polish Catholic Congress, which we are requested to publish in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>Today we can confidently predict that the proposed Polish Catholic Congress is coming closer to realization. The enthusiasm that has enveloped the reverend clergy and the societies leave no room for doubt. One thought, one idea is in the minds of everybody--that there will be a Congress.</p>
   <p>There are certain people who see a lack of unity in any undertaking suggested by the clergy. Let them put on their glasses; then they will see that they are not wise. The flag is raised, and on it are the words, "In Hoc Signo Vinces"--"By this sign thou shalt conquer".</p>
   <p>Among the opponents of the Congress are some who fear that the Congress intends to declare war on the Polish National Alliance. They are wrong, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their fear is groundless. The Congress, according to our views and according to the views of all sensible people, does not intend to fight anything that is good--and we consider every organization a necessity in its own particular sphere--but will fight anything and everything that appears to be harmful and dangerous to Polish people. Those, therefore, who fear the Congress must be the harmful elements of our population.</p>
   <p>The Polish Catholic Congress wants to create a spirit of unity among the clergy, a spirit which, united and powerful, will fight against all 'libelous-liberal-socialistic' elements, so as to preserve our people in the faith of our forefathers, and to foster patriotism in God's spirit.</p>
   <p>The Polish Catholic Congress will also consider ways and means to support and develop the Polish Catholic press. Such a press puts forth a healthy, nutritious food for which our people hunger. We must admit that today the good-for-nothing liberal-Jewish press has remade a part of this truly Polish people in a manner to suit their own nefarious schemes. It excuses itself on <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the plea of progress. We understand progress, certainly; but not liberal-Jewish progress. We favor progress, but only reasonable progress, dependent on religion.</p>
   <p>So the satanic influence of imaginary progress will fight the Congress, in order to turn the hearts of the faithful away from their spiritual mentors. The Congress will expose to the public the whole shame of these scoundrels, who, shielding themselves with a kind of liberal patriotism, are organizing congregations pleasing to the "Moskals" (Russians).</p>
   <p>Briefly stated, the Congress aims to improve our religious, national, and social well-being. It does not want to destroy, but to correct that which the oppositionists have damaged.</p>
   <p>So to work, you Polish Catholic societies! You are the bulwark of religion and Polish nationality against rotten, radical calumnies--give each other your hands and show that you have not discarded the religion and customs of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>your forefathers. There will be a Congress, so do not linger behind; state your views and our necessities. We will consider them seriously.</p>
   <p>The priest with the people--the people with the priest; that is unity and strength--and therefore victory, which is so feared by our enemies.</p>
   <p>X. Omega.</p>
