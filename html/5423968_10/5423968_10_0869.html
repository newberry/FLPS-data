   <p>On May 12 the societies of St. Adalbert Parish staged a benefit ball at Pulaski Hall; its results were satisfactory. The committee in charge, comprised of representatives of the various societies, wishes to extend an old-fashioned Polish "thank you" to the speakers, military societies and civil societies for their co-operation.</p>
   <p>The financial statement is as follows:</p>

   <p>This resulted in a net profit of $262.83. This sum was divided as follows: One third, $87.61, for the benefit of the Pulaski Hall; and two thirds, $175.22, to J. Radziejewski, pastor of St. Adalbert Parish for the benefit of the church and school. The committee suggested the purchase of a canopy for the church.</p>
   <p>In the name of the committee thanks are extended to all the supporters of this cause.</p>
