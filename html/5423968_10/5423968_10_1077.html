   <p>The conditions established by the papal delegate, Monsignor Satolli, under which the Holy Trinity Church may be opened to the public, are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The church property will, without any question whatever, be the property of the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>2. The parish will make a detailed statement of the debts on the property and present this to the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>3. An exact list of the members of Holy Trinity parish, with their full names and addresses, must be made.</p>
   <p>4. The directors of the parish will include members of the Holy Cross Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>On Saturday, the Reverend Czyzewski, pastor of the South Bend, Indiana <span class="page-break">\2</span>parish, arrived in company with a member of the Holy Cross Brotherhood. Solemn High Mass was celebrated at Holy Trinity Church by these two priests on Sunday. Father Czyzewski left immediately after Mass, but will return soon to install the new pastor. Who the new pastor will be is as yet unknown.</p>
   <p>We hope, in the near future, to give the exact conditions which we have mentioned above. In the meantime, it is with real pleasure that we announce that the affairs of Holy Trinity parish have finally taken a turn for the better. There is reason to believe that the harmony which has been attained will not be disrupted again. All of the faithful are doubtless happy that after so many years and after so much bitter unpleasantness, the parish has finally made its peace with the Church.</p>
