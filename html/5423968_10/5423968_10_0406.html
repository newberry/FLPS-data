   <p>The Independent Church Committee has sent a plea for help in a letter to the undersigned society asking support for their church which is facing a financial crisis and the following is in reply:</p>
   <p>Dear Brothers! We have lamented enough over the fact that you were bold enough to forget all about us, and now you are bold enough to seek help from the St. Martin Hussars Society.</p>
   <p>Dear Brothers! You are well aware of the fact that we have true Roman Catholic churches and that it is our duty to support them and not seek others or Independent churches. We deem it a sin to support independent temples.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly other societies received the same kind of correspondence. It is expected that all others will follow the example of the St. Martin Hussars <span class="page-break">2</span>Society. Let us all adhere to the principles of the Roman Catholic Church, which is supported by the rock of St. Peter and which the gates of hell will never overwhelm.</p>
   <p>Administration of the St. Martin Hussars Society.</p>
