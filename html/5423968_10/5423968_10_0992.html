   <p>Unity and brotherhood--that is our slogan.</p>
   <p>Down with the false prophets! Down with Kolaszewski!</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman Catholic Union's convention has been held in an atmosphere of brotherly love, harmony, and unity. Thank Thee, O Lord!</p>
   <p>The conspirators who tried to wreck the Union have left Cleveland disappointed, and the delegates to the convention have proved that they are good Poles and good Catholics.</p>
   <p>"Count" Rybakowski landed in jail--the place where he should have been a long time age.</p>
   <p>The Poles have spoken at the Union's convention--they have condemned the <span class="page-break">\2</span>charlatan Kolaszewski and his accomplices. Read the protest, written with emphasis and dignity.</p>
   <p>Wiarus (alias Katolik) has been condemned at the Cleveland convention, much as it was condemned three years ago at the Detroit convention of the Polish National Alliance. Such is the fate of this filthy pseudo Catholic newspaper--to be damned eternally.</p>
