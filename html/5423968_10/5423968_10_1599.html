   <p>In the year ending June 30, 1927, 199,804 persons received their citizenship papers in the United States, according to a report from the Commissioner of Naturalization at Washington, D. C. The figures given here have been taken from this report.</p>
   <p>Nearly 200,000 new citizens in one year! Of this total, 34,983 were Poles, which shows an admirable representation. It must be admitted, however, that for the first time in the history of the Naturalization Bureau, the Italians surpassed the Poles. A total of 45,262 Italians received their second papers. The year 1927 was a record-breaking year in the annals of naturalization in this country, with the exception of 1919, when the Government granted citizenship to the soldiers who had participated in the World War. In <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>1919, 217,358 persons received their papers, among them 128,335 soldiers. In 1927, 4,311 soldiers were given naturalization papers after their discharge from the Army. The law relative to the World War soldiers will expire this May.</p>
   <p>According to the Naturalization Bureau statistics, the various nationalities rank as follows in 1927:</p>

   <p>The Federal Government maintains twenty-three naturalization bureaus throughout the country. They are found only in large cities, and not in all the states. The cities with the largest bureaus are New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In New York City 47,283 persons were naturalized last year; in Philadelphia, 29,211, and in Chicago, 22,789. Next in line in the number of citizens naturalized during 1927 are Boston, with 22,308; Pittsburgh, 14,356; Buffalo, 10,568; Detroit, 10,208; and Cleveland, 8,797. Figures for other <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>cities fall below 5,000.</p>
   <p>The Naturalization Bureau is recommending that Congress raise the fee charged for the first and second papers. It suggests that five dollars be charged for the first papers and ten for the second ones. Ever since the inception of the Naturalization Bureau, the Federal Treasury Department has been covering the expenses. The fees paid by the applicants do not cover the costs. Only during its first year, that is, in 1906, was there no deficit. In 1927 the Government paid out to the Naturalization Bureau $746,621.91, receiving in Return only $248,032.50. It is for this reason that the increase is requested.</p>
   <p>The applicants, in reality, paid more than the figures show, but it must be remembered that half of this money went toward the upkeep of naturalization courts and the cost of the bureaus throughout the United States. This is why such deficits occur.</p>
