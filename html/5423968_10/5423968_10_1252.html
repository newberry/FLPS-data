   <p>The religious holiday of the Three Kings will come to an end with next Wednesday's evening services, which will be held at 7:30 P. M. Everyone is welcome to attend, especially those who never paid a visit to this place before. The men who work during the day and find leisure time during the evening, will get a few restful and joyous moments in the services. Children may come if accompanied by an adult.</p>
   <p>The Holy Family Orphanage Choir will sing religious numbers of the Christmas holidays. By the execution of these numbers, the visitors will be able to form an idea of the progress of the children in the orphanage. The visitors will be invited to see the living quarters of the children. The furnishings are attractive and simple, although not paid for in full as yet. The condition that obtains in the institution was made public before the holidays, with the result that generous contributions were received and most of the improvements were paid for. Although donations should supply most of the needs, the fact is that the demand exceeds the supply. Since a majority of the improvements depend on voluntary offering, we urge those that can afford it to give their share. It is hoped that this request will bring many kind responses.</p>
   <p>Material, odds and ends, etc., will be gladly received. Since in this kind of work the beginning is always hard, we anticipated these hardships. Our purchases were a bit high in price, nevertheless, everything was essential. The Christmas spirit has helped a great deal and the children have done their part to make this work a reality. They have prayed fervently, they have sung with devotion, and they have worked diligently. Their efforts were rewarded; toys and candy were shared by all.</p>
   <p>At present there are 123 children in the Home, and their daily routine is as follows: 5:45 A. M. Getting out of bed, washing, and dressing.</p>
   
   <p>6:15 A. M. Morning prayers.</p>
   <p>6:30 A. M. Holy Mass.</p>
   <p>7:15 A. M. Breakfast and recreation.</p>
   <p>8:30 - - School hours-at mid point half hour recess is taken</p>
   <p>11:30 A. M. for recreation and second breakfast.</p>

   <p>4:30 P. M. Repast. The older children do their homework and the younger say the Rosary.</p>
   <p>6:15 P. M. Dinner.</p>
   <p>After the evening meal, there is a recess for recreation until the evening prayers. At 8 P. M. there is another rest period. The older children practice the singing in which they have been instructed during the day. The young children prepare themselves for bed at 7 P. M. This group sleeps longer in the morning.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. E. Czarniewski examines the children daily and if necessary twice a day.</p>
   <p>There is one gentleman in particular to whom the Orphanage owes unlimited appreciation. He supplies daily all the bread that is needed for the Home. Thanks have been given him before, and we repeat them now with greater gratitude.</p>
   <p>The following contributions have been sent in since we made our last report: Michael and Joseph Wituski, 157 W. Blackhawk Street, donated a beautiful writing desk; an anonymous person sent five dollars in gold; Mr. Schultz, $5; Miss Augustine Lamkowski, $2; Mr. Joseph Schwichtenberg, $2.</p>
   <p>The organization is very grateful for these kind contributions.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that many persons will turn out for the services of the holiday of Three Kings.</p>
