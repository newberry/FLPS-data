   <p>A loathsome pamphlet entitled: "The Polish League in the United States Is a Political Work of Father Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish", was prepared and distributed downtown and in Polish settlements by unknown persons last Saturday.</p>
   <p>Anonymous letters and articles are usually written by worthless persons; therefore we should not take them too seriously. Wickedness and calumnies directed in this manner do not reach those at whom they are hurled. Anonymous slanders usually rebound at those who loosed them. Consequently, we will not attempt to acquaint our readers with the details of the anonymous pamphlet; neither will we try to disprove the falsehoods which fill the pamphlet. We wish only to call attention to a fact which is very important in our conditions. The title alone, indicates the purpose of this obnoxious pamphlet.</p>
   
   <p>This year is dedicated to Kosciusko. The hundredth anniversary of our hero's battle at Raclawice has inspired many warm hearts and brilliant minds to action. Brotherhood and concord were the watchwords uttered by Kosciusko over a hundred years ago. With those watchwords in our hearts and on our lips, the Poles in America, kept apart by dissension, began to think about organization and unity. Plans for a mass meeting, for a Polish League in America and for celebrations were made. At first they were hailed with enthusiasm, but later on they were opposed. Who directs this opposition, who is its leader, who is awakening old passions in our hearts and fanning destructive fires? This we do not wish to conjecture. This opposition works openly through the public press; therefore, it must limit itself to certain decent bounds.</p>
   <p>But this is not enough, for the secret leaders of the opposition have decided that those who are inspired by "Kosciusko Year" to do nationalistic work and propagation of brotherhood must be attacked with sharper weapons. Behold! The anonymous pamphlet to which we referred made its appearance. It was written with diabolical cunning, and it had a diabolical purpose. And this purpose? It was to crack the unity which was beginning to embrace the Poles; to destroy God's peace, which was descending upon us; to poison our hearts with venomous distrust and hatred; to separate the hands which were willing to perform co-operative work.</p>
   <p>As they could not make any charges against the principle of the planned mass meeting and the proposed League, the authors of the anonymous pamphlet attacked the proponents of the League, and especially one whose signature appeared on the appeal. They chose him because he was a priest, because he occupied a high position in society, and because he had accomplished much. They collected thousands of malicious lies, and employed all vile means in order to besmirch the character of the patriotic priest, and through him the principles of the League and the idea of co-operative work and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>That was a wicked piece of work, and the fact that it was afraid of daylight proves as much. The author or authors of the brochure must have been dishonest, for they did not have the courage to express themselves openly. Therefore, we brand their deed and their anonymous brochure a villainy. That is the purpose of this article.</p>
   <p>We wish to draw the attention of the honest Polish public to this relatively new but obnoxious symptom among our countrymen, and we are confident that this opinion will condemn it as it should be condemned. We also desire to take up another question. Why, and on account of what diabolical malice, or through what ignominious perversion did such a pamphlet come into existence? That is hard to answer.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, a certain journalist compared the proposed League with the Polish Constitution of the Third of May, which was proclaimed one hundred and three years ago. He compared the fight which is being waged today with the fights of those years. If we agree with this comparison we should be reminded that there exist a number of anonymous pamphlets that were published a hundred years ago, which attacked the Constitution even before it was adopted. History proved later on that most of those pamphlets were published either with Muscovite money of by the future "Targowiczanie" (Confederationists) [Translator's note: Confederationists were formed in Targowice, Poland, for the purpose of abolishing the constitution].</p>
   <p>We cannot declare that anything of the kind is taking place now. But, in any case, this subversive activity, this diabolical cunning of the intrigues, this anonymity of the brochure as well as this callousness in falsehood, gives us food for thought.</p>
