   <p>A new society comprising practically all the young men who attend the Sunday School, has been organized in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The society has been named St. Stanislaus Kostka Youth Society. The Chaplain of the society is the Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek. Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz is the president, Mr. Narcyz Legowski, the recording secretary, and I. Bogucki, the financial secretary.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's meeting it was unanimously decided that the members would read books from the parish library with the utmost care. At future meetings, each member will report on the book he has read. Choice of books for the members rests with the president.</p>
   <p>The Society boasts fifty members for a beginning. It is claimed that this society will soon outdistance St. Casimir's.</p>
