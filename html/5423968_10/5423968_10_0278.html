   <p>At the present time we invite all the marshals, city officials, delegates, presidents and secretaries of the Z. N. P. church societies, all Polish Catholic parishes in Chicago to this great meeting which will take place next Friday, June 9th, in the hall of the Holy Trinity parish. At this gathering will be decided the route to be followed by the procession at the blessing of the corner stone for the new church of Holy Trinity.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of sending out invitations has not as yet received any letters from the invited guests, stating that they will be present at this celebration. Many church societies have not been sent invitations because we haven't the correct addresses nor the names and addresses of the respective secretaries. That is why this notice has been placed in the Polish Daily News for the benefit of all that haven't yet been invited.</p>
