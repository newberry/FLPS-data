   <p>The central administration of the Polish Women's Alliance sent the following letter to all its groups, urging them to protest against the unjust and unconstitutional restriction of immigration.</p>
   <p>"We come to you with an urgent and very important matter. There is no time for deliberation; we must act at once. The present topic of discussion in Congress is the restriction of immigration. This restriction will affect us Poles. We, as descendants of heroes who shed their blood for the freedom of the noble and magnificent United States, have a right to call upon the sense of duty of the people who, with the aid of our Polish votes, stand at the head of free America. We have a right to protest against the demands of chauvinists, who desire to adopt a measure whereby honest, healthy, and diligent immigrants who do not know how to read and write, because of the fault of the aggressor nations, will not be allowed to enter into the United States.</p>
   
   <p>"Our duty is not only to protest against adoption of this measure, but to protest immediately. There is no time to call meetings, so that the presidents and secretaries of groups should sign the protests immediately and send them to the congressmen of their districts. The names and addresses of congressmen may be obtained by any citizen.</p>
   <p>"In addition to this protest, a delegation composed of representatives of the Polish Women's Alliance, the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish Alma Mater, and other Polish organizations will be sent [to Washington]. The purpose of the delegation is to protest against the injustice of the chauvinists.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Neumann,</p>
   <p>President of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>Miss A. Emilie Napieralski,</p>
   <p>General Secretary."</p>
