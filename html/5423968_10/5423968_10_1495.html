   <p>The St. Aloysius Young Men's Society has been recently organized in St. Adalbert Parish. All those who have graduated this or last year from the parish grammar school are eligible. Members will be accepted at the meetings to be held every second Sunday at 4 P.M.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this society is to teach the members the Polish language and to develop thought along Catholic lines. We urge the parents to have their children who are eligible join this organization. Parents are also urged not to deny the boys the privilege of joining, for in them will be safeguarded the Roman Catholic faith and our national traditions.</p>
   <p>A library has been available to members through the kindness of the Sisters of Nazareth.</p>
