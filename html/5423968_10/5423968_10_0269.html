   <p>A new Polish parish was organized and built on the Northwest side of Chicago. The pastor of this new parish is the Most Rev. Father John Zwierzchowski, who at present is residing at the church rectory, located at Superior and Bickerdike Street. This rectory is connected with the church, as is the beautiful new school.</p>
   <p>In a short time the church will be consecrated and opened to the public; the school will also be opened and ready for children.</p>
   <p>We have high hopes that our new parish will expand rapidly and grow rich, because of the support guaranteed by the "Poles" living in this neighborhood; besides this we know that Most Rev. Father John Zwierzchowski is a man of action, energetic and an excellent administrator. Father Zwierzchowski, until his present transfer, was chaplain at the parish of St.Michael Archangel in South Chicago. He was also assistant to the pastor at St.Adalbert for a few months; wherever he served, his record stands out as the best; the new pastor is very good in role of uniting and combining public as well as church affairs; he has the utmost respect in this parish because of his organizational work and good deeds. May the Almighty God bless and help this new parish and its pastor John Zwierzchowski in all their undertaking for the sake of existence.</p>
