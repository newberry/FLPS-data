   <p>Yesterday we published an announcement in the columns of our paper, that the conference to be held in advance of the Polish Catholic Congress, will take place on March 19, in Detroit, Michigan. This announcement was signed by Reverend Pitass, of Buffalo, and by three Detroit priests. One of them, Reverend Gutowski, who is at the moment in Chicago, requests us to publish a few more words on this subject.</p>
   <p>The aforementioned invitation was mailed to every Polish priest in America, without exception, and to many lay people. Several hundred invitations were mailed and the work was not accomplished at once. This may be the reason--or perhaps incomplete addresses of some priests were used--that some priests have not yet received their invitations. Therefore, Reverend Gutowski repeats the invitation and requests the presence of all the Polish priests at this conference.</p>
