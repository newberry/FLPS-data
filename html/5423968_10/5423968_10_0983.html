   <p>Kolaszewski and his followers are trying to organize a schismatic parish in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Kolaszewski's announcement in Jutrzenka (Morning Star) has been fulfilled, for he has come to Chicago for the purpose of founding his false church.</p>
   <p>He came here together with the editor of his scandalous Jutrzenka, the self-styled priest Radziszewski, and other adventurers.</p>
   <p>At last they have decided to establish a schismatic parish in the Avondale district, where they will mislead the people. They are assisted in this venture by Tamillo, a well-known agitator in Saint Hedwig Parish, the slanderer of the clergy in Nowe Zycie, the inventor of the theory that "Moses created God", etc.</p>

   <p>This gang from Cleveland, assisted by Tamillo, is endeavoring to lead the Poles in Chicago from the straight path, but let us hope that they will not succeed. A few individuals will probably follow them, but the honest public will turn away. In another article we will publish a warning written by a prominent Polish clergyman of Chicago.</p>
