   <p>On Sunday, August 7, the St. Cecelia Society will celebrate in the big hall near Bradley Street the tenth anniversary of its existence. The admission price is very reasonable, and there is assurance that those attending will not regret their presence, since those participating belong to the early membership of this society.</p>
   <p>The political meeting will not prevent anyone from attending this performance, because that meeting begins early and will certainly end in time to permit attendance at the performance. The St. Cecelia Society is deserving of support and recognition in every way.</p>
