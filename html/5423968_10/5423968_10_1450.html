   <p>St. Margaret's society presented two short plays last Sunday in the parish hall. A three-act play "The Degenerate Daughter" and a one act play, "Uncle Has Arrived" filled the program. A capacity audience attended. The generous applause was sufficient evidence that the amateur actors gave a fine performance.</p>
   <p>Father J. Zielezinski spoke during the course of the program. His theme was "The Work of Our Young Generation." Some of the guests were: Rev. Thomas Bona, Rev. S. Swierczyk, C. R., Joseph Tarasiuk, C. R., B. Lazarowicz, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>C. R., Fr. Joseph Sehnke, Fr. J. Ostrowski, and Fr. Carol Marcinkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The stage director Fr. Vincent Nowicki who has been interested in the youth movement, has done an admirable job. Miss Helen Juszczak sang a number of songs. A dance was performed by Miss Helen Rozak.</p>
   <p>Such entertainment programs should be given often. In a short while the parishioners would forget about attending the movies and support their own theatricals.</p>
