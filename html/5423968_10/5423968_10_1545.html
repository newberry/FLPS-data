   <p>With the growth of immigration in America, it is natural also that the number of young people is increasing. There are about two million Poles in America at present, including a great number of young people, born either in Poland or here in America. If we don't want the youth to be lost for the cause of Poland, we should make every effort possible to organize them into a body which would keep alive their Polish instincts and assure a better future for the Polish nation, and which would join in ties of fraternalism and peace these future generations, our young people, on whom our future rests.</p>
   <p>We know well that a division into two or three inimical factions will not lead to our ultimate aim, that is, the general good. The Polish people in America have been long divided into parties, and today we realize how harmful this is. The youth of today, therefore, should not follow in the old footsteps <span class="page-break">\2</span>but, regardless of party feeling, should combine into one harmonious union.</p>
   <p>This matter of uniting the Polish youth was already brought to notice through the initiative of the Patriotic-Educational Society of the Polish Youth of Chicago at the last convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. The society also appointed a committee which has been devoting its efforts to organize the Polish youth in America.</p>
   <p>The committee has prepared a constitution for the future Union of Youth, which is being carefully scanned by the Polish clergy of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>Here are the aims in view as prepared by the Committee:</p>
   <p>a) To guard the language of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>b) To keep alive the Polish nationality, to support religion in the Catholic and educational spirits.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>c) To install libraries, reading rooms, etc., where the young people can gather and be educated to become not only good Poles and Catholics, but also worthy citizens of this our adopted country.</p>
   <p>d) To pay death benefits.</p>
   <p>e) To defend Polish affairs in the American papers, if necessary.</p>
   <p>f) To arrange national celebrations for the youth on January 22, May 3, and November 29.</p>
   <p>The Polish Youth Union shall also be encouraged in arranging discourses for the young people.</p>
   <p>The Polish Youth Union organized on this basis will find, we hope, sincere acceptance, especially among the young people. Of course, the majority shall decide whether to omit or add or change the aims as outlined above.</p>
   <p>We ask all Polish youth societies in America to read this appeal at their <span class="page-break">\4</span>meetings and to consider the matter properly. Let friend and foe argue the matter and the result may benefit our future organization.</p>
   <p>We ask the Clergy, parents, guardians, and everyone who has any influence over the young people, to give us their support. We also ask the Polish press for advice, suggestions, and help in order to interest all of the Polish people in the Polish Youth Union of America.</p>
   <p>We invite all those interested, especially young people's societies, to send in their opinions, views, and suggestions to the secretary of the Committee, Mr. Frank P. Danisch, 733 Horn Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Committee:</p>
   <p>Stephen Napieralski</p>
   <p>Frank P. Danisch</p>
   <p>Vincent F. Eichstaedt</p>
   <p>Stanislaus J. Segera</p>
   <p>John Taters.</p>
   <p>We respectfully ask all papers to reprint this appeal.</p>
