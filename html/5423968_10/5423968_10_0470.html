   <p>After many postponements, the case against the excommunicated priest Anthony Kozlowski was finally brought to an end on Saturday before Judge Dooley.</p>
   <p>Kozlowski lost the case and was fined five dollars for causing a disturbance on the street in front of the home of Mrs. Mary Anna Kamienska, who claimed the priest insulted her during an argument.</p>
   <p>Kozlowski announced immediately that he would appeal but we doubt if that will do him any good.</p>
   <p>The complainant was represented by Attorneys Clemens J. Belinski and John C. King.</p>
   <p>Although the fine was small, the fact that he was found guilty proves the <span class="page-break">\2</span>mans character....Genuine priests do not cause disturbances or fights on our streets.</p>
