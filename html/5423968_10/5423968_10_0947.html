   <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ! First of all, before I begin to discuss the matter of Reverend Anthony Kozlowski of St. Hedwig Parish, I feel obliged to admit that I am at fault and to beg your forgiveness, for, speaking truthfully, it was I who started all this trouble. I begged my brother, Reverend Joseph Barzynski to accept Reverend Kozlowski as an assistant at St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>Therefore I beg forgiveness, dear brothers and sisters, because it was inconsiderate of me to send an unknown priest to your parish. I trust to God that I will be forgiven by all of you for my lack of foresight, for whatever damage has been unintentionally done.</p>
   <p>As for me, I promise earnestly to pray for you and your parish, for I do not wish to absolve myself of even a part of this great sorrow which has <span class="page-break">\2</span>fallen upon you. It is my desire, therefore, by this letter voluntarily to right the wrong that was done and to make the entire affair clear to the public eye, according to the holy truth of God and the holy spirit of the love of Christ.</p>
   <p>As I look upon the crafty execution of the affair in your parish, for which every Catholic and Christian heart suffers great pain, for which every honorable Pole is ashamed, I see that the foes of Poland are joyous and that the enemies of the church have cause to sneer. Therefore, I crumble with anxiety before God and consciously feel that I am obligated to make a sincere effort to correct the wrong. Because of this I wish again to announce publicly by this letter that to a large extent the fault was mine, dear fellow workers, brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>It is impossible for me to make properly clear the entire affair as it was started and helped along by certain people, parishioners and others, against my brother, the pastor of St. Hedwig Parish, Reverend Joseph Barzynski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Some say that my brother is at times rude in his expressions and is easily roused to anger. But, on the other hand, no one can accuse him of ever being a flatterer, hypocrite, cheat or conspirator. No such accusations were made by any layman or clergyman....That his opponent, Reverend Anthony Kozlowski, is entirely different, whether by nature or interest, is a fact.....</p>
   <p>Some claim that the pastor did not select any parishional committee. This, however, is not an established fact, for Reverend J. Barzynski has a large number of important parishioners assisting him in keeping accounts and order in the church.</p>
   <p>My brother, Reverend Joseph Barzynski, immediately after taking charge of St. Hedwig Parish, came in contact with people who, although they were not called to act as such, wanted to become pastors and to make the present pastor their assistant. Those priests who had personal gain in mind can agree with this. When a Catholic priest stoops so low as to sell himself <span class="page-break">\4</span>to persons who have no knowledge about the vocation and tasks of priesthood, especially of a pastor, but who wish to direct him, then he should become a Lutheran minister.</p>
   <p>As to the accounts, who has charge of them now? You all know that everyone has charge of them. Whoever desires to examine them may do so at any time; nothing is hidden. Every penny is accounted for many times; income and expenses are not kept secret; the books are always open.</p>
   <p>Those who did not offer any contributions to the church are the ones who cannot come to any peace. They would be happy, perhaps, if something from the church would fall to them.</p>
   <p>Finally, a parish committee may be elected each year and changed each year. The same system applies to the care of the books of the parish, and does not apply to the Articles of Faith, as long as they are clear and honest, void of personal gain to a certain group but serving the good of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>clergy and the parishioners, the school, the poor, and always the Home of God and the honor of God.</p>
   <p>We have proof of the kind of committees and order Reverend Kozlowski would set up. Promises and boasts are snares for people of weaker intellects; already it has been shown that many of Kozlowski's statements are and have been notorious lies and deceptions.</p>
   <p>Look, my dear friends! Did you consider the nature of the work that you have been carrying out? In reality, there is nothing debatable in this matter of Reverend A. Kozlowski and Reverend J. Barzynski. The entire affair is in express and indisputable disregard not only of the clergy and the temple of God but also of the authority of the bishop. "Those who hear you hear me--and whosoever despises you despises me, and whosoever despises me despises the One who has appointed me."</p>
   <p>And do you think, my brothers, that you are permitted to manage the House <span class="page-break">\6</span>of God as you please? What would you say, brother, if someone entered your home and told you how to operate it?....You think, perhaps, that your home is better and that it rests on stronger foundations than the House of God? Would you permit anyone--Anthony or Ambrose--who came into your home to appoint most anyone he pleased to take over the management in your stead? The parish and the parish church gets from you no more respect and consideration than your own cottage and family!...</p>
   <p>Oh! Surely God will severely punish those who are guilty of such a blasphemous outlook. He will punish them from one generation to another, and not a few will suffer perpetual damnation.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, Reverend Kozlowski, after receiving an order from the bishop, was bold enough to hear confession from the Sisters of the III Order [sic]. Because of this he fell into a state of irregularitatis, and the nuns have been brought to a definite act of sacrilege. And this is the kind of priest you wish to have for pastors!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Where is your Roman Catholic faith? Where are your duties as a citizen and your common sense? The ashes of your fathers and mothers are being disturbed in the grave, and the blood of the holy Martyrs, who have been sacrificed because of their faith by the Muscovites, is calling to God for revenge because here one Muscovite soul is able to lead you to schism.</p>
   <p>My dearest brothers! I realize that I have unfortunately, not foreseeing any evil, presented the priest in question as an assistant to the pastor at St. Hedwig Parish. Because of this I have involuntarily become the cause of these great sins--which are weighing heavily upon my heart.</p>
   <p>Therefore, I beseech you! do not lose forever your souls. Remember that it is only one step from irregularisa to schismatic. Remember my twenty years of work with and among you and your sons and grandsons. Heed my call to you. Return to the path of righteousness, to the path of peace and respect for the laws of the church.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Your obedient servant and brother,</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski, C. R.</p>
