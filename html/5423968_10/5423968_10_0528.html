   <p>We are informed that a new joke is about to be perpetrated in St. Hedwig Parish in the "Independent Church of All Saints", namely, the blessing of church bells.</p>
   <p>A guest to this affair will be that notorious axcommunicated "prelate," Kolaszewski, from Cleveland, Ohio, in violet robes (naturally), and, at the same time, Kozlowski, so as not to lose in impressiveness, will also dress in violet robes.</p>
   <p>Will there be fun! But, joking aside, if this "blessing" of the bells really takes place, it will create a new scandal, a new sacrilege, which will once more fool the people.</p>
   
   <p>Oh, those bells! They will ring not to serve God, but to offend Him, and to emphasize the shame of the deluded people.</p>
