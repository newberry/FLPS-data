   <p>Seven hundred church representatives and priests gathered here in the Auditorium Hotel yesterday, and before them spoke Bishop McDowell, criticizing the public administrators and their oaths in fulfilling their duties.</p>
   <p>The bishop entirely and clearly chided Mayor Busse with these words: "What steps shall we take toward a person who takes an oath on his promises, and who later sets a bad example by not fulfilling these promises?" Everyone understood that this was spoken about Busse. "If we have such a person in our midst, beware then, because he is just like a criminal, whose place is usually behind steel bars."</p>
   <p>Bishop McDowell pretends that he forgot that politicians usually give us many promises during their candidacy, never thinking of ever keeping their word.</p>
