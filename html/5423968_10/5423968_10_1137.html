   <p>The blessing and dedication of the picture of the Holy Trinity Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish will be held during the vesper ceremonies at that church on the coming Sunday in the afternoon. The administration of this society desires to have these ceremonies as solemn as possible, and for that reason it cordially asks the administrations of all the parish societies, insofar as it could possibly be done, to endeavor to have their societies participate in this solemnity.</p>
