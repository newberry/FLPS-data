   <p>In the home of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, to date over 1, 300 volunteers have enlisted, during this week then, let our youth hurry up their decision and call at the recruiting office in the home of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The general secretary has received a letter during the last few days from the Captain of the district, Mr. F. R. Kenney, thanking him for his efforts so far in urging Polish volunteers to join the army.</p>
