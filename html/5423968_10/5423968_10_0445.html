   <p>Before and after the official notice of the Polish Catholic Congress appeared, calling the Polish Catholics to Buffalo, on September 22, to deliberate on our affairs, the liberal press, with a viciousness peculiar only to it, has endeavored, and continues with all the means at its command, to ridicule this "force," as they call it.</p>
   <p>The time for ridicule has passed. The Polish Catholic people, who base their moral and material welfare on the ten commandments, have understood the importance of this call only too well, and they are devoting all their energies to this holy cause. They have touched these cancerous growths which have been the cause of our discord much too often in the past; they have had a glimpse of the terrible pseudo-progressive parade, and with a growing fear in their hearts for the future they ask what will happen.</p>

   <p>From which direction will the hope of salvation appear? It reminds us of the Catholic Congresses in Torun-Cracow-Lwow (Poland) held recently--the benefits resulting to the Polish people are still fresh in our memories. The Prussian knows well that through these Catholic Congresses many an indifferent Pole is today bravely fighting for the national cause.</p>
   <p>In Galicia (Poland) it is well known that the local Catholic gatherings have damned the growing tide of socialism, anarchism, and false patriotism. Everybody knows that Catholic gatherings and congresses are the guardians of genuine human progress; they warn us of evil; they lead us on to that which is good.</p>
   <p>The vicious attacks of the liberal press against the Polish Catholic Congress are useless; their efforts are in vain. All of their false assertions cannot prevail against the might of our Catholic religion. The Congress will be held and the perverted press is powerless to stop it.</p>
