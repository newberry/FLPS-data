   <p>Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, who recently returned from a stay in Europe, has been appointed pastor of the St. Hyacinth Church by the archbishop of Chicago. The new pastor celebrated his initial Mass yesterday [Sunday] at the church, and the former pastor, Reverend Joseph Gieburowski, delivered a farewell address to his parishioners. His words touched the hearts of the entire congregation.</p>
   <p>After the services a general meeting of the parishioners was held to pay tribute to their old pastor, whom they held until he promised that he would pay them a visit next month.</p>
   <p>The change was made at the parish because of the ill health of the Reverend Gieburowski. Rather than have the parish without a pastor during the long absence of the stricken priest, a successor was appointed. In order to quiet any disturbance that may have been aroused, a committee was chosen to make the decision and introduce the new pastor.</p>
   <p>No doubt is held but that the Reverend Sedlaczek will continue the good work that he has been doing at St. Stanislaus Kostka parish. May God preserve the new pastor.</p>
