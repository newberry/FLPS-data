   <p>Whereas, There is now before the Congress of the United States a bill providing for the regulation of the entry of aliens into the United States, known and described as the Smith-Burnett Immigration Bill; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, The said bill contains, among other provisions, requirements of educational tests to which all aliens desiring admission to this country will be subjected, and their inability to meet the said tests will constitute a bar to their admission into the United States; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Conditions in many foreign lands render it impossible for countless thousands of people to secure an education in the land of their birth, as a result of the tyrannical attitude of foreign governments toward the people of countries that have been taken by force and deprived of their liberty; and Whereas, Many people residing within the boundaries of the former commonwealth of Poland are among these, who, as a result of years of oppression on the part of a hostile foreign government and its despotic desire to destroy them as a nation and a people, have been deprived of the rights and opportunity to attend school and colleges in their native land and have at their first opportunity sought liberty and freedom by emigrating to the United States; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The downtrodden and oppressed of every clime for years have looked upon these United States as a land where all honest people, irrespective of nationality or creed, could enter and enjoy the blessings of liberty, freedom, and justice; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The history of our country shows that from its very foundation, through its most trying moments, the vote, work, and efforts of immigrants have been the support of this American nation and this American country and its institutions; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The people coming here from Poland and in fact the peasants, artisans, and workingmen of European countries in general have upon their arrival proved themselves to be industrious, home-loving, moral, saving, and law-abiding--not drones in the beehives of our industries, not parasites upon the country, and not exploiters of their fellow men, but a desirable, healthy, and strengthening element who have worked diligently not only to better their own conditions but to make this country great and to perpetuate this free government and its great principles; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, So far as the Polish and other Slavonic people are concerned, there has been no fair, just, or intelligent investigation or report made of the immigration problem by any commission of our government, for no commission and no government report upon the subject did show any sympathy, nor were they objective as to the language, customs, conditions, and principles of the Polish or other Slavonic peoples; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, A healthy, moral, honest, industrious immigrant coming to this country, after a period of helpless childhood, as an adult is an asset and not a drain to this country, for the expense of bringing such an immigrant to the condition of becoming self-supporting has been done before his coming here by the country whence he comes; and</p>
   
   <p>Whereas, We know that literacy or education tests do not indicate the morals, conscience, honesty, integrity, or industry of an immigrant; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The present immigration laws and restrictions which are being rapidly enforced are sufficient to keep out of our country all vicious, unhealthy, and undesirable elements; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we, the members of (Name of Society) residing in (Name of City, Town, Village), State of, citizens of the United States of America, having the well-being and future of this great country and its government and institutions at heart, and as a part of that element of this country's population which came from Poland, hereby protest against the enactment of the proposed restrictions requiring educational tests as being unfair, unjust, and un-American.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Hon. (Name of Congressman), Congressman from the State of, for submission to Congress.</p>
