   <p>"At the call of the pastor of our parish, Reverend John Kasprzycki, the administrations of all the societies in our parish met in the school hall on Sunday, May 3, after Vesper services.</p>
   <p>After prayer, the undersigned was unanimously chosen as secretary of the meeting, and the pastor explained the purpose of the meeting.</p>
   <p>He said the meeting had been called in order to come to an understanding in regard to the picnic which is to be held on July 4 for the benefit of the proposed Thaddeus Kosciusko monument.</p>
   <p>Every society has received an invitation to the meeting sent out by the main committee in charge of the picnic.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The picnic idea was accepted in principle, and, on a motion by Mr. L. Kalisz, a subcommittee of twenty-five was selected to make further arrangements. The following were selected members of this subcommittee [Translator's note: Only five names are given, so the figure twenty-five is evidently a typographical error]: L. Kalisz, from Holy Cross Society; Joseph Wyrvchowski, from Saint Joseph Society; Joseph Walinski, from Saint Casimir Young Men's Society; and Jacob Rybandt and Frank Sobieszczyk, from Saint John Cantius Society.</p>
   <p>The reverend pastor earnestly recommended that some action be taken to buy bells for our church.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned with a prayer.</p>
   <p>Joseph Walinski, secretary.</p>
