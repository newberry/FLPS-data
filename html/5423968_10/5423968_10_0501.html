   <p>A curious case was decided yesterday by Judge Wolf in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Joseph Kaszubowski, 17 Pulaski Street, a member of two groups--the Jacob Wejer Society No. 1, under the protection of Saint Francis Xavier, and the Saint Hedwig Parish, joined the "Independents" at the time the unfortunate schism began in Saint Hedwig Parish. As a result, he was expelled from the Wejer Society, the constitution of which denies membership to anyone not in accord with the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>This was perfectly right, but Kaszubowski felt that he had been mistreated, so he sued the Jacob Wejer Society for $200.</p>
   <p>The case was assigned to Judge Wolf. An American lawyer represented Kaszubowski. Attorney Clemens J. Bielinski, together with Mr. Hubert Abraham, <span class="page-break">2</span>president of the society, represented the defendant.</p>
   <p>The society was victorious.</p>
   <p>The Judge decided that the "Independents" demands were baseless and unjustified and dismissed the case. Now Kaszubowski will have to pay court costs also.</p>
   <p>May this case be a warning to all the other "Independents".</p>
   <p>By renouncing membership in the true Catholic Church, they lose the right to belong to Catholic Societies...This certainly is easy to understand.</p>
