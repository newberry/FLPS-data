   <p>At the meeting held at the [Polish World's Fair] Reception Committee's headquarters on July 18, a committee of three was appointed to prepare a memorial to be distributed at the Catholic Congress in Chicago. The Committee completed this important work in Polish in the allotted time and presented it at the meeting held on Sunday (at which Polish Day arrangements were discussed).</p>
   <p>The memorial is an extensive one, entitled, "Persecution of Catholics in Poland by Russia." It is outlined as follows: 1. Introduction. 2. Source of the persecution. 3. Historical background--Catharine II, Nicholas I. 4. Insurrection of 1863, Alexander II. 5. "Conversion" of Unites, in Chelm, in 1875. 6. Present system of religious persecution in Poland. 7. Conclusion. The meeting agreed that the memorial answered the purpose adequately.</p>
   <p>With a few additions and corrections, the memorial will be translated into <span class="page-break">2</span>English and printed in several thousand copies. It will be ready on September 4.</p>
