   <p>There is being held at the All Saints Church's parish hall a three-days' synod of the Polish National Church, a country-wide religious organization. Among the 107 men and women delegates, there are 26 priests, representing their parishes, with Reverend Gawrychowski as chairman.</p>
   <p>Different commissions, nominated at the first session of the synod, are filled with men delegates, with the exception of the commission on celibacy, where there are also two women delegates.</p>
   <p>In the leading address, delivered by the bishop of the Polish National Church, Reverend Franciszek Hodur, there was emphasized the need of further expansion of church activities, the necessity of self-defense before the aggressive inroads of the Roman Catholic Church, while exerting more influence on the national, moral and religious life of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland. As to the means by which the doctrines and principles of the Polish National Church could be propagated more effectively, the speaker recommended to the synod that a more serious attention should be given to the publishing and spreading of suitable missionary literature.</p>

   <p>The matter of celibacy, brought up by Reverend Cichy, evoked an enlivened discussion, but no definite agreement on the subject was reached.</p>
   <p>While reporting for the commission on rituals and ceremonies, Reverend Krupski recommended to the synod that the Latin language should be eliminated from the liturgy of the Polish National Church and the Polish language substituted instead.</p>
   <p>There were nominated by the synod four new bishops, namely, Reverend Bonczak, of Milwaukee, Wis.; Reverend Gawrychowski, of Rochester, N. Y.; Reverend Plaza of Chicago Ill, and Reverend Cichy, of Toledo, Ohio. Reverend Krupski was appointed rector of the seminary, and Reverend Grochowski was elected general secretary. The above mentioned six priests were approved by the synod as constituting also the Board of Spiritual Advisors for the entire Church.</p>
   <p>These ponderous and eventful accomplishments by the synod were solemnly commemorated with the evening ritualistic services at the All Saints Church, with the chant, "Te Deum Laudamus" (We Praise Thee, O God).</p>
   <p>The third and last day of the synod was started with a solemn Requiem Mass in <span class="page-break">\3</span>commemoration of the late Bishop Kozlowski, and of other deceased priests and members of the Church.</p>
   <p>At the final sessions, the synod accepted a new profession of faith, instituted few new religious commemorations on certain Sundays, heard reports on publications and on relation of the Polish National Church to other churches, approved some changes in the by-laws of the Church, and accepted a resolution calling for closer cooperation with Poland.</p>
   <p>The synod adjourned Dec. 3, at 6 P. M.</p>
