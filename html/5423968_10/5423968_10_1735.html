   <p>Telegrams were sent to Senators Robert M. La Follette and Shelby M. Cullom.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>We have just learned that Conference Immigration Bill, Section No. 3, requires immigrants to produce certificates of character from their own government.</p>
   <p>"Should this bill become a law it would bar political refugees from entering this country, as no government would give certificates of good character to political agitators who endeavor to secure laws for the betterment of their condition, while it might readily give such certificates to criminals and other undesirables in order to be rid of them.</p>
   <p>"This country has always been the asylum of political refugees and we, on behalf of seventy thousand members of the Polish Catholic Union of America who are citizens of this country, protest against this bill as being unjust <span class="page-break">2</span>and un-American, and we respectfully appeal to you to use your influence to defeat this measure.</p>
   <p>POLISH CATHOLIC UNION OF AMERICA</p>
   <p>S. Adamkiowicz, President.</p>
   <p>N. S. Budzban, Secretary.</p>
