Our hero was born in Chicago on the 6th day of January, 1891, and died on the battlefield of France on June 11, 1918.</p>
   <p>Wladyslaw Stelmaszek lived with his mother Michalina Stelmaszek before enlisting in the United States Army. His mother lives at 8347 Mackinaw Avenue. He volunteered into the U. S. Army on the 14th day of June, 1917, and was sent to the training camp in the South. He landed in France last winter and served with the 18th Field Artillery until his death.</p>
   <p>In the first part of the year he was on the Western Front in France. On Friday the 18th day of June there was a telegraphic report that <span class="page-break">\2</span>our here took an active part in a battle in which he was seriously wounded. Later on there was another official report from Washington stating that he was wounded on the 7th day of June and died on the 11th day of the same month in the field hospital, four days after receiving wounds at the front.</p>
   <p>Receiving the official reports his old mother went first to her oldest son, Jan, who lives at 83rd and Burley Avenue. He left four brothers.</p>
