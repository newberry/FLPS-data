   <p>Rev. Fr. Felix Zwiardowski, well known among Chicago Poles, has begun his twenty-sixth year as a priest. All this week he will celebrate his silver anniversary of priesthood.</p>
   <p>Rev. Fr. Zwiardowski, member of the Order of Resurrection Fathers, came to Santa Maria, Texas, April 6, 1866. He received the holy orders of priesthood at Galveston, Texas, the following year. On May 22, he was assigned to St. Hedwig's Parish. In 1870, he was called to Santa Maria, Texas, to take over the duties of director of Polish missions in that state, replacing Fr. Adolph Bakanowski.</p>
   <p>Many of the old Polish residents of Chicago remember when Fr. F. <span class="page-break">2</span>Zwiardowski came to St. Stanislaus Kostki's Parish in 1873. But soon after, in July of the following year, because of ill health caused by climatic changes he returned to Santa Maria. He has remained there ever since. Although his duties as a pastor keep him busy, he manages to make annual visits to Chicago. During his periodic stays in Chicago, old acquaintances are renewed and many times new friends are added to his visiting list.</p>
   <p>Last week, after a gala festival in honor of his silver anniversary of priesthood in Santa Maria, Rev. Fr. Zwiardowski made his nineteenth annual trip to our city. Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock, he will take part in a special mass at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Church.</p>
