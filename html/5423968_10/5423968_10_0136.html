   <p>Dr. Orlowski was in South Chicago by orders of "the protector of Polish people" to make apologies to Bishop Rhode for the statement that appeared in Narodowy that the aunt of our first Polish bishop in America gave him birth because she felt sorry for him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rhode dismissed Mr. Orlowski with nothing, stating that he will accept an apology only on one condition and that is, that Narodowy will correct the statement and that the "protector" must admit the authorship of the article which caused such a nasty suspicion.</p>
   <p>The 'protector' of the people who begs forgiveness in the anti-chamber of a bishop is a queer character.</p>
