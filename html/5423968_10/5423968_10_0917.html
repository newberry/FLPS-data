   <p>The unfortunate St. Hedwig Parish will possibly have order restored shortly and the church may be opened Sunday.</p>
   <p>The party of agitators, after receiving a rebuke from the Apostolic Delegate, Monsignor Satolli, has finally decided to give in to the bishop's demands. Monsignor Satolli, after becoming aware that the Parish Committee, which is formed of conservative parishioners, is becoming more influential with Archbishop Feehan and gaining more supporters in its efforts to have the church opened, declined to take part in the affair and so informed their delegate who had come to Washington.</p>
   <p>To carry out further their decision, the opposition, composed of twelve members, presented themselves before the Archbishop of Chicago and expressed their regret for the disruption of order at St. Hedwig Parish. They stated that <span class="page-break">\2</span>they were prepared to abide by the wishes of Bishop Feehan. They also made a request to have the church opened and to have a new pastor assigned to take charge. Bishop Feehan accepted their apology and promised to have the church opened on Sunday. As to the new pastor, he insisted that he will not accept anyone unless he measures up to qualifications.</p>
   <p>In all probability a letter relative to this matter will be issued tomorrow by the bishop, and will be published by Dziennik Chicagoski without delay.</p>
   <p>From this letter we will be able to learn who is to be appointed pastor and assistant at St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>The Parish Committee also had an audience with Bishop Feehan recently in regard to having the closed parish reopened. Prior to the reopening of the church, an understanding must be reached with the remainder of the opposition, which has formed another flank.</p>
   <p>In this respect the Parish Committee has requested Dziennik Chicagoski to <span class="page-break">\3</span>publish the following announcement:</p>
   <p>The undersigned wish to state publicly that the Parish Committee, composed of twelve members of St. Hedwig Parish, is holding a special meeting this evening, February 21, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>The opposition committee, which is also formed of twelve members, is cordially invited to attend this meeting and discuss plans for a complete understanding of the entire matter.</p>
   <p>The meeting will be held in Michael Kortas' hall, 1055 North Robey Street.</p>
   <p>Andrew Glowczewski, president</p>
   <p>Anthony Barczynski, secretary</p>
   <p>In publishing this appeal, we express the hope that concord will be reached between the two factions of St. Hedwig Parish, that peace will reign once <span class="page-break">\4</span>again among all parishioners, that the parishioners will accept the pastor whom the Bishop will appoint, and that St. Hedwig Church will be opened Sunday. It is our express desire that these wishes be realized.</p>
   <p>Along with this, we observe with pain that some of the Polish papers still persist in publishing false reports about the conditions at St. Hedwig Parish, and also about the Apostolic Delegate, Monsignor Satolli, and Bishop Feehan. These stories are undoubtedly directed at the short-sighted individuals who are apt to be influenced by them to start another misunderstanding among the parishioners.</p>
   <p>It is not unusual that the Tribune should be playing up some of these fabricated stories, for the Tribune is a Republican mouthpiece, and is trying to snare some fish in the Republican net. But it is more than surprising to see the Gazeta Polska (Polish Gazette), published by W. Dyniewicz, hurriedly publish, without control, various unfounded stories about the parish.</p>
