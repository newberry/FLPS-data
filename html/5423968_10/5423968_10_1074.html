   <p>The consecration of the recently completed St. Stanislaus B. M. (Bishop and Martys) Church was a solemn occasion for the new Polish colony in Cragin yesterday. This colony has a promising future before it. Situated on the Northwest Side, just within the boundaries of the city(twenty odd minutes by the train from the Loop), not far from factory and business districts, it has attracted quite a large number of Poles--and will continue to attract them. Besides the Poles already settled there, a great many more own lots on which they intend to build homes. Yesterday's consecration of the church was due entirely to the efforts of the Poles living in Cragin.</p>
   <p>The little church, whose patron is St. Stanislaus B. M., is a frame building with a foundation and steeple of brick. The cost of its construction was ten thousand dollars. Its interior is almost completely furnished. There is a beautiful altar to St. Stanislaus, and bells have been presented to the church by one of the landowners of Cragin. The organ is a gift of Walter Wleklinski of Chicago.</p>
