   <p>The creation of a committee to represent the Slavs in America. One of the first subjects to be considered, is the question of immigration. The point was brought out, that there was a need for a joint committee, that would represent and intercede, in all matters, pertaining to the welfare of the Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks in the United States. It was also pointed out that the present immigration laws, discriminate against the Slavs, classifying them as undesirables. We must defend our honor.</p>
