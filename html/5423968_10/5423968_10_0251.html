   <p>A memorable, historical day in the annals of the flourishing parish of St. Hyacinth in Avondale will remain forever in the minds of the people.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Bishop Muldoon, with the assistance of many members of the clergy, consecrated the corner stone under the new school and temporary church.</p>
   <p>It was a gala day from early morning for the whole parish. This was noticeable already after the beautiful decorating of numerous homes, especially in part of Milwaukee Avenue, Diversey Avenue, Central Park, Wolfram Street, Lawndale Street, George Street and Drake Street, and also many other local streets.</p>
   <p>Into the corner stone there was laid away, alongside the Polish and English periodicals from recent dates, a document splendidly written in Gothic style on parchment, giving valuable data leading up to this achievement by the Poles in Chicago.</p>
