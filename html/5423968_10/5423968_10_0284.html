   <p>Bishop Weber, a Catholic bishop, in his statement protests Bishop Kozlewski's intention to resign his Roman-Catholie standing of bishop to Join the Protestant Episcopal church, in the year 1902.</p>
   <p>As is known. Bishop Weber was one of the few who helped Bishop Koslowski be ordained a bishop; that is why Bishop Weber wrote this letter to Kezlewski.</p>
   <p>"In article 48, of the Old Roman-Catholic Testament, it states the rules and obligations of a Catholic bishop. That is why I want to call your attention to this, Bishop Kozlewski.</p>
   <p>"When I heard that you were deserting the Catholies and intending to side and work with the Protestant Church, it was very hard for me to believe.</p>

   <p>"Remember, Bishop Kozlowski, that you received your consecration as bishop from our hands, the old Roman Catholic Bishop's.</p>
   <p>"Before your consecration you signed your name under the Utrech system, on the 24th of August 1889 and by this act you most solemnly obligated yourself that you would not engage or be induced by any member of a  Protestant or any other religion, to join their forces without considering you and your obligation to the Catholic religion. May God forbid that I should believe this to be the truth."</p>
   <p>In the near future Bishop Weber claims to bring to the eyes of the people the absolute truth in this matter, signed personally,</p>
   <p>Theodore Weber, Rev. Bishop. "</p>
