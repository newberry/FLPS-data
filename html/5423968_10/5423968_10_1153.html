   <p>The inclement weather that prevailed throughout the week cast some doubt on the success of the blessing ceremonies of the cornerstone of St. Michael's School. All the parishioners of the newly formed South Chicago parish were gravely concerned Saturday, for the western horizon was gradually spreading a dismal outlook for the following day. Reverend A. Nowicki, pastor, performed a special mass and offered it in memory of St. Anthony, the performer of miracles. Many churchgoers joined in the services and prayed that the Almighty might bless the parish with sunny weather for the next day.</p>
   <p>Sunday morning, during the sermon of High Mass, the pastor requested all members of the church to attend the ceremonies of the cornerstone despite the threatening skies. He also informed them that the well-known Reverend V. Barzynski would officiate.</p>
   <p>Just before noon the dark clouds slowly began to disappear. The first rays <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of sunshine of the week penetrated the gray mist. The dread of a wet Sunday afternoon was cast away.</p>
   <p>Special guests for the cornerstone services were: Reverend S. Kobzynski, Reverend V. Barzynski, Fr. J. Barzynski, Reverend Ratz (German), and Reverend Sullivan (Irish), City Treasurer Peter Kiolbassa, and other dignitaries of the city. Members of the Dziennik Chicagoski and Wiara I Ojczyzna, including those of the Calumet, were also present.</p>
   <p>Immediately after dinner hundreds of people began to gather at the site of the new school and temporary church. All the Polish church societies of the district began to arrive. Societies of other parts of the city were at the scene. Music from a large orchestra filled the air.</p>
   <p>At three o'clock a large number of societies were represented. The Catholic Knights, A. O. Hibernians, St. Peter and Paul's, Catholic Foresters, Knights of the Blessed Virgin, and Knights of St. Casimir were some of the representative organizations.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Reverend V. Barzynski came out at four o'clock to start the ceremonies. Music greeted his entrance upon the pavilion, which overlooked the completed foundation for the new school. There were about 4,000 people about the stand.</p>
   <p>The blessing of the 2,000 pound cornerstone was officially started with an opening prayer by Reverend Barzynski, followed by a litany. A copper container bearing documents of St. Michael's Parish was placed in a niche and the first trowel of cement was spread by Reverend Nowicki, pastor of the parish.</p>
   <p>During the raising of the stone, one of the workers fainted. Fortunately, this mishap did not endanger anyone, nor did the worker suffer any complications.</p>
   <p>After the recitation of the psalm "Miserere" the officiating priest blessed the basement. Later, he made a speech appropriate for the occasion.</p>
   <p>"The Church," said Reverend Barzynski, "is a congregation of beings who possess immortal and intelligent souls. From this material God builds an immortal church which serves the calling of heaven. Each one of us is a composite of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>this material. Our lives are the proving grounds which determine whether or not we are capable of becoming builders of this Church, and the churches of the mortal people are the examination rooms.</p>
   <p>"The erection of temples of worship," continued the reverend speaker," shows us that we too should build up our religious faith. We can do this through our will, work, and intelligence. The Roman Catholic faith has gathered all of us here without any regard to nationality, and it actuates us to support this institution in which our body and soul will find peace and strength."</p>
   <p>He continued, "In this holy edifice you will receive the graces of God in the form of the holy sacraments, the counsel of salvation, and at times sound reprimand for your wrongs. No society has such a strong foundation for the purification of our sins. The saints and martyrs have formed the foundation of the Catholic Church. Therefore, this faith needs no improvement. It is not blind. Evil finds no kind word. Good is always supported, exalted, consoled, and sanctified. It is not blind, but full of love toward its friends and enemies, for the church is full of deeds that please God.</p>

   <p>"Its truths are not secrets, but shine brightly in the face of the world. The missionaries are continually broadening its range along the frontiers of paganism. Their work is much easier in such places than among wiseacres and sophists.</p>
   <p>"Just as a mason fits the bricks in place, so does God fit the soul in its place, which is to pursue his teachings in the Church. We should take more part in this calling if we do not wish to have our souls cast away as unfit.</p>
   <p>"Not every brick fits in place; there are many kinds of people. Quietness and humbleness add to the fitness of the building, and the sacraments are the mortar. With these virtues we can be examples to other people. We will be the good bricks that are needed to build a strong edifice of faith, and despite the fact that uncalled for supporters are found among us, the Polish churches will continue in their strength."</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of this speech, Reverend Adolph Nowicki thanked the Germans and Irish, in German and in English, for taking part in this gala dedication.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>He expressed the hope that all nationalities will support the activities of this parish. All the marshals and presidents of the societies were invited to the pastor's home.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the orchestra played a national hymn, "Boze Cos Polske."</p>
