   <p>"It's time, Father, let's go," said goodhearted Jas (Jack), bursting into my room like a bomb. He had just learned that the archbishop had appointed me rector of the new parish of St. Michael Archangel, which was about to be established in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Let's go, Father; we worked hard enough before we got you elected. So let's go. The people are waiting with a band over at the station."</p>
   <p>We left. The weather was truly typical of Chicago--a particularly nasty drizzle. Wide open spaces all around us; here and there a sagging house, further on fields and water--water and fields. Looking around in all directions I thought: H'mm, this must be the place where geese and ducks congregate, because there don't seem <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to be any people living around here.</p>
   <p>After a forty-minute ride, we arrived in South Chicago, but the band and drums somehow whisked themselves over to 83rd Street, expecting us to land over there. At any rate we arrived safely, but here was another problem: where was one to live in this place?</p>
   <p>"Jas," I queried, "where am I going to stay?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean where? At my house, of course!"</p>
   <p>"But I'll be putting you to unnecessary trouble."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense, Father, you're going to stay with me and that's that."</p>
   <p>So I stayed at his home.</p>
   <p>I was very happy there and felt perfectly at home in this friendly and hospitable <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>house.</p>
   <p>There was only one problem: it seemed that the room which I was occupying somehow or other missed the stove; I guess the stove and room were not on speaking terms. Therefore, on arising in the morning, I frequently had to take careful inventory to make sure that Mr. Frost did not take up permanent residence some-where about my person in order to play a trick on me. I had, my dears, to take good care of my poor bones, because I looked upon them as church property. But when I told good old John Szostakowski about this, he dragged out a feather bed for me, because he did not want to be responsible for anything happening to the parish property. Despite this, I had a very good time at his house. His good wife did everything she could to entertain the priest fittingly and to make him genuinely welcome. The children, too, did not bother me very much, as at that time there were only two Wolodyiowskis and one little Helen. [Translator's note: Characters in Sienkiwicz's trilogy. We would probably say "two wild Indians and one Pocahontas."]</p>
   <p>Therefore, good people, I thank you for your good old traditional Polish hospitality. <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>God reward you for the shelter which you have given me.</p>
