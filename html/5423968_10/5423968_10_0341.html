   <p>Tomorrow at 8 P.M. will mark the beginning of Advent lessons and services for the Polish youth at Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish. It would be a fine thing if our younger people would take interest in this period and attend the church services to hear the word of God. We all know that the Advent period is designated for the preparation of the great event, the birth of Christ!</p>
   <p>Polish youth, recall the words of August Selizius, who said "Although Christ may have been born a thousand times at Bethlehem, if he did [not] become alive within you, you will be lost forever......"</p>
   <p>That is why these lessons that will begin to be given Saturday are offered, for they prepare your hearts for the coming of the Son of God.</p>
   
   <p>There is no doubt that the Polish youth of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish will attend these services. Above all, the parents concerned with the spiritual good of their children should send them out for this heavenly banquet.</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph Ziemba, C.R.</p>
