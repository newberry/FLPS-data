   <p>Because of the prevalent spread of the grippe throughout the world, the Pope has issued a dispensation which permits the Catholics not to observe Lent. This has been done to enable the people to fortify themselves with reserves of energy and thus be able to safeguard themselves against this rapidly spreading epidemic, the ravages of which are so great that every precaution should be taken.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that as a general rule the sick do not have to fast. Also exempt from this practice are those who work too hard, children, old persons, and pregnant women. This shows that for many years certain restrictions were granted during the observance of the lenten period.</p>
   <p>The Pope's dispensation saves a great deal of worry to many priests and their assistants, not to mention the followers of the faith, who thus are free from many doubts and unnecessary contrition.</p>

   <p>This dispensation, however, is not intended to prohibit fasting or to discourage people from it. Those desiring to fast may do so as in previous years.</p>
   <p>The gist of the Pope's order is that those who observe the fasting period but disregard other important duties by becoming negligent in observing them, will be like the Jews during the biblical days, when the Lord, through one of his prophets, said: Ye have fasted, but your will was only in the fasting.</p>
   <p>Fast is primarily a holy, religious, and advantageous practice when it is done in the name of God. What the prophet says, "Be angry, but do not sin," should be especially remembered during Lent. Fast, or do not fast, but do not sin.</p>
   <p>If you are in a position to fast, do so in the name of God. Do not attempt to critize or accuse people who are unable to follow the dictates of the Church because of physical handicaps, working conditions, or economic standing.</p>

   <p>Perhaps if these people were in different circumstances, they would abide by the laws [of the Church] without as much as an unkind word.</p>
   <p>Would a fasting mother be considered a good mother were she to deny her child its vital food?</p>
   <p>Fast Brother, but do not imbibe! There are many people who have become habitual drinkers. Accustomed to the use of liquor through a long period of years, they spend most of their lives fasting because they cannot eat, and as a consequence they walk about with a bloated appearance, loathsome to themselves and others, derelicts unfit for prayer or work, becoming unsightly beggars. Shamelessly they walk the streets to while away their time begging, not for food but for liquor. As soon as they get some money, they hurry as quickly as possible to quiet their burning desire for alcohol, a desire which is never quenched and which makes them to live the life of the condemned.</p>

   <p>O Brothers, now is the time to give aid to the helpless, the time to teach them to eat whenever they wish and whatever they want. Let them eat bread or meat on Friday on Sunday until they learn to eat and break away from the disgusting habit of drinking. Now is the time for them to become men of honor and pride!</p>
   <p>There are others who like to fast, but they like to slander those who do not give them praise for their sacrifice and their hypocritical religious belief.</p>
   <p>There are also those who fast, but the more they abstain the more mordant they get. As a result, they become aroused with anger and blasphemy. Their fasting is worthless, Godless.</p>
   <p>If you are to fast, do it without ostentation, slander, anger, and blasphemy. Do it of your own volition. The lenten and other days of abstinence will be easy to follow. We advise to those who brag about their sacrifices to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>eat three meals a day with as much meat as they wish until they will become worthy and of better heart to make this small sacrifice in the name of the Holy Father.</p>
   <p>This is what one of the Apostles said: "Although I would speak in all languages ... and become dried to the bone of fast, it would be of no avail if.I did not do it for the love of God."</p>
   <p>Those who believe in the concepts of the Roman-Catholic Church and follow its teachings willingly, are the ones that benefit most from these indulgences. They are the ones that need not be told time and again, for they have observed the tenets of the Church for many years. They realize that fasting is not practical for those who are unhealthy or who belong to the hard working class.</p>
   <p>These words of Christ should always be before them: "Guard yourselves in order that you would not show your acts of righteousness before others," that is, do such things in a way that others would not see. "and when you fast, do not be like the sad hypocrites." ...</p>
