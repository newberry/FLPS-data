   <p>What has been expected for a long time has finally happened. The overcrowded condition of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church during some of the Sunday services has attracted the attention of city authorities. The Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church, has received a letter from the Mayor pointing out the danger of overcrowding to the lives and health of his parishioners.</p>
   <p>It is evident from this letter that such overcrowding is not permitted by law, since it endangers the lives of thousands of people, especially as in the case of the upper church, where there are no side exits. If we wish to avoid having the city close our church, we will have to prevent overcrowding and at the same time give access into the church to all who wish to attend services.</p>

   <p>The construction of a new church on Chicago Avenue or Carpenter Street is being considered to relieve this condition. But in any event, the new church cannot be completed before autumn. It is in the interest of all of the faithful to do what they can to get construction on the building started as soon as possible. In the meantime, steps will have to be taken for immediate temporary relief. The Reverend Barzynski will inform his parishioners of the action he has decided to take immediately after the sermon tomorrow (Sunday).</p>
