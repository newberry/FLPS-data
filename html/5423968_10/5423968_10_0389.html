   <p>The following sermon on Saint Adalbert was given Sunday, April 25, at Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church, by Reverend J. Gieburowski on the occasion of the nine-hundredth anniversary of the Saint's martyrdom. A large number of Polish societies had gathered to hear the sermon:</p>
   <p>"Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever! (Hebrews, 13th chapter 7,8.)</p>
   <p>In the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Our country, beloved brothers, can be justly called a nation of pious believers, for it has not only accepted the Christian religion but followed it reverently everywhere and at all <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>times. The Poles have also defended their faith against the wild hordes of Mongols and Turks that tried to overwhelm the Christian world. The principles of the Christian faith have been protected against the evil influences of schismatic movements. Consequently, the Poles, just as from the beginning, now are one of the finest models in Europe.</p>
   <p>"Our country can also be called an apostolic nation. For wherever a Pole has settled, he planted the roots of the Christian religion. In his own country faith was propagated by him and protected against the spoliation of other religions from neighboring countries.</p>
   <p>"But, above all, Poland has been and is a nation of martyrs. This is something of which we can be proud before other peoples, for no other nation has suffered as much for the will of God and the Christian cause as the Poles. We can rejoice over this because this suffering gave us life, this death [loss of Poland] gave us vitality--as can be seen by the accomplishments of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>our people of today. Just 'as the seed of martyrdom is the common seed of Christianity,' according to Tertullian, an early Latin father of the Church, in like manner the same seed can be our seed of life and force of our national spirit. This is being exemplified on Polish soil.</p>
   <p>"Saint Adalbert was born in the year 956 A. D. on Bohemian soil, of a noble Slavic family. He received his training in Magdeburg under the guidance of Archbishop Adalbert, who consecrated his charge as a priest in 980 A. D. As a young priest, Saint Adalbert returned to his native town to preach the gospel of the Church to his people.</p>
   <p>"Through his industrious work as a priest, Saint Adalbert was soon after appointed Bishop and then Archbishop of Prague, where the Bohemians were still observing many pagan rites. The energetic Archbishop realized that he could not convert this pagan horde through physical force; consequently he used spiritual means. Through prayer, penance, and abstinence he began <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to win the people to his fold. To be more fortified in his work, he joined the Benedictine Order in Rome. And through the will of the Almighty, success in converting the Poles and the pagan Prussians came to him with his earnest work. Saint Adalbert preached the gospel along the frontiers of paganism, and wherever he went the true light of his sermons were welcomed and accepted. The Poles willingly accepted the Christian doctrines and did not mistreat nor brutally kill the messengers of God, as in other countries. Seeing the willingness of the people to accept his form of religion, the inspired preacher approached the Polish King Boleslav, who not only welcomed him and his teachings but also suggested that he preach to the neighboring Prussians. But the Prussians were not as hospitable and noble as the Poles. They adhered to their idols and killed the trusting and sincere missionary. Seven spears pierced his body, and as Saint Adalbert fell to the ground, just like the martyr Stephen, he raised his eyes toward heaven and prayed for his murderers. He prayed that his blood might sprout the seed of Christianity on Prussian soil and that this same blood might bring the blessing of God upon the Poles <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and upon Poland.</p>
   <p>"Verily, many blessings came to Poland!</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Apr. 27, 1897.</p>
   <p>"Above all, his efforts brought to the hearts of the pagan Poles the true light; the seed of the true faith sprouted, and the old religious customs were abandoned. Thus, his martyrdom helped the Poles unite under the banner of brotherly love. Under the sufferings of Saint Adalbert the Poles were brought together as one nation.</p>
   <p>"Prior to this, the activities of the Poles were unknown; they could not compare themselves in anything with other nations; they were not a people of accomplishments, There are legends and unusual tales of miraculous incidents; but one could not see light, truth, and goodness. The more important history of Poland begins with the martyrdom of Saint Adalbert.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>His sufferings started a miraculous development in Poland. Churches and convents, the fortresses of Christianity and true learning, began to be erected in great numbers all over Poland. From these institutions learning began to spread throughout the country; the strength of the spirit began to grow.</p>
   <p>"So it happened. Only after the blood of the martyr soaked the Polish soil, only after the remains of the martyr were laid to rest, only then did the Poles become a great nation which subjected the pagan Prussians, defeated the wild Saxons, Bohemian, Hungarians, Russians, and stemmed the onslaught of the Germans, who wanted to wipe out the Poles with the sword. As justly stated by one of the great Polish preachers, Saint Adalbert was the builder of Poland. And that is why the people of the province of Poland, who have nurtured the spirit of Poland from their cradles, celebrate the nine-hundredth anniversary of Saint Adalbert amidst pomp and glory. They pay homage for the tears he shed and the suffering he underwent for the sake of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>his people. They offer prayer at the ancient cathedral at Gniezno where the body of the martyr rests, as a token of appreciation for planting the seed of Christianity on Polish soil. Out of this seed sprouted a great Polish civilization.</p>
   <p>"And that is why we immigrants should consider this a solemn moment, for we are Poles just as well as those across the sea. We should join them, in prayer, for Saint Adalbert gave us the same jewel. But, above all, we should pray to Saint Adalbert to give us strength in the belief of our faith. Ah, this, above all, is imperative to us in America! It is necessary for us to open the eyes of our soul to the seven wounds of our saintly brother, who fell to the ground with prayer upon his lips, with heavenly joy and with firm determination, and ask ourselves for what idea did Saint Adalbert die with such heroism.</p>
   <p>"The answer--that he dies for the sublime idea of the sublime idea of the Holy Faith, that he sacrificed his life in order to lead the people to God, to condemn and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>uproot evil and idolatry--should be closely imbedded in our souls; it should encourage us toward imitation, and should be written indelibly upon our hearts.</p>
   <p>"The enemies of truth and the Catholic faith are ridiculing us more openly in America. They exert the greatest effort to tear from us our most cherished jewel and gift of God--the Holy Faith--and in its stead try to spread disbelief, godlessness, and the despoliation of customs. We must be able to comprehend that the more the people fall away from the true faith, the more they fall away from their morals and consequently lose their reasoning in behavior--and the more they waste their life and spiritual strength. The apostles of godlessness--evil books and senseless newspapers--not only distort one's life but also undermine our moral stability. How many American souls have already been contaminated both spiritually and materially!</p>
   <p>"Ah, my dear brothers! Shouldn't we, upon the advent of this great day of Saint Adalbert, stand upon our own feet and band together to oppose this <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>godless influence? Silence in this respect is the treason of God--the renunciation of the true faith. And the denial of the faith is the greatest insult to God. We should be grateful to the Lord for calling us to the true faith, and therefore we should always acknowledge it everywhere and every time. True love of truth and sincere and unflinching devoutness in the Christian faith do not permit indifference in faith, nor do they allow the negligence of the principles of the religion. Therefore, down with false tolerance! Down with teachings and principles that renounce the Holy Faith! Down with education that renounces God! Down with progress that takes the evil road! And, above all, we should cast aside from our ranks evil books and newspapers that condemn Faith and the virtues thereof. Our training and knowledge leans upon the true Christian faith--let our progress be based upon the precepts of goodness and faithfulness to god. Let us become worthy inheritors of the faith of our forefathers. Remember our superiors who spoke the word of God. Observe the true faith. Amen."</p>
