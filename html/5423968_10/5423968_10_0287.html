   <p>Faculty communicator of accomplishments, in regard to the third catholic congress, calls our attention to convoke this congress. We are calling your attention to the fact that we are not opposed to the 3d Catholic congress being held in Chicago, but we have the right to demand, that at this meeting of the Catholic congress we bring forth the most interesting faction.</p>
   <p>We have over 30 group federations belonging to this Polish Catholic organization, of this number only 4 groups were present which is roughly speaking, one eighth of the full strength, these four groups took part in the voting, and picked Chicago as the city in which to hold this Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>The executive board feels that it is compelled tocall this third Catholic Congress to this, and not to any other city.</p>
   <p>Did the executive board forget that more than one eighth of this group federation <span class="page-break">2</span>is necessary at these meetings to vote on matters pertaining to choosing a city for this Catholic congress?</p>
   <p>If all the groups were present and took part in the voting there wouldn't be any comment or hard feeling, if any city were picked that they thought wasn't  good enough to have this congress.</p>
   <p>When all Polish Catholic organizations are joined in unity, as the Polish education organization, then it will be time to have a central committee choose the city for the congress and then have all the groups vote on it.</p>
   <p>In this group we would like to have all the Catholic churches, Polish Catholic group organizations, Polish artists and dramatic club, and the Polish press, combine as one.</p>
   <p>At this congress all the presidents, executives; and high officials of these different groups will speak, on the Poles in the United States, their welfare, their <span class="page-break">3</span>ways of living, labor problems, education, traits, ideas, virtues, and the morality of the people.</p>
   <p>We have information that Bishop Quigley of Chicago will call this 3rd Catholic Congress to order; this made us immensely happy, but we were happier when we heard that Bishop Quigley was to be made Archbishop in Buffalo. Because of his intended advancement, Archbishop Quigley, will rewrite his speech which he will read to the assembled officials of this congress.</p>
   <p>He smilingly admits that his speech will be short, but interesting, and will make every Catholic Pole very happy.</p>
