   <p>The Larger Catechism of the Roman Catholic Religion for Parochial Schools (Chicago: Polish Publishers' Association, 1892). Price twenty-five cents.</p>
   <p>The Larger Catechism of the Roman Catholic Religion for Parochial Schools has just come off the press. Published by our Polish Publishers' Association, it contains answers to the second edition of Deharb's Catechism. It is in three parts, with lessons on the principles of the Roman Catholic religion. In addition, it contains the ministration and a collection of the most important prayers. The edition carries on its top cover a view of St. Stanislaus Kostkas Church. The need for a book such as this has long been felt in the Polish parochial schools of America, and it is believed that it will find many purchasers. It must be added that this catechism has received the gracious approbation of Archbishop Feehan.</p>
