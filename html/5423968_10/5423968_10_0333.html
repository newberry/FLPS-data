   <p>From the circle of clergy we receive as follows: From sometime our newspapers have been filled with petty quarrels, bickerings,, so that at times they were too odious to read. The subjects of the arguments are foolish, small, without meaning in comparison to the farm it does the reading public.</p>
   <p>The blind do not see that the individual suffers thru this, and the division into parties, which are already weak causes them to become still weaker. If the editors possessed a little charity that is real christian charity, there would not be such quarrels among us.</p>
   <p>We would be very grateful to you Mr. Editor, if you would take these grains of gold from the book "Following Christ" by Thomas A Kempis, Volume 1, Chapter 14-15-16-17.</p>
   <p>"Turn your eyes upon yourself and be careful not to judge others." </p>
   <p>"It is waste of time to try to judge others, you may be mistaken and commit a sin. But to judge oneself is useful work."</p>
