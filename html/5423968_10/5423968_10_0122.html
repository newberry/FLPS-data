   <p>A great celebration was held on Sept. 20, 1914, at St. Adalbert Parish, as it was the consecration of the new St. Adalbert's Church, which was built for about $200,000.</p>
   <p>For this occasion the whole neighborhood was festively decorated with Polish and American flags. Nearly all the houses on 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st streets, between Ashland and Paulina Street, were decorated. Other decorations were the colors of red and white with stars, and the papal colors. From early morning the traffic was great in the neighborhood. One could see not only the parishioners of St. Adalbert, but also many from other Polish parishes and settlements. All were here to see the big parade and if possible to get into the church. There was plenty of room for all in the streets, but in the church there was only room enough for 2,000 people. There were about 30,000 people on the street. The society of the Union attended in corpore and was lead by the general administration. The parade was <span class="page-break">\2</span>very impressive and it will live long in the memories of the people. It lasted about two hours. Nearly all Catholic, national societies, Falcons and choirs and also some of the Bohemian societies, participated. There were also other Polish parishes represented.</p>
   <p>The parade began in the front of St.Adalbert's church at about 9 A. M., and lasted until about 11 P. M. At Jackson Boulevard the parade greeted the archbishops, bishops and other priests who were in automobiles. From here the parade moved south on Ashland Avenue to 18th Street, west on 18th Street to Paulina Street, north on Paulina Street straight to the church.</p>
   <p>The consecration ceremonies were conducted by archbishop Quigley of Chicago. After the ceremonies, Bishop Kozlowski of Milwaukee, transferred the precious holy sacrament from the old to the new church. This was followed by a pontifical mass. The mass was celebrated by Archbishop Bonzano, apostolic delegate in Washington. His assistants at the mass were Rev. Stanislaw Nawroeki, as archpresbiter; Rev. Boleslaw Nowakowski, as deacon; and Rev. Jan Lange, as subdeacon.</p>

The St. Cecilia Choir, under the direction of Messrs. Seweryn and Bronislaw Kujawski, sang during the mass. The church was crowded to the limit with orderly people.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon, at about four o'clock, high vespers were celebrated and were attended by hundreds of people from distant parishes. Vespers were sung by children choirs of St. Agnes and St. Cecilia's parishes.</p>
