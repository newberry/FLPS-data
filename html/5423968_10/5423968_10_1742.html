   <p>Resolutions adopted unanimously at mass meeting of Poles held at St. Stanislaus Parish Hall, Noble and Bradley streets in Chicago, on May 12, 1912, called together with the intention of protesting against sharper restrictions proposed by the Congress of the United States in limiting the immigration laws. These resolutions in their original version are as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas the honest, industrious and sound peasant and workingman of Europe who comes to this country of his volition to improve his condition and that of his family, who seeks here the blessings of liberty for himself and his family, is a desirable acquisition to the manhood of the United States:</p>
   <p>"Whereas the record of the immigrants and their children who have come to these United States of their own free will to improve their condition <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>shows that they have been a law-abiding industrious and patriotic element of the American citizenship, which shared the burdens and duties of such citizenship, both in times of war and peace, as loyally, zealously and faithfully as the native-born citizen;</p>
   <p>"Whereas a fair investigation of conditions in this country will disclose that in these states, where there is the largest naturalized vote and in which the immigrant has been a potent factor, there are many churches, more libraries, more schools, better schools and a more general intelligence than in other communities, and the immigrants - especially the poor among them - are more frugal, are more industrious, and are more used to continuous hard work than the poor native Americans;</p>
   <p>"Whereas an educational literary or scholastic test for immigrants in no way discloses the morals, character, heart, or virtues of the immigrant, and in no way proves the desirability of such newcomers for admission into this country;</p>
   <p>"Whereas the history of all mankind proves that book-learning does not <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>make up the largest percentage of the common sense that runs the world, transacts its business, secures its progress, trebles its power over nature, wears away the world's restraints, lifts the world's burden or makes nobler men;</p>
   <p>"Therefore be it resolved by representatives of Polish-American organizations and parishes of the city of Chicago assembled in mass meeting this Sunday afternoon, May 12th at the St. Stanislaus Parochial School Hall, Noble and Bradley streets, Chicago, Illinois, that we hereby register our protests and opposition to the attempts to restrict immigration from European countries and nations and to efforts to make naturalization of immigrants after their arrival to the United States more difficult;</p>
   <p>"Resolved that the special efforts at this time to restrict immigration and make more difficult naturalization be proposed new federal laws pending in the United States Congress are hereby condemned by us as American citizens and in particular the provisions for the restriction of immigration, and for more difficult naturalization contained in and comprising the Dillingham Senate Bill and the Burnett House Bill are reprehensible to all fair-minded and just men familiar with the history of the United States and the history <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of nations and especially are they so to us who are familiar with the conditions of the immigrant and who know why the immigrant comes to this country and why he leaves the old world;</p>
   <p>"Resolved that in urging our protests and opposition we appeal to the President of the United States, to the Vice-President, to the Speaker of the House, to all United States Senators and to our Congressmen of the State of Illinois to unite in defeating the proposed Dillingham Senate and Burnett House Bills because said bills are contrary to the spirit of the age, opposed to the law of human development, and incompatible with the highest civilization which require the freest intercourse possible not only between men but between nations and the opposition to or the variance with such law has by the records of history been repeatedly proven to be unprofitable and disastrous to all people who pursued a policy contrary to this law of human development;</p>
   <p>"Resolved that statemanship which seeks to restrict immigration in accordance with the Dillingham Senate and Burnett House Bills is not American but Chinese of the type which made China a dark land before the awakening thereof;</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"Resolved further that we call attention to the lawmakers at Washington that the undesirable apostles of disorder, discord, discontent and class hatred, immorality, irreligion and lawlessness are not the peasants and industrious workingmen of Europe who because of governmental conditions in their native lands are unable to equip themselves to pass educational or illiterate tests but that such undesirables apostles and trouble breeders are when found among the immigrants such men as will be able to pass any and all educational tests;</p>
   <p>"Resolved that we further call the attention of our lawmakers at Washington to that, the immigrant who comes here to better his conditions to avoid persecution of despotic governments and to improve his family has been found and proven to be a home-loving, home-making, anti-divorce and anti-race suicide acquisition to this country's citizenship;</p>
   <p>Resolved further that we hereby point out that the further restriction of immigration and the further making difficult of naturalization under the letter and spirit of said Dillingham Senate and Burnett House Bills will <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>assist the government usurping Poland and persecuting the people of Poland in their dastardly work, will make more difficult the struggle of the Polish people to keep alive the ideals and virtues of their living nation and will be an example to the world of ingratitude to the people who gladly sacrificed their lives in the defense and for the perpetuation of the principles of freedom and free government in the United States when this country needed them and whose brethren are now denied the fruits of these sacrifices and efforts if the un-American principles and efforts are to prevail;</p>
   <p>"Resolved that we forward a copy of these resolutions to every member of Congress from Illinois to the President and Vice-President of the United States, to the United States Senators from Illinois and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives;</p>
   <p>"Resolved further that these resolutions be signed and subscribed to by the chairman and secretary of this mass meeting and by a specially appointed committee of citizens here assembled."</p>
