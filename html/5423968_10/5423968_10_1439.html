   <p>Dear youths, Polish soldiers of the Army and Navy; the entire Polish immigration today depends upon you, tear yourself away, away from the evil of laziness, the indifferent belief among us, and let us remember that not every husbandman's yield is the cause of a bad crop.</p>
   <p>Comrades in arms; the hour for activity has arrived. Your efforts and devotion will not be forgotten, you know as well as I that when working as an individual you achieve nothing, only by organizing will we gain strength of decision. Let us not remain idle, let us unite into one huge body.</p>
   <p>And so our first step is to take into possession all of the Poles who served in the American Army and Navy, and who number over 200,000. From this number of Polish soldiers we should be able to gather a very strong organization, one that will hold the deciding vote of our future.</p>

   <p>The slogan of this organization should be "One for all, and all for one." It isn't enough, comrades, that this organization oblige us morally and materially, it shall give us the stamina for demanding justice for our country, Poland, the mother of us all.</p>
   <p>Leon T. Walkowicz.</p>
