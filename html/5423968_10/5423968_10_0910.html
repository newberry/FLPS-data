   <p>(The following announcement was received from the St. Hedwig Parish Committee.)</p>
   <p>The undersigned, by the following declaration, wish to declare publicly that after all Christian efforts have been expended, and various means have been exhausted in our efforts to affect an understanding with the committee of the opposition, it has been concluded that the opposition is composed of persons of ill will, persons who deliberately plot to disrupt the harmony among the parishioners. By their conduct they bring upon the people of St. Hedwig Parish the wrath of God and the contempt of humanity. The opposing group has twisted the words of the Archbishop, and has disregarded his orders at its meetings; it plays the role of a faithful Catholic committee before the credulous people.</p>
   <p>Because this kind of activity leads directly to schism, and not to the opening of the church and school, the undersigned, in the name of the entire Parish Committee and all Roman Catholic members of St. Hedwig Parish, publicly express the severance of all connections with the opposition group in all matters pertaining to the Roman Catholic religion and activities at St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>We have every reason to fear for the salvation of our souls, for "the company you keep determines your character." The Apostle of the People stated that "the Holy Ghost has created bishops to take charge of the Church of God." But some people choose the first hobbledehoy that comes along, one who is unfamiliar with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Catechism, regard him as a prophet and permit him to blaspheme against the Holy Apostles and the power of the Roman Catholic Church!</p>
   <p>We, as Catholics, do not desire to hear of such a committee. Jesus Christ said: "He who does not heed the church (that is, the authority of the church), let him remain as a pagan and a public sinner." This committee does not heed the Archbishop; they listen to the successors of Judas, who impart to them the hypocrisies of the Pharisees.</p>
   <p>Is this a Christian committee? No! It is an everlasting humbug.</p>
   
   <p>Is it a Catholic group? Not in the least, for it opposes the orders of the Bishop.</p>
   <p>Is it Polish? It is not even this, for it disgraces Poland.</p>
   <p>Is it patriotic? It is not this, either, because it starts agitations and imparts lies.</p>
   <p>Then what kind of a committee is it? It is a committee that sows the seeds of discord! No decent person will have anything to do with it.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the undersigned, as old parishioners and members of the Parish Committee, declare that all connections pertaining to the Catholic religion and St. Hedwig Parish have been broken with the opposing group. We trust that every true Catholic will no longer permit himself to be duped, and will no longer be connected with people that aim to disrupt the unity of the St. Hedwig Parish and disregard the wishes of the Archbishop.</p>
   
   <p>We can only offer a prayer for such people. But to listen to their insidious words, which leads to schism, is to sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
   <p>With the help of God we will not permit this, and, therefore, we life our heads in prayer to Him in Heaven and say: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil......Amen."</p>
   <p>In the name of the St. Hedwig Parish Committee:</p>
   <p>A. Glowczowski, president</p>
   <p>A. Barczynski, secretary</p>
