   <p>A brief article written by a Polish priest, the Reverend J. Papon was found in the Michigan Catholic. The author was replying to a previous article concerning the Poles living in this country. In that previous article the Michigan Catholic had mentioned that there are four million Catholic Poles in the United States and that they have many dignitaries in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Reverend Papon asked with justification: "Where are these Church dignitaries of Polish nationality in this country? How many are there among these four million Poles?" The Poles have only one suffragan bishop of Polish ancestry, and he is merely an assistant to the Archbishop of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Papon further stated, with a courage seldom seen among our clergymen, that the sincerely Polish priests are treated shamefully by Church officials of other nationalities. He noted that our priests are plainly abused by the autocracy of Irish and German bishops in this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>country. It has been a long time since we have witnessed such fearless denunciation by a Polish Catholic priest. The Poles know that injustice is done to our clergy and, through them, to our entire Polish nationality. Evidently the harm done them must be of vast proportion when such bitter words issue from the lips of Polish priests. If there were more brave people demanding their rights, the Church dignitaries would be compelled to give serious consideration to the demands of the Polish Catholics. Unfortunately, our people are too generous and make no demands for things justly due them. As a result of this the Poles are scapegoats of other nationalities. The entire Polish Catholic clergy is urged to voice its opinion and demand its due. Our people will co-operate, and thus we shall attain what is rightfully ours.</p>
