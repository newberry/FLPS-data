   <p>The expected peace in St. Hedwig Parish did not come yesterday. Agitation was continued to such an extent that it was impossible to perform any services.</p>
   <p>The trouble occurred in the following manner: The Chancellor of the Archbishop of Chicago, the Most Reverend J. P. Muldoon, arrived Sunday morning with the newly appointed paster, Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, and the latter's assistant, Reverend Biella.</p>
   <p>A group from the opposition, despite promises that they wanted peace with the Archbishop, immediately objected to the newly appointed members of the parish.</p>
   <p>In view of the lack of supporters from the right wing of the parishioners, the Most Reverend Muldoon entered the church and read the decree of the Archbishop from the pulpit, announcing that as a result of the present <span class="page-break">2</span>objections on the part of the parishioners the church would remain closed.</p>
   <p>No services were held. This is unusually saddening, but inevitable. The Archbishop had consented to have the church opened on the condition that the committee of the opposition would remain orderly, as promised. When it began to appear that the promises were nothing but pretentions, when all previous negotiations went for naught as the new pastor was presented, the church was ordered closed.</p>
   <p>What have the agitators gained? When will they be able to collect themselves?</p>
   <p>The following announcement was received from the Parish Committee of St. Hedwig Parish:</p>
   <p>The undersigned invite all the parishioners of St. Hedwig Parish to attend two meetings relative to the affairs of the parish.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The first meeting will be held this evening at Kortas' Hall, 1065 North Robey Street. The second will be held tomorrow evening at the home of Stanislaus Sniegocki, 1069 North Leavitt Street. Both meetings will start at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>Every parishioner in accord with the church and the Bishop is obligated to attend these meetings. Those from the opposition desiring to come to peace terms are also invited.</p>
   <p>The parishioners are reminded that Lent and Easter Confession are approaching.</p>
   <p>A. Glowczewski, president.</p>
   <p>Anthony Barczynski, secretary.</p>
