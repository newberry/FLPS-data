   <p>The scout movement is very slowly being accepted among the Polish emigration, due to many reasons, for the discussion of which we have no space here. It is a great harm that there does not exist such a scout organization, which would draw near to every Polish school and make a scout out of every Polish boy. This is not the place to enter into a lengthy description about the scout movement, about its sentiments. Issuing from the supposition, defined by the proverb, "By the fruit you shall know them," this information is given by the periodical Rolnik (Farmer), and we, after it, tell our readers about these fruits, which come forth from the scout movement. These fruits are manifested in every scout, in every boy, who belongs to the scout organization. They are manifested in the conduct of the boy, in the increase of information, filling his young head. What else is a scout able to do? - you ask.</p>
   <p>Let us listen: A scout is able to tell where is north and where is south, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>where is east and where is west even if he found himself in a dense forest. A scout is able to tie a knot that holds well. He is able to swim across a river. He is able to pitch a tent and is able to mend his torn trousers. He is able to tell you which fruits or seeds are poisonous. He is able to distinguish nut-bearing trees from a considerable distance.</p>
   <p>He can unfurl a sail on a boat, and he can also take the place alongside the helm of a motor boat. He knows how to row and he knows how to land his boat in a certain place with an ordinary stick.</p>
   <p>In the forest he can recognize different birds by their feathers and by their sound. He walks through a forest with such certainty as though he had to be drawn back from it by somebody with a thread.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>He is quick to recognize a braggart or self-praising person, but he knows how to keep from letting him know what he thinks about him. His power he considers as the highest possession on earth. He can build a fire in the woods during a big downpour and seldom needs more than one match for this and he knows how to build a fire in the woods so that it would not start a forest fire.</p>
   <p>He understands the method of rubbing on himself pieces of wood, so that he could get from them by the method of primitive people a spark and fire.</p>
   <p>He can ignite a fire with the help of his knife and a piece of flint.</p>
   <p>A scout teaches himself self-control and will not be a coward in the presence of threatening danger, because he knows what course to take.</p>

   <p>Mothers, would you like to see your sons such daring men? Infallibly yes. But, you will say, there are no scouts among us and a boy cannot learn all of these things. It is a trifle that there are no scouts. There is yet your mother, there is your husband, the father of your children. You be the instructors and teach your sons that which the scouts learn from their instructors.</p>
   <p>From the earliest youth teach your children that which can be useful to them in life. Teach them how they should advise themselves when necessary and how they should hurry with aid to others. Impress into their memory and hearts the commandment, that they should always be useful to themselves and others and order them that in the pursuit about their own welfare not to harm their fellow creatures. So they teach the scouts, so the parents ought to teach their children, the rest will be done by the Polish National Council.</p>
