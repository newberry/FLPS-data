   <p>We were informed yesterday that the Independent Polish Catholic church in the neighborhood of the parish of St. Adelbert does not exit any more. The Catholic people did not give this church enough financial support to have it continue.</p>
   <p>During the last three weeks the priest's robes and the church ornaments and belongings were sold. Many of the families who were members of this independent church soon joined the parish of St. Adelbert, a Roman Catholic church. This greatly helped St. Adelbert parish, because of the number of children from these families who enrolled in this parish school.</p>
