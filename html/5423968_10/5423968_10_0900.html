   <p>New and important developments took place at St. Hedwig Parish during yesterday and today.</p>
   <p>By an order issued by the archbishop of Chicago, which was prompted by a petition signed by a large number of parishioners, St. Hedwig Church was opened for services yesterday.</p>
   <p>Mass was celebrated by Reverend E. Sedlaczek at 8 A. M. Many members of the parish attended. After the services, Reverend Sedlaczek took charge of the parish rectory. No disturbances occurred.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon and evening, however, trouble was started anew by the deceitful agitators. Meetings were held by them at which violent threats were voiced. A desire was also expressed to stage an attack on the rectory last <span class="page-break">2</span>night, but this did not materialize. Finally, it was decided to start an assault on the parish rectory this morning.</p>
   <p>At approximately 8 A. M. this morning a group of agitators entered the vestry just as Reverend Sedlaczek made his entrance, preparatory to the celebration of Mass. These would-be disturbers were disposed of in short order. The 8 o'clock services took place without interruption. Over four hundred persons attended.</p>
   <p>A large mob of people, mostly women and boys, gathered about the church, intent on starting some kind of commotion. The police on duty in this vicinity prevented any disturbances.</p>
   <p>No active violence occurred, and no one was hurt. The police arrested only three women and one boy, the noisiest persons in the crowd. Shortly afterwards, the crowd dispersed.</p>
