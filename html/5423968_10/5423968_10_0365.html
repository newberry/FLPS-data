   <p>A large number of Saint Hedwig parishioners attended the social given by the Holy Name Society Sunday afternoon at the Columbia Hall, 10-12 Hamburg Street. Another crowd went to see the two dramas, "Chlopow Arystokratow" (Aristocratic Peasants) and "Posag w Kominie" (Dowry in the Chimney), staged by the Saint Hedwig Dramatical Circle last night at the parish hall. Both events proved to be successes from the entertainment standpoint. Those who did not attend found pleasure in pleasant conversation out of doors and enjoyed the warmth of a beautiful summer night.</p>
   <p>While the parishioners from Saint Hedwig Church were enjoying themselves, the Independents (A parish independent of the Pope was organized in this section of the city) walked about downcast, wondering how they would get their temple out of debt. Others were concerned about the state of things when their "bishop" goes out into the world. Still others worried about <span class="page-break">\2</span>what is going to happen when their new pastor, Zalewicz, takes over his duties.</p>
