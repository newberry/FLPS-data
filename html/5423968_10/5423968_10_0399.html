   <p>The St. Paul Uhlan Knights of Bridgeport have sent the following announcement to the Dziennik Chicagoski for publication:</p>
   <p>To the "Independents" [a faction which has renounced the Pope and set up its own church] of the St. Adalbert Parish community:</p>
   <p>The committee of the Independent Church has sent us a letter with a plea that we support its church, which is in dire financial straits.</p>
   <p>Dear brothers! We have lamented a great deal over the fact that you have fallen from the Roman Catholic Church, but we were unheard. How, then, do you dare to make a plea to us for help? We are in no position to offer you assistance. As Roman Catholics we support the principles of the Roman Catholic Church; consequently we can only give the following advice: We appeal to you to regain the road of righteousness, away from all schism, and return to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the fold of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Befuddled brothers! You write to us that in the event we seek your aid you will be only too glad to give it. We reject your offer of help and we will not give you any. We condemn your behavior, and we will treat you as traitors to this faith and the fatherland--our Poland.</p>
   <p>Administration of the St. Paul Uhlan Knights</p>
