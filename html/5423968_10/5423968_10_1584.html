   <p>The gymnastic education society entitled "Polish-American Falcons" was organized with the intention of affording to the Polish youth an opportunity to educate themselves mentally and develop physically.</p>
   <p>It is well known, dear fellow men, that the above mentioned society has now and will have the following aims:</p>
   <p>First, to lend a helping hand whenever needed and to live in peace amongst ourselves like brothers. To join with other organizations, like the Polish National Alliance, and by it help to build a Polish hall here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Second, to produce Polish theatricals, recitals, concerts, etc., as by this alone we shall obstruct the path to evil into which our youth might fall. So for this reason I make a plea to our friends, especially to the Polish youth, to join our Polish-American Falcons' organization, and by working together we will show other nationalities that our Polish mother doesn't <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>need to be ashamed of her children.</p>
   <p>So come young and old to our meetings that take place every first Sunday of the month at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in the hall of Mr. Nalepinski, at Noble and Chopin street.</p>
   <p>As to the question of building a Polish hall, it could be accomplished in a short while.</p>
