   <p>The St. Mary of Perpetual Help Church was consecrated yesterday amidst solemn rites. Twenty-six Catholic societies led by an orchestra, took part in the ceremonies. Main, Lurel, 31st and 32nd streets were so crowded it was almost impossible to pass. The people of the neighborhood, mostly Poles, jammed the streets and sidewalks.</p>
   <p>The ceremonies began at three o'clock in the afternoon, when the societies from Town of Lake and 17th Street made their appearance, each led by a mounted marshal in colorful uniform and represented by a band. As these bands passed by, one by one, it seemed as if they were trying to outdo one another.</p>
   <p>After reaching 32nd and Laurel Streets, the societies entered the portals of the new church. When the last group had entered, Father Dowling, general chaplain, and his assistants, Fathers John Radziejewski, Hayer, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Barzynski, and Raszkiewicz, came out from the rectory to perform the blessing of the church.</p>
   <p>Solemn vespers, under Father Dowling, began at 4 P. M. Father Radziejewski acted as deacon and Father Hayer as sub-deacon. A sermon was given by Father Urban Raszkiewicz.</p>
   <p>Father Raszkiewicz talked about the sacrifices mentioned in the Old and New Testaments. He emphasized the importance of observing Holy Mass on Sunday and compared the offerings made by the people to the church during biblical days with those of the present day. Contributions, attendance, and prayers play an important part in the Church of God. The giving of a few cents will not make anyone poor. Any donations in support of the church will bring to the donor blessings from heaven. In conclusion, Father Raszkiewicz urged all the Poles to unite and become a harmonious whole. The fact that one came from a province and the other from another, should be forgotten. After all, all are brothers and sisters of one mother, the Blessed Virgin.</p>

   <p>After the sermon, solemn blessing ceremonials began.</p>
   <p>The structure and interior decoration of the church are of unusual beauty. The edifice is patterned after the Roman and Byzantine styles of architecture. Although the portals are impressive, the spacious height of the interior of the church is even more so. The large tall pillars, the beautiful arches, the stained-glass windows, and the tall central dome are bewitching to the eye.</p>
   <p>The completion of the murals will make St. Mary of Perpetual Help Church one of the most impressive churches in Chicago. Thus far it has cost $100,000. One of the many important features of the church is the acoustics, thanks to which very little effort is required by the speaker to make himself heard.</p>
   <p>Reverend Stanislaus Nawrocki is pastor.</p>
