   <p>A great number of people assembled last night in the school hall on Bradley Street to participate in the grand reception arranged by the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish in honor of Paul Smolikowski, the Most Reverend General of the Congregation of Resurrectionist Fathers. It was also a farewell to the honored guest, who is leaving Chicago tonight.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by Reverend Simon Kobrzynski and Reverend Vincent Barzynski, the Reverend General occupied the seat of honor. One orchestra played on the stage, which was beautifully decorated. Many Polish priests and laymen from other parishes were present at the reception.</p>
   <p>The program was very interesting, consisting of speeches, singing, and drills by the turners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Beginning with the Polish saying, "Guest in the home, God in the home," Reverend Barzynski greeted the honored guest with words flowing from the heart and went on to describe the task undertaken by this mission, the troubles conquered, and the work accomplished. "The purpose of all these efforts is to save our faith and nationality," he said. "We have not failed in our duty. The majority of us have not lost our religion and stand steadfastly by its banner." He asked the Reverend General to place at the feet of the Holy Father, the Pope, in the Capital of Saint Peter, Rome, our obeyances and our prayers, so that he would remember us personally and take care of us. He expressed the sorrow felt by all that the General must leave us so soon. "You just arrived and you are already leaving! So we greet you and bid you farewell at the same time, filled with respect and love for you. Remember us and pray for us!"</p>
   <p>This beautiful speech touched all deeply and was greeted with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa was the next to speak in the name of the parish. "We are plain people", he said, "workers, but sincere, and we welcome you." He then <span class="page-break">\3</span>pointed out the trials and troubles besetting the Resurrectionist Fathers, in establishing, where thirty years before was but a swamp, what exists here today, an edifice of God, a school, and other fine buildings, so that the people could gather to praise God and discuss their problems. Kiolbassa begged that he bless this difficult work.</p>
   <p>Additionally, Mr. J. Tomaszewski spoke for the thirty-six parish societies and Szezesny Zahajkiewicz for the parish teachers. Both speeches were eloquent and sincere. Zahajkiewicz described the full scope of the work undertaken in Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, called the General, the commander of this army, proceeding onward--with the sign of the cross and the banner on which is visible the white eagle--toward continuous improvement.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Jozwiakowski, speaking in the name of the parish choirs, expressed their hearty feelings of welcome.</p>
   <p>The last speech, in the name of the Poles of Chicago, was delivered by P. Ligman, <span class="page-break">\4</span>who spoke at length on the economic situation of the immigrants here in America, pointed to their growth and successful improvement, and finally touched on the unfortunate affairs of these last few months, caused by the separation and schism of certain parishioners. He expressed the hope that this dark cloud will soon be dissipated.</p>
   <p>That was the tenor of the speeches</p>
   <p>On this lavish reception program Nowicki's orchestra played two selections, one of them Kontski's "Awakening Of The Lion." A women's, men's, and young women's choir, directed by Andrew J. Kwasigroch, the parish organist, sang beautiful melodies. The soloists were Miss W. Barwig-Miss Kosinska, Mrs. Barwig- Mrs. Jozwiakowska, Mr. Kondziorski, Mr. Dombek, and Mr. Barwig.</p>
   <p>A drill by the parish Turners ended the program.</p>
   <p>The Most Reverend Father General listened to the various numbers on the <span class="page-break">\5</span>the program with evident satisfaction, and at the end requested Reverend J. Kasprzycki to read, for him a letter he had written to thank the Poles of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We print this letter of thanks in its entirety.</p>
   <p>"I wish to extend my sincere thanks to Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish and all societies for the kindness they have shown me.</p>
   <p>"I realize that you wish to express your gratitude for the labors of our Congregation and to show me, a new arrival from Europe, what the Poles in America are like.</p>
   <p>"I am very grateful for the first and overjoyed [at the last].</p>
   <p>"We, clergymen do not labor for the sake of acclaim, but we are only human, and this reception gives us the ambition and strength to continue in our work with <span class="page-break">\6</span>new vim and vigor. It is pleasant to see that our Reverend Fathers, and especially Reverend Vincent Barzynski, have accomplished a lot here.</p>
   <p>"And I was thrilled by the love you have shown for Reverend Barzynski.</p>
   <p>"So, in order to reward his faithful service, and to make you happy, I have made him the Superior of the Congregation of the Resurrectionist Fathers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"That you also desire certain recognition in the old country is proper.</p>
   <p>"It proves how closely you wish to be joined with the Poles in Europe. I know you want my opinion, because I have often been asked: What do I think of the Poles in Chicago, in America?</p>
   <p>"We, in Europe, think of the Poles here as follows: What we hear about the Poles' actions, we consider as play, and some sort of 'American humbug', but we <span class="page-break">\7</span>do feel bad about the disturbances and schisms which appear all too often.</p>
   <p>"Our enemies take advantage of the unfortunate affairs which have been happening lately. 'You see,' they say, 'what this religion, this Catholicism for which the Polish people are praised, really is!' The Poles scorn schisms, because schism is Russian. They are loyal to the Pope and their bishops, because they are their protection against Russianism, but when they cannot make use of Catholicism for their own purposes, then they formulate their own schisms.</p>
   <p>"And what are these Independent churches if not an offshoot of the Russian religion? The same faith as in the Catholic Church, the same services--save that they want independence from the Pope's authority and the bishops loyal to him. That is all a schism amounts to.</p>
   <p>"I am happy that, by coming here, I have been able to convince myself how falsely the people in Europe judge the Poles in America, and happy also, that I can tell it to you.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>"It is sufficient to have seen for myself, to become convinced that the work you are doing here is no 'humbug' or play, but most important work, patriotic, and religious. This faithfulness, as I see it here, has always been lacking in our European brethren, but we are learning it from you. American, perhaps but that is a minor matter and, of course, we are grateful for it. But we are learning to stick to the job.</p>
   <p>"But not only steadfastness. We are learning how to work together. The many societies here are proof of this. This is another very important gain for us, because in the past our big drawback was failure to co-operate. Every Pole is ready for sacrifices, ready to give all he has for his fatherland, even his own life, to save it; but he feels that he alone should save his country, and when others appear to help, he will not continue, will not co-operate with them; in fact, he will interfere with them because he himself wants the honor of saving it, and nobody else.</p>
   <p>"That is the reason of all our defeats and why we could never build anything <span class="page-break">\9</span>worthwhile.</p>
   <p>"But much has been done here already to rid ourselves of this evil. This cooperation is not merely a theory any more.</p>
   <p>"And what shall I say about schisms and the Independent churches?</p>
   <p>"It is, indeed, a sad situation. But the evil is not so terrifying, when there is an effort to overcome it, and that there is an intelligent effort--the projected Polish Catholic Congress in America--is the greatest proof of it.</p>
   <p>"We here in this free country, not being shackled, must pass a certain temporary phase of existence. A person born in subjection, suddenly given his freedom, unlimited freedom, cannot help but lose some of his equanimity.</p>
   <p>"I hope that these schisms, although painful, will serve to strengthen our Catholic faith.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>"Catholicism, which is more a matter of feeling with us, will, through these difficulties, become a matter of self-knowledge. It will strengthen itself.</p>
   <p>"On concluding my remarks, I wish to again extend my sincere thanks for everything you have done for me, for yesterday's theatrical performance, the childrens recital, and today's reception.</p>
   <p>"I wish to thank all the societies, the parochial choir, and the Dramatic Circle.</p>
   <p>"Allow me also to thank the good Sisters of Notre Dame for their effective services to the parish. I had the opportunity to see not only here, but also in Canada, how faithful they are in their work, and how quiet and gentle they are. I noticed especially how particular they are about the Polish language. In Berlin, Canada, there is a group of Polish people, and the Polish children are naturally being lost to us among the great mass of German children in the school. The Sister Superior of this school, therefore, arranged to have a Polish nun to teach these Polish children our language. I wish to offer them my <span class="page-break">\11</span>congratulations and my deepest thanks.</p>
   <p>"Let me close with God bless you for everything!"</p>
   <p>So ended the beautiful reception. The Reverend Father General, on leaving the hall, was given a sincere, hearty farewell.</p>
