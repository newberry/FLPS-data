   <p>The parliament of the Polish Unions in America is in session at the St. Adelbert's parish hall, from which we will receive an accurate report.</p>
   <p>Homes in the neighborhood of St. Adelbert's are beautifully decorated. At 8:30 in the morning, societies from the Parish of St. Casimir (two lady's and two men's groups), with a delegation, marched to the parish of St. Adelbert, where the divine services took place. At the wishes of His Excellency, Bishop Rhode could not take part in the street parades because of important matters coming at the last moment, detaining him.</p>
   <p>Bishop Rhode arrived about 10 o'clock in Mr. Kwiarkowski's car, accompanied by Rev. Fathers Wojtalewicz, John Lange and A. Szpotanski; at 10:30 the Episcopal divine services began. Honorary deacons were Rev. Father Wojtalewicz and Rev. Father Szpotanski; assisting Bishop Rhode at the divine mass were Rev. Father Felix Feldsheim and Rev. Father Zachola; in charge of this ceremony were Rev. Father Lange, Rev. Father Ostrowski, and Rev. Father Truszynski.</p>

   <p>Before the delegates and priests entered the church the mandate committee was chosen.</p>
