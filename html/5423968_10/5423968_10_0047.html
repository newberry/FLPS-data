   <p>Father Jan Obyrtacz celebrated the silver jubilee of his priesthood on the 8th day of December, 1920. Indeed, it was a great celebration in Saint Stanislaus parish, which will be remembered for a long time, not only in his parish but throughout Chicago and other cities.</p>
   <p>Father Obyrtacz, who tried to avoid publicity, became the center of it. It seems that all Polish communities located in Chicago and nearby localities were greatly interested in it.</p>
   <p>The celebration took place at Saint Stanislaus Kostkas church in Chicago. The High Mass was celebrated by Father Obyrtacz himself, who was assisted by Rev. W. Zapala, general of the Resurrection; Rev. S. Siatki, and Rev. Jan Swierzchowski. Rev. Jan Sobieszczyk was the master of ceremonies. The Rt. Rev. Bishop P. P. Rhode preached a very beautiful sermon, commenting on the good work of the feted one, and wishing him long life, good health, happiness and the Lord's blessing for future work.</p>
   
   <p>After the church services there was a banquet in the parish hall for the clergy. About 100 priests participated in this celebration. In the evening of the same day there was a great public banquet given in honor of the priest by the local clubs. The hall was packed. So many guests came to the banquet that there was no accommodation for some of them; they were turned back. There were many Polish notables at the banquet. Mr. Jan Smulski rendered a wonderful speech, praising Father Obyrtacz. The most important speech was rendered by Rev. W. Zapala, Father Bubacz's school colleague. Father Obyrtacz received many beautiful gifts. The jubilee was a great success.</p>
