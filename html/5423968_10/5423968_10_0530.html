   <p>As is known to our readers, about two weeks ago an invitation was published in various papers, and also was mailed to members of the Polish clergy and to some outstanding laymen, to meet in a preliminary conference at the Polish Seminary, in Detroit, Michigan, for the purpose of deciding on the date, the place, and the program of the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>The invitation was signed by Reverend J. Pitass, Reverend P. Gutowski, Reverend Frank Mueller, and Reverend J. Dabrowski.</p>
   <p>In response to this invitation the following clergymen and laymen met yesterday, at 2 P.M., at the Polish Seminary in Detroit, Michigan:</p>
   <p>From Detroit, Michigan: Reverends P. Gutowski, J. Dabrowski, Frank Mueller, <span class="page-break">2</span>D. Zmijewski, John Mueller, Zgudzius, Buchaczkowski, and Kisielewicz, and Messrs. Joseph Kromke, Louis Szymanski, Valentine Budnik, John Dalman, Frank Jaworski, Michael Lesman, and Ignatius Wolf.</p>
   <p>From Chicago, Illinois: Reverends Eugene Sedlaczek, John Kasprycki, and Adolf Nowicki, and Messrs. Clemens Bielinski, Albert Jendrzejek, Paul Giersz, Peter Kiolbassa and Stanislaus Szwajkart.</p>
   <p>From Buffalo, New York: Reverends Deacon J. Pitass, Flaczek, and Swiniarski. and Mr. Jacob Rozan.</p>
   <p>From Toledo, Ohio: Reverend Simon Wieczorek and Felix Matulewski.</p>
   <p>From Cleveland, Ohio: Reverends Rosinski and Cwiakala.</p>
   <p>From Berea, Ohio: Reverend Suplicki.</p>
   <p>From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Reverend Tarnowski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>From Pittsburg, Pennsylvania: Reverend Rydlewski.</p>
   <p>From Port Austin, Michigan: Reverend F. Gzelba.</p>
   <p>It is worthy of mention here, that Reverend Tarnowski announced that he also represented many priests of New York, New Jersey, and parts of Pennsylvania, whom he had met at various parishes during forty-hour devotions and other church celebrations, and who had requested him to act in their behalf.</p>
   <p>The Congress will be held.</p>
   <p>The conference was called to order by Reverend Gutowski, who explained the purpose of the meeting and requested those present to select a chairman; he himself proposed Reverend Swiniarski of Buffalo for this office. Those present unanimously endorsed his proposal and Reverend Swiniarski took over the position of chairman. Mr. Stanislaus Szwajkart was selected as secretary.</p>
   <p>The first question brought up for discussion was whether a Polish Catholic <span class="page-break">4</span>Congress should be called.</p>
   <p>There was some doubt expressed as to whether those assembled could decide such a question, because not all the Polish parishes or even all the states were yet represented.</p>
   <p>After a brief debate the assemblage decided that the time had come to take action. The papers had published a great number of letters from priests and laymen, who had proclaimed that they favored the calling of a Polish Catholic Congress and who gave their reasons for it; many of them could not come to Detroit for this conference because it was being held on a day of devotion and also because of the lenten season. Since it was impossible to delay further if the Congress was to be held this year, it was decided to settle the question at this conference and to elect a committee to take care of the details of arranging the Congress.</p>
   <p>Then it was decided, practically without debate, that the Congress shall be held in Buffalo, New York.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>After a short debate it was decided that a committee, consisting of twenty-one persons, eleven priests and ten laymen, should be selected, and that some not present at this conference, but who had publicly expressed their endorsement of the Congress in various periodicals, might also be selected for this committee.</p>
   <p>This committee was also to have the power to fill vacancies if some of those absent should refuse or could not accept the mandate.</p>
   <p>The Committee was then selected; the following priests were named on it: Reverends Deacon J. Pitass, Eugene Sedlaczek, Tarnowski, Gutowski, Barabasz (from Baltimore), Rosinski, Grembowski (from Polonia, Wisconsin), Gramlewicz (from Naticoke, Pennsylvania), Kwiatkowski (from Jersey City, New Jersey), Stanowski (from St. Louis, Missouri), and I. Tarasiewicz (from Milwaukee, Wisconsin).</p>
   <p>The following laymen were elected to the committee: Messrs. Stanislaus Slisz (from Buffalo, New York), Clemens J. Belinski and Peter Kiolbassa (of Chicago, <span class="page-break">6</span>Illinois), Martin Grzadzicki (of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania), W. C. Korpal (of South Bend, Indiana), Valentine Budnik (of Detroit, Michigan), Joseph Gomulski (of Toledo, Ohio), Joseph Slomkowski (of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), Michael Zagorski (of St. Paul, Minnesota), and Aloyisius Nagorski (of Erie, Pennsylvania).</p>
   <p>During these elections, telegrams expressing wishes for success of the conference were received from Reverend Barabasz, Reverend Ignasiak, and Reverend Alexander Lipinski.</p>
   <p>Next followed consideration of what suggestions to give to the committee just elected.</p>
   <p>It was first decided to recommend that, after having chosen the date of the Congress, they issue an appropriate proclamation, and then, that the committee be divided into subcommittees, whose duties it would be to prepare the various subjects to be discussed at the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In order to give the committee certain instructions, various questions that would be proper to consider were discussed. Plenty of material was furnished by the motions submitted by many priests and published by the Polak Wameryce (Pole In America). Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek submitted a brief of these proposals and suggested that the arrangements committee be divided into seven subcommittees to embrace all these subjects.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy discussion, however, it was decided to advise the committee to form only three subcommittees:</p>
   <p>1. A committee on church affairs, which shall prepare briefs to be discussed on (a) the question of organizing the Polish clergy, (b) the question of the independent churches, (c) the question of a spiritual seminary, (d) the question of considering the activities of the Polish National Alliance, and other appropriate questions.</p>
   <p>2. A committee on labor relations, which shall prepare briefs to be discussed on: (a) the question of a general Polish Catholic organization, <span class="page-break">8</span>(b) the question of organizing a labor association, (c) the question of the Polish Immigration House, and other proposals.</p>
   <p>3. A committee on schools and education, which shall prepare briefs for discussion on: (a) the question of establishing a teachers' seminary, (b) the question of the Polish press, (c) the question of standardizing studies in the parochial schools, (d) the question of an organization for teachers and organists.</p>
   <p>In addition it was decided, on the advice of Reverend Adolf Nowicki, that after having prepared the program for discussion, the committee should ask for the approval of the bishop of the diocese in which the Polish Catholic Congress is to take place, and also ask for the approval of the apostolic delegate.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to suggest to the Committee not only to publish an invitation to the Congress in the Polish press, but also to mail individual invitations to all priests and to all church societies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>It was further decided to advise the committee to invite prominent priests and laymen from Europe to the Congress, and when Reverend Pitass announced that he personally would be willing to cover their expenses from his own funds, those assembled received the announcement with a rising vote of thanks.</p>
   <p>Finally a very lively debate ensued over the question of whether members of the Polish National Alliance should be received as delegates to the Polish Catholic Congress, and after a long discussion it was decided decisively that no members of the Polish National Alliance would be received as delegates.</p>
   <p>A temporary chairman was then elected, as was also a temporary secretary of the arrangements committee, whose duty will be to call the committee together in order to elect permanent officers. The Reverend Deacon J. Pitass was selected as temporary chairman and Mr. Joseph Slisz as temporary secretary.</p>
   <p>This concluded the discussions at this conference. The chairman spoke of the <span class="page-break">10</span>importance of this first step made by the delegates in preparation for the Polish Catholic Congress, and the assembled delegates arose from their seats and voiced their thanks for his effective handling of his duties. The conference then ended with a prayer.</p>
   <p>The above report is not official; the secretary was authorized to send a copy of the official minutes of the conference to Reverend Swiniarski for his approval and signature, and several days must elapse before this can be done.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow we will publish further details of the conference in Detroit.</p>
