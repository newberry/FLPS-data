   <p>Walk through the streets of Chicago in the Polish neighborhoods today and you will see in almost every window one, two, or even three stars sewn on to a bit of cotton or silk of national colors. This means that, from the house where the stars appear, one, two, or three brave young men have gone to the battlefields in France to give the Germans a whipping, to win freedom for the oppressed nations of the world, to crush the autocracy and militarism which the arrogant and base Germans represent, and to perpetuate democracy.</p>
   <p>Just walking down one short street, Marshfield Avenue, from Division Street to Chicago Avenue, we found about sixty such stars in the windows--proof that that many young men have entered the army, that here are families which have given their best, their dearest sons, brothers, or fathers to a holy cause--the freedom of humanity from the chains of slavery--smashing forever, at the same time, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>hydra head of German militarism and autocracy.</p>
   <p>We saw these stars mostly in the windows of Polish homes. These Poles have given their blood, their positions, their whole future to the service of this country, which accepted us hospitably and which has said through the lips of President Wilson that Poland must be united, free, and self-governing. It is worth giving one's blood and property, in the face of so sincere a promise for Polands' future. Stars in these Polish homes are our pride and bring us great honor.</p>
   <p>We bow our heads to these stars, as we pass them, as before the holiest of things. From these homes young men have gone to fight for our freedom and their own--to free the world from tyranny and oppression. To us they are saints, and we pay homage to the mothers who raised such sons.</p>
   <p>Some joined the American Army earlier, other enlisted in the Polish Army, but the one and the other are fighting, and will continue to fight, for the same <span class="page-break">\3</span>principle, for the same sacred cause. A Polish soldier in the American Army is fighting just as much for the unity and future of Poland as the soldier in the Polish Army is fighting for the unity and greater future of the United States, although one fights under the Stars and Stripes and the other under the White Eagle.</p>
   <p>Mutual aims and aspirations tie us to America, and our victory and glory must be mutual also. Our blood spilled on the fields of battle in this war will not flow in vain, for of it shall bloom the beautiful flower of freedom and equal rights for the whole world. Let us not weep, then, over those who fall, for they will go down in history as the greatest of heroes. Over their graves.... the spirits of Kosciuszko and Pulaski will hover, blessing them that they have followed in their footsteps and earned laurel wreaths for their brows.</p>
   <p>The Poles in America have given their sons to the Polish and American Armies; they will give more when the necessity arises. They give willingly of their hard-earned money, but this is as nothing compared to the sacredness of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>cause. There should be as many of these stars as possible in Polish homes, for they shine as an example, to us and to posterity, of how we can fight for Poland and for the freedom of humanity. And the more gold stars that shine, the greater the glory and honor to us.</p>
   <p>To you, mothers and fathers of Polish blood who have stars displayed in your windows, glory and honor eternally, for you have fulfilled the holiest of your duties to Poland and to the country in which you are now living. Your dearest ones are fulfilling your destiny on the field of honor; their names and your names will be recorded in golden letters by history.</p>
