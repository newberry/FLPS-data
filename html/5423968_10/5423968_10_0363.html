   <p>Through the efforts of all the Polish societies of Holy Trinity parish a picnic was held yesterday at Pregler's Grove. A large crowd turned out for the occasion. The perfect summer weather made it possible for every one to have a glorious time. The proceeds were contributed to the support of the church.</p>
