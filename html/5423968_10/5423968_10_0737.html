   <p>The principal speakers of the evening were: Mr. Glowczewski, president of the St. Hedwig Society; Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, guest from St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish; Clement Belinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; and C. Armknecht, local parishioner.</p>
   <p>The annual celebration of the founding of St. Hedwig Parish, held last night, surpassed all anticipations. A half hour before the opening of the program all seats in the parish hall were occupied. Not only was the hall filled to capacity at 7:30 P. M., but crowds of people were standing in the hallway, around the entrance and on the sidewalk. Hundreds had to be turned away.</p>
   <p>The themes of all the speeches were the duty of all righteous Poles and Catholics, the relation of the parishioner to St. Hedwig Church, and the recognition of St. Hedwig Society for its zealous work for the parish. All <span class="page-break">2</span>speeches were well received, especially that of Mr. Belinski.</p>
   <p>Songs, declamations, and piano playing added variety to the celebration. The school children's choir and the parish choir delighted the audience with their songs.</p>
   <p>Miss Martha Szczepanska and Miss Lucia Baczkowska, who played the piano like professionals, were rewarded with bouquets. J. Sobieszczyk, a student of St. Stanislaus Kostka school, gave a beautiful recital of the poem "Hedwig". The St. Hedwig Parish school children, dressed in native costumes, enchanted the audience with their singing of national airs. The parish choir surpassed its usual capable performance, and was compelled to repeat a few numbers by request.</p>
   <p>Moved by the occasion, the pastor, Reverend John Piechowski, expressed heartfelt thanks to all for their enthusiastic support. He concluded by saving that harmony builds and discord ruins. The audience was greatly stirred by his words.</p>

   <p>The affair was concluded by the singing of "God Save Poland".</p>
   <p>Last night's event plainly indicates that one spirit and one thought lives in the heart of the pastor and the hearts of the parishioners, who are faithful to the fatherland and to our religion.</p>
