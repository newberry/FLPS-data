   <p>The tradition has been well-founded that a Pole, John of Kolno (a town of Moravia) in the services of King Christian of Denmark, commanded a fleet which reached the coast of Labrador in 1476. The well-known Zabriskie family of New York is descended from Albert Zborowski, who not later than 1662 settled on the Hackensack River, New Jersey. His signature is found affixed as interpreter to an Indian contract of purchase in 1679. One descendant, Abraham O. Zabriskie, was the eminent Chancellor of New Jersey. Other descendants intermarried with the most prominent colonial families and were soon merged in the general population. In 1659 the Dutch on Manhattan Island hired a Polish school-master. In 1770 Jacob Sadowski settled in New York, and his sons were among the first white men to penetrate as far as Kentucky. It is said that Sandusky, Ohio was named after him. Previous to this there were Polish settlers in Virginia and the Southern States.</p>
   <p>Among the European champions of American Independence few, if any, were more prominent than the noble Polish patriots, Thaddeus Kosiuszko and Count Casimir Pulaski, the brilliant cavalry officer. Several of the aids of Pulaski's famous Legion were Polish noblemen.</p>
   <p>The Polish Revolution of 1830 brought to the United States a considerable and abiding <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>contingent of Poles, mostly soldiers and members of the lower nobility. Part of Napoleon's Polish Legion had been dispatched to San Domingo, whence such as did not perish miserably or return to Europe came to the United States. A considerable number of Poles were in the American armies, fighting the Seminole Indians in the South. Among Americans of that time enthusiasm in Poland's cause ran high, and the tourists who visit the Polish National Museum at Rappersvil, Switzerland, can see many tokens of sympathy sent to the struggling Poles by their American Admirers.</p>
   <p>In 1835 there existed a "Polish National Committee in the United States", whose members were prominent Americans, and whose president, as we learn from a pamphlet printed in Philadelphia, September 30, 1835, was M. Carey. The number of Poles in the United States must have run up to thousands, if we may judge from the frequent allusions to the various groups in the American Press of the time. American sympathy took concrete form when Congress made a grant of thirty-six sections of land to the Poles and surveyed two townships for them near Rock River, Illinois.</p>
   <p>A number of veterans of the Revolution of 1830 organized the "Stowarzyszenie Polakow w Americe" (Association of Poles in America) in New York. Am appeal dated New York, 20 March, 1842, calls upon all Poles in America to affiliate with an organization <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>recently effected at the home of the Rev. Louis Jezykowicz, 235 Division St., New York. "To die for Poland" was the watchword of the organization which, according to a brochure printed in Paris, elaborately commemorated the Revolution of 1830, at the Stuyvesant Institute, New York. Poles from Boston, Baltimore, Utica, Philadelphia and Niagara were present at the celebration, and many distinguished Americans and foreigners, as well as various Scandinavian, French and German societies participated.</p>
   <p>In 1852 probably the second Polish organization in the United States was founded, "Towarzystwo Demokratyczne Wynincow Polskich w Ameryce" (Democratic Society of Poles in America) an ardent anti-slavery organization. In 1854, it numbered over two hundred members, but there are no records of its activities later than 1858. The Poles coming throughout this period of political immigration were persons of culture, and were freely admitted into American Society, which looked upon them as martyrs for liberty. Father Gaspar Matoga, who came to the United States in 1848, and completed his studies at Fordham, was the first Polish priest to be ordained in the United States.</p>
