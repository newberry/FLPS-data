   <p>We have been reliably informed that Nowe Zycie (New Life), the local "A. P. A.-istic" and anarchistic paper, has sent a communication to various groups of the Polish Alliance asking them for financial assistance....due to hard times and imminent failure. This is a fact. One of these begging letters has been shown to us. No comments necessary! [Translator's note: A. P. A. stands for American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic organization.]</p>
