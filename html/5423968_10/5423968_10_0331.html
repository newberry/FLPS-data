   <p>Buffalo N. Y. - Since the founding of the first Independent Catholic Church, Polish people will always be looked upon as corruptive people in regard to religion; American papers are always criticizing and writing scandalous stories about the Polish people in this respect.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, Rev. Father Kaminski was ordained a bishop of the Independent Catholic Churches. This caused much confusion and talk; and caused a split in this church organization. Some people backed up Rev. Bishop Koztowski of Chicago as their bishop working under the rule of the Independent "Pope Karwowski;" the rest of the people supported by Bishop Karminski as their leader.</p>
   <p>The followers of Bishop Karwowski began the construction of a church of their own on Playter Street, near Broadway, in Chicago. On the eve of consecration of the church a group of Bishop Kaminski's followers attacked the people awaiting the arrival of Bishop Karwowski. A great battle followed in which women and children took part.</p>

   <p>Many policemen were called to subdue the attackers, but not without the use of their clubs. All the windows were smashed, even the main doors of the church were broken down.</p>
   <p>The consecration of the church was postponed until Wednesday, by which time the damage done to the church can be replaced and repaired.</p>
   <p>It is claimed that Father Joseph Bohdan, who was thrown out of the Catholic church took over the reign of an Independent Catholic church in Philadelphia after Father Klawitra left.</p>
   <p>Rev. Bohdan is also the editor of "United" a weekly newspaper. This newspaper is the sole originator of the Polish league of socities, supported and kept up by Catholic organizations. Chaplain of this Polish league is Rev. Father Kwiatkowski of Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>
   <p>We cannot understand how it happened that an Independent Catholic priest can be an editor of a Roman-Catholic newspaper supported by true Catholics.</p>
   <p>Why doesn't the Chaplain look into this matter? If it can be proven that the Independent Catholic priest is still the editor of a Roman-Catholic newspaper it will ruin the character and social standing of all Roman Catholic churches and orgizations in this country.</p>
