   <p>The marked decrease in immigration as a result of the World War does not cease to interest and worry the American newspapers. Not so long ago, the Chicago American in an editorial again pointed to the fact that in the second half of last year (1914) only 204,884 immigrants entered the United States as compared with 734,869 in the second half of the year 1913. Setting aside his former prejudices toward immigration, the author of the editorial frankly declares that without arrivals from Europe this country will be unable to develop as it has done and cannot exist in the future. In his opinion it may be presumed that for the next fifteen years Europe itself will need its people. Moreover, even after these fifteen years it will be difficult to increase the immigration into America if we continue to pass such nonsensical bills in Congress as the last one, in which an intelligence test was made one of the principal requirements for entry into America.</p>
