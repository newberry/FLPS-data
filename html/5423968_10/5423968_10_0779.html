   <p>After an agreement between the two parish committees of St. John Cantius Parish and the pastor, it was decided to hold a fair for the benefit of the parish on July 27. A committee was appointed to operate the fair and on the designated day it was opened to the public. The fair continued until September 1--twenty-seven days in all.</p>
   <p>With the exception of Wednesdays and Fridays the fair was opened each night and on Sundays at 4 P.M. Everyone who attended the fair must admit that it was a well-planned affair.</p>
   <p>Not only our own parishioners took part in this fair but also many good-spirited persons from St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, St. Hedwig Parish, Holy Trinity Parish, and many other people of different nationalities. Their support and attendance enhanced the spirit of the fair.</p>
