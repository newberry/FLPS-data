   <p>As previously announced in the Polish press, a mass meeting of Polish veterans of the American army will take place in Central Park Hall, 3600 Wolfram Street, Sunday, February 12, 1922, at 2:30 P.M. All veterans in the Avondale district are asked to come because questions of interest to veterans will be discussed.</p>
   <p>This recently organized post of Polish veterans in America will choose and adopt a name for itself at this meeting. Applications for the State of Illinois bonus will also be distributed and filled out for each member of the post. Every veteran is asked to bring his army discharge papers, since they are essential in filling out bonus applications.</p>
   <p>Veterans, wake up! Our organization is your organization; every Pole should be a member of the Alliance of Polish Veterans in America. It is the first Polish organization of its kind and the best organization for self-respecting veterans. Come one, come all!</p>
