   <p>Yesterday afternoon there was a big parade from the recruiting station at the corner of Augusta Street and Milwaukee Avenue, where only Poles enlist in Uncle Sam's army. The occasion for the parade was the departure of about two hundred young Polish recruits who were to entrain that evening for Jefferson Camp, near St. Louis.</p>
   <p>The parade was led by mounted police. Next came the flag followed by the drum and bugle corps of our scouts playing military marches.</p>
   <p>These were followed by about sixty little boy scouts and girl scouts carrying a tremendous American flag fastened to ropes, in a horizontal position, into which people threw money from windows to the little fellows for the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>Following the flag, the most prominent Polish men marched to see the soldiers <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>off. Among these were: Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance; Peter Rostenkowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Mr. Gizinski, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance for the State of Oregon; S. Orpiszewski, editor of the Alliance publications; Mr. Konopa, secretary general of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Mr. Skibinski, editor of Free Poland; Mrs. Mary Sakowski, director of the Polish National Alliance; Miss Augustynowicz, an employee in the Alliance offices; Mr. J. Andrzejewski, Mr. Joseph Szymanski, Mr. S. Bieganowski, and many others whose names we were unable to gather.</p>
   <p>These were followed by little scouts with little guns, and after them marched about two hundred recruits by twos, commanded by officers of the Alliance of Polish Military Societies. They bore themselves well, with their heads high, and with calm smiling faces. The American flag was borne and such appropriate signs as "Polish Boys for U. S. Army".</p>

   <p>Enthusiasm on the Streets</p>
   <p>The parade marched along Milwaukee Avenue to Desplaines Street, thence to Randolph, to La Salle, to Adams, to Dearborn, thence back to Randolph and to State Street, and wound up at the main recruiting station at Van Buren Street, where the parade dispersed. The recruits went inside the station, from which they left several hours later to go to camp.</p>
   <p>Crowds gathered on the streets as the parade passed, shouting enthusiastically in honor of our boys, and the little scouts, uncovering their heads at the passing of the Stars and Stripes. This parade made a strong impression on people of other nationalities, and raised the Poles high in their estimation.</p>
   <p>It should be added that a solemn mass was said for the Polish soldiers in Uncle Sam's army at Holy Trinity Church in the morning, before the parade started.</p>
   <p>The American papers printed many words of praise for the Poles, stating that <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>two thirds of the volunteers were Poles.</p>
   <p>At the recruiting bureau at Milwaukee Avenue, about five hundred Polish boys have already been recruited.</p>
   <p>Our boys are on top everywhere!</p>
