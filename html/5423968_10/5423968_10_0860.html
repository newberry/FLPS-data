   <p>Although the report was made that St. Hedwig Church would be opened tomorrow, an unexpected court order has been issued, temporarily holding up the opening. All the arrangements for a parade, in which societies from other parishes agreed to participate, and for special services have been cancelled.</p>
   <p>It is evident that the prospect of success of these plans was not to the liking of the Schismatics of the parish. They banded together and decided to interfere with this proposed opening celebration. A committee consulted a lawyer to see whether a legal trick could be used.</p>
   <p>This morning attorney Max Kaczmarek, unfortunately a Pole, appeared before Judge Payne in the name of Dziewior and other representatives of the divided parishioners and requested an injunction against the archbishop of the Chicago diocese, to prevent the opening of the St. Hedwig Church.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Judge Payne gave the following decision about 1 P. M.:</p>
   <p>"No. 166,907.</p>
   <p>"Jacob Dziewior et al vs. Catholic Bishop of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"On motion of the plaintiff's solicitor, it is ordered that the defendant be required to preserve the present status with respect to the parish of St. Hedwig and that the said defendant be enjoined from attempting to hold service in the said church until the parties can be heard by the court.</p>
   <p>John Barton Payne, judge"</p>
   <p>[This is quoted verbatim from the English original.]</p>
   <p>In view of this order, naturally the church opening and parade will not take place. It is always right to respect the law.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>When news of this restraining order reached our office, a special edition of Dziennik Chicagoski containing the details was published in order to inform the Polish societies which were to participate in the opening of the church tomorrow about the cancellation of the program, and in this way protect them from any unnecessary inconveniences.</p>
   <p>No comments about this court order will be made at the present. We wish only to say that this restraining order issued by Judge Payne is only temporary, until the case is reviewed in court. This may be for the best.</p>
   <p>Let the court first of all, after looking into the matter, convince the schismatics that their pretentions are unwarranted. Only then will a triumphant and solemn celebration of the opening of the church be possible. for the good and honest parishioners.</p>
