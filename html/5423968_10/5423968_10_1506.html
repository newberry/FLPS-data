   <p>The first meeting of the Oswiata (Enlightenment) group of young people, at which an essay was read, took place yesterday on the Northwest Side of the city, in the Holy Trinity parish hall. The reader, Mr. Stephen Barszezewski, chose the theme "Enlightenment".</p>
   <p>The essay was very interesting. The reader portrayed, in a sincere, clear, and thorough manner, the importance of, and benefits accruing from, greater knowledge and enlightenment.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled, and the audience was composed of those who can properly realize how important knowledge is. Everybody listened with great attention and concentration, and the reader was rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
