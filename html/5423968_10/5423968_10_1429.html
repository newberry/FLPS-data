   <p>It is predicted that United States and Spain would soon be engaged in a war. To show their appreciation for the freedom given to us Poles, it is assumed that all Polish people will volunteer to join forces with the American army if necessary.</p>
   <p>All people interested in this movement should be present; because if enough people are interested, we will organize a Polish regiment.</p>
   <p>Polish people are invited to attend the meeting every evening, except Monday.</p>
   <p>Only men ranging from 21 to 35 years of age need apply. Every man with any common sense and respect for his country should volunteer. Office is being conducted by Peter Kulbassa, 113 W. Division St.</p>
