   <p>Since the creation of Holy Innocence Parish a few years ago, the wooden structure with its high steeples looks like an old building because it is badly in need of paint. At the present time the church looks neglected and uncared for, but this is due largely to the fact that a new parish like Holy Innocence cannot be taken care of like any of the older parishes because it hasn't as many parishioners and lacks financial support.</p>
   <p>After numerous requests from parishioners to Rev. Father Zwievzchowski to have the church painted, he called upon Mr. Blazejezyk, a Polish citizen, to estimate the cost and send him the bill.</p>
   <p>A few days later Father Zwievzchowski received the bill to the amount of $300, which was checked and approved by the church committee.</p>

   <p>Work was begun two weeks later, but due to rain and damp weather the work had to be discontinued until more favorable weather was on hand. When the exterior painting is completed, the interior of the church will be under consideration.</p>
   <p>Most Rev. Father Zwievzchowski is overburdened with work at the present time because his assistant Rev. Father Feldheim is recovering from ill health in the State of Missouri. During his absence Father J. Karpinski, Superior at the Sisters of Nazareth's Home, acted as assistant to the pastor, but he was called back to his own work after three weeks.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father Karpinski returned to his parish after an absence of six weeks completely recovered from his nervousness. Father Zwievzchowski is happy to have his assistant back in time to get the school children ready for their first Holy Communion, which will take place the last Sunday of June.</p>

   <p>Since June 1st Mr. Eugene Walkiewicz, the new organist, has taken full charge of the choir. He was born and raised in Poland and completed his organist course at Ratysbone. He came to America five years ago and resided in Kenosha, Wis. After a period of two years he was made organist of a Polish parish, a position which he held until he received an offer from Holy Innocence parish. The congregation is wishing him the best of everything in his new position.</p>
   <p>The parish is expanding and the school attendance has increased over twenty-five per cent since its beginning. At the present time there are over eight hundred families belonging to this parish.</p>
   <p>The Polish families are buying out the properties of the Swedes and the Germans and have intentions of making this neighborhood surrounding Holy Innocence parish strictly Polish.</p>
