   <p>A letter from the main bureau of the committee calling the Polish Catholic Congress, 227 Lovejoy Street, Buffalo, New York.</p>
   <p>"To the officers of all Polish Catholic societies and delegates to the Polish Catholic Congress:</p>
   <p>"Blank credentials have been mailed to the pastors of Polish parishes for delegates to the Polish Catholic Congress, and we request the various societies to call for them, fill them out, and sign them. The delegates who are to represent the parishes, not the societies, will please apply to their pastors, who will give them credentials properly filled out.</p>
   <p>"Hoping that the various societies and elected delegates will follow these instructions, I remain,</p>
   <p>"With brotherly regards,</p>
   <p>"Stanislaus Slisz, secretary."</p>
