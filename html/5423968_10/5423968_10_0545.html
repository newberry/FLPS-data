   <p>Today, practically on the eve of the Detroit conference, we must agree that the Polish Catholic Congress in America will be most impressive.</p>
   <p>One hundred and sixty Polish priests, and as many societies, all Polish organizations, have endorsed the Congress.</p>
   <p>From all directions, both laymen and clergy are all preparing to travel to Detroit and a large number of delegates will go from Chicago.</p>
   <p>Everybody is talking about the Congress; our people are beginning to think of it and realize its importance. These are self-evident facts.</p>
   <p>New applications are arriving every day, proving conclusively that the masses of Polish Catholic people in America will support the Congress with all their heart and soul.</p>
   
   <p>We have already published the names of many of the societies, and here are a few more:</p>
   <p>Wiara i Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland) publishes a list of seven societies from the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Parish in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. These are: St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr, The Pulaski Guards (under the name of St. Floryan), the St. Joseph Brotherhood, the Society of Yellow Uhlans (under the protection of Saints Peter and Paul), the Soldiers of St. John, the St. Hedwig Society, and the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</p>
   <p>These societies severely condemn the "Independent" churches and everything that is inimical to the Roman Catholic Church and its followers.</p>
   <p>From Scranton, Pennsylvania, we have received similar favorable news. The Polak w Ameryce (Pole in America) has published a list of eleven local societies that have decided to support the Congress with all their strength, and in addition have expressed the severest condemnation of the "Independent" churches. The names of these societies are: The Guard of Thaddeus Kosciusko; The Soldiers of the Holy Cross; The Guard of Casimir Pulaski; The Society of the Most Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, Branch No. 1; The Society of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Branch No. 2; The Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka, Circle No. 1; The Society of Polish Hand Workers; The Society of the Name of Sobreski; The Dramatic Circle; and Lutnia (The Lute).</p>
   <p>In addition the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Society, in the parish of the same name in Buffalo, New York, vigorously endorsed the Congress. This is one of the oldest, and the largest local organization.</p>
   <p>Finally, the following societies have sent us letters endorsing the Polish Catholic Congress: The St. Casimir Society of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Branch 125 of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus); The Society of Brotherly Help of St. Casimir the Prince, of the parish of the same name in Chicago (notification sent by the secretary, Mr. Max Adamowicz); The St. Hyacinth Society, of St. Adalbert Parish in Grand Rapids, Michigan; The Brotherhood of St. Casimir, of the parish of the same name in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Altogether, twenty-two new Polish Societies have endorsed the Congress.</p>
   <p>We see, therefore, that this is not a mere gentle stream but a powerful wave of sentiment, that will, undoubtedly, beginning with the Detroit conference, become ever larger, and will embrace slowly but surely the entire Polish Catholic population of America.</p>
   <p>The Congress will, therefore, be very impressive. This can be said definitely today, without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
