   <p>The young Parish of St. John Cantius finally received three new church bells. The news spread rapidly throughout the neighborhood and caused excitement. Many people came to see them and rejoiced, others vowed they would move away as they did not wish to have their sleep broken up and to be constantly reminded of death. Sometime in May the Archbishop of Chicago will consecrate the bells.</p>
