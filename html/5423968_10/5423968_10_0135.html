   <p>Narodowy is very indignant because the pastor of St. John of God Parish turned out from his office Mrs. Szramko, who could not pay $30 for the burial of her child. Her husband makes only $9 per week and there are five children in the house.</p>
   <p>There is no room here for indignation. If some one wants to keep "bullocks," he or she must supply them with good food and all comforts necessary for bulls.</p>
   <p>Don't you think that such a "bullock," sitting in a parish house and claiming to be a "servant of God," is worse than the bullock standing in a stable?</p>
   <p>He likes to eat chickens, ducks, geese and drink good beer, wine, and whiskey. As a "Holy Ox," he is entitled to a "Holy Manor House" for expounding the holy faith.</p>
   <p>It can't be otherwise.</p>
