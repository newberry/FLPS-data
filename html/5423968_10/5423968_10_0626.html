   <p>We received the following correspondence with a request to publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski (Polish Daily News):</p>
   <p>A great mass meeting was held Sunday, January 26, in the newly organized Polish parish of Sts. Peter and Paul in Chicago. Every member of the parish was present. Mr. Jacob Hebel was elected chairman and Mr. Joseph Zietak was chosen as secretary. The chairman explained the object for which the meeting was called, namely, to denounce and condemn the lies attacking their parish which were published by a disreputable paper called the Dziennik Polski.</p>
   <p>After hearing the details of the charges, all the assembled members expressed contempt for those who dared to attack the parish and our beloved pastor, Reverend Paul Rhode.</p>
   
   <p>Our parish is composed of people who love peace and unity, and our pastor is a young priest, but honest and sincere in his labors for the welfare of the parish, and he is greatly respected by his parishioners, in fact, by every Pole who has had the honor of knowing him intimately. We have absolutely no complaint to make against him.</p>
   <p>On January 20, in issue no. 17 of the Dziennik Polski, there appeared an article attacking Reverend Rhode. It was signed by two persons, presumably our parishioners, whose names are supposed to be Fr. S. Weclewski and August Mach. Therefore we, in the name of the entire parish, authorized at today's mass meeting feel duty-bound to state that everything mentioned in the aforesaid article is a dastardly falsehood.</p>
   <p>The article is full of lies. It is a lie that F. S. Weclewski and Aug. Mach are members of our parish, because we have no knowledge of any persons bearing such names, and we judge that the names are therefore spurious.</p>
   <p>It is a lie that Reverend Paul Rhode was supposed to have employed a teacher by the name of Mr. Frank Daniel contrary to our wishes. This is not true. We, the parishioners, decided to employ him as an organist and teacher if he proved himself to be qualified. And, after a month's trial, we have found him to be competent as a teacher in our newly organized school. The children are making rapid progress under his tutelage.</p>
   <p>It is an infamous lie that Reverend Rhode did everything to suit himself, without asking anybody's advice. It never was that way and it is not that way now. Reverend Rhode consults us in even the slightest affairs concerning the parish.</p>
   <p>It is a lie that there were six hundred parishioners when the parish was organized and that since Reverend Rhode took charge, the number has decreased; on the contrary, since the time when services were begun, forty new members have been added to our rolls.</p>
   <p>You gentlemen, Weclewski and Mach, or whatever may be your true names, must be great falsifiers.....You shed crocodile tears for our children and the knowledge taught them, and where are you headed for? You evidently lack enough knowledge to be able to understand and to apply God's Commandment to love your neighbors.</p>
   <p>You are not concerned about our children, but, in a diabolically clever manner, you want to create disturbances among us, deprive our pastor of his good name, sow seeds of dissension among us, and destroy all our good work.....That is the reason you are hiding behind assumed names.</p>
   <p>Considering matters further, it is also a lie that Mr. Fr. Daniel, our organist and teacher, received a salary of sixty dollars a month; every sensible person can understand that so small a parish, rising in these terribly difficult times, is unable to pay such a salary.</p>
   <p>It is a lie also, that Reverend Rhode is leading the parishioners blindly. When he wants to do something, he does it with the consent of the people, and not as he pleases. This is proved at every one of our parish meetings.</p>
   <p>Your lies or the lies of that disgraceful paper will not touch us or our parish.....They would not be worth-while answering if they concerned us alone. And we would not have answered them at all, were it not for the fear that the lies so boldly published in the Dziennik Polski might blind some of our good people to the truth.</p>
   <p>Our concern to enlighten them causes us to issue this protest, and we categorically deny all the foolish and irresponsible lies. We want the public to know that among us in this parish, peace and love are the rule, and we hope that the public will severely condemn these snakes in the grass and liars.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul Parish: [There follows a list of parishioners.]</p>
