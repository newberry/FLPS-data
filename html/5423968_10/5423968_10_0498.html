   <p>We have received a copy of the following appeal sent to all pastors of Polish parishes by the committee in charge of arranging the Polish Catholic Congress:</p>
   <p>"Buffale, May 7, 1896.</p>
   <p>"Dear Reverend Father: According to the decision of the members of the main committee in charge of preliminary preparations and the calling together of the Polish Catholic Congress, every Polish Roman Catholic parish is entitled to one delegate for each 1,000 parishioners. Parishes having less than 1,000 members may also send one delegate.</p>
   <p>"Only these should be selected to represent a parish who are not delegates of and society.</p>
   <p>"Hoping, that the parish of which you, Dear Father, are pastor will gladly take <span class="page-break">2</span>part in this Congress, we cordially request you to call a parish meeting at which delegates may be chosen to represent the parish. We hope you will accede to our request, because certain very important matters concerning our religion and our nationality will be discussed.</p>
   <p>"We also wish to state that an appeal will shortly be sent out calling the Polish Catholic Congress to meet at the most opportune time.</p>
   <p>"Please send the names and addresses of the chosen delegates as soon as possible to the secretary of the committee, Mr. S. Slisz, 227 Lovejoy Street, Buffalo, New York.</p>
   <p>"Finally, we wish to state that it would be advisable if the parishes chose laymen as delegates, because the priests are delegates by virtue of their office and can participate in the discussions at the Congress.</p>
   <p>"With sincere greetings, we remain,</p>
   <p>Your humble servants,</p>
   <p>Reverend John Pitass, president,</p>
   <p>S. Slisz, secretary."</p>
