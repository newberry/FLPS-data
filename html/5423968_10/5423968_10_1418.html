   <p>During the past week, the Narod Polski received the following dispatch from the Secretary of the Navy:</p>
   <p>"The President last night signed an executive order directing that the authorized enlisted strength of the Navy be increased to 87,000. He was authorized by Congress, in case of emergency, to direct such increase in enlistment. New ships and ships in reserve are being fully commissioned as rapidly as possible and the need is imperative for a larger enlistment to man them. There has been a not increase of over six thousand five hundred in enlistment since Congress recently authorized an increase, but many more are needed.</p>
   <p>"Will you not emphasize this need by giving special prominence Monday on the first page of your paper, to the President's order, and also by making an editorial appeal for new recruits for the Navy?</p>
   <p>"The Navy offers exceptional advantages to young men of ability and ambition to serve in the first line of national defense.</p>
   <p>"In this emergency you have the opportunity and the privilege of performing this public service and I am confidently appealing to your cordial and helpful cooperation.</p>
   <p>Josephus Daniels,</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Navy."</p>
