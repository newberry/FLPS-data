   <p>Commercial organizations of various kinds, and with a declared capital of many million dollars in paper, have, for some time, been springing up with the rapidity of mushrooms. These enterprises are carried on through the sale of shares.</p>
   <p>We are not wholly opposed to such organizations; we must, however, consider their soundness. Therefore, we earnestly warn our readers and members of the Polish National Alliance to be most careful about investing their money in enterprises that do not bear thorough investigation.</p>
   <p>A few days ago we published a warning issued by the Press Committee which was based on information given by the National Committee. In reference to this matter, the Polish Daily Record writes as follows: "Much has been said lately about re-emigration to Poland and how such re-emigration could help to establish commercial relations between Poland and America."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>All these plans sound very promising, but not all promoters are guided by honest and patriotic reasons. We believe that re-emigration of Poles to Poland should take place because Poland will need plenty of good, skilled workers. Those with experience will, therefore, be most valuable. This movement should, however, not be rushed. The return to Poland should be well planned and regulated by governmental requirements. Those people who do not have sufficient funds should, however, not leave this country as they would be disillusioned.</p>
   <p>During the first few years following the peace treaty, Poland will have enough hands to rebuild what has been demolished during the war. The sudden flow of laborers into the land might bring about a crisis, and be the cause of another emigration problem. When Poland has rebuilt its ruined villages and towns and has enough food and provisions, then will be the time for mass re-emigration. Then there will be enough work for every skilled worker.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But Poland will, even at this time, welcome people with money who will invest in land which can now be had at extremely low prices, or such as will invest in some commercial or manufacturing enterprises. Poles should, in their early age, learn a trade which may be used to advantage later in Poland, and for which they will be generously paid.</p>
   <p>In reference to the numerous small corporations organized in this country recently, we must admit that we have no confidence in them, and, therefore, we warn all Poles to be most cautious when investing their money. Anyone who is without either money or experience, and is trying to sell shares to establish business relations between Poland and America, is without business qualifications, and is trying to bleed the gullible public.</p>
   <p>Commercial connections between both countries can be established and maintained only by large corporations which have been organized by well-known, progressive Poles who have met with the approval of the Polish government. Therefore, we give the following advice to all our countrymen: "Be very cautious when invited to invest your life's savings without any suitable security."</p>
