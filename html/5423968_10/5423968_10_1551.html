   <p>Under the instigation of its pastor Reverend Nowicki, St. Michael Archangel Parish has organized two new military societies, the Cadets of St. Michael and the Kosynieri [soldiers armed with scythes, as in Kosciusko's peasant army]. Each will consist principally of school boys; those who do not attend school may be members only if they can prove themselves of exemplary character and are introduced by responsible persons.</p>
   <p>Leon Machinkowski, a member of the Illinois National Guard, will command the Cadets, while Anthony Niewolski, who is an old soldier from Poland, will be in charge of the Kosynieri.</p>
   <p>Judging from the large number of applications for membership, we can predict success for both of these societies.</p>
