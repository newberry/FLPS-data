   <p>The combined choirs of St. Mary of the Angels' parish sponsored a farewell banquet on Wednesday, February 3, 1915, for their former instructor and organist, Mr. Joseph P. Mallek. The affair was conducted in the spacious parish hall, and was attended by the Reverend F. Repinski, by all the choirs, and by prominent parishoners and other guests.</p>
   <p>After the banquet Miss F. Gackowska, in a brief speech, made known the purpose of the affair and called upon Mr. Frank Urbanski to act as master of ceremonies</p>
   <p>Mr. Urbanski expressed his thanks for the honor bestowed upon him. In ardent words the master of ceremonies described the five years' work of Mr. Mallek, giving him full credit [for his accomplishment]. At the same time he added that were it not for Mr. Mallek, the parish would never have enjoyed so strong and popular a financial institution as the Father Gordon Building and Loan Association.</p>

   <p>After this, Misses M. Smigaj and S. Bazar sang a duet, "Separation" (Rozstanie), a composition of John Mallek's.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Poklenkowski was the next speaker. In his excellent speech he touched upon Mr. Joseph Mallek's activities and expressed his satisfaction that although they were bidding farewell that evening to Mr. Mallek as an organist, he was not leaving their circle but in so far as the speaker knew would continue in the parish in the building and loan association and in his own business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Roman Pojawis played a piano solo, after which Miss Agnes Powalisz delivered a declamation with much expression. This was followed by a piano solo by Miss L. Banach.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Francis Repinski was the next speaker. The reverend father stated that it was unnecessary to bid farewell to Mr. Mallek because he is not leaving us; he will still be with us, although not as an organist. He then gave [proper] credit to our organist for his work and wished him success in his new enterprise.</p>

   <p>The final speaker was the guest of honor, Mr. Joseph Mallek. In a lengthier speech he remarked that five years ago, when he arrived at St. Mary's parish, he was informed that great disorder and dissension existed in the choirs.</p>
   <p>"Investigating the reason for these conditions," said the speaker, "I cancelled the presidencies and other offices of the choirs and took the leadership into my own hands. Although I did not receive the assistance promised me at the time of my acceptance of the position, and although I have personally met all the expense of the purchase of copies of church and national music, I have nevertheless brought about order and co-operation and have trained [the choirs to sing] difficult church music. When I think back and recall these various obstacles and the lack of assistance, I am proud of what I accomplished."</p>
   <p>The speaker thanked all the members for their sincere work, for their assistance, for their faithful service and friendship, and for the pleasant surprise that the choir had prepared for him. In conclusion he stated that the moments spent with the choirs in conducting church and national music will remain in his memory for a long time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The things accomplished by Mr. Mallek are really admirable, and the results [of his efforts] speak louder than words. The choirs of the parish join with the Reverend Father Repinski and all the parishioners in wishing Mr. Mallek success in his new field of endeavor.</p>
