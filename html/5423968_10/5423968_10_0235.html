   <p>Say your Rosary! How many stopped to say the Rosary, intending to give an excuse with a regretful air: "I have no time." No! but time enough for useless visits, for prolonged conversation. And even if your occupations should rapidly succeed one another, if your days should be absolutely filled, your piety even in that case should be allowed a little satisfaction. It does not take whole hours to say some Ave Marias. Give to the recitation of your Rosary some of your lost moments, nothing but that -- and you shall have said your Resary! Why not slip your beads into your hand, and, while walking in the street, begin to say them mentally?</p>
