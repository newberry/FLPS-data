   <p>Thanks to the efforts of Reverend W. Fuhrman, pastor of St. Casimir's Parish, and several outstanding citizens of this community, the members of the parish have succeeded in organizing a unit of the Polish gymnastic society Sokol Polski, or Polish Falcons. To head the new unit, which already counts twenty-one young men in its ranks, the following members were chosen: Joseph Serwatkiewicz, president; Albert Szymanski, vice-president; John Rosinski, recording secretary; Miecislaus J. Szameit, financial secretary; Joseph Kozlowski, cashier; and Alvin Rosinski, temporary instructor. The constitution will be written this week.</p>
   <p>Residents of St. Casimir's Parish, I appeal to you! Please send your young sons, 12 years old or over, to our parish hall on February 4, at 2 P.M., so that they may join the Polish Falcons. This organization has taken upon itself an obligation which consists not only in taking care of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>physical strength of its members but also in spreading enlightenment in order to save the young generation from degradation.</p>
   <p>We are certain that other Falcon units, especially the Polish Falcons No. 1, organized in St. Adalbert's parish, will be glad to come to our assistance.</p>
   <p>John Rosinski, secretary.</p>
