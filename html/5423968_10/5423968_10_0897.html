   <p>Warning has been given to the Chicago Tribune time and again about their twisting the facts relative to the disturbances at St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>The policy of the Tribune is not only Republican, but is also greatly influenced by the A. P. A. [American Protective Association] faction. It has always been against the Poles, and now a special interest has been taken in the agitators of St. Hedwig Parish. The purpose of this, of course, is to win over as many new votes as possible for its party [Republican]. This is evidenced by the lively interest the Republicans of the Fifteenth Ward are taking in this affair; their for ces are working closely with the agitators responsible for the misunderstanding at St. Hedwig Church.</p>
   <p>In this commotion the Tribune is not ashamed of the steps it has taken. It lies to such an extent that it is frightful.....</p>

   <p>It has been pointed out, according to the Tribune, that the Chicago archbishop is a Resurrectionist. This scandalous absurdity was even repeated by one of the Polish papers of "good will" of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Today, we find greater, more scandalous and more impudent lies in the Chicago Tribune than ever before. That paper prints the following story about the conditions at St. Hedwig Parish:</p>
   <p>"A representative individual of the parish was questioned as to whether the disorder in a Polish parish in Omaha had anything in common with the disorder in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"He said: 'No, not directly. But consider this, sir: this priest, Kaminski (reference is being made to the deceiver and schismatic, Kaminski: editor's note.) is a Resurrectionist. The church in South Chicago was closed (which church? - editor's addition). Discord prevails there. The priest is also a Resurrectionist.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In every outbreak in our parishes this same Resurrection Order has been responsible for all the trouble.'"</p>
   <p>Every Pole, every person familiar with Polish affairs will admit that the Tribune was unjustified in publicly announcing such insolent lies.</p>
   <p>Kaminski consecrated by Villatte as a Resurrectionist! Chicago church closed because of a member of the Resurrection Order! Verily, this surpasses all bounds.</p>
   <p>If the reporter of the Tribune wrote these unprecedented lies because of his ignorance, the publishing of them could be forgiven. But what right had he to voice an opinion as though he was a "member of the parish"? What kind of a conscience does this monster have? And of what nature are those Polish papers that willingly repeat the lies of the Tribune? Let everyone give his own answers to these questions....</p>
