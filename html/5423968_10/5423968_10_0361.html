   <p>Reverend Bednarek serves as an example of our youth, for he reached this station through work, study and, above all, the call to serve God. All his former friends were unable to be present at the consecration ceremonies, therefore, the entire parish will be on hand to take part in the celebration of his first Mass next Sunday. They not only will pay homage to him but exchange a few friendly words.</p>
