   <p>At the present time we are confronted with items concerning this new Polish parish, that is to cause a change in the name of this parish.</p>
   <p>Through the order by his Excellency, the Most Rev. Archbishop, this parish will be named Holy Innocence (Sw. Mlodziankow) in place of St. Florian.</p>
   <p>We are informing all our dear Polish members that the blessing of this church and the school of Holy Innocence, will take place Sunday, Dec. 10, at 10 o'clock in the morning.</p>
