   <p>This picture of the new Immaculate Conception Church shows how the structure will look when it is completed.</p>
   <p>It was only recently that the new building was started on the corner of 88th Street and Commercial Avenue. The church is to be built of Bedford stone, will be 160 feet long and 72 feet high (without the tower), and will seat 1,500 persons. When completed it will be the most beautiful church in South Chicago. The entire building is to be heated by a hot water system and will be illuminated by electricity. The total cost is estimated at $70,000.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, November 11, the ceremony of laying the cornerstone took place before a crowd of three thousand persons. Archbishop Feehan officiated.</p>
