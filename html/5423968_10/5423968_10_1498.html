   <p>It is in the nature of man to crave for social recreation, and this craving should be satisfied in moderation. This is true of our Polish youth. In order to satisfy the cravings of their nature, they are bending every effort to arrange social entertainments.</p>
   <p>The Young Men's Archbrotherhood of Jesus, one of the many societies in Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, in order to get away from immoral entertainments and not to waste the public's time with empty and pointless social functions, which do not cultivate the spirit but kill it, undertook the task of presenting to the public a literary and patriotic program. The young men and women of the society threw in all their energies in the plans. Their five-hundred-volume library hummed like a beehive. Volume after volume was scrutinized for interesting material. A great deal of effort was put into this work, as the aim was to present a good program.</p>

   <p>After a few weeks of diligent work the climax came last Sunday, June 13, when the curtain on the first act was raised at the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish Hall. From beginning to end the interest of the audience was captivated by the variety of acts. The actors have demonstrated not only that they are familiar with the history and literature of Poland but that they know how to interpret some of the great plays on the stage.</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph Gieburowski, special guest of the evening, opened the program with stirring patriotic words. During the course of his speech, he signified that the Almighty will restore Poland from ocean to ocean because of her loyalty to His faith and her service for the good of Christianity and civilization. Reverend Gieburowski said that the suffering of the Polish nation has been the most just will of God. God alone has placed the Polish people into chains in order that they may cleanse themselves of their evil habits and to train themselves in brotherly love, respect for freedom, elevation of the soul and, above all, to learn to respect God.</p>

   <p>The priest was right, for our one hundred years of slavery has drilled us in many nationalistic virtues which were lacking during the reign of Poland and which no nation can live without. Although slowly, Poland is freeing herself from her bonds through the cognizance of truth. And it was apropos of her present condition that Reverend Gieburowski concluded his speech with the following lines:</p>
   <p>"Poland, politicians of today</p>
   <p>Do not know what they say</p>
   <p>When they claim Poland is dead</p>
   <p>For she'll rise from her grave instead,</p>
   <p>Because her wounds will heal,</p>
   <p>Because her grave is her cradle."</p>
   <p>After the opening address, a variety program followed. The first to appear on the stage was a mixed chorus under the direction of Mr. Chojnacki, <span class="page-break">4</span>organist of the lower choir of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church. The men's choir was next, followed by the women's choir. Both gave brilliant renditions of patriotic and religious songs.</p>
   <p>Declamations were rendered by Simon Sikorski, Miss W. Wierzba, W. Rokosz, and others. W. Czastka sang a solo and John Bombera and F. Czastka rendered a monologue. There were many other acts.</p>
   <p>Reverend Gieburowski closed the program with a word of thanks to the audience for its co-operation and a word of praise for the splendid performance given by the young Men's Archbrotherhood of Jesus. He also announced that this group is going to stage a benefit performance on September 19 for the Polish Hospital and the society's library. The curtain fell as the audience sang "God Save Poland."</p>
