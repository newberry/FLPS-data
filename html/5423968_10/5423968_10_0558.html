   <p>Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette) states:</p>
   <p>We are informed that the St. Hedwig Court of the Catholic Order of Foresters had its charter revoked, because some of its members belonged to the group of "Independents" organized by the fallen pseudo-priest Kozlowski.</p>
   <p>Is it not a shame that some of our countrymen, just because they are not Catholies, are thrown out of our ranks?</p>
