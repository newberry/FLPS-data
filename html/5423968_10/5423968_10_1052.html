   <p>As we know, on Christmas Day, after the ceremonial blessing, regular services will be held in the lower St. John Cantius Church on Carpenter Street. Yesterday, Wednesday, December 20, the Right Reverend Simon Kobrzynski blessed the rectory of the new Polish parish on Front Street, and today, on the feast day of St. Thomas the Apostle, the pastor, Reverend John Kasprzycki, after saying the Holy Mass at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church for success for his parish, removed his belongings to his new home. Reverend Floryan Matuszewski was named assistant to the new Polish parish and he will move here within a week.</p>
