   <p>We are witnessing an increasing immigration of Polish mechanics, such as machinists, blacksmiths, locksmiths and similar trades. These men are not familiar with the English language and therefore do not know the names of machines or material which are used. Such immigrants have difficulty in securing employment at their trades. Although there are skilled and efficient mechanics among them, they often have to endure long delays before securing work. Our mechanical methods are superior to the European standard and special training is required, a problem wich entails considerable difficulty, even for the most capable European mechanic-if he does not understand English.</p>
   <p>Brethren of the above mentioned trades, who realized the urgent need for a Polish organization of mechanics in the iron industry, held a conclave on the fourteenth day of January and appointed a committee to consider this question. All Polish mechanics, machinists, blacksmiths, locksmiths and mechanical engineers were invited to attend a meeting at the Quo Vadis Hall, corner Ashland Ave. and Division St., Sunday, February, the 4th, 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>The Committee: J. Martyka, F. Piatkowski, S. Skowronek, T. Janiszewski, E. Rybicki.</p>
