   <p>This is a world of aches and pains. Every person must endure his burden and the whip of opposition. For the sake of the general welfare it appears that some must sacrifice for others their own desires and claims.</p>
   <p>We Christians are not called upon like our predecessors thousands of years ago to sacrifice our lives, but all of us can sacrifice our own selfish desires and pleasures.</p>
   <p>Sacrifice is one of the fires that purify the soul. It strengthens the human heart. It teaches us to feel for others, whether friends or enemies, and to help them. It eradicates selfishness. There is nothing greater than this idea of God's and the sacrifices flowing from it. To sacrifice one's self for one's brethren that is one of the greatest of virtues and one of our most important duties.</p>

   <p>Sacrifice gains for us God's grace. Nobody will achieve a crown without first carrying the cross. Without sacrifice there is no merit. The journey, difficult and troublesome, through life would otherwise be a jaunt across the ocean, without fears, storms, or waves. Sacrifice is not only indispensable to our welfare, but in addition, and above all, it is a duty.</p>
   <p>If you want to be a Christian, sacrifice yourself daily, quietly and in silence.</p>
   <p>If you want to be a good Pole, do the same.....Stop thinking only of yourself; think of our mutual cause, of your neighbors, of an ideal--and you will be truly a Christian and a Pole.</p>
