   <p>In the January 13, 1892 edition of Dziennik Chicagoski, an appeal appeared to all older parishioners of the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, for a conference to be held on January 17, with a view toward establishing a welfare society. This appeal was signed by Rev. Vincent Barzynski, rector of the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish.</p>
   <p>At the gathering which resulted from this appeal, a committee was chosen to make plans relative to the basis upon which this society should be established. Besides Rev. Barzynski, the citizens included on this committee were Peter Kiolbassa, Stanley Kunz, Victor Bardonski, August Kowalski, Anthony Rudnicki, Jacob Mucha, Frank Wleklinski, V. Pyterek, Paul Ratkowski, Sigmund Czaplinski, Louis Biadaszkiewicz, Frank Okon, Frank Murkowski, and Frank Zwierzynski. These citizens, therefore, should be considered the main organizers of this society.</p>

   <p>For the following two weeks, general propositions were discussed, the administration was elected, and the constitution formulated and accepted after the third public reading.</p>
   <p>This constitution contained the following cardinal points:</p>
   <p>The Welfare Society, under the auspices of St. John Cantius, endeavors to discharge Christian deeds of charity in Chicago, Illinois toward the needy, and chiefly toward the countrymen of the members of the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish. All Poles may become members. Those that pay an initiation fee of one dollar, and who contribute four dollars or more yearly to the treasury shall become regular members; on the other hand, the benefactors of the society are those who cannot or will not bind themselves to regular fees. They give support to the society, however, by single contributions or by offerings of food, shoes, clothing, <span class="page-break">\3</span>etc. Meetings of the members will be held quarterly, one of which is to be the annual meeting for the purpose of electing twenty directors. The directors will select officers from their midst, and they will perform their duties without charge. The directors are to meet once a month and the officers twice a month, or oftener, if necessary.</p>
   <p>This society, in the short period of its existence, has showed great progress in its activities, and already has helped many poor people. During the current year, it has the following directors: Rev. Vincent Barzynski, Congregation of the Resurrection Fathers, ex-president; Victor Bardonski, first vice-president; Frank Wleklinski, second vice-president; Stanley Szwajkart, recording secretary; Thomas Krolik, financial secretary; Jacob Mucha, treasurer; Paul Ratkowski, inspector; Walter Nowaczewski, host; and August Kowalski, Anthony Rudnicki, Max Kasmar (Kaczmarek), Stanley Kunz, J. Kaminski, Ignace Machnikowski, Peter Kiolbassa, Ignace Mikietynski, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, Francis Okon, Joseph Paszkiewicz, John Rudnicki and John Arkuszewski.</p>

   <p>According to the last semi-annual report of the financial secretary, the distribution of charities exceeded $200. The entire income amounted to $291.50 and after deduction of other expenses, a balance of $40 remained in the treasury. There were 130 members of the society.</p>
   <p>All affairs of this society are managed by Mr. Thomas Krolik, the financial secretary, who resides at....Cleaver Street.</p>
   <p>This society is affiliated with no larger organizations, but the desire of its founders and members is the establishment of similar societies in other parishes of Chicago. If they prove their usefulness, then they might be formed into one great organization. We hear that the citizens of South Chicago propose to establish a similar society in the St. Michael parish; while in the St. Josephat's parish of Chicago, there already exists a society of this nature, though organized on exactly the same principles.</p>
