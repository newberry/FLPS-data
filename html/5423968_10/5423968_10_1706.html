   <p>The enemies of immigration are active again. Not only are they trying to impose unjust restrictions upon immigrants who through no fault of their own do not know how to read and write, but they are giving preference to immigrants from other nations, while those from Poland are forgotten or ignored. Why? Because we have no government to intercede for us, because we have no Poles in Washington to defend our cause. Let us, therefore, be our own government. Let us create our own representation. Let us create our own spokesmen.</p>
   <p>This afternoon, that is, on January 8, 1915, at 4:30 P.M., a meeting will be held in Judge E. Jareeki's courtroom relative to this important matter. All Poles who participated in the immigration conference with Senator Lewis several weeks age are asked to be present. All officials of Polish organizations, editors of Polish newspapers, our Polish clergy, as well as all Poles holding public office, are also invited to participate in this meeting.</p>
