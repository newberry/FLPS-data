   <p>The number of members of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is growing steadily.</p>
   <p>Two new societies from outside of Chicago, numbering about one hundred members, have joined this organization.</p>
   <p>The last assessment roll of the Polish Roman Catholic Union has been already sent out, Mr. Frank Wleklinski, secretary of this organization, assures us; the list contains names of 8,090 members. With this new hundred, the membership of the Union will reach close to 8,200 members. The Milwaukee split will soon be remedied.</p>
   <p>More particulars about this matter will be published in the next issue of Wiara i Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland).</p>
