   <p>Yesterday the Polish community of St. Hedwig Parish witnessed the "consecration" of the new schismatic [independent] church.</p>
   <p>This "ceremonious" event (which is covered in detail in another section of the paper) brought out one interesting fact: the absence of its champion and principal figure, that is, its mythical bishop who was to have performed the rites.</p>
   <p>Many stories were circulated throughout the community yesterday relative to the reason of the "bishop's" absence--practically as many as are passed at the present time about the sea serpent. There is little concern about these stories, however, no matter how fantastic or interesting. We are only concerned about the confirmation of the logical and evident results which spring <span class="page-break">2</span>from this fact. The final outcome of all this talk is as follows:</p>
   <p>Apostate Kozlowski, who has been promising his followers a bishop, could not produce one at the final moment, because no Roman Catholic bishop would agree to participate in any schismatic event, because, as is apparent, those who have previously posed as bishops would not commit a sacrilege at this time for fear of the responsibility involved.</p>
   <p>An intelligent person cannot come to any other conclusions.</p>
   <p>For this reason, or any other, sufficient proof has been given that the building blessed by Kozlowski is not a Roman Catholic church, that the Roman Catholic clergy has nothing in common with this parish and church, and those that claim otherwise are misleading the people. This, after all, is as clear as the sun.</p>
   <p>The leaders of this schism gave damaging evidence against themselves <span class="page-break">3</span>yesterday--and we believe that the people will gain by this proof.</p>
   <p>Now, perhaps, is the best and most opportune time to cast away the false prophets. Stop condemning the soul and stop being led by the nose by these quacks who present these schismatic beliefs as the truth.</p>
   <p>The wayward brothers, upon realization, will willingly follow in the footsteps of those who returned to the true fold yesterday [yesterday is used figuratively].</p>
   <p>Those who desire to adhere to the right church and follow the Holy Faith and the authorities of the Roman Catholic church have been given various concessions at St. Hedwig Parish. The bishop assigned a new and respected pastor to the parish who has been accepted by the parishioners. He has urged them to work for their mutual benefit, which he asked for blessing from above. Members of this parish are now peaceful and content. Anger <span class="page-break">4</span>and hatred is not harbored in their hearts. They are not vexed with worry nor are they concerned about what is going to happen to the Church which was erected uselessly by hard earned money, nor are they concerned about what planet a bold cheat will fall from to act as a Roman Catholic bishop and perform sacriligious rites, supposedly Catholic.</p>
   <p>Yes! Peace prevails in the hearts of the parishioners of the right flank for they have clear minds.</p>
   <p>This same harmony can be shared by all those who even today are grouping their way blindly, provided they find enough strength and reasoning to leave the road of errors. When they will have accomplished this they will have cleansed their conscience and instilled joy in their hearts; thereby avoiding heavy moral and material losses.</p>
