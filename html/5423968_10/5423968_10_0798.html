   <p>The St. John Cantius Parish Fair Committee is repeating this year what it introduced a year ago; namely, "Orphans' Day," which will be held this coming Thursday [August 29]. Although the purpose of the fair is to raise funds to complete the St. John Cantius Church, one day has been set aside not only to fete the orphans of the Holy Family Orphanage but to turn over the entire proceeds of the day to that institution.</p>
   <p>A reception committee will take charge of the underprivileged children at 2 P. M. this coming Thursday. Everything will be ready for them. All those who wish to make this a momentous day for these children are urged to attend. Not only will they have a pleasant time but they will also perform a good deed. These who have never attended such an occasion are especially urged to attend this one.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was Children's Day at the fair, the second this month. Although it <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>rained, a sizable crowd attended. Many came home with valuable prizes. The older folks made things interesting by purchasing concession tickets for the school children.</p>
   <p>The last day of the fair will be September 1. A welcome is extended to all those who have not as yet taken part in this fair. Remember that the proceeds will be used for the completion of the church.</p>
