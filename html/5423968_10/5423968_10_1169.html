   <p>Yesterday Rev. Felix Zwiardowski C.R., former pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Church, performed his silver anniversary mass in this church. The special eigth o'clock mass was offered to God as thanks for making the twenty-five years of priesthood a possibility.</p>
   <p>A group of parish school girls, dressed in white and carrying bouquets of fresh flowers for the celebrant, sat at prayer in the chancel. Reverend Zwiardowski was attended at the altar by Reverend Kobrzynski, who served as archdeacon; Father F. Gordom, who served as deacon; and Father Kasprzycki, who served as subdeacon. Mr. Pawlowski, who is a candidate for the priesthood, presided as ceremonialist. Throughout the mass, the church choir was accompanied in their singing by musical instrumentalists.</p>
   <p>Rev. V. Barzynski delivered the sermon. He gave a short survey <span class="page-break">2</span>of the history of the Order of the Resurrection Fathers. He pointed out that Reverend Zwiardowski was the son of a Polish army officer, who served during 1831.</p>
   <p>"In 1863, the former, instead of taking up the sword to defend his country, decided to join the ranks of the newly budding Resurrection Order. He thought that the banner of the cross would do more common good for his people. His monastic vows took him across the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. His early mission work was performed in Texas and later in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"When Father Zwiardowski came to this country in 1867, to participate in mission work, he was only a clerk. But soon after he became a full-fledged missionary. On April 20, the following year, he was ordained at Galveston, Texas, by Bishop Cladius M. Dubius. This indeed was a great moment for the new priest and missionary, as well as for the Poles, for he was the first Polish priest to be ordained on American soil. Although he became inflicted.</p>

   <p>with rheumatism, Reverend Zwiardowski came to Chicago to establish St. Stanislaus Kostka's Parish, but his stay in Chicago was short-lived. The climate complicated his rheumatic ills and he was forced to go back to Texas, where the weather was more favorable. The organizer of a Polish parish in San Antonio, Texas, took his place. Since then the work of Father Zwiardowski has taken him to many small towns and villages. He has spent many years among the Indians. Today he is occupied with a work that is very close to his heart: Keeping the Polish people together on American soil," concluded Reverend Barzynski.</p>
   <p>During the Offetorium, Mr. Barwiga, bass, sang "Regina Coeli Laetare." This was the outstanding rendition of the mass services.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the mass, the celebrant said "Te Deum Laudamus" and offered it as thanks to the Almighty for granting him the privilege of reaching his twenty-fifth anniversary as a priest. After the services, the entire church choir wished Reverend Zwiardowski many more years of <span class="page-break">4</span>priesthood.</p>
   <p>Many Polish notables were present at the reception dinner. Rev. V. Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Parish, Mr. Machnikowski, Reverend Domagalski, and Reverend LeGrand gave short talks apropos to the occasion. The latter recited a beautiful poem in French, and later spoke in English. Rev. Felix Zwiardowski thanked the entire assembly for their wonderful reception.</p>
   <p>The editorial staff of the Dziennik Chicagoski wishes to extend their heartfelt congratulations and their hope for continued success in the work being pursued by Rev. F. Zwiardowski. The members of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Parish wish him all the success and happiness in the world.</p>
   <p>"Ad multos annos!"</p>
   <p>We wish to add that Reverend Zwiardowski is the director of missionary work in the western part of Texas. He has helped to establish several <span class="page-break">5</span>parishes, namely, St. Mary's and St. Hedwig's. He became a great benefactor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's School, when he persuaded the superior of the Notre Dame Sisters to supply teachers. This entailed a great deal of work. Several trips were made to Milwaukee before arrangements were completed.</p>
