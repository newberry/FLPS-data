   <p>A week ago, in the Chicago City Club, an annual meeting of the Immigrants Protective League was held. To this league belong also the representatives of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. A dinner was served before the meeting in one of the club's halls.</p>
   <p>After the dinner, the president of the League, citizen Alex A. McCormick, after a short talk, called upon the secretary, Miss S. P.Breckenridge, to read the financial report for the past year. The report showed that the League expends over $14,000 annually for the protection and care of immigrants in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Its funds are gathered from voluntary donations.</p>
   <p>After the secretary, a director, Miss Grace Abbott, read an extensive and interesting report on the activities of the League.</p>
   <p>In her elaborate work, Miss Abbott pointed out in figures how many persons of different nationalities benefited from the services of the League.</p>

   <p>The first place in this regard is held by the Poles, the second by the Jews.</p>
   <p>This report contains much valuable information regarding our Polish immigrants, and it should awaken Polish organizations to become interested in the activities of this League and to begin some sort of action for the purpose of aiding our countrymen who, upon coming to this country, often become the victims of different agents and "chiselers."</p>
   <p>The administrations of our Polish organizations, without exception, ought to send their representatives to the meetings of the League and support its activities as much as possible.</p>
   <p>Polish immigrants, as statistics point out, receive the most benefit from the services of the League. Therefore it is only natural that the Polish nationality should support the activities of the League, and our organizations, which owe their welfare and development mostly to immigrants, can do much in supporting this League.</p>

   <p>In the past year the League took care of 12,000 immigrants of different nationalities in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Union was represented at the meeting by secretary V. S. Konopa.</p>
   <p>The administration of the League is composed by the following: A. A. McCormick, President; Prof. George H. Mead, First Vice-President; Miss Jane Addams; Charles L. Hutchinson, Cashier; Miss S. P. Breckenridge, Secretary; Miss Grace Abbott, Director.</p>
   <p>The office of the League is at 290 S. Michigan Avenue.</p>
