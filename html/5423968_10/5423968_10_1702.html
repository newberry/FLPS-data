   <p>An anti-immigration bill has again appeared on the floor of the House of Representatives. This bill, which is generally known as the Burnett-Dillingham Bill will, if enacted and enforced, prohibit entry into America to anyone who is unable to read and write, at least in his native tongue.</p>
   <p>This bill, which is already well known to the readers of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, is intended to curtail immigration from southern and eastern Europe, where there is a larger proportion of illiterates than in Poland. The bill, however, affects our people also, for not everyone in Poland knows how to read and write. Political conditions in Poland are such that the country is torn into three parts. In addition to having deprived our people of language, religion, and land, our foes have bent every effort to deprive them of education.....</p>
   <p>It is not entirely the fault of our people that they are illiterates; the ones <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to blame are the enemies of Poland, who partitioned our homeland and denied us the chance to acquire a certain amount of education. In the opinion of some of our wise American legislators, illiterate immigrants should not be allowed to enter into this country.</p>
   <p>Now when the dragon of anti-immigration measures raises its head again there is no time to look for the cause. The thing to do is to send letters of protest to responsible people in Washington. It wouldn't be right for our people to neglect this matter. We should not let our indifference give the congressmen an opportunity to say that, since we did not protest, we must regard the anti-immigration measure as satisfactory.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, which is the strongest Polish organization today, does not neglect this matter and is doing everything possible to show in Congress that its members, united in the Alliance and spread over all the Polish colonies in America, do not agree with and protest against the passage of any new anti-immigration laws by the government of this country. America today should open <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>wide her heart and portals, giving refuge to the miserable creatures who will perhaps look for hard labor here after the war.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, therefore, joins all other Polish organizations and groups in this protest. It is estimated that more than four million Poles in America will protest against the proposed anti-immigration bill. This organization calls upon all its branches and affiliated societies to send one protest after another to the representatives and senators of their states. The greater the number of protests, the more thought will the congressmen give to the matter.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to hurry, because time presses. True, this bill, even if it is passed in Congress--and it is very probable that it will be--will not become a law immediately, because it must have the sanction of the President. This bill, however, is opposed to the ideas of our President. The protests, if sent at the proper time, will be proof that millions of voters or future citizens are not in accord with those who try to do us harm for no fault of our own. Let us be prepared today for any future eventuality and let us have sufficient foresight so as <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>not to be too late with our grievances. In short, let us be prepared.</p>
