   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka Young Men's Society has been organized in Bridgeport (St. Mary of Perpetual Help Parish). A motion was made and carried at the last meeting to discontinue the initiation fee for one month. This was done in order to give the Polish youth a better opportunity to join a young men's Polish Roman Catholic organization.</p>
   <p>The Polish youth of Bridgeport should take advantage of this offer. It is to their best interest to become associated with an organization of brotherly love and Roman Catholic principles. Through co-operative work the Polish spirit will be elevated and its enemies will be discouraged. In this respect the "Independents" [independent of Pope] who have started to agitate in this locality will not get a foothold.</p>
