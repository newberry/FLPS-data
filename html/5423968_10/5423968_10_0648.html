   <p>Yesterday we promised to publish the exact text of the resolution adopted last Sunday at a meeting of representatives of societies in St. Adalbert Parish. We are herewith fulfilling our promise. The resolution reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, there appeared last week in various Chicago newspapers--including Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily), Zgoda (Peace), Sztandar (Banner), and Nowe Zycie (New Life)--an article entitled "Protest," dated January 5, 1896, and directed against Mr. C. Bielinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and signed by the officers of the Society to Build Pulaski Hall; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, several days ago the Chicago Record, an American newspaper, also published an article of a similar nature containing falsehoods and insinuations, libeling the members and societies belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the persons who signed this protest published in various Polish newspapers--and specifically mentioned in the article published by the American Chicago Record--represent the officers of the Society to Build Pulaski Hall and have several times called meetings in this hall solely for the purpose of damaging the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, endeavoring to persuade certain societies of the Polish Roman Catholic Union to break away from it, libeling the administration of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and especially its president and secretary, and in general for the purpose of creating dissatisfaction and ill will in the ranks of said Polish Roman Catholic Union;</p>
   <p>"We the undersigned, representatives of the societies belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in meeting assembled in the church hall of St. Adalbert Bishop and Martyr Parish, this twelfth day of January, 1896, solemnly protest against the unprincipled, unjustified, unpatriotic, hostile, and underhanded actions of the representatives of the officers of Pulaski Hall, and declare:</p>
   <p>"1. That at the meeting held in Pulaski Hall on the third day of December, 1895, and called by the officers of the society of this hall, at which the protest published in the Polish newspapers was adopted, and at subsequent meetings at this hall, no person was authorized to represent any society belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; that the article in the Chicago Record is not based on the facts, in that it falsely and intentionally stated that presumably ten societies had been represented at these meetings and that these societies, numbering around 3,500 members, contemplate breaking away from the Polish Union;</p>
   <p>"2. That the mere publication of said article in an American newspaper, or the supplying of the information on which the article was based--the consequences of which must be borne by those persons who had called the meetings and taken part in them--is an act extremely unpatriotic, underhanded, scurrilous, shameful, and concocted for the purpose of discrediting the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and causing it both moral and material damage;</p>
   <p>"3. That all the statements made in said protest, published in the Polish newspapers, were either invented or not based on the true facts and therefore do not in the least justify such a protest; to wit:</p>
   <p>"a. The first article has absolutely no bearing on the matter;</p>
   <p>"b. The second and third articles completely misrepresent the facts when it accuses the president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of causing unrest and dissension in the societies, whereas the unrest and division of opinion are caused by those who call such meetings and prepare such protests;</p>
   <p>"c. The fourth paragraph is an evident falsehood. Mr. Bielinski did not speak at the November patriotic celebration to attack the honor and good name of the stockholders and directors of the Pulaski Hall; he did not say anything against the hall itself. At another occasion, however, he did condemn the misuse of the hall, saying that meetings were allowed for the purpose of propagating the movement of the independent church--the leech of our communities--and causing quarrels and fights;</p>
   <p>"d. In the fifth paragraph the facts are again misrepresented. The reason why Mr. Bielinski is condemning the Pulaski Hall Alliance members is because the latter are supporting the independent church;</p>
   <p>"4. That this traitorous, scheming, damaging, action against the largest and eldest Polish organization in America, by the representatives of the officers of the Pulaski Hall, is condemned by us as anti-Polish, anti-Catholic, deserving the praise of the greatest enemies of our nationality, the A. P. A. (American Protective Association, anti-Catholic), nonbelievers, and Muscovites;</p>
   <p>"5. That no society affiliated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and no true and faithful member of this Polish Union, in the confines of our parish, contemplates resigning from this organization;</p>
   <p>"6. That we are sorry for those deluded and lost members of our Polish Roman Catholic Union, who libel our organization in such a manner in the American and Polish newspapers, and we consider them evil and false members of the Polish Roman Catholic Union;</p>
   <p>"7. That we praise the actions of the present administration of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus with our whole heart, consider it the best possible and with only the best interests of the organization in mind;</p>
   <p>"8. That we particularly consider the unjustly attacked president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union an upright citizen; an energetic, sacrificing, and steadfast defender of our good organization, worthy of the highest honors and praise, bringing glory to our organization, and we congratulate the last convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union for selecting a man well worth all honors and respect to head the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>

   <p>It speaks for itself. [Translator's note: The name Bielinski is spelled Belinski in his advertisement as an attorney in the same issue.]</p>
