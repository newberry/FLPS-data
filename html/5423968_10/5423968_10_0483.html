   <p>The case against the Reverend John Piechowski, unjustly accused or criminal libel, was finally called yesterday by Judge Eldred (of Logan Square), who then gave his decision.</p>
   <p>The charge was dismissed.</p>
   <p>We have already printed a few items about this case. The accuser was a certain Mr. Kowarzyk, an undertaker belonging to the independent sect of the Reverend Anthony Korlowski, who felt insulted by the innocent [Polish] word "Drab" (strong man), which, he alleged, referred to him.</p>
   <p>This case will go no further, and it will not be appealed to the Criminal Court. Those who started the proceedings will themselves be judged.</p>
   <p>In the trial the facts were disclosed, in spite of the objections of Mr. <span class="page-break">2</span>Kowarzyk's attorney, who is the excommunicated priest Kozlonski, and what the purpose of the accusation was.</p>
   <p>Attorney John King, defending the Reverend Father Piechowski, spoke very well. He condemned the entire independent religious movement and showed clearly its sorrowful aim and beginning.</p>
   <p>Further particulars of the trial and a reprint of this speech, full of wisdom and of logic, will be published in tomorrow's paper.</p>
   <p>The trial lasted all afternoon and was finished late at night.</p>
