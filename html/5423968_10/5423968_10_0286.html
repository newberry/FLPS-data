   <p>Solemn consecration of the Polish cemetery "Resurrection" will take place Decoration Day, May 30, at o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Rev. Bishop Muldoon will perform the duty of consecrating the cemetery and will be ably assisted by a Polish and a Slavic priest from Chicago's own parishes. Rev. Father Wojeiech Furnam, administrator of this cemetery, has great hopes that this ceremony will be the best.</p>
   <p>In the name of the cemetery administration, we cordially invite all the Catholic Poles and Slavs of Chicago to take part in this festive consecration.</p>
   <p>Transportation from the city to the Polish cemetery "Resurrection" is very reasonable, it costs only 15 cents one way. Take any car to Archer Avenue and ride the Archer street car to the city limits, then board a Joliet car to Bethany Station, near the new cemetery.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father Sztueke, C. S. C.</p>
