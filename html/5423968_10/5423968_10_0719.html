   <p>The "blessing" of the new schismatic temple by the fallen priest Kolaszewski, who was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church by the Pope, belongs to the past.</p>
   <p>This sacrilegious ceremony was performed last Sunday before an inquisitive and gaping crowd.</p>
   <p>It is with regret that we make note of the fact that besides the fallen group from St. Hedwig Parish, two societies of the Polish National Alliance and a portion of a Polish military organization took part in this farce.</p>
   <p>This served as an excuse for the schismatics to publicize that societies from all Polish parishes of Chicago took part in the parade held prior to the "blessing" ceremony.</p>
   <p>It readily can be said that this is only one of the many lies that have been broadcast through one medium or another.</p>
   <p>We wish to declare:</p>
   <p>That no Polish Roman Catholic society connected with any of the Polish Roman Catholic parishes of Chicago took part in this schismatic comedy;</p>
   <p>That no righteous Roman Catholic priest was present during the "blessing" ceremonies of this scandalous temple.</p>
   <p>That on righteous Polish Roman Catholic parish of Chicago sympathizes with the fallen priest of his associates.</p>
   
   <p>Those who desire evidence in this respect are referred to an article of protest sent in by the Holy Trinity Parish and published in yesterday's issue of the Dziennik Chicagoski [translator's note: see article "Holy Trinity Church Protests Against Independent Church Movement" published in the Dziennik Chicagoski on November 11,<span class="gap">[gap]</span>]. The Holy Trinity parishioners protested against the allegation that sympathy was expressed secretly for the independent church movement.</p>
   <p>As a consequence, the Sunday "blessing" actually burned against the schismatics who attempted to make this affair a triumphant event. Through this affair they have demonstrated their insignificance and weakness. It turned out to be a subject of laughter for the crowd.</p>
   <p>The befuddled group, perhaps, should be convinced that no bishop will consent to take part in the services held in the temple of the independents; that only those priests who have fallen from the true fold and who have been condemned by the bishop, or those individuals who consider themselves priests will take part in the services; that no Polish Roman Catholic priest and no righteous <span class="gap">[gap]</span> parish sympathizes with the charlatans-the false prophets who wish to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the true faith and lead the people from the path of salvation and God.</p>
   <p>This should be sufficient to the befuddled people; it should open their eyes and lead them along the right road.</p>
