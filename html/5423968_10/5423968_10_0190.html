   <p>Yesterday afternoon, in the parish hall of Holy Trinity, the first parliament of the Polish Catholic Federation took place. Only three councils were present; one of these a middle class council.</p>
   <p>The parish of St. Josephus did not send its delegates because at this time the Mission was taking place at this parish. The parish of St. Josephus gave its mandate to Rev. Father K. Sztuczko of the new Holy Trinity parish. The parish of Immaculate Conception of St. Mary from South Chicago was represented by Rev. Father Marciniak, John Wojnowski, Constance Chamska, Frank Tobinski, Bernard Chamski, Andrew Katacinski, Ignatz Bernatowicz and W. Folmer. From the city council of Holy Trinity were the following delegates: Rev. Father Szalewski, John Grzeca, Frank Marchiewicz, Paul Gerlich, Vincent Sztuczko, Sigmund Majewski, S. Rembowski, Miss S. Wozmiak and Miss Agnes Warszewska.</p>
   <p>The parliament started at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when Mr. Rembowski greeted the delegates. Miss Novakowska delivered the monologue and the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>three Kempski sisters and their brother Theodore Kempski composed a quartet that sang many beautiful Polish songs.</p>
   <p>At this parliament, the delegates elected temporary officers to preside over this meeting until the regular election took place. Mr. Wojnowski was elected president and Mr. Marchiewicz, secretary.</p>
   <p>The general election took place as soon as Mr. Wojnowski took his place of honor. As a result of this election, Mr. Grzeca was chosen president while Mr. Chamski was elected secretary. As soon as the meeting was in normal order following the election, it was decided to read to the assembled delegates the letters received from Rev. Bishop Paul Rhode and Rev. Father Truszynski, president of the Executive Committee of the Third Polish Catholic Congress. Below is the summary of each of these two letters:</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Chicago, Nov. 6, 1908.</p>
   <p>To the Polish Catholic Federation in America at the Holy Trinity Parish, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Reverend Fathers and Dear Delegates:</p>
   <p>I regret to inform you all that I am unable to partake in any activities concerning the Federation, for the simple reason that I must leave Chicago. I send my best wishes to all the delegates and officials of this Federation, also my blessings for your great undertaking in behalf of the Polish Federation.</p>
   <p>I received a copy of your constitution and I hope that the delegates accept <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>it at this meeting. Once more as the conclusion to my letter, I bless you in your work.</p>
   <p>Bishop Paul Rhode.</p>
   <p>W. K. K. Sztuczko, C. S. C.</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Third Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>Reverend and Dear Father:</p>
   <p>Although I would enjoy being present at your meeting to take place next Sunday at the Holy Trinity parish hall of the Polish Catholic Federation, I cannot attend because it takes place on a Sunday and it is difficult for me to leave my home on a day of obligation. I cannot be present but my soul will be your guardian for the good of the Federation, and long life in your work. With the officers in charge, I feel sure that they will do their utmost to build up this Federation so that it may stand <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>on its own foundations, for everlasting existence, continuing its work for the good of the Polish people and language. May God bless you.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father K. Truszynski.</p>
   <p>The third letter came from the St. Casimir Council of South Bend; the fourth from Antigo, Wis.; the fifth from Father Smogura from Steubenville, Ohio. Many councils were notified to send delegates to this parliament but very few abided by this request, many did not even send a letter stating why their council was not represented or why their delegates were not chosen.</p>
   <p>In the process of this meeting the discussion was brought up whether to change certain articles in the constitution. Amendments were voted upon.</p>
   <p>We must also inform you people that the committee and executives of this Federation read the constitution two days before this parliament met. Bishop Rhode approved of the constitution.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>After the amendments are passed the constitution of the Polish Catholic Federation in America will in the future consist of federated councils only. It will not accept such organizations as the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, Union of Polish Societies, and the 'Poles in America.' These organizations were invited, but because they could not send their delegates or an acceptable reason, they are off our list. This was recorded in the books upon the request of Bishop Rhode and the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>The following article brought before the delegates was to have the Polish Catholic Congress and the Polish Catholic Federation. Work hand in hand in all business pertaining to the welfare of the Polish people. It was unanimously passed.</p>
   <p>It was voted upon and passed that the smaller councils and parishes be invited to send a delegate to headquarters to find out all the necessary information and then explain it to the council at their regular meeting. All these councils have an allotted time and must be signed up with our <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>executive committee before their time expires. They will not be accepted after the final allotted date. If you councils believe in solidarity, now is the time to prove and show it.</p>
   <p>It is also our pleasure to inform you of the election of the following: Mr. Wojnowski, president; Mr. Tobinski, vice-president; Mr. Marchiewicz, secretary; Mr. Majewski, secretary of finance, and the cashier is to be chosen from the delegates representing St. Josephus parish. Chaplain elected is Rev. Father Mieczyslaw Szlewski. His advisors are Mr. Chamski and Mr. Rembowski. It was voted and passed that the delegates buy a gift for Bishop Rhode, but it would have to be presented at some great Polish affair. A motion was seconded and the parliament came to a close, ending a very successful and happy gathering of delegates.</p>
