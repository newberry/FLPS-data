   <p>Although the weather was perfect last Sunday, it did not have any effect on the attendance of the Sunday-school class in the hall of St. Stanislaus Kostka's School. A large crowd of Polish youth was on hand to hear the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's church, lecture on "The Soul of Man".</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the discourse will be continued by the pastor along the same lines. It is anticipated that a capacity crowd of Polish youth will be present, for the topics of the other speakers are not only interesting but instructive. The school begins promptly at 10 A. M.</p>
