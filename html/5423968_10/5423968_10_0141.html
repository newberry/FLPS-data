   <p>Crossing themselves very piously, the editor of Dziennik Narodowy kissed very reverently the apostolic paw of Mr. Rhode, the First Polish Bishop in America.</p>
   <p>That ended the fight for "principle of the right of the people" conducted by Dziennik Narodowy, and from now on Mr. Rhode is no more a mere 'suffragan' or a 'painted bishop,' a man who didn't know his father, but Right Reverend Bishop Rhode, the First Polish Bishop, with a large capital B, in the United States of North America.</p>
   <p>Bravo, Gentlemen!</p>
