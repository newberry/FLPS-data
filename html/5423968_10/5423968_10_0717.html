   <p>Information has reached us from reliable sources that the so-called "independent" priests of Chicago are planning to hold a series of meetings relative to creating schism among the Poles. This move is more certain now since their new temple in the neighborhood of St. Hedwig Parish has recently been opened and "blessed".</p>
   <p>The first in a series of these meetings will be held this evening at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>Several prominent Poles of this city were invited to take part in this affair by the leaders of this independent church movement. However, they declined.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It must be understood that the purpose of this meeting is to start the spread of this independent idea throughout the world. We wish to caution our compatriots not to attend this or other meetings even out of curiosity.</p>
   <p>It is not the right thing for those that have reviled against God and slandered the Church to lead other people toward the path of evil.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, we caution the leaders of this independent clique not to try the patience of our people who are genuinely religious, because they may consider these approaches unpleasant.</p>
