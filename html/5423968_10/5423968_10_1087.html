   <p>There are very few Polish male religious institutions in America. Of these, there is only one in Chicago--that of the Resurrection Fathers, whose superior is Father Simon Kobrzynski.</p>
   <p>Female Polish religious establishments are far more numerous. They exist beside practically every Polish parochial school, and a detailed list of them will be found below. We need but note here that the education of Polish children in Chicago is principally in the hands of the Felician, Franciscan, Nazarene, and Notre Dame Sisters.</p>

   <p>The Holy Family Polish-Bohemian Orphanage, under the guidance of the Notre Dame Sisters, and the high school for Polish girls, under the guidance of the Nazarene Sisters.</p>
