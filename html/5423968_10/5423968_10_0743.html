   <p>In the Sunday [September 29] edition the Tribune printed the following article:</p>
   <p>"Reverend John Piechowski, Catholic pastor of St. Hedwig Parish, states that he was not present at the last meeting of the St. Joseph Society of his church with a club secretly hidden on his person, nor was he there to create a disturbance. He assures us that he was occupied in the rectory during the time of the meeting and entered the hall after the close of the gathering."</p>
   <p>Thus, the Tribune corrects in part the story about this affair that took place in St. Hedwig Parish on September 26.</p>
   <p>It is a question now whether the two sensational Polish papers, Dziennik <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Polski (Polish Daily) and Nowe Zycie (New Life), which have so eagerly reprinted the false report spread by the Tribune, will follow the Tribune and correct the story of this affair. Apparently they will not do so, as their habit is to lie and not to retract.</p>
