   <p>The Poles of Chicago should always be proud of yesterday's celebration. Its memory should last as long as they live in Chicago, and it should be publicized throughout the country because it brought credit to all Poles.</p>
   <p>The changeable weather of Chicago was rather unfavorable, for it was chilly, cloudy, and gloomy and it tried to snow.</p>
   <p>Delegates from all over the country came to St. Stanislaus Kostka's Parish. Among the delegates were many clergymen and men of distinction. They admired our beautifully decorated buildings and some of them honored us by visiting our office and printing shop. We have learned from the visitors that the celebrations in other cities were also successful.</p>
   <p>In the Morning</p>
   <p>As outlined in the program, there was a solemn memorial service in honor of those who sacrificed their lives for the faith, country, and the principles of the Constitution of the Third of May.</p>
   <p>Afternoon</p>
   <p>The children of St. Stanislaus Kostka's school staged a special celebration in the afternoon. Although it did not draw a large crowd, it was successful. It was a working day; therefore, many parents could not attend and for the same reason the large Polish hall at Bradley Street was not filled. We are of the opinion that it is the duty of parents to see what progress their children are making in the school, about which so much has been written lately.</p>
   
   <p>Have our children made any progress? Yesterday's demonstration is the best proof. Facts speak for themselves.</p>
   <p>The school children's celebration was carried out according to the program. It began with a march played on a piano by the school girls, after which the school girls choir, whose members were dressed in national colors, sang the Polish song "Where the Polish Heart Beats." Then Mr. B. Klarkowski, the teacher spoke to the school children about the Polish Constitution and its importance. After his talk, he introduced little Leon Jozwiak, who in spite of his young age, delivered a beautiful speech, beginning with the words; "God did not grant us the privilege to be in the land where white eagles nest," Little Leon was greatly applauded. Next on the program was a beautiful piano duet entitled "Philomy Brilliant," played by two school girls. This was followed by an athletic exercise by a group of boys. Finally, the time arrived for the "Bouquet of Polish Songs," which was executed by the choirs to the satisfaction of the public.</p>
   <p>Deserving special attention is the beautiful sententious dramatical sketch entitled "Religion and Happiness," staged by senior school girls of St. Stanislaus Kostka's school, in which seven goddesses, namely, Wealth, Art, Wisdom, Beauty, Singing, Music, and Poetry offer their services to a girl of luck, but cannot satisfy her because each of them represents only apparent mundane happiness. Our heroine, however, is seeking absolute happiness, which appears to her in the form of Religion and Faith. The performance was a success for which the young ladies received great applause. The rest of the program was made up of singing and instrumental music. The program was concluded by Reverend V. Barzynski, who spoke of the patriotism of our mothers. He regretted the fact that the number of children in the hall was rather small.</p>
   <p>In the Evening</p>
   <p>The culminating point of yesterday's activities was last night's celebration in English at the large Polish hall, to which, besides the Poles, Americans and Germans were also invited.</p>
   
   <p>Shortly before 8 P.M., the great hall was practically filled. The orchestra played the favored "Bouquet of Polish Songs" as the public filled the remaining seats at the gallery. The knights of the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared in their picturesque uniforms, the school children dressed for the occasion, and the parish choirs stationed themselves at the sides of the hall. The platform was occupied by special guests, the clergy, delegates from societies and high city officials. Reverend Father Szukalski, opened the meeting and introduced Judge Moran as the chairman, who was greeted with deafening applause. The program began with the singing of "O Columbia" by the parish choir conducted by Mr. A. Kwasigroch, after which Judge Moran proceeded to speak.</p>
   <p>Judge Moran's speech was recorded stenographically, but we cannot reproduce it here for lack of space. However, we will point out the most important parts.</p>
   <p>Judge Moran complimented the Poles for commemorating so important and beautiful an event, and then gave a brief outline of the Polish Constitution, describing the circumstances under which it was declared. He said, "Surrounded by foes opposing principles of justice and freedom, the Poles formed and accepted a constitution which brought them immortal fame, for it was an example for all because it dared to declare a lofty principle that an authority comes from the people, and because it gave so much right to the people that the Polish King had less authority than the President of the United States."</p>
   <p>Judge Moran continued, "Poland lives by its history, literature, noble virtues and deeds of great and famous men.</p>
   <p>"You have your heroes, learned men, artists."</p>
   <p>He cited beautiful examples in our history, mentioned Sobieski, Kosciuszko, pointed to their great deeds, and added that wherever there are lovers of freedom, there you find famous Poles, and that the Poles come to the United States to unite with a peace-loving nation, bringing honor to the country. He stated that it was a great honor for him to be chairman at this meeting. He praised our work, our institutions at which our children learn English and Polish, and remarked that we have a tendency to establish a government like that of the United States, that we should accomplish it, and that we have the good will of all. He concluded his speech with complimentary remarks about our gathering, our beautiful hall, and our patriotism.</p>
   <p>His sympathetic speech was frequently interrupted by hearty applause.</p>
   <p>Next attraction was a vocal duet by Mrs. P. Kiolbassa and her daughter Rose, who sang the beautiful "Schubert's Serenade," and for which they were rewarded with tremendous applause and flowers. The duet was a success, in spite of the untimely interruption of the orchestra.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting then introduced the Right Reverend Spaulding, Bishop of Peoria, as one of the best speakers in America and as a distinguished bishop of our country.</p>
   <p>Indeed we had the rare privilege of hearing a great speech delivered by a famous speaker and prince of the Church in America. It was a great honor to hear this silver-tongued orator. His speech revealed that he has a great knowledge of our history; it also disclosed his profound sympathy for our nation; it made us proud of being Poles, and it will be remembered for a long time. He spoke about our great astronomer, Copernicus the priest. He compared the Poles with the Irish, and then proceeded to describe the partition of Poland and its causes, and here he manifested his profound knowledge of Polish history by citing historical facts. He encouraged us to love our wonderful country as well as the adopted one, and added that only the ungrateful forget their native country. Referring to American patriotism, he stated that American Poles are good patriots and also excellent linguists, and disapproved of depriving anyone of his native tongue. We listened to this great church dignitary with great respect, interest, and pride. He received tremendous applause.</p>
   
   <p>After the Bishop's speech, the school children sang "The Star-Spangled Banner," and after that the ladies' choir sang a Polish composition.</p>
   <p>When the choir ceased singing, the chairman introduced Mr. P. Onahan, a former city treasurer, who spoke on the religiousness of the Poles, referring to King Sobieski, who after defeating the Turks, as an exemplary and loving husband, sent the news to his wife in Poland, and as a faithful Catholic sent the captured Turkish flag to the Pope of Rome.</p>
   <p>Special recognition should be given to the choirs and the soloists. We refer to Miss F. Bok, who sang a soprano solo and attracted everyone's attention by her beautiful voice. Jan Kondziorski distinguished himself as a basso.</p>
