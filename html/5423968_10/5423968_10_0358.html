   <p>The Saint Hedwig Parish Committee has recently paid a part of the debt of the church. Reverend John Piechowski, pastor, managed to collect three thousand dollars for this payment.</p>
   <p>The condition of the parish would have been much better, had it not been for the unfortunate misunderstandings we have had here for some time. However, things are changing and there is hope that under the thrifty management of the present pastor the parish debt will be completely wiped out within a few years. The debt at present is $40,000.</p>
