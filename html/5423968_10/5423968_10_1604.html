   <p>In the nineteenth century, America outstretched her arms hospitably to receive the oppressed peoples of the world. In the United States, anyone could find a new fatherland and the right to call himself an American. Alas, with the passing of time, this has changed a great deal. According to the present conception relative to the future of this country, immigrants of every race must pattern themselves after the Anglo-Saxons. But this is not all. Along with this, they are to safeguard the Anglo-Saxon religion, moral code, and traditions. The Puritans [Siegfried writes "purists"], posted as sentinels along all the roads leading to the future, have ceased to be <span class="page-break">2</span>brothers to the oppressed. At present they contend that the United States should no longer be considered as a republic or a country belonging to everyone, that it belongs only to those who were born here. This is the latest theory, but in practice the way had long been prepared for it by the people themselves.</p>
   <p>As in the past, so in the present, the Anglo-Saxon Protestants consider themselves an aristocracy endowed with special privileges. Consequently, there has never been complete moral and social equality among the citizenry, despite the fact that the Constitution of the United States very solemnly affirms it. Some publicists have even evolved two categories of citizens--native-born and naturalized. The one-hundred-per-cent American looks upon the immigrant with suspicion and distrust, for the immigrant speaks either in broken English or in his mother tongue. This one-hundred-per-cent American is proud not only of his birth but of his standard of living. He presumptuously considers his morals so far superior to those of others that he dares, as a prominent Klansman put it, to "look God straight in the face."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In reality, this attitude toward foreigners is not to be wondered at, if one considers that during the past century Europe has not sent the best of her citizens to America. To the American child an Italian is a peddler, a Greek a bootblack or cheap restaurant-keeper, a Frenchman a low-class barber, and a Pole an industrious ox. It never occurs to the child that there are people in Italy, Greece, France, and Poland who possess a culture far above that of many an American gentleman. Educated and prosperous parents send their children to Europe to correct their distorted picture of the Europeans. However, those who have never journeyed abroad retain their limited American perspective. In the long run they consider the Europeans a people without morals, ignorant degenerates coming from communities where the most primitive hygienic conditions prevail, potential anarchists and revolutionists likely to die of hunger. This creates the impression that certain Americans exaggerate anything having to do with Europe or the Europeans; and a closer and deeper study reveals this to be indeed the case.</p>
   <p>As a result of this attitude the immigrant is discriminated against; justice <span class="page-break">4</span>differentiates between him and the one-hundred-per-cent American. It can be stated openly that an American judge, even one not suspected in the least of dishonesty, tends to favor the one-hundred-per-cent American witness over the immigrant. In doubtful cases, he will decide against the Greek, the Italian or the Pole, not to mention the negro.</p>
   <p>Racial differences arise daily in American society, especially in private affairs. Many clubs and societies protect themselves in every way possible against the entrance of naturalized or alien individuals, or persons of another race. This is particularly true of the one-hundred-per-cent American home, from which the foreigner is barred because he is considered a social pariah.</p>
   <p>This attitude of self-satisfaction on the part of the one-hundred-per-cent Americans, as well as their opinion that the morals of the rest of the world are lower than theirs, did not develop out of ill will, for the Americans are hospitable. The reason for this attitude is that they cannot understand why <span class="page-break">5</span>others do not follow their way of thinking, or do as they do. They believe that the superiority of their civilization is so complete and obvious that any denial or doubt of it is like denying the existence of the sun.</p>
   <p>The attitude of such Americans may be summarized as follows: [Editor's note: The following passage is translated from "The Ku Klux Klan Interpreted," by F. Bohn, American Journal of Sociology, January, 1925.]</p>
   <p>"We are the greatest people on earth. Our government is the best. In religious belief and practice we (the Protestants) are exactly right, and we are the best fighters in the world. As a people we are the wisest, politically the most free, and socially the most developed. Other nations may fail and fall; we are safe. Our history is a narrative of the triumph of righteousness among the people. We see these forces working through every generation of our glorious past. Our future growth and success is as certain as the rule of mathematics. Providence is always on our side. The only war we Americans ever lest was when one third of us was defeated by the other two thirds. We have <span class="page-break">6</span>been divinely selected in order to save and purify the world through our example. If other nations will only accept our religious and political principles, and our general attitude toward life, they soon will be, no doubt, as happy and prosperous as we."</p>
   <p>Their idea of Americanization, therefore, cannot be other than a demand for the adoption, by immigrants, of Anglo-Saxon moral, social, and religious principles. There was a time, at the close of the last century, when these one-hundred-per-cent Americans were convinced that the Latin and Slavic immigrants would change their culture and become assimilated. At that time, of course, they did not give a thought to any possible modification of their own culture. Their only idea was to melt all races and all cultures, into one race and one culture--the Anglo-Saxon. When they began to see that a new American society was developing contrary to their ideals, that is, out of the mixture of different races and without the complete extermination of their separate racial and national characteristics, it is not strange that their attitude toward the immigrants changed to one of hostility.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Thanks to the early kindness of the one-hundred-per-cent-Americans, a certain number of the newcomers were already established here. These newcomers soon began to infect them with a different world outlook, foreign to the Protestant American spirit. Later, greater numbers of immigrants came into the country and began to work more energetically against the Nordic theory, which regards an immigrant as an inferior. The immigrants were opposed to this, because they wanted to become Americans as sincerely as the early comers, who now are proud of having been born in this country.</p>
   <p>It is evident that, as a result of this, Americanization was being carried out in a different way than had been planned by the "assimilationists". Instead of the digestion of all the races by one privileged race, the socalled American melting pot arose, in which all the races are being melted with the hope of obtaining from this mixture the future American, who today is still unknown and whose identity is still uncertain. Mention has been made before of this melting pot and the difficulties encountered in melting the races. At present, emphasis is placed upon the fact that the Catholics sincerely believe <span class="page-break">8</span>that their religion will not in the least interfere with their becoming good Americans. Those who share this outlook demand the full co-operation of all the races in building the America of the future.</p>
   <p>This demand ought to be heeded, for it has many followers in the various strata of society. Multitudes of immigrants came into this country in the hope of finding freedom on a new continent. They desired a rebirth of the spirit and were willing to pay for this regeneration by establishing a permanent residence, with a deep conviction that they were contributing to the creation of a new country, a new nation. Their hearts were overflowing with gratitude and admiration for their adopted country, and their faith created a strong cohesion among the various national groups. Now that they are being told that the true American is the Protestant who was born here of Puritan parents, and that only those of this origin have the right to be called the founders and builders of this country, the recent immigrants have opened their eyes. They can no longer recognize in real life the ideals of which they had dreamed.</p>
