   <p>On Sunday, November 18, a mass meeting was held by the St. Adalbert parishioners at 5 P.M. to show their feeling of respect for their pastor and their trust in him and to voice a protest against the leaders who have tried to cause a schism in the parish.</p>
   <p>The parish auditorium was filled to the galleries. On the stage were Reverend John Radziejewski, pastor of St. Adalbert Parish, and his assistants, and Reverends Adolph Nowicki and John Kasprzycki. Besides the administrative body of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, which was fully represented, Modest Maryanski and J. B. McAvoy were also present.</p>
   <p>At 5:30 P.M. the meeting was opened with a prayer by Reverend Radziejewski, after which F. Czerwinski was appointed chairman. Mr. Czerwinski called upon Leon J. Schultz to act as recording secretary, and then invited Mr. Maryanski to take the speaker's stand.</p>

   <p>Mr. Maryanski greeted the audience in an old fashioned Polish style: "Praised be the Lord, Jesus Christ," and then went on to speak about the Poles abroad and their churches. He recalled to the audience that those across the seas have their own churches, cemeteries, crosses, and regal graves at Wawel and Czestechowa. All this, and the people too, withstood the onslaught of the Swedes and delivered Poland, thanks to the Knights of Holy Faith garbed in the habits of monks.</p>
   <p>Mr. Maryanski recalled to the attention of the assembly the moment when the people were leaving their native country amid woeful tears, when they were bidding adieu to the graves of their forefathers and parents, when they promised the local priests that when they reached the free land of Washington they would abide by the faith of their fathers and raise their children accordingly.</p>
   <p>"Today the time has come," continued Mr. Maryanski," to show whether we have broken this vow that was laid down at our baptism and which we have maintained, <span class="page-break">3</span>and promised to maintain at our departure. For a situation has arisen in which we must show whether this vow has been broken and whether we have followed the corruptors at the expense of our souls. But this is not all for, by falling away, we also add shame to the Polish name in America."</p>
   <p>The speaker also urged the entire group to show their unity, endurance, and love. He concluded his speech by saying: "In our present situation it would be criminal to sever our religious and national solidarity. It would not be right to say that by defending our nationality we defend our religion. But it can safely be said that by defending our religion we also defend our nationality, for our nationality grew and developed upon the rock of St. Peter, upon Catholic,christian soil. Thus it was bred and thus it will remain."</p>
   <p>Casimir Bielinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, was the next speaker. He spoke with great fervor. Carried away by his own enthusiasm, he presented the entire current of agitation as a damnable intrigue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The true character of Rademacher and his associates was presented by Mr. Bielinski in his discussion. He stated that this clique is only interested in the dollar. When a righteous Catholic priest leaves one parish he easily finds a place and livelihood in another; on the other hand, if a person without honor and faith, like the independent and schismatic priests, once loses his position, he is always beset with poverty and hunger. That is why they try to agitate the people because they wish to open new fields for their future.... for their existence. But at whose expense? None other than those that they have misled.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bielinski further enlightened the audience about the false assertions of Rademacher, who, as a Catholic bishop, involved the Polish parishes and schools in debt for the sole purpose of sending money to Ireland to help the Irish cause. He asked for the removal of this mask of falsehood, stating that, as in Cleveland and Milwaukee, so in other cities, German bishops have charge of the diocese, but they would never think of committing a transgression such as has been committed by these ex-priests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>After Mr. Bielinski, an Irishman, J. B. McAvoy, spoke to the audience in English. He urged the Poles to band together under the banner, "Faith and the Fatherland", just as the Irish do. Mr. McAvoy also mentioned that even in politics the Irish made no mistake whenever they followed the leadership of their priests. In conclusion he read the resolution, which was adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>The last speaker of the evening was the Reverend Adolph Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael Parish. It is impossible to include his speech in its entirety because of lack of space. However we will give the highlights.</p>
   <p>He gave a resume of what the previous speakers had said and then explained the relations of the bishop to our schools and churches. He said that a bishop is not, as the papers say he is, the owner of these institutions; that he acts only as a trustee or guardian.</p>
   <p>The audience was stirred by all the speakers, particularly when the local <span class="page-break">6</span>pastor, the Reverend John Radziejewski,read the protest and resolutions in Polish and asked the people whether they accepted the document. Not one voice in the crowded auditorium was heard in opposition.</p>
   <p>Elevated and comforted spiritually, the people went away satisfied and convinced that the staging of like meetings throughout all parishes would be advantageous to all Polish people, because they would enlighten them and guard them against the agitators. And in this way a staunch barrier would be built against the violence and underground manipulation of anarchism, which is disguised by the mask of patriotism.</p>
   <p>The protest reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"On November 12 a sad incident occurred at St. Adalbert Parish. A group of persons, actuated by a deep and blind hatred against the Roman Catholic Church, called a local meeting at Pulaski Hall and invited three excommunicated priests, <span class="page-break">7</span>namely, Kolaszewski, alias Rademacher, Kaminski, and Kozlowski, to attack the Polish Roman Catholic members of this locality, and at the same time to spread the scourge of schism.</p>
   <p>"In view of this fact, we, the members of St. Adalbert Parish, have gathered at the school hall on November 17 and wish solemnly to announce the following protest:</p>
   <p>"In the first instance, we consider those ex-priests, who have given impetus to this diabolical work, renegades and deserters of our faith.</p>
   <p>"In the second instance, we consider this schismatic movement to be influenced by anarchism and condemn it as such, and brand it as criminal, because it is a movement the purpose of which is to divide our society.</p>
   <p>"In the third instance, we declare, as faithful and firm believers in the faith of our forefathers, that we will continue to adhere firmly to the principles handed down by St. Peter, and that nothing will deter us from our obedience to our bishops and our attachment to our pastors."</p>
