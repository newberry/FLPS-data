   <p>Renewed action against our people is in progress in the capital of the United States.</p>
   <p>American chauvinists are now working with more determination than ever to deny entrance into the United States to honest and healthy people whose only fault is not to know how to read and write.</p>
   <p>Among the illiterates thus affected are many of our own compatriots who, because of the ban placed upon education by the partitioners of Poland, were unable to learn even the rudiments of reading and writing. These people, who, though illiterate, are honest and sincere, are denied entry into this free country, while, on the other hand, the portals are open to every type of criminal and suspicious characters.</p>
   <p>Our heroes have shed their blood for this country. Polish immigrants have contributed enormously to the development of this nation. We therefore have a right and a just reason to protest against the placing of restrictions on an immigration which is a blessing to the United States.</p>
   <p>The measures designed to being about these restrictions were vetoed once by former President Taft. Despite this, the enemies of immigration are not idle and are new exerting every effort to have this unjust law passed. Their influence is great and they have already prevailed upon the United States Senate to pass this unjust and harmful measure.</p>
   <p>At present, this measure is under debate in the Lower House of Congress and has every possibility of passing. We should, therefore, exert all our efforts, use all our influence, and leave no stone unturned to prevent the passage of this bill.</p>
   <p>Let us flood all the congressmen with our protests. Let us stand in defense of the oppressed, and we will not only fulfill our duty but also prove that we know how to defend ourselves against the snares of the chauvinists.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the name of justice and of our brethren who are oppressed everywhere, in behalf of the poor and wandering who desire to work for the necessities of life in a free country, we request the presidents and secretaries of all Polish societies to forward the enclosed protest to the congressmen in their districts.</p>
   <p>We request that this protest be forwarded immediately after it is received as the slightest delay is liable to harm the good cause.</p>
   <p>We speak in behalf of all the Polish organizations that have combined into the Polish Immigrants Protective League, for the purpose of combating this unjust measure.</p>
   <p>Besides these protests, a delegation will soon be sent to Washington. It will be composed of representatives of the Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union, Polish Alma Mater, Polish Women's Alliance, and other Polish organizations, to protest verbally and personally against enactment of this unjust measure.</p>
   <p>Hoping that you, gentlemen and fellow-compatriots, will fulfill this obligation and thus prove that you stand in defense of laws justly due our people and are opposed to limitation of immigration, we wish to remain,</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Rt. Reverend Bishop Paul Rhode.</p>
   <p>K. Zychlinski, President of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>P. S. Presidents and secretaries are requested to sign and affix the seal of their societies to the enclosed protest, sending it immediately to the congressman in their districts. If the address of the congressman of the district is unknown, it can be obtained by asking any prominent citizen of the locality. Immediate haste is urged.</p>
