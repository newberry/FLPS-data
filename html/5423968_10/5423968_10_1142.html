   <p>Our Polish-American Journalism is again besmirched by the appearance of a new weekly paper "dedicated," as it avers, "to the spread of liberal ideals". This Journal describes its program as follows:</p>
   <p>"The task of the Polish Journal published here is to prepare its readers for independent thinking".</p>
   <p>Hence, as this weekly states in another place, it desires that the people shall learn to think; that they shall not be subject to the influence of the views of others but draw their own conclusion about everything. But how does this weekly wish to undertake this? Thus, it avers:</p>
   <p>"We believe that it is the duty of an organ dedicated to the Polish population <span class="page-break">2</span>of the United States to persuade the public to adopt those principles which are in spirit professed by the organ itself."</p>
   <p>So its duty is to influence public opinion, so that an independent public opinion may be developed, not subject to any influence! Logical and beautiful; there is nothing more to be said.</p>
   <p>We read farther on in the same articles:</p>
   <p>"What has the Polish press in America accomplished in this respect? We are compelled openly to admit, though exposed to various attacks, that with one splendid exception, the popular and sincere journal Nowe Zycie (New Life) and also, to some extent in recent times, the Echo, there is no Polish paper of which one issue would satisfy the demands made by us in the above paragraph. Nearly all the rest of our Polish journals spread and propagate religious fanaticism, already deeply rooted in our people, we regret to say. They <span class="page-break">3</span>awaken racial passions, and standing on the ground of a falsely conceived patriotism, they talk the people into believing that only he is a Pole who complies blindly to prejudices of every type, who fears progress, who scorns enlightenment and tolerance."</p>
   <p>He who read a short article in our Dziennik Chicagoski of last Friday, entitled "Age-Old Conceptions," and properly understood the satire contained therein, will find an epitome in a few of the above words of the often comical allegations made against us and collected by us in this article.</p>
   <p>We always encounter the charge that Catholic periodicals are opposed to "progress and enlightenment". Whence this charge?</p>
   <p>Did any Catholic periodical ever proclaim: Do not learn, do not enlighten; for your welfare and salvation depend on darkness? No; on the contrary, every truly Catholic periodical attempts to spread enlightenment as much as possible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Catholic papers do not limit themselves to matters pertinent to faith and morals; every truly good Catholic periodical endeavors to develop a clear conception of the various branches of education, in matters of foreign and national politics, and in all kinds of general knowledge.</p>
   <p>These periodicals also take great pains about the moral elevation of the people in every manner. We know very well that our emigrants, principally members of the laboring class of Europe, were essentially very little enlightened; but they have made such extraordinary progress in enlightenment here in the last few years and have advanced so much in education that it must fill with astonishment nearly every unbiased person. Citizens have been made out of Polish peasants who take part in the government of the nation and occupy numerous posts in it. And to whom do they ascribe this? Perhaps to these "liberals"? This pestilence has but recently appeared among us. Our Polish-American citizens are essentially indebted for their enlightenment and progress first to those who toil with self-denial, the priests, and next to the Polish Catholic press.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Let us compare the situation of our poor immigrants in the mines of Pennsylvania with the status of the immigrants in cities like Chicago. There one sees veritable darkness, slavery, bestial instincts, the lack of any education; here, the life of a free citizen of the United States. Compare even the conditions in New York with those existing in Chicago. There one finds numerous "liberals," freethinkers, so-called progressives; here in Chicago there are settlements around the parish churches. Except for that, they would suffer the misery which Poles suffer in New York, a life with no tomorrow, a lack of any principles, no participation in politics, and the empty vociferations [of agitators]; but the fact is that here we have wealth, rows of buildings and other real estate belonging to Poles, a live participation in political affairs, an ever increasing knowledge of political life, strong and powerful associations, and the respect of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Evidently progress and enlightenment reign here--there, retrogression and idle talk. What unbiased person will not acknowledge this?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Yet these small gentlemen rave that they wish to teach progress and enlightenment! Evidently they understand something else under these terms than education in the various branches of knowledge, or participation in public life, or mutual moral support and a safe existence on the basis of this enlightenment. Yes; by "progress and enlightenment" they mean something else. They themselves openly define it. By these terms they mean "liberation from every type of prejudice," or in plain words loss of faith. Of what can they accuse religion if they themselves are already so unfortunate as not to profess it? Does religion propagate immorality? Does it teach what the majority of them teach, the breaking of family ties and the commission of one act of madness after another, later to short one's self and miss, finally deriving some benefit of [such attempted] suicide by gaining renown and acclaim for being a martyr to one's principles?</p>
   <p>Does religion, truly and sincerely professed, bring calamity upon any one?</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Certainly not. In reality [these liberals] cannot forgive this "religious fanaticism" because it does not make other people like them, because it establishes family ties, because it elevates and spreads true morality and not an empty-mouthed civilization.</p>
   <p>Show us this progress of yours; indicate how you gain in importance and in respect among others, in peace, in success, in a life worth living! Thank God, you will not mislead many as long as facts throw back your lies in your face.</p>
   <p>You charge religion with intolerance. Yes, a truly religious person does not tolerate that which stands in contradiction to religion. He does not tolerate crime; he does not tolerate transgression; he does not tolerate anything that is opposed to the teaching of experience and faith. Could it be otherwise? As long as I acknowledge the principles of goodness and truth, of the sacredness of family ties, can I give any assurance to my child or to my friend or to my brother that those who do not maintain their family ties are doing well?</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>If I believe that God, while most beneficent, is also most just and will punish me for my sins and reward me for my good deeds, can I at the same time instruct a student under my care that those who state the contrary are also justifiable? In this respect Catholic periodicals must be intolerant.</p>
   <p>And you, progressives, are you more tolerant? By declaring war on this so-called "religious fanaticism," do you respect the convictions of others? By accrediting to yourself "the duty of influencing public opinion" are you governed by tolerance? Whence do you come? Who sent you? Where did you acquire knowledge to teach others? Of what progress and enlightenment and civilization are you the product that you should exalt yourselves before others as teachers? Or does your light come of yourselves! Satan, thy name is vanity!</p>
