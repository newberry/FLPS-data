   <p>Day before yesterday the installation of the new officers of the Girls for Girls Club took place at the Polish Women's Alliance Building. Several score members sat down to a modest tea in order to participate in the discussion of important matters.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Miss Emily Napieralski, the club's president, who described briefly the purpose and aim of the club.</p>
   <p>The Girls for Girls Club has given visible proof of its patriotism and lofty aims by the fact that in less than two years the members have collected several thousand dollars for relief of Polish girls, victims of the present war.</p>
   <p>The club is developing well despite many obstacles, and if it continues to develop along its present lines it will one day become a powerful organization <span class="page-break">\2</span>which will unite all the Polish girls in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The program of the little social consisted of the following numbers:</p>
   <p>1. Vocal duet by Misses K. Idzikowski and W. Ankowski.</p>
   <p>2. Recitation, "Powrot Zolnierza" (Return of the Soldier), by Miss A. Nowakowski. Monologue, "Rozia Idzie za Maz" (Rosie Gets Married), for an encore.</p>
   <p>3. Piano solo by Miss Flora Rupinski.</p>
   <p>4. Mandolin solo by Miss Elizabeth Syrek.</p>
   <p>5. Vocal solo, Polish nursery rhyme, by Miss H. Baranowski.</p>
   <p>6. Vocal solo, "Talisman," by Miss W. Ankowski.</p>
   <p>7. Vocal solo, "Ach te Oczy" (Oh Those Eyes), by Miss Lutkowski.</p>
   <p>8. Piano solo by Miss Kolakowski.</p>
   <p>The numbers on the program were excellently performed and were well liked <span class="page-break">\3</span>by the audience.</p>
   <p>Various gifts contributed for the occasion were then raffled off.</p>
   <p>The pillow with a white eagle contributed by Miss Goslinowski was won by number 151--Miss E. Krozowski, 109 West Superior Street.</p>
   <p>An oil painting contributed by Mr. N. Czarnowski was won by number 430--Miss L. Mitrenga of 460 West Erie Street.</p>
   <p>Picture of a white eagle, contributed by Miss Goslinowski in a frame hand-carved by Mr. Kulesza, was won by number 809--Mr. S. Konieczny of 1414 West Division Street.</p>
   <p>All the lucky winners should call at the office of Miss Emily Napieralski, president of the Girls for Girls Club, 1309 North Ashland Avenue, for their prizes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>After all the business was finished the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>As has already been announced, the Girls for Girls Club is having a dance on Wednesday, February 14, 1917, at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall, to which it cordially invites the general public.</p>
   <p>The proceeds are destined for relief for girls in war-torn Poland.</p>
