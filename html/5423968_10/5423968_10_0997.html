   <p>Yesterday was a very solemn day at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>The Most Reverend Archbishop Feehan came to the parish for the purpose of administering the Sacrament of the Confirmation to hundreds of the faithful of both sexes.</p>
   <p>All church societies gathered in the church yard and on Noble Street at 2 P.M. At about 2:30 P.M. they marched toward North Avenue to meet the Archbishop. The procession was headed by Nowicki's Orchestra, which was followed by the Polish Cavalry Society, then the Cadets and the Knight societies--namely, the Uhlans, the Guard of the Queen of Poland, and St. Martin's Knights--and after these came the rest of the societies.</p>
   <p>The Archbishop was greeted at the Elston Avenue bridge and escorted to the <span class="page-break">2</span>church. The Archbishop arrived in a carriage, and was accompanied by the Reverend Piechowski.</p>
   <p>In a short time the Archbishop entered the church, and began the holy ceremony. More than six hundred persons received the Sacrament of Confirmation. The Archbishop was assisted by Reverend V. Barzynski, Reverend S. Nawrocki, Reverend E. Siedlaczek, and Reverend T. Szypkowski.</p>
   <p>The Archbishop delivered two short addresses, one before the ceremony and the other after it. The choir sang a number of religious songs during the ceremony. The confirmation ceremony ended at about 6 P.M. The societies then escorted the Archbishop to the rectory.</p>
