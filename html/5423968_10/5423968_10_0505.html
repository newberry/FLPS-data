   <p>In certain local papers there have been articles and insinuations, claiming previous knowledge, that the Polish Catholic Congress in America, on account of some outside interference, cannot be held, and has been cancelled.</p>
   <p>We consider it proper and just to deny these rumors absolutely. In spite of the troubles encountered, the congress has every reason for success. Nobody stands in its way. On the contrary, everybody wishes it success--knowing full well the necessity of holding such a congress.</p>
   <p>Differences of opinion as to the manner in which the congress is to be held, if they do exist, will be settled through mutual understanding and compromise. Everything will be all right. Our Poles in the West have shown less interest in the congress than those in the East, but no doubt the former group will soon awaken and begin working, so that a congress may be held. The enemies of the Catholic faith need not be so happy too soon.</p>
