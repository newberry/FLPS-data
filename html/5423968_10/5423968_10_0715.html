   <p>Yesterday, November 12, a meeting was staged by the leaders of the "Independent Church" movement at Pulaski Hall. These "Independents" were those who had fallen from the ranks of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this gathering was to lead our people astray; because of certain conditions this attempt was a failure.</p>
   <p>Only a comparative few have seriously considered joining this reactionary group. We severely condemn these few for taking this step.</p>
   <p>Mr. [?] Zychlinski opened the meeting and Mr. [?] Stefanowicz was appointed chairman, while the former was made recording secretary.</p>

   <p>Rademacher, Kozlowski and Kaminski spoke at the meeting. They all cast the worst kind of reflections upon the authorities of the Church [Roman Catholic] and the servants of God.</p>
   <p>Consequently a meeting was held by the undersigned and others that same evening to voice our protest against this godless meeting, against the blasphemous assertions made at the meeting and against the slander and insinuations cast upon the priests and the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
