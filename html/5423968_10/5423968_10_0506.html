   <p>"The forty-hour devotion--April 21-23--has never before been so solemnly celebrated in our Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Parish as it was this year.</p>
   <p>"All credit is due to the pastor, Reverend [Frances] Wojtalewicz, who bent every effort to give his parishioners an opportunity to receive the greatest possible spiritual benefits.</p>
   <p>"The Pastor was assisted by the following priests: U. Raszkiewicz, from Otis, Indiana; F.X.Lange, Stanislaus Nawrocki, Paul Rhode, F. Raczynski, K. Truszynski, M. Krawezunas, F. X. Kroll, Albert Furman, all from Chicago; John Szukalski and Anthony Pradzynski, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin; E. Wrobel, from Michigan City, Indiana; K. Kobylinski, from Hammond, Indiana; F. M. Chodniewicz, from Downers Grove, Illinois; John Kubacki, from North Judson, Indiana; P. J. Rosch, from South Chicago.</p>
   <p>"In addition, Reverend U. Stanowski from Saint Louis, Missouri, who was passing through Chicago, very kindly consented to help also.</p>
   <p>"May God reward you a hundredfold, Dear Reverend Fathers, for the troubles you undertook to save our souls.</p>
   <p>A Parishioner."</p>
