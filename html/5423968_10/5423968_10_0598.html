   <p>We have received the following correspondence, with a request that we publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"The Holy Trinity Society of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, at its meeting held Monday, February 17, decided to take part in the proposed Congress of Polish Catholics in America.</p>
   <p>"John Kortas, president,</p>
   <p>"Thomas Krolik, secretary."</p>
   <p>Further, in the last issue of Wiara I Ojczyzna (Faith and Fatherland) we read as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"South Bend, Feb. 16, 1896.</p>
   <p>"The St. Stanislaus Kostka Society, at its last meeting, decided to support heartily the proposed Congress of Polish Catholics in America, and unanimously agreed to send two delegates to it as soon as it is called.</p>
   <p>"Peter Bielecki, secretary".</p>
   <p>A similar announcement is made by the Sacred Heart Benevolent Society of Town of Lake (Chicago).Mr. Bernard Maza, secretary of the Society, says:</p>
   <p>"Our Society considered it necessary to defend Christian truths, and to condemn those enemies who 'like roaring lions, seek whom they may devour,' and endeavor to sow the seeds of discontent and hatred among Catholics."</p>
   <p>Finally, in the same issue of Wiara I Ojczyzna, Pastor Lange (in Lake View) announces that St. Josaphat's Parish considers the Polish Catholic Congress very necessary, and will take part in it.</p>
