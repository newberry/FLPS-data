   <p>The Smith-Burnett Anti-immigration Bill, prohibiting entry into the United States to all those unable to read and write, was killed. It will not come before Congress for discussion during this session. This bill passed in both houses by a considerable majority when a vote was taken on it, but President Wilson vetoed the proposed enactment because of the ban placed upon the entry of illiterates. It is necessary to obtain the votes of two thirds of all congress men to override the President's veto. This vote the supporters of the bill failed to receive, and on February 4, 1915, the President's veto was sustained, although by a very narrow margin of votes. This bill was killed and the President's veto was sustained by only five votes. Two hundred and sixty-one congressmen voted in favor of the bill, and one hundred and thirty-six cast their ballots against it. There was not, therefore, the required two-thirds vote, the President was victorious, and the chauvinists suffered a defeat.</p>
   
   <p>Congressman Burnett, the creator of this bill, is enraged no end over the outcome. He threatens to present the bill again at the next Congress. It is still uncertain, however, whether this confirmed and avowed chauvinist will be reelected.</p>
   <p>The following congressmen from the state of Illinois voted to sustain the President's veto: Gallagher, Gorman, McAndrews, Sabath, Stone, Springer, Williams--Democrats; Britten, Madden, Mann--Republicans; Copley--Progressive.</p>
   <p>The following congressmen from Illinois voted against the President's veto: Baltz, Buchanan, Borchers, Fitz, Henry, Foster, Fowler, Hill, O'Hair, Rainey, Tavenner--Democrats; McKenzie, Hinebaugh--Republicans; Thompson--Progressive. Hoxworth was absent during the vote.</p>
   <p>It is worthwhile to remember the names of these people so that we can properly reward them at the next elections. Let the Poles pay them as they deserve....</p>
   <p>A heated debate over this contemptible bill, and particularly over the President's veto, lasted for five hours. Both sides argued in order to gain followers, and sharp words were exchanged. Congressman Burnett, a Democrat, and Gardiner, a Republican, conducted a vicious tirade in behalf of the bill; the opposition was led by Sabath and Moore, Democrats.</p>
   <p>Congressman Albert Johnson, of the state of Washington, demanded that this country's boundaries be completely closed to immigrants until the unemployed in the United States find work with adequate remuneration for themselves, and until conditions become better, This motion, however, failed.</p>
