   <p>From the newly published Hoffman's Catholic Directory For 1896, of the Chicago Archdiocese, we have obtained the following particulars about Polish parishes and the priests assigned to them.</p>

   <p>The number of children attending the Polish Parochial Schools according to the directory is as follows:</p>
   <p>At St. Adalbert: 975; at St. Peter and Paul: 50; at St. Casimir: 208; at St. Hedwig: 761; at Holy Trinity: 437; at St. Hyacinth: 80; at St. John Cantius: 628; at St. Josephat: 524; at St. Joseph: 483; in Cicero: 70; at the Holy Mary of Perpetual Help school: 805; at St. Michael in South Chicago: 740; at St. Stanislaus Kostka: 3,550; at the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (South Chicago): 600; in Sobieski: 50; in Lemont: 282; in Joliet: 92.</p>
   <p>We are publishing these figures just as they are printed in the directory, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>but, at the same time, we wish to state that they seem to us quite low. In all probability, the number of Polish school children attending the Polish parochial schools in Chicago is considerably greater. We ask the reverend pastors to notify us of any mistakes in the list; we will gladly publish the correct figures.</p>
