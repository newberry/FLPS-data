   <p>The Poles in South Chicago, especially those in the neighborhood of St. Michael's Parish, last Sunday celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of St. Michael Archangel's Parish.</p>
   <p>The anniversary celebration was begun with church services at 10:30 A.M. in the presence of many clergymen in the beautifully decorated church. His Excellency Bishop Paul P. Rhode celebrated the Pontifical Mass assisted by Reverend Ostrowski, rector of St. Josephat's Parish, as deacon, and Reverend John Grembowicz, former pupil of our parish, as assistant deacon. Reverend Francis Wojtalewicz was the archpresbyter. The sermon, appropriate to the occasion, was delivered by Reverend L. W. Grudzinski. During the Mass the parish choir, through the efforts of the local organist, Prof. K. Kowalski, sang very well.</p>
   <p>The morning celebration was a sort of introduction to the evening exercises <span class="page-break">2</span>prepared by the school children and the parish choir, held at the parish hall and arranged by the Sisters of Nazareth.</p>
   <p>The carefully prepared program consisted of eleven numbers, all of which, with out a single exception, were excellently performed.</p>
   <p>The well-known orchestra of the Urbanek Brothers played a medley of Polish tunes. This was followed by a short address by Reverend John Lange. Next the school children sang and were enthusiastically applauded. This was followed by twenty-five boys who, with little verses, represented the history of St. Michael Archangel's Parish. Following the solo performance of Carol Singer, a member of the orchestra, girls from the middle grades danced "Silver Bells" in gay costumes. The storm of applause lasting several minutes forced the girls to reappear.</p>
   <p>Now came the seventh and most important number of the program, an address by Bishop Rhode. The bishop, in a truly fatherly manner, reminded us of those <span class="page-break">3</span>happy and unforgettable years when the croaking of frogs could be heard in the neighborhood, when there was water all around, when everyone worked for the good of the church and the parish.....</p>
   <p>Following Bishop Rhode's address, the local choir under the direction of Professor Kowalski sang Gounod's "Jubilee Cantata."</p>
   <p>Finally, a drama, entitled "The Queen by Grace of God," was performed by young women exclusively. Mrs. W. Kaliszewski portrayed the role of the queen with spirit and understanding. Little Catherine Szafranski deserves special mention for her portrayal of the part of a poor little girl who refused to give "even a crumb" of bread to the fallen queen. Miss S. Zaparta played the role of Countess Joan very well, and little Helen Kupski played the part of Zyglinda, Countess Joan's daughter, with feeling.</p>
   <p>The ladies-in-waiting--Ludgard (F. Radke), Blanca (H. Chojnacki), Beata (R. Dykowski), Irene (K. Jozwiak), and Helen (Murzynski) deserve a word of <span class="page-break">4</span>praise for their capable performances.</p>
   <p>To conclude the program and to bring this eventful day to a close, all those present rose and joined in the singing of the hymn "Boze Cos Polske" (God save Poland).</p>
