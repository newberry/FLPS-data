   <p>One of the most active organizations in the field of helping our needy countrymen in Chicago is The Swedish National Society. Last year it distributed $1,200 to the poor not to mention the activity of its free employment bureau. The society is now making plans for a midwinter festival to be held at the Auditorium Feb. 6, when a Swedish historical play will be presented.</p>
