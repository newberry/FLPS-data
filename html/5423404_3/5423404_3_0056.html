   <p>Last Saturday at the Sherman House a meeting of the Swedish Singing Union was called in order to make arrangements for a Memorial to the memory of Gunnar Wennerberg, the great Swedish composer who died recently.</p>
   <p>Representatives of sixteen different churches and singing clubs were present. A committee was chosen to make plans and arrangements. Members of committee: John Spann, Wm. Dehlin, and M. Bergstrom. One of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>resolutions passed was that this organization is to be known as the Swedish-American Gunnar Wennerberg Memorial Chorus of Chicago. The memorial will consist of a festival and concert, at which the dead composer's songs and melodies will be sung and played.</p>
   <p>The proceeds will go towards the founding of a fund the disposition of which will later be determined by the committee.</p>
