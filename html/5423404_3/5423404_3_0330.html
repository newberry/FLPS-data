   <p>This Swedish Club held a bazaar, as announced, at Belmont Hall, last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Many pretty and valuable articles were sold for high prices; the undertaking netted about $600.</p>
   <p>Charles Halberg's painting, which he sent, brought $110. All of the money taken in will be used to alleviate illness, and need among the people. Some of it will be given to help combat the spreading of the terrible disease tuberculosis. We honor the women who have accomplished this work.</p>
