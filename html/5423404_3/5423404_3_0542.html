   <p>The beginning of a new calendar year marks an important milestone in the history of a newspaper. Just as for the individual, so for the newspaper the occasion is one for serious reflection on the part of the editorial staff and, we may well say, on the part of our readers as well. It reminds us that Father Time moves along, not with great speed perhaps, but steadily, and with-out ever retracing his steps. And he pulls us along with him, whether we want to go or not.</p>
   <p>It is of the utmost importance that, as time passes, we absorb and make our own some of the new impulses which each new year brings with it so that we do not stop growing, so that we do not become lost in the past. This applies even more to a newspaper, whose task it is to reflect truly contemporary ideas, ambitions, and spiritual as well as material activities, and to lead the way toward that which is right and good.</p>
   
   <p>The Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter has already passed the half-century mark, but is still vigorous as a youngster, and its zest for life has increased with every passing year. It has not remained stationary, nor has it become solidified in old, stereotyped forms; and just as its plant equipment and external appearance have kept step with modern trends, so also have its contents mirrored the social evolution and progress which are always going on, as well as the highest ideals of the day. To sum it up, the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter has tried to be what a publication should be which wants to be a spokesman for sound public opinion.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter was the first Swedish newspaper here to take up the modern ideas of social progress and reform, and to propound them vigorously. The driving force behind its efforts in this respect has been its sincere interest in the welfare of the people, and its intense dislike of everything that tends to ussurp the fundamental, God-given rights of man. Our readers have not failed to recognize this basic policy and progressive spirit in our columns, and the many expressions of encouragement and good will which we receive almost daily testify to the fact that the Swedish public appreciates a liberal progressive newspaper which is not afraid of new ideas, which supports useful reforms, and which always looks out for the people's interests in the solution of the intricate social problems of our times.</p>
   <p>The Swedes have always been praised for their sterling qualities as citizens, and the people of no nationality in this country have earned more respect than they have for loyalty, devotion to duty, honesty, and ability as workers. We are proud of this, and the Tribunen-Nyheter wants to be a Swedish standard bearer urging all its nationals carefully to preserve the culture and traditions they have inherited from their fathers and brought with them to their new home here, to transplant these customs and traditions to American soil, and to help them grow and bear rich fruit, to the honor of the old fatherland and for the material and spiritual benefit of the new fatherland. We desire to be valuable citizens of America, and to contribute to her progress.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter will remain true to its best traditions, and will always try to maintain its position as the foremost Swedish-American newspaper, whose comments on political, social, and other questions are read with interest and approval in Swedish-American homes throughout the land. As before, we shall bring our readers the latest news from all parts of Sweden, news concerning our countrymen in America, general American and world news, good serials and short stories, and also special articles by the best Swedish writers both in this country and abroad. Our special departments will continue as usual.</p>
   <p>During the past year, we received many tokens of appreciation from our readers, and we are happy to announce that our subscription list is growing steadily. Indications are that it will keep on growing. It may be a surprise to many to hear that some six thousand copies go to Sweden every week.</p>
   
   <p>This happy situation is chiefly due to the mutual good will and confidence between ourselves and our public, and we take this occasion to thank every-body whose co-operation has made our success and progress possible. Looking forward to a continued pleasant association, we wish all our readers and occasional contributors, our friends and supporters, near and far,</p>
   <p>A Happy New Year!</p>
