   <p>The Illinois department of the Scandinavian Workers' Educational League is planning to arrange a new study course this year. For that purpose it has approached the management of Good Templar Park in Geneva, and an arrangement has been made whereby the park is at the League's disposal from July 29 to August 5 inclusive. Those who attended similar courses in previous years know that they are very interesting and educational, and this year a special effort has been made to present a particularly fine program.</p>
   <p>Among those engaged to deliver lectures are Carl Sandburg, Carl Haessler, Ralph Chaplin, and Dr. Lawson. Discussion on a variety, of topics will take place every evening, and an effort is being made to combine pleasure with utility.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements has issued an announcement, from which we quote:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"We urge all who are interested, not only those who belong to the Educational League, but others also, to support this Course. It is open for all who wish to attend. The fee is only ten dollars, which entitles the student to food for six days, sleeping quarters in a tent for the same length of time, and the privilege of attending all lectures, participating in discussions, etc.</p>
   <p>"Applications should be mailed as soon as possible to Gunnar Adolfson, 2306 Wilton Avenue, who will also give all information requested about the course. With the application should be enclosed five dollars as a down payment on the fee.</p>
   <p>"By authorization,</p>
   <p>"The Arrangement Committee."</p>
