   <p>Most of our countrymen have probably seen the mighty biographical drama "The Spoilers." And no one can deny that the drama is effective, but only few, we think, are aware that at the very origin of the drama stands a poor Swedish boy - and that those who found the first rich gold mines in Alaska where now is situated the city of Nome and where occurred the development around which the drama is built, were all of them born in Sweden and Norway. The poor Swedish boy in the drama is said to be the well known Alaska millionaire A. E. Lindblom, now living in San Francisco.</p>
