   <p>About four hundred of the delegates, who have been participating at the Swedish Baptists 50th Jubilee visited the University of Chicago last week. The visitors were received and greeted at the Kent Theater by President Harper, Prof. H. P. Judson, and Prof. S. Matthews. A response was made by Professors Lagergren and Edgren. The Swedish Baptists have a certain reason to be interested in the University because their own seminary at Morgan Park is now affiliated with the University of Chicago.</p>
