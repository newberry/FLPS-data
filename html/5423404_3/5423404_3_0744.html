   <p>Mr. Herming Wennersten, one of our energetic compatriots in Chicago, is now working on a directory of the Swedes in Chicago. The directory will appear in April. In order that it be as complete as possible the Swedes of Chicago are requested to send as soon as possible their names, addresses, business, or employment, preferably on a postal card, to Mr. Herming Wennersten, 1006 Seminary Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
