   <p>The Swedish Pavilion is now almost erected on the grounds at The World's Fair between the lagoon and Lake Michigan. It is triangular in shape. The height of the cupola is 70 feet, with a spire on top of it. The Swedish Flag, which will be flown from the flag-pole, will be 150 feet from the ground.</p>
   <p>The Eskilstwna Tree Ennobeling Co. has built the pavilion at a cost of $40,000.00 and its structure is very attractive. The interior is painted in light colors. The Swedish Tourist Society will occupy one of the best spaces in the pavilion. The giantic painting of Stockholm will be placed in the entrance.</p>
   <p>There will also be wax figures in Swedish National Costumes, and a model of a Swedish farm home.</p>
   <p>The Royal Swedish Hunting Club and The Gymastic Society will also be represented at the Fair.</p>
