   <p>The North Park College is prospering and expanding. The school is now represented in the Loop by a branch known as the North Park School of Music, located in rooms 407 and 408 in Kimball Hall. This musical branch has an efficient staff of teachers, among whom are: Sigfried Laurin, A. Francke, and Blanche Waldenstrom. Prof. Laurin is principal of the school of music, a fact alone which should sufficiently guarantee the success of this enterprise. We feel that the college displayed wisdom in opening the musical branch, and also by adding such efficient teachers to its educational faculty.</p>
