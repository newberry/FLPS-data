   <p>Last Sunday this club gave a wonderful Minstrel Show at its quarters on Wrightwood Avenue. All seats were completely sold out, and not even standing room was available. The audience was immediately put into a good humor which lasted throughout the performance. The chorus opened with "When the Band Begins to Play," and continued with the following popular melodies: "Happy Hooligan," "Dinky Pink" from "Gambling Man," "Riddle Song," "Poor Little Moses," "Home Ain't Nothing Like This," "Foxy Grandpa," "Gas Pipe," "I'll Wed You in the Golden Summertime," "You'll Always Be the Same Sweet Girl to Me."</p>
   <p>Many of the numbers won so much applause that the performers had to give several encores. The Svithiod Singing Club has had a great many brilliant entertainments, but this, in our opinion, was the very best. The Swedish people of Chicago are to be congratulated for having such players at their disposal.</p>
