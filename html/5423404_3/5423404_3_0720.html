   <p>A set of travelogues has been given to our paper by Mrs. Myra Peterson. This set is a fine descriptive trip to Europe some years prior to the World War. It describes the author's travels with her friends, and is very interesting. The first chapter tells of the ocean voyage. Then follows intimate details of Rouen and Paris, whose works of art, museums, historical places, and buildings are ably set forth and described.</p>
   <p>There is a chapter on Versailles, Fontainbleau, Brussels, Coblenz, Mainz, Wiesbaden, River Rhine, Frankfort-Au-Main, Oberammergau, whose passion play is graphically dealt with, Dresden, Berlin, Stockholm, Filipstad, London, and the return voyage to New York.</p>
   <p>Some of the descriptions are accompanied by splendid illustrations which are being appropriately distributed, give added enjoyment and value to the travelogue.</p>

   <p>The book has 200 pages, and, together with the binding, and printing, and covers, which are very elegant, it gives much credit to its author, who is the wife of Charles S. Peterson.</p>
