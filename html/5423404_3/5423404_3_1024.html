   <p>We Americans of Swedish descent or birth should appreciate the unselfish work which Vestgota Gille has taken upon its shoulders, of raising a fund of $2000 for a monument to be erected on the grave of the late editor John A. Enander in Oak Hill Cemetery. Since the sixties to the turn of the century, no one individual has contributed so much towards the enlightenment of the Swedish-Americans concerning their duties as American citizens as has Doctor Enander. This will not only immortalize the memory of this personality, but this will also be a token of our contributions to American history during the last half of the century.</p>
   <p>Other nations are honoring the memory of their leading men. Should not we do the same? If we neglect this we show our weakness, and we as well as our work then deserve to be forgotten. But we must be united and strong! Through co-operation and worthy deeds we must show our united <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>strength, and thus occupy the niche in history to which we are entitled. What we have won honestly, we should keep. Shame would be heaped upon us, if we failed to do our duty.</p>
   <p>Towards this fund, $1410 has already been contributed. The world war should not be a hindrance. The committee is thankful for every little amount received.</p>
   <p>Kindly forward contributions to Mr. John A. Fredain, 2449 Pensacola Ave., Chicago, Ill.</p>
