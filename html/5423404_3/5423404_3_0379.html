   <p>p.11.... The sick benefit society, Nordstjarnan (North Star), on the South Side celebrated its twenty-first annual May festival last Saturday evening. The affair took place at Freiberg's Hall on Twenty-second Street and was attended by hundreds of members and friends of the popular organization. The North Star has celebrated few May festivals which have been better attended, although the festival was planned on short notice the public had the pleasure of hearing a highly entertaining program. On the program was the following: The North Star Singers under Mr. Ernst Lindblom's leadership, the Pfeil Trio, solo-numbers by Mrs. Anna Pfeil, and a festival speech by the young lawyer, Oscar Olson, who knew how to entertain his hearers with various well-told anecdotes. All numbers were received with enthusiasm.</p>
