   <p>The most important sailing event of the season, the race from Michigan City to Chicago, 381/2 nautical miles, took place last Sunday and was won by our almost unbeatable yachtsman, Gus Nylund, in his sail boat, "Springtime." The prize was the highly coveted Stratford cup valued at $2,500, which has to be won by the same individual skipper three times before it becomes his permanent property. This is Nylund's second victory of the trophy.--Besides Nylund, the crew aboard "Springtime" consisted of Ralph Johnson, Gust Johnson and Uno Gustafson.</p>
   <p>We take this occasion to point out, as we have done before, that "Springtime" was designed and built by Mr. Nylund, himself.</p>
