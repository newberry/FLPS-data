   <p>The New Augustana Hospital is now well under way. The building will be eight stories high and of fire-proof construction. The total cost of this ultra-modern hospital is estimated at $900,000, which is being raised by the issuance of first mortgage gold bonds at 6% interest. The location of the new hospital is at Sedgwick St. and Garfield Ave., and the sponsor is the Illinois Conference of the Augustana Synod.</p>
