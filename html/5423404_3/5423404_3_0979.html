   <p>A general membership meeting of the Swedish-American Athletic Club was held on January 8, in the clubrooms at 3055 Sheffield Avenue, and was attended by almost all members, proving that they take an active interest in the welfare of the organization. The report indicated that 1914 was a very active and successful year for the Club. The membership steadily increased, and at the turn of the year stood at 260. The athletic facilities have been improved, particularly the gymnasium to which a dressing room has been added.</p>
   <p>Practice in gymnastics is held every Tuesday and Thursday night under the instruction of Dr. Carl G. Rydin. The wrestlers practice every Wednesday night and Sunday morning, and most of the members are active athletes.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the Club should also take up hockey, and members who already have developed some skill in this game were urged to join the team, <span class="page-break">\2</span>which will probably see action during the ice races arranged by the Western Skating Association to take place in Garfield Park on January 17.</p>
   <p>August Putkanen and Fred Holmes, the Club's ablest wrestlers, will compete in the Illinois Athletic Club's championship matches on January 16. George Odin is president of the Club.</p>
