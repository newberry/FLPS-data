   <p>The Swedish section at The World's Fair in Chicago is going to be very prominent. The interest in the Fair is steadily increasing and there is restless activity everywhere to get things ready for the exhibition before the time for their shipment expires. The number of exhibitors have increased to nearly 300.</p>
   <p>The Exhibition pavilion, in parts, is already on its way from Sweden to Chicago and so are most of the objects intended for The Fair. Engineer A.Leffler, commissary for the Swedish Exhibition, and G. Wickman, architect will depart for Chicago in February to supervise the erection of the pavilion and other arrangements.</p>
   <p>The great Swedish industries, especially the steel and iron, are going to be represented in a most worthy manner. The Swedish Tourist Society and the Nordic Museum are working each in the field to contribute to the exhibition by designing peasant houses, photographs of beautiful places in Sweden and winter sport scenes and other scenery.</p>
