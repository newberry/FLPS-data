   <p>The film "Gosta Berling's Saga," adopted from Selma Lagerlof's famous book of that name, was presented last Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoon in Orchestra Hall. Thursday night, when we were there, the house was filled to capacity, and according to reports reaching us the attendance was almost as good on the following two nights, and Sunday afternoon a large number of people were turned away at the box office. Naturally, Swedish-Americans were in the majority in the audiences, and it was a rare event for them, especially for all those who had read the book.</p>
   <p>Everybody seemed to be well pleased with the performance. The picture was accompanied by music, rendered by Harry T. Carlson, which harmonized very nicely with the scenes appearing on the silver screen and with the spirit of the picture.</p>
   <p>Those who have seen Greta Garbo in American-made films would hardly recognize her in this one. But Lars Hanson as "Gosta Berling" could not have been <span class="page-break">2</span>surpassed, and, all in all, the entire cast played their roles in a manner which did credit to themselves and to the Swedish film art, as well as to the book and its author. In several respects this picture differs from the general run of American films, in which, as a rule, both the hero and the heroine are presented as spineless dolls. At the same time, it has its weak points, and it may well be that part of these can be traced to the censor. The English text is not all that could be desired, and those who have not read the book are bound to have some difficulty in following the story.</p>
   <p>Certain scenes in the picture, such as the big fire at Ekeby, indicate clearly a gratifying improvement and progress in Swedish film technique, as compared with earlier pictures, and it is safe to predict that "Gosta Berling's Saga" will have a successful run in America.</p>
