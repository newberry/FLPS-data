   <p>A mass meeting, under the auspices of the lodges Vart Hem and Svea, of the I.O.G.T., held last Sunday, was very well attended.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened with music by the Bellman Trio, after which Dr. Jacob Bonggren read an ode to Mr. David Holmgren, a member of the Swedish parliament. Mr. Holmgren was afterwards introduced to the audience by Editor Frans Albin, and gave a brilliant speech.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holmgren's speech was followed by songs by Mr. Robert Johnson, and by the Linnea ladies' quartette. Both Mr. Johnson and the ladies of the quartet deserve praise for their beautiful singing.</p>
