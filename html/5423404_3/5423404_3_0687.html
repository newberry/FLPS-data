   <p>The annual Christmas periodical Varmland, Var Hembygd (Varmland, Our Home), which is also the yearbook of the society Varmlands Nation, will be off the press this week. We received a test copy yesterday, but we have not had time to examine it closely. As far as we can see at only a brief glance it compares well with the editions of previous years. The print is larger and there are more pages. The frontispiece boasts a drawing by the noted artist, Gotthilf Ahlman, reproduced in four colors, and the only fault we can find with it is that the word Varmland is misspelled.</p>
   <p>The periodical is richly illustrated and printed by the firm Moberg &amp; Nord, and they have done a fine job. It costs fifty cents, and every Varmlander in America should have a copy. If the times were not as bad as they are the price would have been one dollar, and it is worth it.</p>
   <p>Orders should be addressed to Varmland, Var Hembygd, 1914 Irving <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Park Boulevard, Chicago.</p>
