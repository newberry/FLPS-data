   <p>A bronze statue of an Indian on a horse, made by the prominent Swedish artist, A.E.Dallin, which was exhibited at the World's Fair last year, has been purchased by Judge Lambert Tree for $10,000 and donated by him to be erected at Lincoln Park. The motif of the statue is purely American. It shows an Indian, riding on his horse, holding a staff with an attached feather, which is a token, among the Indians, that the horseman is coming for a peaceful purpose.</p>
   <p>The artist has called his work "A Peace Token." The statue was at the ParisExhibition in 1890, where it was highly recommended. It was rewarded with a medal and diploma at the World's Fair in Chicago, 1893.</p>
