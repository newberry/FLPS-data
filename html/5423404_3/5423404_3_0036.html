   <p>Carl Oscar Nelson, the promising young Swedish violinist, gave a concert last Saturday evening at Kimball Recital Hall, Wabash Avenue and Jackson Boulevard. Mr. Nelson is one of the most promising students of the Capone Violin School, located in the Kimball Building. The young Swedish singer, Miss Anna Nelson, assisted in the program..... The audience vigorously applauded the various numbers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nelson is only sixteen years old, but, undoubtedly, he shows unusual ability as a violinist. His playing indicated genius throughout..... In passing, it may be mentioned that the young violinist is son of Police Officer Olaf Nelson, 1010 North 43rd Avenue, one of the ablest members of our police force. Young Mr. Nelson is the director of Wicker Park Juvenile Orchestra, and he has already become known as composer of several numbers, which were highly commended by his instructor. We believe that the future holds much in store for the young violinist.</p>
