   <p>The turn of the year marks the most significant event in the history of the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter. For it can now look back on half a century of existence and of work. It is observing the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. Fifty years of unbroken activity is quite a long workday for a newspaper; it is an indication of honest effort and faithful work, able leadership and sound policies, and confidence and good will on the part of its readers. Such an occasion deserves to be celebrated.</p>
   <p>For more than half a century, the Tribunen-Nyheter has been a champion of freedom and enlightenment, truth and justice, and faithfulness to ideals and duties in all spheres of human activity. During all these years, it has sought to advance the cause of its countrymen and to keep the Swedish spirit alive. It has served as a uniting link for the people of Swedish blood who are scattered all over this country. At the same time, it has <span class="page-break">2</span>endeavored to strengthen the ties of friendship between Swedes in America and Swedes at home, as well as to promote friendly relations between the old and the adopted country. Its efforts have been crowned with success, and its circulation and influence have increased steadily until it has become the leading Swedish-American weekly, a position it has occupied for many years now.</p>
   <p>The half-century mark was reached three years ago, but it was necessary to postpone any official observance of the occasion because of the low ebb of business and to certain other conditions which were particularly trying for the entire foreign-language press at that time, not least of all for a weekly with a large circulation. However, fifty years of existence and vigorous activity of a Swedish-American newspaper is a rare and important occurrence, and since conditions are now more favorable the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter is observing the belated anniversary by presenting to its Swedish-American public a jubilee issue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The contents of this issue are chiefly of a historical nature. Its purpose is to show how the Swedish element has taken an active part in developing and maintaining the American republic, and to point out some of the material and spiritual contributions which it has made to American national life. These contributions are real and deserve recognition. In proportion to their numbers, the Swedes have contributed more to the progress of this country than any other nationality.</p>
   <p>Read the many special articles in the jubilee issue! They will give the reader an idea of the great cultural work done by Swedes here, and will help him realize that they have been an asset to the country ever since the year 1638 when they first began to cultivate the land along the banks of the Delaware River. We may well be proud that we are the standard-bearers of the Swedish spirit in a new land. As good citizens, we should do our part in spreading Swedish culture, for it constitutes a valuable component of Americanism in the true sense of that term. If we do so, not only shall we ourselves benefit, but future generations, too, will <span class="page-break">4</span>gather a rich harvest.</p>
   <p>As the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter observes this anniversary, we greet its many thousands of readers, and thank them for their never-failing confidence, friendship, and co-operation. We also wish to express our deep-felt thanks for the many friendly and highly valued felicitations which we have received from near and far. Filled with sincere gratitude to all our well-wishers, we, in turn, wish one and all a happy New Year.</p>
