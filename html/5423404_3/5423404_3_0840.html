   <p>Ellen Key, the Swedish Authoress, was the topic of Mrs. Ebba Norman Gould's lecture given before the Lake View Swedish Study League last Wednesday. A record crowd attended this lecture, which was delivered in faultless and highly enjoyable Swedish. A special mention of this is being more because of the lecturer's American birth, although of Swedish parentage, but the main reason may be found in the fact that her husband is none other than the eminent professor of Scandinavian and Germanic literature, University of Chicago, Dr. Chester N. Gould.</p>
   <p>Prof. Gould will be the lecturer at the Leagues' next meeting, Dec. 8th. His subject will be "The Old Icelandic Sagas."</p>
