   <p>Our foremost literary critic in Chicago (aside from Kuriren) Jacob Bondgren, thought that A. V. Dohlgren had written the long poem which appeared in a recent issue, but our correspondent, the literary expert Ernest Skorstedt, in Castle Hock, positively credits "Uncle Adam," C. A. Wetterbergh, as being the author. We intend to rely upon Ernest Skorstedt's statement. To our friend Mr. B. Olson, in Rockford, we wish to give this friendly advise: Do not write any more verse until you can compose as well as Sandelin, or at least as well as Kuriren.</p>
