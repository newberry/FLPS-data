   <p>The Swedish- Americans of Illinois will be the title of an illustrated work in the English language to be issued early in the coming year. The work will be published by the Swedish American Biographic Association, an organization consisting of men of note, interested in our history. The editor of the work is the well known journalist, Anders Schon. It is the intention that the work is to consist of two parts, the former containing a historical review of the development of our nationality in Illinois in the various fields, the latter to contain several hundred biographies with photographs of Swedish people now living in the state. The work promises to become a valuable contribution to our Swedish American historical and biographical literature.</p>
