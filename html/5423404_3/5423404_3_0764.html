   <p>Last Friday night a particularly interesting and varied Swedish program was offered by Radio Station WIBO, which is owned by the Nelson Brothers Bond and Mortgage Company.</p>
   <p>The popular barytone, Gosta Flodstrom, sang a number of sailor songs, and the young tenor, Thore Osterberg, rendered two songs written by Prince Wilhelm of Sweden. As usual Gunnar Kassman gave a short talk, this time describing the west coast of Sweden, and later on he also recited some fine poetry, namely, King Oscar's "Ostersjon" (The Baltic Sea) and "Londonbref" (Letter from London) by Thure Nerman. [Translator's note: King Oscar was the father of the present Swedish king.]</p>
   <p>Next Friday night a similar program will be offered, and as usual it begins at nine o'clock.</p>
