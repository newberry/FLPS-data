   <p>In the news again is our old friend, Mr. Bryan, who has been a presidential candidate a few times without being elected. That he was not elected is not so strange when one remembers that the Svenska Amerikanska Posten has been his organ among us Swedes, and has procured for him about as shining a victory as it did for John Lind, who later earned the privilege of being in better company. Yes, this Bryan, who has no fame as a jurist, or even as a capable attorney--this Bryan is indulging in the same shamelessness as has characterised the Svenska Amerikanska Posten. "Tell me with whom you associate, and I will tell you whom you are like," is a true saying.</p>
   <p>Bryan now accuses the Supreme Court of wilfully and stupidly having reached an unjust decision in the Porto Rico matter. Bryan makes this casual indictment after the unusually able jurists who make up the Supreme Court have honestly and conscientiously studied for many months this weighty and <span class="page-break">\2</span>knotty problem. Bryan goes further. He accuses the Supreme Court of being in a conspiracy with McKinley, Hanna, et al, for the overthrow of our whole form of government.</p>
   <p>This is more than ridiculous. It is shameful, it is the height of shamelessness. How long will the people bear with this presumptuous demagogue, this evermore mud-slinging leader, this spectacular example of political impudence? Is not even the Supreme Court to be left in peace by these rough-skinned mutineers? Hasn't Bryan enough common sense, hasn't he enough heart, to let the country's beloved President sit in peace at his wife's sick-bed? Will the bare-faced demagoguery in our land know no bounds?</p>
   <p>One is forced to ask these questions, when considering the now actually abominable Bryan sitting in Lincoln. Poor Nebraska! With Bryan and Erik Johnson, and El--but, no, let us not waste space in your worthy newspaper by naming others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>An ordinary, amiable, and just person, guessing as dreadfully wrong as Bryan has done, would devoutly wish himself and everything his to be forgotten. When has Bryan spoken a true word of prognostication in politics? Think what horrors he predicted if McKinley was elected and "free silver" was not accepted in 1896. Think how the Svenska Amerikanska Posten uttered its: "May it come to pass, even so!"</p>
   <p>McKinley was victorious, free silver was forgotten. The country breathed a sigh of relief, and Uncle Sam grins up his sleeve and says: "We have never had better times." All Europe looks with alarm upon our progress, yet Bryan and the Svenska Amerikanska Posten, our famous false prophets of disaster, act as if ruin were overwhelming us. Such "cheek", such "brass" is necessary if one would belong to their party.</p>
   <p>Last fall, Bryan shouted about imperialism. Now Aguinaldo has himself exhorted his people to swear fealty to the starry flag. He has himself furnished <span class="page-break">\4</span>a good example for his people. The whole world now knows that the war was kept alive only through the false hope that Bryan would win the election last fall. One of the defeated of the old rebels in America, he was the Philippine rebels' only hope. That hope has vanished, the rebellion is in point of fact ended, and the rebel leader is ours, but now comes the false prophet, Bryan, and attacks the Supreme Court's integrity. Who has at any time seen anything more insolent?</p>
   <p>And among us Swedes Bryan's mouthpiece continues from week to week to voice the same principles with the same blindness, with the same impudence.</p>
   <p>Pompons patent medicine advertisements, and other things which the public can well do without, are mixed with the most shameless political demagoguery and nonsense, and to lure the farmers these remedies were offered at cheap prices only for the sake of getting rid of them. That the price had to be low was obvious, for who would pay the usual price for such stuff?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Yes, it is a sight to see. Bryan and the Posten, the dear friends, have been deserted by the third member of the organization, Aguinaldo....The next thing we expect to hear is that Bryan and Svenska Amerikanska Posten have taken issue with the Ten Commandments, and the right which gave them to us.</p>
