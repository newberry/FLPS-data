   <p>The annual "Old Settlers' Picnic" under the auspices of the Calumet Club was held last Thursday. Requirement for participation is to have arrived in Chicago on or before 1840. More than 100 men and women attended the affair, at which a supper was served. Among those present were our countryman Captain O. G. Lange and his wife. Captain Lange arrived in America in 1824 and came to Chicago in 1838.</p>
