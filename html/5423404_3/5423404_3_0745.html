   <p>Framat (Forward) is the name of a new monthly published by Messrs. Swenson and <span class="page-break">2</span>Bjork, at Rockford, Illinois. We mention the paper under the caption "Literature" because the first copy of the monthly which we had the pleasure to receive was the Christmas number, and that number deserves to be called literature. The number contains thirty pages, of good quality paper and of rich contents. It ought to be read by every Swede. Price, per number; five cents; price, per year: thirty cents.</p>
