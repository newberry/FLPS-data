   <p>The Open Air Festival last Sunday at Riverview Park, arranged by the Swedish National Association of Chicago, became an autumn festival instead of a summer festival as planned, and the reason was the weather, not the planning. Those in charge did even more than they had promised, for they presented a speaker, both outstanding and eloquent, who was not mentioned on the program, Senator J. Hamilton Lewis. He had nothing but flattering things to say about the Swedes and his speech was greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>There was music by the orchestra of the "Northern Star" and of the "Vikings" and singing by the "Swedish Singing Society", dance exhibition by the dance club "Skansen".</p>
