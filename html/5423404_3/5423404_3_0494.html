   <p>The Swedish Historical Society of America was founded in Chicago July 22, 1905. Its purposes are as follows: to gather and preserve for coming generations books and handwritings concerning the Swedes and their institutions in America, and publications written by the Swedes; to gather articles and photographs connected with the Swedish immigrants and their descendants; to give out publications concerning the Swedes in America and in Sweden; to gather books concerning Sweden's history, culture, and literature, which are to be a part of the Society's library, and which may develop into a central Swedish library in America. The Society's temporary quarters at the Swedish Seminary Building in Evanston are now too small for its purpose, and a new building to be erected in the heart of Chicago is now its goal.</p>
   <p>At a recent meeting of the members of the Society, it was decided to build <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a library building. A building committee was formed, consisting of A. G. S. Josephson, chairman; Professor C. G. Wallenius, secretary; Frank Gustafson, treasurer; a committee composed of Fritz Schoultz, Nels M. Hokanson and Gustaf Hallbom. This committee appointed Mr. Alfred Soderstrom to be its finance agent, and to collect money for the building fund.</p>
