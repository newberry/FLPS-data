   <p>This is the title of a practical little book published by Hjalmar Lundquist. Every Swede in Chicago should have one, as it contains a complete list of congregations, societies, and other Swedish organizations in the city, including net only their addresses and other information, but also the names and addresses of their officers. The booklet is exceptionally well edited, and fills a long-felt need.</p>
