   <p>Drake lodge #3, I. O. V. with boasting may claim to be one of the most progressive of all the twenty-two lodges in the Order of Vikings. The Order has its chief source in Lake View, and from that place have come the greatest influx of lodge members from the very time of its organization, thirteen years ago.</p>
   <p>On Thursday evening of last week, the second regular conference for this month was held. A large accession of new members was anticipated, and on account of this, it was doubted whether the old meeting place in Wells Hall, at Clark and Fletcher Streets, would be large enough to accommodate the crowd.</p>
   
   <p>For this reason, Claremont Hall (old Spelz Hall) was rented for the evening's meeting. This proved fortunate, for even this larger hall became crowded by the more than three hundred members and adherents who attended the meeting. Thirty-six new members were received into the lodge. The membership now has been increased to three hundred forty-five. A uniformed sextet, directed by Mr. Holmberg, furnished the music in connection with the reception of new members. Afterwards, those present enjoyed singing by a quartet from Orphei Singing Club. Frithiof Malmquist, Grand Chief of the Vikings, was the speaker of the evening. His speech was well prepared and received. Past Grand Chief Herman Carlson spoke amid strong applause. Al Person initiated riotous applause with his jolly ditties as he presented the members of the committee on ceremonies, all of whom wore their Viking regalias.</p>
   <p>Refreshments were served.</p>
   
   <p>Great jubilation arose when the question was brought up of the removal of the "Herring salad" from the Swedish flag of the lodge, and it was resolved that in the future the flag should contain only the blue and yellow colors. The whole gathering was one of jollity and good humor. In conclusion, it may be said that the lodge boasts a sick benefit fund of $4,200.</p>
