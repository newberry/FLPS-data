   <p>Organizations that wish to arrange for lectures on educational topics for their members have a treat in store for them. The well-known lecturer, Jenny Velander, is returning from a tour of the West, and will spend a few weeks in the city; during that time she will be available for lecture engagements. She has an extensive repertoire of instructive topics in a variety of fields, such as: "Cultural Geography as a Course of Study in Schools and in Self-Education;" "Sweden's Most Important Problem of Today"; "The Responsibility of Women in Regard to Our Great Social and Political Movements"; "Political Association and Disassociation"; "A Comparison between German and Scandinavian Educational Ideals"; "The Motor Car as Commercial Pioneer"; "The Modern Woman and Modern Dress"; "Sweden Just Now"; "The Language and its Role in Culture Building"; "Trends in Present Day Temperance Work"; "The Child and Alcohol"; and "Democratic Rebirth."</p>
   <p>According to the original plans, Mrs. Velander was to lecture before Good Templar lodges only, but since she intends to remain here a couple of weeks longer than first thought, it has been decided to allow other organizations to avail themselves of this rare opportunity. It is not often that such a distinguished lecturer as Mrs. Velander visits our city; so as many people as possible should hear her.</p>
   <p>Organizations that wish to arrange for one or more lectures should, without delay, get in touch with C. O. Engstrom, 2849 Abbott Court, who is the secretary of the Scandinavian Grand Lodge of Illinois of the Independent Order of Good Templars (I. O. G. T.).</p>
