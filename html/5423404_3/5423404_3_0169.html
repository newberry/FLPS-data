   <p>Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition is attracting the attention of the entire world. Almost all nations are represented at this great event, in one way or another, and one may be sure that the few that are absent have valid reasons for their failure to participate. Broadly speaking, the exposition belongs not only to Chicago, but to the entire civilized world, since its scope covers all the important changes which have taken place during the last century, and the great scientific discoveries which have effected every field of human endeavor.</p>
   <p>An older person, who saw the Columbian Exposition which was held here forty years ago, is perhaps in a better position than most others to realize the significance of the progress which has been made during the last decades. Forty years ago we did not have airplanes, radios, automobiles, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and many other marvels of modern invention that are in common use today. These modern wonders were unheard of at the time of the 1893 exposition. And think of the greet industries which have come into being as a result of these inventions!</p>
   <p>As far as Chicago is concerned, no more fitting name than A Century of Progress can be imagined for its centennial observance, symbolized in the exposition. Is there any other area in the world, of similar size, where such amazing changes have taken place, and so much material and cultural progress has been made during the last one hundred years? If there is we never heard of it. And Chicago is, therefore, more typically American than any other city in the country.</p>
   <p>Swedish immigrants began early to make their way to this city, and our nationals have contributed much to its growth. It is said that more than one third of all the buildings here were built by Swedes, and our people have taken an important part in the many other activities which have made <span class="page-break">\3</span>Chicago what it is today.</p>
   <p>But it is not only Chicago that has benefited by the energy and pioneering qualities of our race. Swedish immigrants have always been in the front line among those who brought this great land under cultivation and brought civilization to its farthest corners. They have mined the ore in its mountains, cut down the trees of its forests and followed them through the various manufacturing processes, and they have turned the vast prairies into rich farm land. Yes, one would hardly be guilty of exaggeration if one should say that during the last seventy years Swedes in this country have brought under cultivation a total area several times as large as all Sweden. When and where in the history of man has a race of people, so small in number, accomplished so much?</p>
   <p>There are good reasons why, during Chicago's centennial celebration, a special day should be set aside as the Swedish Day, and this day will be observed next Monday, June 19. That is the day when we Swedish-Americans <span class="page-break">\4</span>are to gather and remind ourselves, and also other nationalities, of the work which men and women of Swedish blood have done here in America. The Swedes have always been a people that liked to build and to cultivate new land, not only in the literal sense, but also in the sphere of intellectual activity. Credit for the standing which we enjoy here in America today should be given to our ancient Swedish ancestors, but on this particular occasion it behooves us as Swedish-Americans to honor the memory of the early Swedish settlers in this country.</p>
   <p>So let us gather at the Century of Progress Exhibition on Monday, June 19. Too little has been said and written about the peaceful conquests which the descendants of the Vikings have made here in the far West. Let us honor ourselves by honoring our fatherland and those men and women of our race who preceded us here in the New World. Let us make the Swedish Day, Monday June 19, the greatest day for our nationality in the last three hundred years!</p>
