   <p>Miss Marie A. Brown gave a very interesting lecture last Thursday night at Fairbanks Hall attended by a large group of Scandinavians and a few Americans. She showed great knowledge of the history and geography of Sweden. She also showed fine pictures of different parts of the Scandinavian countries and the larger cities, Stockholm, Upsala, Gothenburg, Kristiania and Copenhagen.</p>
