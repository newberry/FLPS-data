   <p>Harry Olsen, the esteemed Swedish-American attorney who is a candidate for election as Chief Justice of the Municipal Court of Chicago, gave a very good lecture recently at the First Baptist Church, 31st Street and South Park Avenue, under the auspices of the Young Men's League. He made the statement that Chicago seems to be the haven of criminals from all over the world and that we have more lawbreakers than London, with its 4,500,000 inhabitants, to say nothing of New York City, our country's largest city.</p>
