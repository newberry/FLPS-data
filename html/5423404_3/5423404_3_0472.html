   <p>The Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago has just bought the building at 503 Wrightwood Avenue, near Lincoln Park. It is one of the most impressive-looking structures in that part of the city. The property was bought from Francis J. Dewes, president of the Standard Brewery Company, for $50,000.</p>
   <p>With this purchase the Society has happily solved its building problem. It now possesses a more luxurious and comfortable clubhouse than any other Swedish organization in America.</p>
