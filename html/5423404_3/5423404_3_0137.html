   <p>The large and extensive Order of Svithiod, with the assistance of the Swedish Theatrical Society, presented F. A. Dahlgren's beautiful and appealing play, the "Vermlandingarne" (The People of Vermland), last Saturday evening at the North Side Turner Hall. The big hall was filled to capacity by a fun-loving crowd, and strange to say, the curtain rose at exactly 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>The chief roles in the piece were played by Mr. Max Hedman whose portrayal of "Erik" was excellent, and Mrs. Ida Linn who as "Anna" won the public completely, especially by her singing. Mr. Ernest Lindblom, as the owner of the estate, did not quite evince the warmth of feeling and the love of his fellowmen, which the play seems to demand....Mr. Carl Milton played the role of "Ola i Gyllby." With regard to both attire and acting he might have given a greater impression of sturdiness.</p>
   
   <p>The same Mr. Milton was excellent, on the other hand, in a different role played by him in the same piece, namely the role of parish priest. Mr. Carl Liljegren was somewhat inadequate in his role of "Store Sven;" the calm self-reliant farmer was too much for Mr. Liljegren. The daughter of "Ola i Gyllby" was portrayed by Mrs. Ellen Graf; if the attire of "Ola" seemed too ragged, there could be no complaint that he had not 'dressed up' his daughter. Mr. Robert Johnson played the role of "Wilhelm," the son of the big farmer. He displayed altogether too much joy in meeting his old student comrade "Erik;" and the same fault was evident when it became his duty to console the sorrowing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leopold Kjellman played the role of "Jan Hanson," the sharecropper, very satisfactorily, and Mrs. Augusta Milton was equally--good as the sharecropper's wife "Anika." Mr. Christopher Brusell, the director of the Society, acted the role of "Anders," the servant boy of "Jan Hanson."</p>
   
   <p>Especially in those tragic scenes where his role called for a display of self-sacrificing love for his fellowmen,was Mr. Brusell's acting so realistic that tears moistened the eyes of a number of people in the audience.</p>
   <p>After the show there was dancing....</p>
