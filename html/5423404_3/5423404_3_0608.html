   <p>It is an old custom in the newspaper world at the beginning of a new year to entertain readers with a survey of the publication's past accomplishments and program for the future, and we do not deny that on such occasions there is a temptation to exaggerate the former and become overambitious in regard to the latter.</p>
   <p>As far as Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter is concerned, a review of the past year is encouraging and should assure continued improvement, progress, and victories, without undue bragging and lofty promises. During the past year we have further secured our prominent position among the country's many Swedish-American newspapers, due to the fact that we are fully aware of and do our best to live up to our great responsibilities as an impartial organ for our Swedish-American public. In spite of the poor times, our mailing list has increased, and we have won many new subscribers not only in American but also in the old fatherland, as well as in other foreign countries. New features and improvement of the old ones have been introduced; more timely illustrations and pictures than ever before have been printed, and in almost every department new ideas have been tried out. In this connection we particularly want to point to the series of colored illustrations accompanying the column under the title "From the World of Phantasy to Reality," which was initiated a few weeks ago.</p>
   <p>Editorially as well as in our general reading material, we follow a truly liberal policy with due respect for the opinions of others and a desire to be humane and do justice to everybody, without permitting our outlook to be misdirected by reactionary or egotistical considerations. In this respect our past record may be taken as a true indication of future action.</p>
   <p>There is not much to be added concerning our program for the year which has just begun. We shall, of course, always continue to improve our plant and product whenever and wherever possible, within such limits as our financial situation permits.</p>
   
   <p>Also this year the interests of our readers shall come first, editorially as well as in the choice of general articles and news items, and all sound and sincere efforts toward human betterment may count on our support.</p>
   <p>We shall in the future, as we have done in the past, champion the cause of the real producers, the farmers, and industrial as well as other workers, and support them in their struggle against exploitation by the powerful corporations. The most important items on our program are: Freedom, Justice, and Tolerance. Reaction, in whatever form it may appear, we shall always oppose.</p>
   <p>The past year has been a rather difficult one for all newspapers, and not least for the Swedish-American publications. Expenditures have increased in spite of generally falling commodity prices, and for this reason many American dailies and periodicals have been forced to raise their subscription rates, but we shall continue to give full value for one dollar per year. This low price was set in accordance with the low production costs which prevailed a few years ago. But at the present time the price of paper, wages in the printing trade, and almost everything else connected with the publishing of a newspaper are higher, and it is due to the increase in sales that we are able to maintain this low price. But we are barely making ends meet, and we hope our subscribers will cooperate with us by paying their bills promptly.</p>
   <p>We have this year presented every subscriber with a calendar and an alamanac, more attractive and with more interesting contents than ever before.</p>
   <p>We want all our friends to know that we sincerely appreciate the encouraging support which they have given us in the past, and hope that they also will stand by us in the future.</p>
   <p>Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter pledges itself to do everything within its power to justify their confidence.</p>
