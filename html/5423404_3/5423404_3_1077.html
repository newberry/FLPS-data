   <p>Valkyria Lodge No. 1 of the Independent Order Ladies of Vikings celebrated its 25th anniversary last Wednesday by an animated banquet at the Verdani Hall, 5015 N. Clark St.</p>
   <p>The lodge was organized on April 17th 1904, by wives and daughters of members of the Frithiof Lodge. There were 17 charter members, 10 of whom have died or moved away. The remaining seven were present at this banquet as guests of honor.</p>
   <p>The Valkyria Lodge is the original women's lodge out of which the Independent Order Ladies of Vikings has grown into a powerful organization. There are now a number of lodges and the membership runs into thousands. The Valkyria Lodge now has more than 400 members and more than $7,000 in its treasury.</p>
