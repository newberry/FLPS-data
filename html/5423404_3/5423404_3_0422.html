   <p>The Scandinavians, who one must admit, know how to organize amusements, had a picnic the day before yesterday at Washington Heights. More than 8000 people were there. Mr. C. G. Lange, as first speaker, pointed out how the Scandinavians secured their rights in social and political matters through their concord. Other speakers were: Consul Charles Sundell, Johnson, and Nic. Hansen. Mr. Washington Hesing also said a few words and praised especially the harmony prevailing amongst the Scandinavians. The celebration was a success from every point of view.</p>
