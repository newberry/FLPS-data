   <p>This society held a meeting last Monday at the First Methodist Church to make arrangements with the choir for the large midsummer festival in Columbia Park to be held in the evening of June 23rd. The meeting was attended by most of the singers, and under the leadership of Professor Ortengren. The choir will give a program which will surely please the public especially all lovers of Swedish songs.</p>
   <p>This singing society has more than any other Swedish organizations lifted the Swedish name and upheld interest in the Fatherland's Songs. When asked to celebrate the 200th anniversary as a memory to Swedish honored son Carl VonLinne, this society was not asleep. Where ever you find a Svithiod Society you will know that it is of the group that renders the greatest financial help to people from Sweden.</p>
   <p>In the past year this Society has donated over $300,000. to the needy in the form of help for the sick, and care of widows and orphans. In 1906 they paid out over $48,000. When a member and countryman had been unfortunate, it was the National Society that took the matter in hand, the money necessary was obtained among the members of Svithiod Society. When a burial place was necessary for this member a grant was made, later the Svithiod Society also befriended his son and found a home for him. When the question came up about supporting a non-secretarian old people's home in Park Ridge, Illinois, Svithiod members were always ready to take up offerings and to make donations. At the Society's midsummer festival at Columbia Park you may rest assured if you attend you will receive full value for your money.</p>
