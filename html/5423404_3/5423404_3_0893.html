   <p>In an earlier issue of this paper, we mentioned the coming lecture tour in America by Prof. Oscar Montelius, and we now announce that October 29 and 31 have been set for two of his lectures. Our countrymen will have the opportunity of hearing him speak twice about the past and present of Sweden, which in itself will be interesting enough to attract a large audience.</p>
   <p>The following is a short biography of this noted lecturer: Oscar Montelius was born Sept. 9, 1843, in Stockholm. In 1861 he entered college and graduated as doctor in 1869. While still a young student, he showed a leaning to public speaking. In 1880 he was sent to Vitterhet Historic Academy, and only last year he was appointed to its Historical Antique Department. Montelius has brought forth <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>epoch-making acomplishments in his work. He stands out as an authority in the educational world and is considered one of the foremost authorities on the question of culture during ancient times. The results of his research have been published in several large volumes. Our old fatherland's oldest historian, Prof. Montelius, is not only one of our great authorities on historical writing's, but also one of our most talented speakers. During his visit here he spoke at various universities about the lives of the old Northmen.</p>
