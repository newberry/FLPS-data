   <p>Time moves on without ever stopping for a rest; the years roll by quickly, and century is added to centuries. We are now about to enter a new year, and nobody knows what it has in store for us. But, as has been our custom, we wish to convey to our esteemed readers our hearty felicitations and best wishes, and to add to them our sincere thanks for the good will and co-operation which we have enjoyed during the past year, and the hope that this happy relationship will prevail in the future.</p>
   <p>It has been said that the value of a newspaper is determined by its contents and general policies. Does it stand for what is right? Does it try to promote the common good? And does it try to bring about unity of purpose among its readers, helping them toward even higher achievements? Does it dare <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>voice its honest convictions, and is its language, tone, and general contents such that it may safely be placed in the hands of any member of the family?</p>
   <p>If a person is interested in sound progress and a better life for all, he should subscribe for, and recommend to his friends, such newspapers as are known to be based on these principles. For the more widespread the support these papers receive, the better are they able to fulfill their high purposes.</p>
   <p>The Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter has always kept abreast of the times, and has tried to follow what it believes to be sound developmental lines, without permitting itself to be thrown off its course by demoralizing influences which always exist in one form or another. And we have a right to feel that our efforts have met with considerable success, for we receive daily proofs that our readers have confidence in us and that the Tribunen has become the leading Swedish newspaper in America. But a newspaper which realizes its responsibilities and duties is never content to rest on its laurels. Just as a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>sensible person always faces the facts, so will a newspaper of the kind which the Tribunen tries to be, interpret the problems and events of the times and present them to the public in their proper light and in an unbiased manner. The influence of a newspaper increases as it succeeds in conceiving realities and conveying them to its readers. To do this has been, is, and will always be the ambition of the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter.</p>
   <p>We have often pointed out that as a Swedish-American newspaper, the Tribunen's chief purpose is to serve as a connecting medium for people of the Swedish race scattered throughout America, and also as a link between the people in the old country and their fellow countrymen in the New World. Aside from this special task, the Tribunen subscribes to the same high ideals that any other wide-awake, progressive newspaper professes, regardless of the language in which it is printed. Our readers will always find in our columns the latest American and world news, and timely articles in which current problems and events are discussed. We dare say that nothing much of importance escapes our <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>attention. We are of and for the common people, and labor and the underprivileged find in us a champion. Our position in this respect is clear, and, together with our political independence, has won for us a secure place in the hearts of our public.</p>
   <p>It is not for a newspaper to sit in authoritative judgment upon men and events and to issue orders, but neither should it be content simply to reflect the ever-shifting opinions and happenings of the day. Its duty is to encourage high ideals, and to develop good taste and a sense of propriety in itself as well as in its public. Under no circumstances should it sacrifice its journalistic dignity. The Tribunen always tries to keep its contents on a high level, and it refrains from printing anything whose wholesome effect may be doubtful.</p>
   <p>During the coming year, the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter will remain faithful to its high traditions, and will further secure its position as America's foremost Swedish newspaper. In its columns, readers will find well-selected news from <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Sweden and from Swedish communities in this country, as well as American and world news, good serials and short stories, humor and satire. Our special departments will continue as usual, with improvements here and there as opportunity permits, and in every issue there will be special articles by the best Swedish pens in this country and abroad. We shall do our utmost to maintain the fruitful relationship between this paper and the culturally interested Swedish public, and shall spare no effort or expense to make the Tribunen as interesting and attractive as possible. Among the special features which we have planned for the immediate future is a series of articles under the heading "The Land of My Fathers," in which a young American describes his impressions and observations during a recent visit to Sweden.</p>
   <p>The increased circulation of the Tribunen during the past year and the many tokens of good will and appreciation which we have received have been encouraging and have caused us much satisfaction. Our friends will be glad to know that we have seventy-five hundred subscribers in Sweden alone.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Our continued progress has been, and always will be due to the mutual confidence and good will between the paper and its readers; and to all those who boost us in one way or another, we extend our hearty thanks. Hoping that this pleasant relationship will grow ever closer and stronger in the years to come, we wish one and all a Happy New Year!</p>
