   <p>The Order of Vasa is a live strong, and widely spread organization with headquarters in Providence, R. I. The Order is now trying to extend itself to the central and western states and intends to found a new lodge here in Chicago, and in other places. The Great Master of the Order, Olof Wallster, and deputy T. S. Osterberg, are here for that special purpose.</p>
   <p>The Order has been in existence for about eleven years, and has already six district lodges and 130 local lodges, with a membership of 11,000, and a mutual fund of approximately $100,000. The Order is very widespread in the eastern states, but has lodges in Pennsylvania and in California, also. Its purpose is to render help to the sick, and those in need; to unite the Swedes, and to foster a social atmosphere among them. The Order does hope to get money enough to build a Home for Aged very soon.</p>
   <p>A meeting will be held next Friday at Geneva Hall, 1-3 North Clark Street <span class="page-break">2</span>to discuss plans for the extension of the Order in and outside Chicago. Everybody interested is cordially invited to attend this meeting.</p>
