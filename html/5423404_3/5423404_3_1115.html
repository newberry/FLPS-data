   <p>The Scandinavian Fraternal League, a national sick benefit and funeral aid organization, has been recently conducting an energetic campaign in Chicago, with the result that 500 new members will be inducted into eleven of its Chicago and vicinity lodges at a ceremony to be held in the Coliseum Annex on Sunday evening, March 29. Superior Court Judge Harry Olson will speak, and there will be drill demonstrations, dancing, and other entertainment.</p>
   <p>The league has now some 18,000 members, men and women, almost as many as the Danish Brotherhood, and its monthly membership paper, of the same type as that of the Sons of Norway, shows a nice annual profit.</p>
   <p>The majority of members are Swedish but the president is a Dane, and so is the district president of the Chicago lodges.</p>
