   <p>p.7. Congress appropriated $35,000 towards the erection of a monument to our renowned countryman John Ericsson. A committee of three persons has also been appointed to handle the erection of this monument. This committee consists of Senator Wm. D. Sharp, Congressman James L. Slayden and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. Mr. Daniels is the committee's chairman.</p>
   <p>The committee has sent out a letter advising of the formation of an advisory committee of thirty-five well-known Swedish-Americans to work in unison with the congressional committee to further the project.</p>
   <p>This latter committee consist of the following persons: S. Adolf Eckberg, chairman; John Aspegren, Hans Lagerlof, John J. Bergquist, G. Hilmer Lundbeck, Emil F. Johnson, Axel S. Hedman, Chas K. Johanson, Albin Gustafson, Eric Oberg, Dr. Johannes H. Hoving, A. G. Liftner, Charles A. Ogren, Frank Carlson, Gus <span class="page-break">\2</span>Pearson-Wern; Carl E. Bohman and Dr.F.G. Leach all of New York, N.Y.; Edward C. Westman, A. Lanquist; Henry S. Henschen; John Ericsson and C. S. Peterson of Chicago; P. A. Peterson of Rockford, Ill.; J. E. Chillberg, of Seattle, Wash.; C. L. Eckman and Samuel A. Carlson of Jamestown, N.Y.; George N. Jeppson, Worchester, Mass.; Swan J. Turnblad, Minneapolis, Minn.; Ruben Heidenblad, Worchester, Mass.; Nelson G. Thorson, Omaha, Neb.; Oscar E. Lindblom, McKeesport, Pa. ; F. O. Hoagland, Hartford, Conn.; Dr. Theo. O. Peterson, Brooklyn, N.Y.; Dr. J. E. Westerlund, Cambridge, Ill.; and Casimir von Phelps, Bethlehem, Pa.</p>
   <p>In the first place the committee's work will be to receive plans for the monument and to prepare adequately for appropriate festivities in connection with the dedication. Further, the committee must decide whether or not $35,000 is sufficient for a worthy monument to an eminently worthy son, Captain Ericsson.</p>
   <p>The letter calls attention to the fact that the monuments erected in Washington to the memory of Baron von Steuben, Pulaski, Rochambo and others were raised through public subscription, whereas the John Ericsson monument is the first of <span class="page-break">\3</span>its kind sponsored by the government. It is considered desirable that the Art Academy of Stockholm be invited to submit competitive plans for the monument; also that the committee visit Sweden and request that the Swedish Nation be represented at the dedication, for example, by the Crown Prince and a Man-of-War.</p>
   <p>The Swedish-American advisory committee will have its first meeting at Hotel Vanderbilt on November 25, 1916, beginning with a luncheon at oneo'clock. Invited to the meeting are: Colonel Wm. C. Church; Royal Swedish Minister, W. A. F. Ekengren and Consul General Magnus Clarholm, New York, N. Y.</p>
