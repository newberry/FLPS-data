   <p>The Swedish Dramatic Society, under leadership of Mr. Ernst Behmer, will open its season on Saturday September 23, at the Music Hall in the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Avenue..... On this occasion the farce, "Uncle Knut from Norrkoping," will be presented for the first time in America. On account of unexpected circumstances, this first presentation by the company cannot be given as planned at Illinois Theatre, and for that reason, the Music Hall has been engaged especially for this occasion. During the season, future plays by the Society will be given at the Illinois Theatre as in former seasons. The play to be presented on Saturday is new, and is of the most interesting character, a farce of the first class, well written, with scenes of varying features, of irresistible jollity, but is also of touching seriousness and sadness.</p>
