   <p>Chicago has taken the initiative to found a Gymnastic and Athletic Society in the Western States similar to what the Swedish athletes did in the east three years ago. The club will try to build up a large and strong organization and through cooperation and yearly races it hopes to boost the interest for Swedish gymnastics forward, and to extend the working field.</p>
   <p>Everybody interested in this matter is cordially invited to a meeting to be held Sunday, Mar. 22, at Glnecks Hall. A committee of two persons will be chosen to lead the meeting. All correspondence should be forwarded to Scandia Gymnastic and Athletic Club, 327 Sedgwick Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
