   <p>The Swedish Theater Society presented "Rosenpa Tistelon" by Emilie Flygare-Carlen, at the Grand Opera House last Sunday. It was dramatized by Maurits Cramer, picturing the life among the fishermen in Bohuslan, Sweden, but judging from the performance, Mr. Cramer did not seem to have good luck with his dramatization. Most of the players performed their best, but the play was monotonous, sad, and without any really dramatical points. The attendance was good, but the public seemed bored.</p>
