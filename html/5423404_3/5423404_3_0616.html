   <p>The ideal striven for and looked forward to by the publishers of Swedish-American newspapers has now materialized. The publishers can put into the hands of Swedish-Americans an outstanding paper, edited by men who are liberal-minded, thoroughly patriotic, and unceasingly active in fighting for the right. Untiring effort is now rewarded, with the result that Chicago's two largest Swedish papers, Svenska Tribunen and Svenska Nyheter have merged and from today on will be published as Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter (Swedish Tribune-News).</p>
   <p>To the 27,000 subscribers and 100,000 readers and friends of Svenska Nyheter we present a paper that for thirty-seven years has been outstanding as a reliable light for the guidance of the sons, daughters and grandchildren of Moder Svea (Mother Sweden) of America, especially in Chicago and other parts <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the Middle West.</p>
   <p>Svenska Tribunen was founded in Galva, Illinois, in 1869, under the name of Nya Verlden (The New World). Four years later it was bought by Andrew Chaiser of Chicago, and the liberal-minded C. F. Peterson became its editor. Nya Verlden's home in Chicago did not last long; following the world-famous Chicago Fire the infant publication was taken to Galesburg, Illinois. A year later, when the rebuilding of Chicago was making good progress, Chicago became its permanent home.</p>
   <p>In 1877, the Swedish Publishing Company was organized, with Frank A. Anderson as president; Chaiser and Peterson also held stock in the new company. In the fall of 1877, Colonel H. Matson also became a stockholder. At this time the C. J. Stenquist Company bought a paper which had been organized three years before Nya Verlden, the Swedish-American. At this time Nya Verlden and the Swedish-American merged, taking the name of Svenska Tribunen.</p>

   <p>With C. F. Peterson as editor, the new paper was a liberal publication; when the talented journalist, C. G. Linderborg, became the editor the paper became very conservative. Leonard Gyllenhaal succeeded Linderborg, and during his editorial rule the Tribune remained conservative. The policy of the paper became less conservative and more pleasant, when, on May 10, 1905, C. F. Erickson became the proprietor and publisher. He has made every effort, through every department of the paper, to send a pleasant and fresh breeze over the Swedish colony, and in this he has been very gratifyingly successful.</p>
   <p>Svenska Tribunen, which today merged with Svenska Nyheter, was a free, liberal, and progressive paper which stood firmly on its own feet.</p>
   <p>Now, a few words to the 32,000 subscribers of Svenska Tribunen. The young, liberty-loving, progressive paper, for years known as Svenska Nyheter, was born in January, 1890, in Chicago, though it was originally christened Humoristen (The Humorist). Gus Broberg was its founder and has been a dominant influence on it ever since. America's best-known humorists were contributors to Humoristen; <span class="page-break">\4</span>among them were such outstanding lords of wit as O. A. Linder, Ville Akerberg, Ernst Lindblom, Gustaf Wicklund, and the inimitable Gus Higgins.</p>
   <p>In 1898, Mr. Broberg decided to change the content of the publication and make it more serious in tone. Instead of an entirely humorous paper there appeared a newspaper under the new name of Svenska Nyheter. The new paper was increasingly successful from its inception, on December 12, 1898, until today, when it merged with its only equal in Chicago, Svenska Tribunen, to become Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter.</p>
   <p>Today the foregoing publications are presented in consolidated form to the subscribers of both. As proven by their progress and principles, both these papers have outgrown their childhood shoes. Each has had its ups and downs, and its victorious battles; each has fought its battles with eyes open and weapons in perfect working order. We have no doubt that the merger will be well-liked, and that it will prove to be to the advantage of our readers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>From now on, our economic affairs will be managed by the veteran, Gus Broberg, while the chair of general manager will be occupied by another highly esteemed man, Mr. C. F. Erickson. The editorial responsibility will be assumed by Anders Tofft, C. G. Norman, Frithiof Malmquist, Nils Mannow, and Gosta Westman.</p>
   <p>Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter, with its 200,000 readers, most of whom are prosperous citizens and liberal buyers, feels secure in stating that no other medium will reach more readily into homes where there is ability to buy and interest in advertisements than today's greatest Swedish publication.</p>
   <p>We trust that we will be as welcome in Swedish homes as were both papers before the merger, and that our talents, thus combined, may multiply the benefits to our combined subscribers, numbering 55,000, and to our readers, conservatively estimated at a quarter of a million in the United States and Sweden.</p>
