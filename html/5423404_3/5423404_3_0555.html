   <p>Last week, the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter received the following letter, which came too late to be included in the jubilee issue:</p>
   <p>"On the occasion of the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's fiftieth anniversary I wish to express my sincere thanks for all that the paper has done for the dissemination and preservation of Swedish culture in America, for the maintenance and strengthening of friendly ties between Sweden and America, as well as for its fine work in the service of general enlightenment and public education. At the same time, I send to the paper my best wishes for the future. I am sure that it will remain true to its great traditions, and will continue its valuable cultural mission.</p>
