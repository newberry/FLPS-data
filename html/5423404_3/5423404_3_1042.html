   <p>The Norsemen of Chicago have honored the memory of Leif Ericson by erecting a magnificent statue of this Viking in Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>The statue was unveiled last Saturday and more than fifteen different Norwegian organizations took part in the ceremony.</p>
   <p>In spite of the cold weather, a great number of carriages wended their way from Skandia Hall to Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. I. Eluig greeted the Norsemen and introduced O. A. Thorp, who delivered the unveiling address.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thorp spoke of the Vikings' discovery of America, on whose shore between latitude 40 and 47, they founded a new colony, their number being about one thousand.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society sang the Norwegian National Anthem.</p>
   <p>The statue was dedicated to the West Park Board of Chicago by Mr. L. E. Olson. It was duly received by the Park's president, F. A. Bongo, in a short address of acceptance.</p>
   <p>The cost of the statue is about $10,000, which amount has been in the process of accumulation since 1892. At a banquet later in the Sherman House, the banker Paul O. Stensland spoke.</p>
