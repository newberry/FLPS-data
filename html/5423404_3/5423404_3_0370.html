   <p>The sick benefit society, Nordstjernan, (North Star) celebrated its twenty-second annual picnic at Elliott's Park, last Sunday. Almost 2,000 persons were present and enjoyed a glorious day.</p>
   <p>Miss F. Paaren, 5749 Lowe Avenue, was chosen the mid-summer bride from among five contesting maidens. The festival speech was delivered by lawyer, O. C. Peterson, and songs were rendered by the society's chorus.</p>
   <p>The program of races ended with both runners and spectators taking to their heels to escape a sudden shower. The contestants in the race were L. J. Bender, H. Gustafson, Frank Hedstrom, Mrs. C. Hamlin, and Mrs. Berglin. In spite of the rain, the day was still an enjoyable one.</p>
