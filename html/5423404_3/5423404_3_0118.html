   <p>On Sunday, March 18, the Svenska Dramatiska Selskapet (Swedish Dramatic Society) presented a high class Swedish historical drama by Zacharius Topelius, at the Garrick Theatre, entitled "Gustaf II Adolf och Regina von Emmeritz." The well-known historical event drew a full house for the opening show, and was given unstinted applause throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>Miss Ida Ostergren, who made her first Chicago appearance, thoroughly won the audience with her great talent and a wonderful personality, as she played the part of "Regina von Emmeritz," the leading feminine role.</p>
   <p>The leading male character "Gustaf II Adolf" (Gustaf Adolf II) was played by Carl Liljigren, who proved his ability to handle high grade roles in an excellent manner, the equal of any professional, and second to none. The entire cast was exceptionally well presented by the home talent players, all members of the Society.</p>

   <p>A storm of applause is always welcomed and encouraging, but there is one thing most desirable: that the entire audience would use more discretion as to when the applause should be given. Sectional outbursts disturb both the players and the appreciative portion of the audience.</p>
