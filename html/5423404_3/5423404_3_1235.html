   <p>To the Swedish-Americans:</p>
   <p>Once more a year has passed, full of hard work and rich in experience for the Swedish National Association and its officers. But we also realize that the year has been notable for the progress achieved in the noble task which has been the honor and strength of the Association since it was first organized. Willingly did the Swedes in Chicago stand by the Association with advice and deeds, of which there has been such great need. For every day Swedes come to this country to whom the lines from Havamal might well apply: "A man without friends, however strong [he may be], will die like a tree in the desert." This saying is as true today as it was a thousand years ago; [it has] perhaps even more [relevance] for the Swedes coming to a strange country than for their relatives [who remain at] home in the North. For all about us we find compatriots who lack friends, who lack bread, who are weak <span class="page-break">\2</span>and without employment. The plight of these people is worse than sad, and dark looms the future ahead of them. Many of them suffer in silence; not a complaint reaches your ears, not a sigh disturbs your heart. It is in behalf of these unfortunate compatriots of ours--male and female--....that we appeal, in the name of the Swedish National Association, to the Swedish-Americans in general and to our Swedish societies in Chicago in particular for the same warmhearted support of our work and activities during the coming year as was rendered during the year that is gone.</p>
