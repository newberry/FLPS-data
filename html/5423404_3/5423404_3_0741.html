   <p>Nordic National Hymns and Other Homeland Songs is the title of a collection of poetry, the author of which is Ernst Wendbladh. The little volume is attractive in appearance, with the blue and yellow flag on the cover. It contains thirteen poems; a strong current of profound love for the fatherland runs through all of them. The first one, "Greeting to the Students from Lund" is dedicated to the singing students from the University of Lund, who recently visited this country.</p>
   <p>In "Nordic National Hymn," Mr. Wendbladh has attempted to create a poem which may become the common property of the three northern countries, and points out in his foreword that such a song should be "devoid of empty bragging and barbaric passion for war and martial qualities." This ideal is truly embodied in the poem.</p>
   <p>A couple of the songs have appeared in Svenska Nyheter; our readers undoubtedly remember the beautiful and powerful "Sverige" (Sweden).</p>
