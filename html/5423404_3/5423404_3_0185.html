   <p>We reported some time ago that the Scandinavian Council, charged with laying the groundwork for Scandinavian participation in the World's Fair, which will be held here in 1933, had decided to send a delegation to the Scandinavian countries, for the purpose of directing the attentions of the governments as well as of the people of the respective nations to that big event.</p>
   <p>The delegation, which was appointed by Rufus C. Dawes, president of the Fair, consists of Charles S. Peterson, vice-president of the Fair, Allan D. Albert, an assistant to Mr. Dawes, Herbert P. Hedman, chairman of the Swedish Fair Committee, Ove Mett, and Palmer Dawes. The latter is a son of Rufus Dawes.</p>
   <p>These men left early this week for the East, where they will embark for Scandinavia on one of the Norwegian America Line's boats. They plan to visit not only the capitals of the Scandinavian countries, but also a number of smaller cities.</p>

   <p>Those associated with the preparations for the exposition expect good results from this publicity trip across the ocean, and in order to facilitate the work of the delegates a pamphlet has been prepared. It is printed in Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, and in it the main features of the exposition are outlined. We quote from the Swedish edition:</p>
   <p>"The delegates desire an opportunity to present the plans for the projected exposition to the leaders within the various spheres of activity in Sweden, in the hope of arousing in them an active interest, so that they will convey to the entire nation our most cordial invitation to participate in this world event.</p>
   <p>"The people of Chicago realize that the centennial observance of a community is not, in itself, of sufficient interest to warrant a world-wide participation in it, but we wish to point out two significant facts which, we think, justify our hopes for just such participation. First, that Chicago is the largest <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>world city whose entire history does not go back more than one hundred years and, secondly, that our metropolis is exclusively a product of modern city-building methods."</p>
   <p>The pamphlet concludes with the following paragraph:</p>
   <p>"Chicago and America invite Sweden to join us in this undertaking, and hope that such co-operation will lead to even closer friendship and better understanding between our two nations. We wish you to share with us not only our work but also our pride in an undertaking of which science is the brain, industry the body, and beauty the soul."</p>
