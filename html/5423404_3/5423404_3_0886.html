   <p>An unusually interesting lecture was given last Friday in the Methodist Episcopal Church, Clark and Washington Streets, by Mrs. C. O. Young, under the auspices of the Sophia Society, the well-known Swedish charity organization.</p>
   <p>The subject was Tegner's undying "Frithiof's Saga," and Mrs. Young gave her audience a word picture of the Swedish Saga period which held it spellbound from beginning to end, and which was rewarded with the most enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Attorney George Q. Johnson told briefly of the work done by the Sophia Society among sick and unfortunate people, mostly of Swedish nationality. Similar lectures, accompanied by other entertainment, will be given by this Society from time to time, alternately in the Swedish and in the English language, and the public has here a chance to support a good cause and at <span class="page-break">\2</span>the same time enjoy an instructive and interesting evening.</p>
