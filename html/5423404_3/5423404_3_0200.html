   <p>The Chicago West-Side Lodges of the Order of Svithiod held a joint Mid-Winter Festival last Sunday at the North-West Hall.</p>
   <p>A mammoth installation of 110 new members, distributed among the participating lodges, had been staged. A diversified program followed, during which films of Col. Lindbergh's flying feat and episodes from the Great World War were shown in addition to a "special Svithiod firm" showing the various activities within the Order during the past year.</p>
   <p>A contest between the ceremonial staffs of the lodges was won by the Nore Lodge No. 18. The trophy, an engraved shield, was awarded by Municipal Court Judge William E. Helander.</p>
