   <p>The Swedish-American Women's Club held its monthly entertainment last Friday evening at the elegant residence of Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Ostergren, 2939 Vernon Avenue. In spite of the inclement weather, a large number was present to enjoy the program which was exceptionally good. The musical numbers presented by Mrs. Hausch, nee von Zedeler, and her two daughters, were especially enjoyed. Their instruments were violin and flute. Mrs. Ostergren filled her place as hostess with her usual tact and capability, and the refreshments served were of the very best.</p>
   <p>The income from the entertainment was very liberal, due especially to a large donation by Mr. Klas Ostergren. The money is to be used for the alleviation of need among our poorer countrymen.</p>
