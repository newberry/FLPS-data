   <p>Last Sunday night, the Swedish National Society celebrated its Midwinter festival at the Auditorium by presenting an historical play by Zacharias Topelius, called "Gustaf II Adolf and Regina von Emmeritz." It was played by The Swedish Dramatical Society, assisted by Harmony Singing Club, Scandia Gymnastics Athletic Club, and John Meck's orchestra. Before the performance started, a bust of King Oscar II was presented by Attorney G. B. Anderson to the Swedish National Society on behalf of the Swedish Dramatical Society, and modeled by the sculpture C. J. Nilsson. Miss Ida Ostergren and Prof. John R. Ortengren played the leading roles in the performance. The net income of the festival goes to charity.</p>
