   <p>Randvar The Songsmith, a book recently published by McClurgs, has vastly increased the admirers of Miss Ottilie A. Liljenkrantz, who was already highly esteemed by the American public, especially the Scandinavian-American circles in Chicago. Her first work, The Thrall of Leif the Lucky, brought out numerous prophecies that more works of an equally high quality would come from her pen.</p>
   <p>We, especially, Chicago Swedes, are proud of Ottilie's wonderful success, as she was born and reared here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Both the aforementioned books are of special interest to all Scandinavian people as they recount important incidents formerly preserved by the old-time Saga of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.</p>
   <p>The esteemed author has announced no plans for future works. She lives a quiet, unassuming life in the home of her father in Chicago who is a well-known engineer.</p>
