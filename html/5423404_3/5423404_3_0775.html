   <p>Last Sunday was a notable day in the history of the Swedish-American press. For the first time, a Swedish-American newspaper arranged the filming of a strictly Swedish-American event, namely, the celebration of Swedish Day in Ravinia Park. And we are happy to inform our readers that the newspaper in question was the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter. The Swedish Good Templars of Chicago were in charge of the celebration and the filming of the event was just another demonstration of this paper's determination to keep up with the times.</p>
   <p>It was quite appropriate that our first venture in this type of news service should be associated with the celebration of Swedish Day. This annual event is attended by a larger number of Swedish-American men and women than appear at any other similar gathering. And it is so typically Swedish. The film <span class="page-break">\2</span>will therefore be of unusual interest, even to people who live in other parts of the country. And, furthermore, this day is especially dedicated to Swedish youth. Clean healthy Swedish-American young men and women spend the day frolicking on the green, just as is the custom at such festivals in the old country. Many a young man and woman who are struggling to carve out a future for themselves in the big city on Lake Michigan return to their daily tasks with happy memories of this Swedish Day celebration, memories which will stay with them for years to come.</p>
   <p>The events of the day are now recorded, so that the participants may "see themselves as others see them". They will pass in review for the first time next Sunday on the silver screen of the Julian Theater. Here are some of the scenes that will be shown: the parade at the opening of the program; a view of the large crowd; J. E. Odell speaks; the flag-raising ceremony; the dance around the Maypole; a group of young people in national costumes; the football game; a prospective Midsummer queen; children in national costumes; the arrangements <span class="page-break">\3</span>committee; national folk dances. This, and much more, can be seen at the Julian Theater next Sunday.</p>
