   <p>The Internationally Famous Swedish Economist, Professor Gustaf Cassel, is in Chicago for the purpose of delivering a series of lectures at the University of Chicago,</p>
   <p>His sojourn in America up to now has been devoted chiefly to lecture engagements at the Universities of Philadelphia, Princeton, Yale, Harvard and Cornell. In these lectures he explained and discussed the program outlined by him before the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives at Washington, D.C., and which embodies a systematic application of a process to avoid the unnecessary fluctuations of the value of gold.</p>
   <p>Professor Cassel's first lecture in Chicago was held last Monday in the Mandel Hall at the U. of C. His subject was "International Trade, Capital Movements and Exchanges." This afternoon he will lecture at the same place on "The Utility of Foreign Investments" and again on June 27 on "The War Debts."</p>
