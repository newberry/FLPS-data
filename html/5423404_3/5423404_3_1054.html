   <p>A grateful generation will give deserved tribute to the immortal Linne, father of botany, by dedicating his monument in Lincoln Park today. The festivities are to be held under the auspices of the Linnean Monument Association and several Swedish and Scandinavian clubs, which affilated themselves with the movement. The point of departure will be at 155 East Chicago Ave. at 2 P.M. From there the members march to Lincoln Park. Music and speeches are on the program. A continuation of the festivities will be given at Thielmann's Summer Garden, north of the park, where a wonderful concert, both instrumental and vocal,will bring the celebration to a fitting end.</p>
   <p>The speaker's list contains such well known names as Mr. Robert Lindblom, Dr.F. Larson, Mayor Washburne, etc.</p>

   <p>The statue of Linne is thirty-nine feet high; its cost, including the allegorical figures which belong to the monument and to be added later, is $22,000. The figure in itself is fourteen and one-half feet tall. The location is at the continuation of Fullerton Ave., in Lincoln Park. The money has been donated mostly by the Swedes of Chicago. The monument is a copy of the Linne memorial of Stockholm, which was dedicated several years ago. The figure comes from the atelier of Otto Meyer &amp; Co., the model, however, is the work of C.J.Defoeman. The granite work for the pedestal is the product of contractor Anderson of Prose Hill. .....</p>
   <p>The officials who founded the Linne' Association are: Robert Lindbloom, Pres., and eleven others, almost all of whom are Swedish.</p>
   <p>The arrangements which have been made for today, will undoubtedly induce thousands to go to Lincoln Park. All honor to the Swedes, who intend to perpetuate the memory of their famous countryman. It is a duty for the German to participate in the festival which has been given in honor of the renowned scientist.</p>
