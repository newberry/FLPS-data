   <p>Skanska Gillet (Scania Club) last Saturday celebrated its annual goose festival, this time in the hall of the Swedish Club. The fact of the Scanians choosing the Swedish Club as their hall of celebration may be significant; the Scanians may be realizing that they, too, are Swedes.</p>
   <p>The most important part of the celebration in which about two-hundred Scanians took part, was of course the traditional goose dinner preceded by the equally traditional black soup and followed by the rice pudding, a common desert in Scania. In addition, there was the Scania liquor, odsakra. For the Scanians, food means a great deal, and the food offered at the celebration was truly delicious.</p>

   <p>After the dinner, the speeches began, most of them in true Scanian dialect, and they were well received and applauded.</p>
   <p>Not until far into the night did the celebrants make their way homeward, all agreeing that it was the best Scanian celebration of many a long year.</p>
