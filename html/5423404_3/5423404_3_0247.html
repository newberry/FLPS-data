   <p>A joint invitation from the Swedish Engineers Society, the Swedish-American Club, the Order of Vikings, and several other Chicago organizations, to our celebrated countryman, Lieut. Erik H. Nelson, U.S.A., asking him to visit us has been accepted. At a general meeting of the various organizations, held last Saturday at the Swedish Club, a committee was elected as follows: Chas. H. Rosberg, Chairman; Nels Otto Johnson, Secretary; Nils J. Lindskoog, ticket holder, and C.E. Carson, Treasurer. It was tentatively decided to give Lieut. Nelson a mammoth banquet at the Rainbow Gardens either April 16th or 23rd.</p>
