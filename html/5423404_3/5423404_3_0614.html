   <p>It is unusual, indeed, for us to make an announcement of our plans in midsummer,but due to the consolidation of Chicago's two largest and best Swedish publications, we feel compelled to give you information for your guidance at this time.</p>
   <p>Our main object is to supply our Swedish colony and other Swedes with a real paper at a low price. In order that all may be benefited we have arranged to present many specialty columns, which we now mention. "Svenska Nyheter" (Swedish News) from our old country will take up about three pages. Only reliable articles will be printed. Foreign news will also have their several columns. "I Forgrunden" (In the Foreground) will give our readers authentic write-ups of Swedes who have gained real prominence here and elsewhere. There will be interesting columns for miners, farmers and industrial workers; a special <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>"Questions and Answers" column for those interested in agriculture and one about Woman and the Home." The "Fria Ordoch Tankar" (Free Word and Thought) column will permit a discussion by readers of any subject of interest to them.</p>
   <p>Our attitude towards debates in the questions and answers column will be strictly impartial and nonpartisan, though we reserve the right in political questions to print our decision as to who we think is the proper man and whether or not a proposed law is beneficial or detrimental, especially in relation to our countrymen.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that our efforts, as outlined above, will meet with the approval of our readers, wherever we may reach them.</p>
