   <p>The Swedish Dramatic Society presented the "Vermlandingarne", last Sunday evening to a crowded house.</p>
   <p>Most things here in the world are subject to the wear of time, to decay, but among things that last long, at least, is evidently Dahlgren's play. Here in Chicago, at least, the play has evidently not lost its attraction for the public. All the players did their work well, and besides the play, the evening offered some fine numbers in singing, and dancing by members of the dance club "Skansen".</p>
