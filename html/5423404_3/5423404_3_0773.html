   <p>Scenes from the recent convention of the Swedish Singers League of America, which was held here in Chicago, were preserved for posterity on film at the initiative of the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter. They are being shown every day of this week at the Julian Theater on Belmont Avenue, which is drawing large crowds on account of this attraction. The views of the parade and of the unveiling of the Swedenborg memorial in Lincoln Park are remarkably good, as are those of the festival in Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>This is the second newsreel of this kind presented by the Tribunen within a few weeks. Both of them have been received with great interest.</p>
