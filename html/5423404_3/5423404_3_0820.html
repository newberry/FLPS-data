   <p>Graduation exercises were held last Saturday, February 1, in the Swedish School of Midwifery, 189 E. Huron Street. Among the graduates were three Scandinavian women: Mrs. Gudivia Jacobson, Miss Hannan Bahrd and Mrs. Ella Olsen.</p>
   <p>This school, which is being conducted by Dr. Sven Windrow, with Miss Anna Malmquist as his chief Assistant, fills a great need in our community, and certainly not least for our Swedish women, of whom not many would be in a position to attend the regular American institutions teaching this subject. It is the only Swedish school,of its kind in the United States, and as a school of this type it enjoys a well-earned reputation. The new course, now in progress, numbers eight students.</p>
