   <p>Work has been received from Stockholm, Sweden, that the models for the four allegorical figures, to be placed around the Linne monument in Lincoln Park park have been completed and that they now are going to the foundry to be executed in bronze. From there they will be shipped to Chicago.</p>
   <p>An intermezzo of sadness is to be recorded in connection with these works of art. The sculpture of the models, the celebrated Swedish artist C. T. Dyfverman, died just a couple of days after the completion and final official inspection and approval of his work.</p>
