   <p>p.11.................The Swedish Cultural Institute has succeeded in making arrangements with the well-known Swedish author, newspaper-man, and travel-lecturer Dr. Hugo Wickstrom, Ph.D. from Ostersund, for a lecture here in the city. This lecture will be held next Sunday afternoon, May twenty-sixth, at 4:00 P.M. in Phoenix Hall, 324 East Division Street, where the famous speaker will discourse on the subject so fraught with meaning to Swedish-Americans, namely: "Varer Svenske" (Be Swedes), and we dare fortell that the public will enjoy a real festive hour since the lecturer is an orator who can in a masterly manner expres "arans och hjaltarnes sprak" (language of honor and heroes).</p>
   <p>Dr. Hugo Wickstrom has made for himself an honored name as an author and lecturer, not only in the old native land, but even far beyond its borders. Everywhere where he has appeared his lectures have been heard with the utmost interest by the large audiences; he has been the subject of much praise by the Swedish press for the substantial material, concise form and easy-to-understand manner of presentation which has marked <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>his lectures, and which by these means have become enjoyable even for the great public.</p>
   <p>The lecturer has made wide travels in foreign lands, and among other countries, has visited Palestine, where Jerusalem especially was the subject of his unusual talent for observation. He has delineated his past travels in an interesting book, which is highly thought of by critics and the public, just off the press in Sweden. The eminent traveler who has newly arrived from Japan and China, has of late lectured at Spokane, Denver, Omaha, Minneapolis and other places, where Swedes in greater numbers are to be found and has everywhere enjoyed the greatest acclaim.</p>
   <p>Seldom is offered such an interesting and elevating event as the affair at Phoenix Hall next Sunday promises to be, and one may predict that it will be very well attended.</p>
