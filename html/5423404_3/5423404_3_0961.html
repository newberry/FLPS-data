   <p>John Frieberg and Bill Demetral, two of the top notchers in the world of wrestling, met last Sunday in a "fight-to-the-finish", in a one-fall bout, at Belmount Hall. Since these two wrestlers, last met, a few months ago, Demetral had met and defeated Stanislaus Zbyszko, so there was a widespread doubt about the outcome of this fight. However, Frieberg emerged the victor.</p>
   <p>It was one of the hardest fought battles ever witnessed and it lasted close to one hour. By frequent applications of "wristlocks" on his Greek opponent, Frieberg finally won the bout.</p>
   <p>In one of the preliminaries, our promising countryman, Johnny Carlin, defeated in two out of three falls, Dick McCarthy, the war-time champion.</p>
