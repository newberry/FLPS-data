   <p>Last Thursday evening, the Drake Lodge, No. 3, I. O. V., accepted a large number of new members at the Wells Hall, 1629 N. Clark Street, the regular meeting place for the lodge. No less than twenty-one new members joined the lodge on this occasion increasing the membership to 325, and it is probable that there will be a continued increase in the membership during the coming summer. A pleasant luncheon was served by the lodge on the occasion, so that the members received full satisfaction, both of physical and mental needs.</p>
