   <p>A play, "Gamla Stockholm," is presented by the Svithiod Singing Club in its hall at 1768 Wrightwood Avenue. The play is attracting a large crowd every night,and is very unique. Here,we recognize several parts imitated from original sections of Stockholm, Sweden, such as "Skomakarekallaren", "Operaterassen", "Bellmansro", "Japanska kafeet", and other places.</p>
