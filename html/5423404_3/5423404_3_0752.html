   <p>The Swedish Glee Club's radio program, heard over station WCFL last Sunday, was a noteworthy performance. Several guest artists took part in it--namely, Mrs. Lillian Palmer, soprano of Waukegan, the tenor, Gunner Sund, the baritone, Joseph Bloomgreen, and the Orion Quartette.</p>
   <p>The studio orchestra also took part in the program, playing three numbers among which were, Grieg's "Anita's Dance" and "Solveig's Song". These numbers were executed with the artistic finesse which one expects from a professional orchestra.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday a Swedish Mother's Day program will be offered over the same station. Attorney C. Hjalmar Lundquist will speak on the subject, "Mother".</p>
