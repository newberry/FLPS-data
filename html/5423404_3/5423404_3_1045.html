   <p>The four figures belonging to the Linnean Statue were placed around the monument last Saturday at Lincoln Park, thus making it complete. The main statue of Linne was unveiled May 23, 1891, and was delivered to the commissioners of Lincoln Park but the four smaller figures were not ready. They are now in their places, figures of women six feet high and representing Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy and Chemistry. The Botany Statue carries a flower in one hand and in the other a magnifying glass. The Zoology figure has a bird and a butterfly; Mineralogy investigates a mineral, and Chemistry is holding a mortar in the left hand and a pestle in the right. The Statue cost $25,000 and was donated by Swedes in America, particularly in Chicago.</p>
