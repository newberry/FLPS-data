   <p>One of the most effective means for preserving our mellifluous Swedish language on this side of the Atlantic is undoubtedly the growth of Swedish societies, which today are more vigorous and extensive than ever before. Within the world of Swedish societies in Chicago, the Order of Vikings, with its fifteen vigorous, youthful lodges, occupies a prominent, perhaps the foremost, place.</p>
   <p>The origin of the Order goes back to 1890. Some keen-minded, clear-sighted sons of the Vikings who had found their living quarters in the mountainous North too cramped met and swore by the age-old sword of Odin that they would organize a society, the fame of which would spread far and wide over the land. Thus the Society of Vikings, which later became the "Order of Vikings", was organized on June 2, 1890. The organizers were Messrs. C. Carlson, G. A. Carlson, C. Henry, N. Hallerts, A. Johnson, V. Muerling, E. Muerling, <span class="page-break">2</span>C. H. Victorin, R. Walden, and A. Walden. These eleven young idealists dedicated their society to the ideal of genuine universal brotherhood. They held regular meetings where they sought a free and open exchange of ideas with no restrictions on topic, and with full respect for one another's opinions.</p>
   <p>But times were changing, and the young men changed with them. They began to realize that the provision of sick benefits and burial assistance was an important function in a society such as they had organized (at first they had considered this function as merely incidental), and they made haste to include these benefits within the scope of their organization.</p>
   <p>We do not intend to discuss the wisdom of the change thus made in the original plan for the society; laws higher than those we are ordinarily willing to acknowledge rule and guide the fortunes of individuals as well as the fate of society at large. If the changes in the original plans had not been necessary, they would probably have not been made.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>As is the case with many societies which are still young and of insignificant membership, the Society of Vikings held its early meetings in the houses of the members. But by October of the year of its origin, the Society had become quite strong, and the Vikings hired Meyers' Hall, corner of Sedgwick and Siegel Streets, for their meetings. The name "Vikings" had already begun to become known and respected within the world of Swedish societies in Chicago. When the Linne statue in Lincoln Park was unveiled in the spring of 1891, the Society of Vikings won strong approval among the Swedes in the city because of the numerical strength and manly bearing of its membership in the parade which the Swedish societies had arranged in honor of the day.</p>
   <p>The Society developed rapidly in strength and influence, and soon had a membership of more than four hundred. At this time, at the suggestion of Mr. J. P. Lundell, a committee was appointed to consider plans for a new and broader form of administration and activity. The results of the work of this committee were presented to the members at a meeting in September, and the Committee's recommendations were adopted. Delegates were chosen, and at a convention held October 3, <span class="page-break">4</span>1892 the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Vikings was founded. The delegates to this meeting of the Vikings were Messrs. A. Holm, A. Carlson, G. Carlson, G. Johnson, O. Anderson, G. Bird, C. H. Victorin, P. A. Noren, A. M. Soderlin, N. P. Grimborg, F. Lind, and A. Walden.</p>
   <p>The primary purposes of the Grand Lodge were: to organize and maintain subordinate lodges; to form a common center where social activities could be held; to arrange for the opening of a reading room; to seek to disseminate good literature among the members; and, as soon as possible, to establish a fund to provide ordinary burial assistance of life insurance.</p>
   <p>True to its characteristic initiative, the new Grand Lodge took immediate steps for the realization of its adopted goal. Two months after it had been created, the organization had the pleasure of initiating the first lodge organized under the Order, Brage No. 2. Three more lodges were organized during the winter: Drake No. 3, Angantyr No. 4, and Frey No. 5, all affiliated with the I. O. V. [Independent Order of Vikings]. In addition, public <span class="page-break">5</span>lectures were given and a library was established.</p>
   <p>For nearly two years the work continued along the lines laid down. Then the demand for...life insurance and sick benefit provisions became so strong that energetic steps had to be taken to arrange for these provisions. The first difficulty encountered by the committee that had been appointed to organize these provisions was that the charter under which the Order had been incorporated was too indefinite to insure complete confidence in the days to come. Various opinions were advanced regarding this problem. Some members held that inasmuch as the I. O. V. had been incorporated under the same laws (act of April 18, 1872) as all the other Swedish societies of this kind, as well as a number of similar American societies, the charter ought to be good enough to meet the future needs of the I. O. V. But this group finally yielded, and a new charter was applied for in the spring of 1895...The requirements for obtaining a charter under the insurance law of 1893 were so exacting, however, that not until November 30, 1895 could the new charter be obtained. On that date the Grand Lodge received from Superintendent of Insurance Bradford K. Durfee <span class="page-break">6</span>the following certificate: [Translator's note: This certificate is reproduced in English, and the following is a faithful copy.]</p>
   <p>"Certificate of Incorporation</p>
   <p>"State of Illinois,</p>
   <p>"Insurance Department,</p>
   <p>"Bradford Durfee, Superintendent.</p>
   <p>"To All Whom These Presents Shall Come:</p>
   <p>"Greeting.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, A certificate of association, duly signed and acknowledged, having been filed in the Insurance Department of the State of Illinois, on the thirtieth day of November, A. D. 1895, for the organization of the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Vikings under and in accordance with the act entitled: 'An act to provide for the organization and management of fraternal beneficiary <span class="page-break">7</span>societies for the purpose of furnishing life indemnity or pecuniary [benefits to] beneficiaries of deceased members or accident or permanent indemnity disability to members hereof; and to control such societies of this State, and providing and fixing the punishment for violation of the provisions thereof, and to repeal all laws now existing which conflict herewith,' approved June 21, 1895, in force July, 1895, a copy of which certificate is hereto attached.</p>
   <p>"Now, therefore, I, Bradford K. Durfee, Insurance Superintendent of the State of Illinois, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the act aforesaid, do hereby certify that the Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Vikings is a legally organized Fraternal Beneficiary Society, under the laws of this State.</p>
   <p>"In testimony whereof I hereunto subscribe my name and affix the seal of my office, at Springfield, State of Illinois, this thirtieth day of November, A. D., 1895.</p>
   <p>"Bradford K. Durfee,</p>
   <p>"Insurance Superintendent"</p>

   <p>Much labor had already been expended upon the revision of the constitution of the Grand Lodge, as well as that of the subordinate lodges, in order to make their provisions correspond, and for the control of the new and, now, chief purpose of the Grand Lodge--life insurance.</p>
   <p>In accordance with decisions adopted previously, the new life insurance and burial assistance provisions became operative. Two months after these provisions became effective, deaths had occurred which necessitated the payment of sixteen hundred dollars. No assessments had been received by the Grand Lodge at that time, and it was necessary to apply money from the capital fund of the Grand Lodge to the settlement of the claims. The plan according to which the assessment table had been calculated has been found, however, to be sound, and the assessments have proven ample to indemnify the capital fund, and, in addition, to make possible the setting aside of a guarantee fund for future emergencies. No claims have thus far been made against the fund which have not been paid.</p>
   <p>The objectives of the Order as well as those of the Grand Lodge are:</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>A. The Objectives of the Order</p>
   <p>1. To unite into one brotherhood, men of Swedish ancestry, of good health and character, between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five, in order to become strong, morally, intellectually, and financially, through unified endeavor.</p>
   <p>2. To arrange for the payment of sick aid and burial assistance in accordance with the constitution of the Grand Lodge and the statutes of the subordinate lodges.</p>
   <p>B. The Objectives of the Great Lodge</p>
   <p>1. To maintain the Order in vigorous condition and to extend it through the organization of new lodges.</p>
   <p>2. To control the general burial fund of the Order in accordance with the constitution of the Order.</p>
   <p>3. To see to it that a fund for sick aid is maintained within each subordinate lodge, for payment to members of the lodge in case of illness, in accordance with the statutes of the individual lodges.</p>
   <p>4. To insure that the subordinate lodges adhere closely to their statutes <span class="page-break">10</span>as well as to the constitution of the Order.</p>
   <p>The substantial internal development evidenced within the Order during the past few years will undoubtedly provide the impetus for further growth in the near future, both in regard to increase in membership as well as in the organization of new lodges. It seems probable that the time is not far off when the insignia of the I. O. V. will be in evidence all over the United States, wherever groups of Swedes are found. Especially is it to be expected that the Order will win adherence among the Swedes within the state of Illinois, since it is the only society among our countrymen in the state--with the exception of the Methodist Burial Society--which is under state supervision and which is privileged under the laws of the state to make assessments for the payment of insurance claims.</p>
   <p>During the period from 1896 and 1903, forty-one members died. They were insured for a total of $13,100. During the same period, $15,968.68 has been paid in sick aid.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>The need of a magazine for the Order was recognized several years ago, and on May 15, 1899 the first number of the Vikingen (The Viking) appeared. Since then the paper has been published regularly every month and sent to the homes of the members. The leaders in this undertaking were E. Emelin, [first] editor, and Otto Anderson, manager. Subsequent editors include Messrs. Otto Craelius, Axel Ahlstedt, and Anders Hessel, the present editor.</p>
