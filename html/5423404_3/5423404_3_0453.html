   <p>Chicago's Public Library possesses a great collection of Scandinavian literature, but it has not been used so much as it ought to be, and the main reason for this is that a complete catalogue of it has been lacking. In the Library's outlying branches it has been impossible to obtain any list of these books, and if one wanted a book by some noted Scandinavian author, it was necessary to go to the main library and look in the card index. But only a person who has plenty of time on his hands and is especially interested in the works of a certain author is inclined to go to so much trouble. As already stated, this situation is the chief reason why the Library has had comparatively few calls for Scandinavian literature. But this condition has now been corrected, and according to a report received by this newspaper a complete and well-planned catalogue of the Library's Scandinavian collection is now available, which distinguishes among Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish books, and they are also grouped according to contents, so that it is easy to find the book one happens to want.</p>
   <p>A young Norwegian, John A. Lindrup, writes thus about this catalogue:</p>
   <p>"Much time and work have been spent on this catalogue, and if the Public Library should charge the actual cost price, I doubt whether a single copy would be sold. But the price has been set at only twenty-five cents."</p>
   <p>This useful and long-awaited guide to the Library's Scandinavian collection is now for sale in the downtown building, located at Randolph Street and Michigan Avenue, as well as at the various branches throughout the city.</p>
