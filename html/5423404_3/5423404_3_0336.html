   <p>The first concert of the fourth annual festival of the American Union Swedish Singers held last night at the Auditorium was given the hearty approval of an audience of 3000 persons. Every number on the program was followed by an encore and the soloists were accorded a welcome demonstrating their success at former concerts.</p>
   <p>Mme. Anna Hellstrom was greeted with the Chautauqua salute and a round of prolonged applause, to which she responded with a heroic war song. Cries of "Bravo!" Bravo!" followed the completion of her first selection and a storm of flowers rained over the platform.</p>
   <p>The popularity of the great Swedish soprano was further demonstrated later in the evening when the members of the singing societies assembled at the Auditorium Annex and serenaded her with folk songs of the home-land.</p>

   <p>Miss Martina Johnstone of New York rendered two pleasing violin selections with splended manifestation of expression, and the solo efforts of Gustaf Holmquist of Chicago and Olof Valley of Kansas City met with the approval of the audience.</p>
   <p>Many of the prominent Swedish people of the city were present to listen to the national airs and to give the stamp of approval to the festival. In the boxes among others, were President Haugan of the State bank of Chicago, Magnus Olson, Henry Runkle, Judge Chytraus, Robert Lindbloom and F. A. Lindstrom.</p>
   <p>In the absence of Mayor Dunne the address of welcome was made by Corporation Counsel James Hamilton Lewis.</p>
   <p>"It seems strange", he said, "to consider it necessary to welcome an assemblage of Swedes anywhere in America, for I believe that history will show that one of your race, Lief Ericson, was the real discoverer of this country."</p>

   <p>While the house was not over-crowded last night, it is believed that a much larger audience will be present this evening when the second concert is to be held. Two rival societies, the Svenska Glee Klubben of Chicago and the Swedish Glee Club of Brooklyn, will take part and the friendly strife will be watched with interest.</p>
   <p>Business meetings of the eastern and western branches of the union will be held during the day at 470 LaSalle Avenue, and Saturday a joint meeting will be held at the same place.</p>
   <p>Saturday evening a banquet will be held at the North Side Turner Hall, and on Sunday a program of interest to all Swedish people will take place at Riverview Park. It is predicted that 30,000 people will attend this gathering.</p>
