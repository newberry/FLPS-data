   <p>The Chicago-Swedish Athletic Club was formed on August 21 through the combination of the athletic clubs, Scandia, Sparta, and Brage. The friends of Swedish athletes in Chicago have always wanted to create one big athletic club, instead of having too many small ones. These three clubs have won many prizes for wrestling at the Scandinavian-American Union's mastership races. Sparta has many good football players.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected: Chairman, T. Andren; vice-chairman, R. Reistad; secretary, Fred Holmes; financial secretary, Ernst Swahn; treasurer, Harold Revin; and the athletic manager, Oscar Munson. The club has two hundred fifty members.</p>
