   <p>Supported by all the forces of Swedish Dramatic Society, Mr. Carl Liljegren will present "Uncle Knut from Norrkoping" at the Northside Turner Hall, Sunday, October 29. As the readers know, the play was presented here in the city about a month ago, and then utterly thrilled the people. The play is entertaining throughout, with an attractive moral background. No lover of the Swedish theatre ought to neglect this occasion to witness the play with its inimicable "Uncle Knut," played by Mr. Liljegren himself.</p>
