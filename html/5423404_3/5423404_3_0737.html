   <p>We have before us a little book bearing the above title, and the following subtitle, "A Collection of Poems Translated from the English Language".</p>
   <p>It might seem that to publish in book form English poetry translated into Swedish, is a case of carrying coals to Newcastle, considering the fact that we have such a wealth of fine Swedish poetry. It might seem so, because English, "the business language," does not lend itself as well to song and saga as does our own musical, poetic Swedish. Still we welcome this collection as a valuable addition to our literature, and we have good reasons for doing so. In the first place, these poems are gems, picked from the best that English-American literature has produced. Secondly, the translations have been done by Swedes and Swedish-Americans, who have won recognition as poets.</p>
   <p>Among the original authors are such names as Longfellow, Swinburne, Edwin Markham, Emerson, [James] Russell, Lowell, Whittier, Robert Burns, Edgar Allan Poe, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and Elizabeth Browning. Among the translators we find Jacob Bonggren, Magnus Elmblad, O. A. Linder, Edwin Tenestrom, C. F. Peterson, Hjalmar Edgren Retzius, Ernst Skarstedt, and Carl Snoilsky.</p>
   <p>All the translations are not masterpieces, however. There are several instances in which the beauty of the poem has suffered much in the process. This is particularly the case with Longfellow's "A Psalm of Life," and we have seen a much better translation of Rudyard Kipling's "The Vampire".</p>
   <p>The editor and publisher of the collection is Mr. P. G. Almberg, who deserves our gratitude for this fine piece of work; he will hardly get any financial reward, but he does not expect any. It is a well-known fact that there is no money in such a venture.</p>
   <p>He says in his foreword to the book: "If this collection is well received by the Swedish-American people, which I hope it will be, another one will follow; for translated literature has its value, and there are such rich sources for it. Fragments that are printed from time to time in our newspapers, without ever being published in book form are finally lost, no matter how valuable they are."</p>
