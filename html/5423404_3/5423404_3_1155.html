   <p>Last Tuesday, a new Svithiod Lodge was organized in Northwest Hall at North and Western Avenues. This new local of the Independent Order of Svithiod took the name of "Central No. 42." It will hold its meetings in the Masonic Temple on the ninth floor. The charter members numbered fifty-two. This is the first Svithiod lodge with by-laws and rituals written in English. All of the previously organized lodges have used the Swedish language.</p>
   <p>Officers of the new lodge are: S. M.: Franklin C. Lundquist; V. S. M: Wallace H. Johnson; P. S.: Charles E. Sward; F. S.: Henry H. Hedberg; Treasurer, Otto Hamburg. About three hundred people were present at the inaugural ceremonies of the lodge.</p>
