   <p>Svenska Nyheter will, in the year to come, continue the same policy it has been following in the past... We shall thoroughly adhere to our convictions, and to the best of our ability shall try to convince others of their truth. Week after week, we shall discuss questions concerning labor, for these problems constitute the very heart of our commercial, economic, and industrial life. Problems in religion, in philosophy, and in science will not be withheld from those who are readers of Svenska Nyheter.</p>
   <p>The news section, at present richer in contents and more extensive than that of most Swedish-American papers, will be made even more interesting. The serial stories and short stories so greatly enjoyed by our female readers will blossom anew during the coming year. All our subscribers can testify that we have kept our promises of the past.</p>

   <p>To those who have not yet had the opportunity of getting acquainted with Svenska Nyheter and its program we beg to say that Svenska Nyheter is the biggest Swedish paper in Chicago (sixteen pages); it is the most inexpensive Swedish paper in Chicago (one dollar per year); it is the most liberal and unafraid paper in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Blind faith, inherited prejudices, military snobbishness, decayed systems of representation have no friend in Svenska Nyheter.</p>
   <p>Such is our message to our readers today. And now let us, each in his own way, celebrate that event [Christmas] which symbolizes the return of light to the earth and to men.</p>
