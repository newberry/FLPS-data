   <p>The Swedish traditions cannot be preserved by singing folk songs alone; neither will the old folk dances be no less effective as has lately been demonstrated in Sweden. In our opinion, no other foreign country could be as receptive to a touring group of Swedish folk dancers than America, where hundreds of thousands of Swedes live.</p>
   <p>The announcement in this issue is an appeal to Swedish-Americans to familiarize themselves with an almost forgotten art among them. There is also a suggesstion that groups be organized to learn and preserve the folk dances here, and present them as a Swedish tradition when occassions present themselves. The plan laid out for the dancers will make the organization of folk dances possible and desirable here.</p>
