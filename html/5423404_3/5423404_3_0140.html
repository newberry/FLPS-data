   <p>Under the suspices of the society Nordstjernan (The North Star), the Swedish Theatrical Society presented Axel Anrep's well-known popular farce, "Nerkingarne" (The Near-Kings) at the South Side Turner Hall last Saturday evening. The play was under the direction of Mr. Ernst Behmer, and the hall was crowded.....</p>
   <p>Playing during the first act was rather lame; in acts two and three the playing was better, but we have seen the various roles in the farce executed much better on earlier occasions. The only actors who "came up to the mark" were Mrs. Ida Anderson-Verner- as "Miss Bloom," Mr. Ernest Albert Alberg- as "Manufacturer Stal," and, perhaps, Mr. Fred Bolling- Soldier Osting.</p>

   <p>The others in the cast miscarried more or less. The singing club of the North Star participated as "common people," and sang some attractive folk songs in acts two and three.</p>
   <p>After the play, dancing took place lasting until early Sunday morning.</p>
