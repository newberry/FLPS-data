   <p>The Swedish Cultural Institute at Spelz Hall, at North Clark Street in Lake View, last Sunday was well attended. The program offered a beautiful solo by Dr. E. O. Benson, who sang "Du Gamla, Du Friska, Du F Jallhoga Nord" ( Thou Old, Thou Sound, Thou North With Mountains High").</p>
   <p>After this followed two excellent violin solos by Professor C. F. Frederickson, a masterful temperance declamation by Miss Elizabeth Swanstrom, and an especially pithy lecture on the care of health, by Dr. C.O. Young. Next Sunday, editor A. Shon will deliver a lecture at the same place on Erik Janssonism in Helsingland, whose followers emigrated at last, and founded the colony of Bishop Hill in Illinois.</p>
   <p>The program will also offer songs, music and declamations. The lecture will begin at three P.M. Admission is free.</p>
