   <p>The November issue of Bokstugan, the periodical published by the Verdandi Study League, is just out. A notable change has been made in the nature of the publication's contents. More than half of the reading material is in English, and the three articles by Carrol Lane Fenton--"The History of Evolution", "The Beginning of Life", and "Why Do You Look Like Your Grandfather?"--make especially interesting and instructive reading.</p>
   <p>Besides the English material and the usual literary review, there are also several poems, the best of which, in our opinion, are the three written by Einar Soderwall, Caleb Stille, and Werner Chramer.</p>
   <p>The series of articles on "Social Hygiene," which started in the preceding issue, is continued in this one.</p>
