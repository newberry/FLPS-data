   <p>The Swedish Theatrical Club of Chicago, under the direction of Brussels and Behmers, on Sunday, presented Johan Borjeson's well-known historical drama, "Carl XII", at the Grand Opera House.</p>
   <p>Before the curtain went up, the house was full, and during the well presented play thunderous rounds of applause greeted the players, who all deserve special mention.</p>
   <p>Special mention is deserved also by Ida Ostergren as "Anna;" Sarah Mordstrom as "Rhoda D'Elleville;" Carl Liljegren as "Brunnerus," the Salem chaplain; and Ernest Behmer as "Carl XII."</p>
   <p>The chorus numbers in the play were presented by the Orphei Sangarklubb <span class="page-break">2</span>(Orpheus Singing Club [a male chorus]).</p>
   <p>The Chicago Swedish colony looks forward to other presentations promised by the Theatrical Club.</p>
