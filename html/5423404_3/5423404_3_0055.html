   <p>A great concert in memory of the author-poet Gunnar Wennerberg was given in the Auditorium last Wednesday evening. Our countrymen thronged the massive Auditorium to hear the songs of Wennerberg by the Gunnar Wennerberg Chorus, numbering 690 members, and a large Men's Choir numbering 250, in which were included the very best soloists in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The speaker was Dr. Gustaf Andren, well-known educator.</p>
