   <p>The lecture season of the Swedish Cultural League will begin Friday, October 24. These annual series of lectures arranged by the League have become more and more popular, and Swedes living in the Lake View district are waiting for them to start every fall. Last year there was some dissatisfaction because so few of the lectures were given in the Swedish language, and for the coming season the committee has engaged more speakers who can speak Swedish. Among the lectures who will return this season we note Dr. C. G. Wallenius, who will relate tales and memories from the island of Gottland, Ralph Chaplin, who continues his interesting talks on American literary personalities, and Professor Joranson, who will discuss the topic, "Is History a Science"? Dr. Schneider will show colored slides of beauty spots in the West, and Professor Harper will lecture on "Soviet Russia". Docent Malmstrom, of the University of Lund, will discuss modern Swedish lyric literature and also the place of sports in modern society. His final lecture will deal with Kretschmer's psychology.</p>
   
   <p>A social gathering will be arranged on February 6, with a program of music and song and other entertainment.</p>
   <p>Season tickets for all the lectures cost two dollars, while the admission to single lectures is twenty-five cents.</p>
