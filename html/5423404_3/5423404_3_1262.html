   <p>Svea Dottrar, a women's society, gave an evening performance last Saturday at Henning's Hall, which was packed to the door. The interesting program consisted of music, song, recital, and a tableau presenting Svea, and her daughters. Dancing followed after the program. This was the first performance the society had arranged since it was organized. There are now 50 members in the society.</p>
