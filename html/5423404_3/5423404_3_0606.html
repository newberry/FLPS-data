   <p>Mr. Johan Parson, who has been on the Svenska Kuriren (Swedish Courier) staff for the past six years, will now be associated with the Svenska Amerikanaren. He is well-known as a writer of the life of Swedish-America. This addition to our staff will enable us to give our readers better editorials than before, particularly in a literary sense. The Swedish-American readers will be treated with short, original stories each week.</p>
   <p>"Cornelius Corncob" who, already has thousands of friends in Swedish-America, will make his appearance in our paper next week, and as we announce this, we know you all will be glad to meet him.</p>
