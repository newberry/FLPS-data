   <p>Fifty years as an amateur actress is well worth boasting of, but boasting is not in the "make-up" of, Mrs. Ida Anderson-Werner, popular member and star performer of the "Swedish Theatrical Society." As a little child in Sweden she partook in a play entitled "Syrsan" (The Cricket), and ever since her coming here in 1892, she has been identified with Swedish amateur theatricals and entertainments in general.</p>
   <p>A benefit performance will be given for her at the Goodman Theatre, Sunday, Nov. 28th, at 8 P.M. That night she will play in "Syrsan" again, but her role will not be the original one of a small child.</p>
   <p>The performance is being given under the auspices of the "Swedish Theatrical Society of Chicago.</p>
