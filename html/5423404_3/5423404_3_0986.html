   <p>The Swedish Olympic Society now has a branch in Chicago with Charles T. Green as chairman, Dr. Axel Werelius vice-chairman, Gust Hallbom treasurer, and Carl G. Lonnerblad, secretary. The headquarters are located in New York. The society was founded for the purpose of collecting funds through various entertainments such as social gatherings and feasts. These funds will soon be used for the participation of Swedish-American athletes as representatives of Sweden at the olympics in Berlin, 1916. Several prominent countrymen in Chicago have promised to supported the newly formed branch and a committee has been elected, consisting of several influential Swedes in Chicago, to work for this purpose.</p>
