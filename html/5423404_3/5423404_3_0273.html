   <p>The Swedish National League's Summer festival in Riverview Park last Sunday was attended by about five thousand people. At the entrance of the park, the visitors were met by a troop of beautiful girls, who tried to "tag" them. It was also Tag Day in the park for the benefit of needy Swedish people in Chicago. The girls were particularly attractive, so one should expect a nice result financially from their efforts. The beautiful "extra" Salvation Lassies knew also how to get customers, with their appeal for money, to provide the boys at the front with Coffee "Med Dopp." All donors were decorated with a tag fastened to the lapel.</p>
   <p>The park was decorated throughout. The speakers' stand in particular was beautifully decorated with American and Swedish flags. The first speaker, Chief Justice Harry Olson, gave a splendid talk on the War.</p>

   <p>Carl R. Chindblom delivered a very fine speech on charity, and painted out the particular significance the day had to the Swedes in Chicago. Mr. Chindblom, who substituted for Dr. Ernst Philblad, is to be complimented for the manner in which he acquitted himself.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were: Attorney O'Connor, Werner Melinder, president of the Swedish National League, and Erik Hagberg, who spoke in Swedish.</p>
   <p>The rest of the program consisted of folk-dances, songs, by the Harmony Singing Society, and music by Swedish-American Orchestra.</p>
   <p>The official program concluded with the singing of America.</p>
