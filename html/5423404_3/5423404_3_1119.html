   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Swedish National Society was held Tuesday, Mar 3. The Charity Committee's report was presented, and it showed that much poverty and need has prevailed even among our countrymen during the last month, caused by the great unemployment problem. The society has been very active in helping most of the needy. The Festival Committee reported that beautiful Glenwood Park has been rented for the Society's twenty-first annual midsummer Feast, to be held Sunday, June 28. It was also announced that the Committee had signed a contract with Baroness Signe Rappe, prima donna of the Swedish Royal Opera in Stockholm, assuring her appearance at a concert together with the Swedish National Chorus, to be held at Orchestra Hall on May 30. Miss Rappe, daughter of the former Secretary of War, General Rappe, has also been engaged to appear at the grand singing festivals to be held at Minneapolis, June 8 and 9.</p>
