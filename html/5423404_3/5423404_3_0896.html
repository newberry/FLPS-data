   <p>On Thursday evening, September 27, Dr. John A. Enander, one of Chicago's most outstanding Swedes, delivered his promised lecture on his recent tour of Sweden. This is the most interesting and authentic lecture we have heard and it was thoroughly appreciated by a capacity audience in the Svenska Evangeliska Lutherska Kyrkan (Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church), at Barry and Seminary Avenues.</p>
