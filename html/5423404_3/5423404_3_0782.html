   <p>The Swedish motion picture "The Vermlanders," was presented twice last Thursday at the Lincoln Dixie Theater in Chicago Heights. The performances, which were arranged by various Swedish organizations in the locality, attracted capacity crowds, and are counted among the most successful events ever staged in that theater.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm with which the picture was received augurs well for its success in other towns and cities throughout the state. The next performance will be given in the high school auditorium in Batavia.</p>
