   <p>The American Union of Swedish Singers of Chicago held a song festival last Saturday at Sharpshooters' Park. The festival was favored with beautiful weather, and was successful in every respect. The singers were tireless in their efforts to entertain the large crowd with our ever-fresh Nordic songs whose melodies rang out so beautifully in the cool evening breeze.</p>
   <p>The Svithiod military band encountered stiff competition with the chorus of singers, and lively dancing added to the pleasure derived from the singing and music. In this park, there is a large, well lighted dancing stage for the older people, the merry-go-round for the children, and several other attractions were sources of joy for all. In short, everybody was satisfied, and enjoyed the entertainment.</p>
