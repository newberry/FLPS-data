   <p>The Chicago-Swedish Athletic Club Soccer Football team played its last series match for this season last Thursday against the Calumet Park Team on the latter's field.</p>
   <p>The outlook for the Swedes seemed to be uncertain at first, but later on they showed themselves equal to the tasks, and won the game with a score of 3 to 2, and therewith the first prize in the series for this season. They have won eight matches out of nine, and made forty-seven goals, losing only ten, which is a very good record. The club's second team played the same day against the English team, Armour Square, and won 5 to 3. The club will hold its first dance Saturday at Viking Temple.</p>
