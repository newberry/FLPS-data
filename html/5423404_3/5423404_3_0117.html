   <p>Master Smith Eller Aristokrater Aro Vi Alla (Mr. Smith or Aristocrats are We All) by Johan Jolins proved a perfect success on Sunday evening when it was presented by the Svenska Dramatiska Sallskapet (Swedish Dramatical Club) at the Garrick Theatre. The fact that the house was not full as expected was doubtless the result of the stormy weather which kept thousands at home.</p>
   <p>The presentation of this drama was exceptional in that every role was played so perfectly that nothing was left to be desired. The Chicago Swedish colony is prouder than ever of its own Dramatic Club. The four leading roles were played by: John Lindhagen as "Jacob Smith;" Ida Ostergren as "Helena," the daughter of Smith; Sara Nordstrom, as "Gertrud," another daughter of Smith, and Ernest Behmer as "Lieut. Henning," Helena's fiance.</p>
   <p>We trust the Club will repeat the performance at a time when the weather will be more favorable, as we feel that the Play will then draw a capacity audience which will heartily enjoy every minute of the performance.</p>
