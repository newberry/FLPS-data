   <p>The summer has come to an end, and Svenska Nyheter will now make good its promise of last June to restore its size to sixteen pages.</p>
   <p>With the advent of October, we also get the cooling, stimulating air which arouses in us a desire to store away a supply of knowledge to draw from in the years to come. To help our readers satisfy this desire, we are now adding four pages of reading matter.</p>
   <p>The leading Swedish-American jurist, G. Bernhard Anderson, has consented to conduct a column in which he will answer legal questions submitted by readers. This will be a very interesting and instructive feature, which we would like to recommend to everybody.</p>
   <p>We have engaged the Stockholm writer, Ernst Lindblom, who every week will entertain us with sketches from the Swedish capital.</p>

   <p>In this issue we begin a series of biographies of outstanding Swedish-American singers and musicians; they are written by Carl G. Fredin, a member of our editorial staff and himself a singer and musician of no mean ability.</p>
   <p>Beginning today, we shall also publish a number of articles under the heading, "Echoes from the Struggle in Colorado". Our readers are not unacquainted with the labor situation in that State, and we feel that it merits a more thorough treatment.</p>
   <p>Do not miss our new, exciting serial story, "The Adventurer".</p>
