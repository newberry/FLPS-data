   <p>For the benefit of the Swedish-American Home of Mercy in Bowmansville, the Swedish-American Women's Club will give a first-class musical soiree this Saturday evening at Studebaker's Music Hall, 203 Michigan Avenue. The unselfish purpose of this undertaking should in itself suffice to draw thousands of Swedish-American men and women to this literary and musical event, even had the committee decided to engage only second-class talent for the program.</p>
   <p>Actually, however, the committee has persuaded the very best among the Swedish musicians, singers, and speakers to take part, and thus the following outstanding Swedes will be heard at the entertainment: Professor David Nyvall; Professor John R. Ortengren; Miss Elizabeth Swanstrom; Mr. Carl Oscar Nelson; and Mr. Emanuel Anderson. In addition there will be a large mixed chorus.</p>
