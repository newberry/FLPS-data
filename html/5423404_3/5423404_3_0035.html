The program was very well selected, and the various numbers were presented so as to keep up the high standing of this celebrated singing club. The applause was vigorous, and several extra numbers had to be given.</p>
   <p>Besides the Glee Club, Mrs. Harriet Smulski, soprano, Professor John R. Ortengren, baritone, and Mr. Walter Schulze, violinist, participated on the program. Professor Emil Larson gave organ solos, and also accompanied the singers on the piano. </p>
