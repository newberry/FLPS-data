   <p>The Swedish paper Hemlandet (Homeland) has been purchased by F. A. Larson, editor and owner of Svenska Amerikanern (Swedish-American). The two papers will be combined. Oliver A. Lender will be the new editor in chief. Hemlandet was first issued in Galesburg, Illinois, in 1855. The paper and the entire staff moved to Chicago in 1859. Charles S. Peterson, member of the School Board, was Hemlandet's last editor.</p>
