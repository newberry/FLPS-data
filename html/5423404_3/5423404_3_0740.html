   <p>Gus Broberg's Swedish Almanac and Calendar for 1905 has just been released by the publisher, and like its predecessors, it contains a lot of information of special interest to Swedish-Americans. It will be mailed free of charge to anyone whose request for it is accompanied by a three-cent stamp.</p>
   <p>This week Svenska Nyheter will mail it entirely free to all its subscribers within, as well as outside Chicago. Those who do not wish to wait for the mail man to bring it to their homes, may get a copy at our office anytime.</p>
