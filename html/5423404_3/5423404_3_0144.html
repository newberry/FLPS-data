   <p>The Svithiod Singing Club issued invitations to a theater party last Sunday evening to be held in its beautiful concert hall on Wrightwood Avenue. In spite of the terrific cold wave, the hall was filled to capacity. The play, in two acts, was "Schoolmaster Blackstadius," or the "Marriage Advertisement." The leading role was played by Carl Pheil, who performed in a masterly manner. "Mrs. Kostame," was portrayed by Mrs. Pheil; "Mrs Kostame's daughter" was interpreted by Therese Sundborg; "Lisette," the maid, was played by Miss Betty Pheil. The play, viewed from any angle, was very enjoyable, and a worthwhile comedy. The audience was in laughter most of the evening. At 10 o'clock, at the conclusion of the play, dancing was indulged in by those present. On Sunday December 29, the Club will give another play. Everyone is welcome.</p>
