   <p>List of officers:</p>
   <p>Following the ceremonial installation, Mr. Sonbergh spoke very impressively of the history of the Brotherhood, its aim, its financial standing, and the fraternal friendship extended to a traveling member by his brothers, wherever they meet each other throughout the United States. The new local lodge will <span class="page-break">\2</span>be known as"Trohet"(Allegiance or Faithfulness) No. 70 and will meet on the second and fourth Friday of every month.
