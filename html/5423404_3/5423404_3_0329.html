   <p>The Swedish Song Society of Chicago met at Svithiod's Song Club Local last Sunday afternoon to make arrangements for some manner of celebrating the two-hundreth year anniversary of the Linne's birthday on the 23rd of May. Among the suggestions that were made was one that the societies singers should gather around Linne's Statue in Lincoln Park at 8:00 P. M. and around the flower kings Statyn to sing some appropriate songs for the occasion. Afterward the singers were to go to the Svithiod's club-rooms where the tables were set awaiting the guests; after the banquet they will be entertained with speeches and singing. Carl R. Chindblom will talk about the flower-king, his work and study of Botany and nature as one of the world's foremost in this respect. Professor John R. Ortengren will speak upon the subject the Song's high Mission.</p>
