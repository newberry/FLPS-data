   <p>The annually recurrent summer festival for the benefit of the Swedish Home for the Aged, in Evanston, was celebrated last Sunday, and the festival proved one of the most successful ones ever celebrated for the purpose mentioned.</p>
   <p>Hardly ever did so many of our people gather to salute the old people as this time, and never before did the festival bring in as large amount of money as this year. The amount received was $6000.00. The Swedish Singing Society in Chicago contributed much to the success of the festival through beautiful rendering of Swedish songs. More than 5000 people were present.</p>
