   <p>Last week, the women of the Svithiod Sangarklubb (Svithiod Singing Club) gave another of their Christmas festivals for poor children, a beautiful custom. This festival was held on the afternoon of December 30, in the club house on Wrightwood Avenue, under the direction of Mrs. Olof Ohlson, and other warm-hearted women.</p>
   <p>It was not only candy and food that made the little ones happy, but valuable presents in the form of shoes, gloves, caps, and other articles of wear, which the little ones well needed. The grateful expressions of the children which the givers received for their kindness were thanks enough for the hard preparatory work and the solicitous attendance of the tasks during the course of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the day. These deserving sisters certainly felt themselves more richly rewarded at this Christmas festival than on any other occasion.</p>
