   <p>Mr. Robert Lindblom gave a farewell dinner in his home last Saturday for the Swedish Commissioner at the World's Fair of 1893, Engineer Arthur Leffler and his staff Welin, Berg, Samuel and Lundquist. Several of our prominent Chicago Swedes were also invited. The host, Mr. Lindblom, suggested a toast for the guests of honor, especially for Mr. Leffler, whose excellent work at the Fair was highly appreciated by everyone concerned. Mr. Loeffler responded. Rev. Herman Lindskog proposed a toast for host and hostess. Mr. Leffler is now going east via Philadelphia, Boston to New York and then home to Sweden</p>
