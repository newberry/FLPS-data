   <p>On Tuesday evening in Dr. Wald's home 1584 Buckingham Place a very interesting social was held in honor of the Lake View Hospital Aid Society. The invited guests numbered over two-hundred, among them many of the most prominent Swedish residents. Dr. Wald spoke in well chosen words of the good the society had done for the afflicted and expressed his appreciation of the progress in the society's work. He expressed the hope that all Swedes with hearts in the right place would work in their own way for the progress of the Society. The membership now numbers over two-hundred, and the society was organized in 1905.</p>
   <p>The other speakers were Pastor Alfred Anderson and Henry Nelson, Dr. Farney of the Lake View American Methodist Church and Gross Stephenson.</p>
   <p>Songs were sung by Miss Mabel Anderson, Miss Ruth Hallgren, Miss H. Thelin, Hon. Anthony and The Austin Quartette.</p>

   <p>All luck to Dr. Wald the Society's President who has already done so much for the Lake View Hospital Aid Society and we agree with Pastor Anderson that Dr. Wald has proved himself a capable workman, by his energy and wise management.</p>
   <p>The first bazaar of the society will be held in Claremont Hall, 1630 North Clark Street Friday and Saturday March 1st and 2nd 1907. If we are interested in this bazaar it will be a real success as the society's concerts were given before.</p>
