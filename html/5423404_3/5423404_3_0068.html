   <p>p.11.....A successful chorus concert was given last Friday evening at St. Ansgarius Church under the direction of Joel Mossberg. The chorus was assisted by the singing society, Lyran, which under Mr. Dahlen's direction rendered three very fine numbers. There was a duet by Miss Anna Rosenquist and Mr. Mossberg. Mr. Gustaf Lindquist sang Gounod's grand tenor aria "Salve di mora" and Mr. Carl Lennerblad, Fame's, "The Palms." An orchestra under Professor A. J. Newstrom's direction gave various numbers and even accompanied the chorus in David's 96th Psalm and "Gloria in Excelcis," by Mozart.</p>
   <p>The concert was in all respects successful. The old temple was packed with a pleasant and applauding audience.</p>
