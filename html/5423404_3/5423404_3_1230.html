   <p>The Swedish-American Woman's Club entertained with a party last Wednesday evening, the proceeds from which will go to the Home of Mercy at Bowmanville. The affair was held at Mr. and Mrs. Hall's attractive home, 1655 Fletcher Street. So great was the number of guests that the Hall apartment was not large enough [to accommodate everyone], but Messrs. Eklof and Nelson, who have apartments in the same building, were kind enough to place their rooms at the disposal of the Club.</p>
   <p>About a hundred and fifty people attended. Coffee and cake were served at the end of the entertainment.</p>
