   <p>was delivered last Saturday at the Central Music Hall by Professor R.B.Anderson, the former American Ambassador to Denmark.</p>
   <p>He spoke of the Norsemen's (the men from the North) explorations of America long before the days of Columbus. He gave an interesting account of the expeditions made to America by our forefathers in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and drew a word-picture of the history of the first Norseman's colony on American soil. This colony was founded in the year 1007, in what is now Massachusetts, by Thorfinn Karlsefne and his wife Gudrid, who arrived here accompanied by 151 men and 7 women. It is claimed that Gudrid gave birth to the first white child born on the American continent. This child, a boy, later became known as Snorre Thorfinson, from whom the world-famous Danish sculptor, Thorwaldsen, among others, claims his ancestry. All in all it was a very interesting and educational lecture, which was deserving of a much larger audience than the one present that evening.</p>
