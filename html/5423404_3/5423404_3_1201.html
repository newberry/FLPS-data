   <p>The Central Federation of Chicago lodges and various other groups of Chicago Swedes held their monthly business meeting on May 22, 1906. Reports of various officers were read and accepted. A most gratifying report was that of the financial committee, composed of Charles Gustafson, Gust Odman, and Henry Schreil. [items of receipts and disbursements are omitted; totals only are given].</p>

   <p>Of the $1800 appropriated by the committee for the current expenses of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Home for the Aged, a balance of $145.58 on hand was reported.</p>
   <p>During the past fiscal year this organization, maintaining the Swedish Home for the Aged, located at Morgan Park, has bought a burial section of a nearby cemetery where deceased inmates of the home will be interred. To date, two of the inmates have been laid to rest in the section bought.</p>
   <p>At present, there are sixteen aged inmates at the home where they are looked after by a well trained and thoroughly experienced nurse.</p>
   <p>The Home is valued at twelve thousand and is free from all debt. The last claim against the home was paid with proceeds of a wonderful bazaar held over a year ago.</p>
   <p>As one and all can readily understand the maintenance of an institution of this size is not child's play either in supervising or raising necessary <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>funds voluntarily. Since the home is now free of debts, the task is much lighter and pleasing to all who are interested.</p>
   <p>The maintenance committee is one hundred percent optimistic, for it is supported in its work by thirty-nine lodges, whose delegates never miss a meeting, and who, until now, have not disappointed the committee in any way. The Home is the only Swedish Home for the Aged in Chicago or any nearby city, hence, the Chicago Swedish colony is not at all backward in supporting the activities of this wonderful institution.</p>
