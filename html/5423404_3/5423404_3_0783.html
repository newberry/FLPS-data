   <p>The great Swedish film presentation had its premiere in Orchestra Hall last night, and all seats were sold out in advance. But do not get discouraged! There will be plenty of opportunities to see this beautiful film showing ten thousand feet of moving pictures of Swedish cities, towns and countryside. The owners have rented the Aryan Grotto Temple, at Wabash Avenue and 8th Street, for eight more presentations,which will take place from February 27 to March 6, inclusive. The program will be identical with that offered at the premiere. The Northland Trio has been engaged for all eight showings of the film, as has the orchestra directed by Professor C. Sinn.</p>
   <p>The entire program is even more interesting and entertaining than is indicated by comments in the press. The film is so detailed and comprehensive that practically every Swedish-American has an opportunity to view the <span class="page-break">2</span>city, town or country district where he was born and played as a child. One might say that those who have seen Sweden only in their thoughts during the last decades have got a chance here to visit the old country without moving from their seats in the theatre. They will see the homecoming, when the liner "Stockholm" docks in Gothenburg, as well as the departure, when the "Drotningholm" leaves the Swedish coast behind, bound for New York. As one travels through the country with this film as a guide, he will see more of the country than he would be likely to see during an actual visit. He makes the thrilling trip through the locks of the Trollhattan Canal, and views the sunrise at Karlstad. The next minute he attends the world ski meet at Holmenkollen, Norway, where the world's most daring jumpers and long distance skiers vie for honors. He visits a large number of cities and towns, and makes extensive trips through the farm country. Of course, he makes a lengthy visit to the capital, Stockholm.</p>
   <p>This and much more is to be seen at the Aryan Grotto Temple during the showing of this film, and it should be enough to draw a capacity house every night.</p>
