   <p>In the Auditorium last Sunday, the play of the above title was the big attraction. It was with this play that the Swedish National Society celebrated its mid-winter festival, and it was through the efforts of the Swedish dramatic players under Ernst Behmer's leadership, and with the cooperation of John R. Ortengren's Harmony Singers Club, Iduna Military Band, and Meck's Orchestra, that this program was presented.</p>
   <p>Before the curtain went up for the first act, advocate G. Bern Anderson made a presentation speech of a bust of King Oscar II,to the Swedish National Society; the bust was made by C.J.Nilsson. It was displayed on a pedestal draped with the Swedish flag. To say that the presentation and the explanation of the background of the gift was not ample, would be complaining, because the bust is a real work of art.</p>
   <p>As for the play, taking it as a whole, scene after scene, was one of comfort and rest. It was apparent that the artists, now as always, when they <span class="page-break">2</span>have to present something of the bound foreman, they find it hard to tramp on each others feet, and possibly they found it hard to make themselves heard, maybe we should point out that which often happened, that even the scenario's and the statistions more than once worked hard to find the proper setting. On the other hand one found crafty workmanship on the scenes and splendidly directed dialogues. Among the outstanding character roles was Behmer's in Hieromymus, even if we do not wish to wholeheartedly agree on this,Mr. Behmer's understanding of this character was well carried out, he has no doubt worked hard to perfect the character role, many of the difficulties which were noticed two years ago when he played it were absent now.</p>
   <p>Miss Ostergren's Regina was fully as interesting as two years ago from beginning to end and is entitled to the highest of commendation.</p>
   <p>Professor Ortengren playing the role of Gustaf II Adolf's played the part to the approval of the audience from beginning to end,and, particularly, in the fourth act, the big scene which no doubt is the most difficult, he performed with marked effect. Although we have more than once said in private that no <span class="page-break">3</span>one in Chicago could better fill this kingly role than Professor Ortengren, and, while we have not at this time any contradictions on this score, he did not seem to be at his best. His always warm and congenial voice, his dramatic, and friendly countenance are strong factors along with gestures of his presentation.</p>
   <p>Ernst Lindblom's Captain Larson was amusing in every respect and won well deserved praise. Carl Liljegrens first Von Emmeritz was not what we had expected. Honorable Liljegrens who always carries out his roles so well did not on this occasion seem to get much pep into his work. Honorable Gunnar Brandt made as good a Bertel as we have ever seen in Chicago, but he should not become overjoyed at this because we have never seen the role very well played. Ida Anderson's Merners Dorothy filled her place well in the play.</p>
   <p>Signe martenson was good as Katohen, and while she sang in low tones, she sang beautifully which cannot be said of the Munk's or "Kattarnes" masses. All of the players did as well as expected.</p>
   <p>The play was not a huge financial success as there were many empty seats, but we hope that there will soon be another entertainment as highly enjoyable.</p>
