   <p>This club has undertaken to organize a gymnastic club for women, by those who have recently taken over the management of the club. A meeting will be held to discuss this question the first Tuesday in December at Standard Hall, 576 Larrabee St. The club management also has in mind organizing other gymnastic clubs into an organization to be called the Western Union of Swedish Gymnastics. Therefore, the Chicago and nearby gymnastic societies will be written to and advised to select delegates for a convention to be held in the near future.</p>
