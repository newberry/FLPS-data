   <p>A concert was given last Thursday evening, April 28, under the auspices of the Linne Monument Society. This affair, which was held at the Svea Hall, proved a great success and no doubt will yield a handsome profit to be added to the fund for the defraying of the expenses for the four Allegory figures and their erection.</p>
   <p>To stimulate the interest for this concert, the Real Estate firm of Jornberg &amp; Rylander had donated a building lot worth $1,000 to go to the holder of the lucky ticket. Much to the dismay of all the hard-working Chicago Swedes, who had bought more tickets than the hall had seats, the lot went to a temporary visitor, A.W. Blemquist, from Burlington, Iewa.</p>
