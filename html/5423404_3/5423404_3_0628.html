   <p>Hardly had the last faint sounds of taps for Editor Wicklund died away when the same sad, measured sounds, announcing another's passing, reached our ears: Anders Leonard Gyllenhaals, editor-in-chief of the Svenska Tribunen, has gone to his fathers.</p>
   <p>His death occurred on Tuesday night. The work of the day.....was over; the paper had gone to press, and the old, faithful servant, who, for more than thirty-one years had placed unsparingly his diligence and his energy at the service of the press, had left for home. Arriving at the Union Station, he slipped down into one of the seats to await the train that was to take him to his cozy home at Glen View. Then his weary head dropped forward, the paper in <span class="page-break">2</span>his hand slid to the floor, Editor Gyllenhaal was dead.</p>
   <p>For a long time our friend, Gyllenhaal, had been ill, but he was not of those who afflicts others with his sufferings. If he were asked about his health, he would throw a warm smile, half laughter, and say, "Oh, I am quite all right, thank you."</p>
   <p>Anger never got the upper hand on Editor Gyllenhaal. If his cheeks were flushed, it was not hard feelings that caused the color, but quiet joy which also kindled the warm sparkle in his eyes..... In vain, will one look for friendship of a nobler type than his, and he gave it freely.... He never had an enemy, and yet he did not restrain his arm when striking a blow for that which he considered right..... A man of quiet strength, he was never <span class="page-break">3</span>seeking popularity.</p>
   <p>When others attended banquets, gave toasts and wrote odes to themselves and other great men, Gyllenhaal would sit in his editorial cubbyhole writing editorials, translating news, and reading proofs.</p>
   <p>Such he was, this man who so suddenly was taken away from those who were near and dear to him. He has left a vacancy in the Svenska Tribunen which will be difficult to fill.</p>
   <p>Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal was born in Sweden in 1842.... In 1866, he bade <span class="page-break">4</span>his homeland goodbye and came to America. Like the rest of us, he struggled and suffered hardships at first, but his blood was young, and his expectations were bright.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1874, he was given position on the editorial staff of Nya Svenska Amerikanaren, and from then onward, without interruption, he has belonged to the Swedish-American press. For sixteen years he was assistant editor of the Hemlandet. In the year 1891, he was offered the editorship of the Svenska Tribunen, which position he held till his death.</p>
