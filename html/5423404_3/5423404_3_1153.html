   <p>What might be called preliminary dedication ceremonies were held last Saturday in the new, stately home of Lodge No. 2, of the Independent Order of Vikings, at Sheffield Avenue and School Street. No less than 130 new members were initiated into the Lodge, which is one of the most active in the entire order, and now has about nine hundred members. The roomy and modern auditorium was filled almost to capacity, and the audience was in high spirits. Several bands participated.</p>
   <p>The plans for this impressive lodge building, the first Viking home in Chicago, were prepared by Architect Andrew E. Norman, who also supervised the construction. The outside architecture is attractive, and the inside arrangements are in good taste. Those who have been in charge of the work have certainly done a good job. When fully completed, the building will have cost about $50,000. The formal dedication will take place in the fall.</p>
