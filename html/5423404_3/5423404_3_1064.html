   <p>A mass meeting was held on June 7th at Svea Hall to sondier a proposal to erect a statue in honor of Karl von Linne in Lincoln Park. The proposal was accepted with great enthusiasm, and the persons present appointed a committee of forty-five to handle the affair. The monument is going to be raised in the name of the Swedish-Americans in the United States and with their financial support.</p>
   <p>The committee elected the following as officers: President, John A. Enander, vice presidents: C.J.Sundell, Rob.Lindblom, P.M.Almin; P.S. Peterson, O.G.Lange, P.W.Nilson and A. Chaiser. Secretaries: L.Hasselroth, V.Tengwald, H.W.Brusewitz and C.Eklund, Treasurer, J.R.Lindgren, Fin. Sec. L.Widestrand.</p>

   <p>"It has been suggested that the intended monument should be a copy of the one erected in Stockholm, Sweden a couple of years ago. About $40,000 is needed for the purpose. We, therefore, ask you, our countrymen, to co-operate with us.</p>
   <p>Linne' was a Swede of world-wide fame as a scientist. We Swedes in America should, therefore, honor him by erecting his statue in a place where men can seek rest after a busy day or week. Linne' gave to the world his beautiful truths of the life of the flowers. We, therefore, ask you for your contribution to enable us to erect this monument in Lincoln Park in Chicago. If 40,000 Swedish-Americans gave $1.00 each we would have the needed money in a couple of months.</p>
   <p>If someone should ask why the statue should be erected in Chicago we answer <span class="page-break">\3</span>this: The largest Swedish colony is located in Chicago. Chicago is the most centrally located of all the large cities in the United States, and is the binding link between East and West, South and North,Chicago is the most cosmopolitan city in America. It is, therefore, most fitting that the statue should be raised here. The genius of Linne' was of such magnitude that he belongs to the whole world. ...</p>
