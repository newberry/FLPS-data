   <p>The Chicago Good Templars' annual midsummer festival, known as Swedish Day, was celebrated last Sunday in Ravinia Park. The weather was unfavorable. A light rain fell throughout most of the day, and not until late in the afternoon did the sun come out. But in spite of this, many people found their way to the park. No less than 8,459 tickets were sold at the entrance, and the total attendance exceeded ten thousand.</p>
   <p>As usual, there were many attractions for both young and old. A notable innovation was the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's filming of the event.</p>
   <p>The program started with a parade through the park which was led by the Good Templars' band. Then there were music, songs, speeches, games, dancing, etc. The main athletic event was a football game between a team from the Swedish-American Athletic Association and a team from Rockford. A special <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>concert program was presented in the large summer theater, which was not large enough, however, to accomodate all who wanted to get in. The main speaker of the day was United States District Attorney Edwin A. Olson, who told of the Government's efforts to enforce the prohibition law.</p>
   <p>After the completion of the official program, dancing and merrymaking continued until it was time to go home.</p>
