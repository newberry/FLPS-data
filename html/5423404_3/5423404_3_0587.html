   <p>An interesting and thoughtful speech was given by the president of the American Association of Foreign Newspapers, Louis N. Hammerling, of New York, at a luncheon given by the Advertising Association of Chicago last Tuesday, at its hall, 123 W. Madison St. for the members of the before mentioned organization.</p>
   <p>In his speech, Mr. Hammerling emphasized the significance of the part of the American press which consists of foreign language papers, and the contribution made by them to the development of the country, intellectually, as well as commercially. Just at present, the speaker pointed out, the immigrants are subjects of suspicion and even hatred from certain quarters and without any good reason their loyalty is doubted. In this connection the speaker noted that all foreign language papers in the country, without exception, are taking stand for America in their editorials. All of them are endeavoring to implant love of our country in their readers, thereby accomplishing a task which would easily cost the country $300,000,000, if it were to be accomplished in schools.</p>

   <p>From Chicago alone 1,686,000 copies of foreign language papers are distributed to the foreign speaking population of the country at large, and the influence of this foreign language press is increased by the fact that the papers are not bought separately, copy by copy to be glanced at and then thrown away, as is the case in regard to the great daily papers in the English language. The foreign language papers are subscribed for by the year, carefully read, and frequently preserved for future reference.</p>
   <p>Besides, the speaker informed his audience, the foreign language press is of considerable importance as a business. During the year 1915 this press has employed 10,067 people with a total payroll of $5,385,000. Paper was consumed for the amount of $77,026.00. The income from advertisements was $7,240,000, and the press represents an investment of $37,000,000, as reported in 1914.</p>
   <p>The foreign language press was represented at the banquet by seven hundred sixty men. The banquet hall was beautifully decorated, and great enthusiasm prevailed.</p>
