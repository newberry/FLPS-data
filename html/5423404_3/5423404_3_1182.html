   <p>This Chicago organization has done a great deal for the Swedish men and women and now for the fourteenth time, they invite the Swedish people to Elliotts Park to celebrate midsummer day in a real Swedish way. Year after year multitudes have taken part in these celebrations; we have grown and this year promises even more. The Swedish government's representative M. Lagercrantz has kindly promised the Swedish son's and daughter's in Chicago a warm welcome from the fosterland, and their appreciation of Chicago's splendid work, and the proceeds of the midsummer festival will be used to help the needy of our landsmen which are growing daily in numbers.</p>
   <p>Swedish National Society has made itself well known for its philantrophy, and also for its charitable work. Some six-thousand Swedish men and women, have free of charge distributed help through this society: to widows, fatherless cripples, and the sick, to the extent of hundreds of dollars worth. Old people have been placed in old peoples homes, the unfortunate and needy have been given a great deal of financial help.</p>

   <p>It so happens the society not long ago were able to secure the freedom from prison John A. Nordgren who had a thirty year sentence. He was a member of Svithiod Lodge No. 1. In order to continue such work and to enlarge on it, the Chicago Swede societies should attend the midsummer festival at Elliots Park, June 23 and take part in this splendid work, and to get the full value of the program.</p>
