   <p>Editor J.A.Enander gave a lecture last Wednesday in the Immanuel Church. His topic was: "The Swedish Nationality in America." Mr. Enander's lecture was very interesting. He predicted that the Swedish nationality in the United States was going to have a great influence upon the future life and progress of America. "The main thing for us Swedes," he said, "is not only to preserve and defend the manly Nordic character we have inherited from our forefathers, but also to adopt all the good we will find among our American brethren."</p>
   <p>Forty million inhabitants in this country are attentively observing us, watching us and the work we are doing for the good of this canny nation. Our duties are great and we have a responsibility both as citizens and as church members.</p>
