   <p>Hemmets Van (The Home Friend) is the name of a new monthly published here in Chicago. Its circulation is quite large among the congregations of the Swedish Church; and the members of the editorial and business staffs of the new paper are, for the most part, preachers. It is the only Swedish, or Scandinavian, monthly in America that is as well edited and as well composed as any American monthly published in the United States. The editors are careful in the selection of material for this excellent paper.</p>
   <p>There is always something to criticize. The paper claims to be Scandinavian, but it appears to be Swedish Nationalistic. When the term Brodrefolket (sister nation) is used, we find it always in quotations. Or, "Our brothers across the border".</p>
   <p>If a paper is Scandinavian it should be Scandinavian, in every sense of the word.</p>
