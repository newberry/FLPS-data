   <p>The Scandinavians know how to give their festivities a certain historical significance by including living pictures and even dramatic presentations of important events. They are masters in this respect. During the first half of the season, the state of the North Side Turnhall often functioned as a pictorial show place, where Gustav Adolphos' deeds of valor and the prowess of Nordic heroes were depicted. The local Swedes arranged a similar festival at the Armory of the Second Regiment, last Wednesday, which helped considerably in producing more funds for the Linne Memorial. This historic Wednesday marks an important botanical achievement which was realized 160 years ago. Linne at the time had just completed his now famous system of plant classification, the family and specie enumerating method. This occurence was the incentive for the celebration. Four Swedish Knights, armed with lances and garbed in 16th century costume, paraded as guards before the entrance to the hall. On the highly decorated stage, scenes from the Fridjof saga(and others) by the famous Swedish author, E. Tegner, were presented, followed by rustic dances in national costume. Linne's compatriots intend to erect a monument in Lincoln Park to perpetuate his memory. It is said that considerable sums have been contributed for this purpose</p>
