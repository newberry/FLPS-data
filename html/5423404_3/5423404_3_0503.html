   <p>The Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago held a meeting last week at King's restaurant, and elected officers for the coming year.</p>
   <p>Gustave A. M. Liljencrantz is the new president; the vice-president is Albin Rissler. The Society now has a membership of 110 and has been growing steadily, thanks to its popular and energetic secretary, G. A. Akerlind. Swedish engineers here appreciate the Society's function as a means of keeping them together and keeping track of each other in this great city. The Society also affords an opportunity for discussing professional problems with colleagues. We wish the engineers continued success in the coming year!</p>
