   <p>A campaign for the purpose of raising funds for the two hospitals operated by the Illinois Conference of the Augustana Synod, the Augustana Hospital in Chicago and the Lutheran Hospital in Moline, will open October 15,and continue through October 22. Plans for this campaign have been under way for some time, and took final form September 8, when the pastors of the Conference met in the old Immanuel Church here to observe the centennial of the birth of the great Swedish-American religious leader, Dr. Erland Carlson. At this meeting the time for the campaign was decided upon, and also the definite sum which was to be its goal, namely $250,000. Dr. C. E. Hoffsten, pastor of the Grace congregation consented to serve as campaign manager, and district managers and assistants were selected. Pastor L. E. Jones is in charge of the publicity department.</p>
   <p>During this campaign, every member of the congregations which belong to the Conference will be canvassed. This method has brought good results before, and it is expected that it will do so again. Pledge cards will be distributed among the congregations; on these cards contributors are to put down the amount they wish to give, and the sum pledged may be paid in installments.</p>
   <p>With respect to the division of the money obtained, it has been decided that the collections from the three Chicago districts are to go to the Augustana Hospital, and those from the Rock Island district to the hospital in Moline. However, each contributor has the right to say which institution is to benefit from his gift.</p>
   <p>Of the money collected outside the districts just mentioned, seventy per cent will go to the Chicago hospital, and thirty per cent to the one in Moline. But here, also, the provision is made that the giver himself may make his own choice.</p>
   <p>It should be pointed out that this marks the first time that a general request has been made to all congregations within the Conference for support of these hospitals, and this support is now very much needed. The Augustana Hospital must be enlarged if it is to fill the heavy demands that are being made upon it. The campaign of February, 1920, brought $163,000, and the proceeds from the one that is now about to start are estimated at $150,000, making a total of $313,000. When, to this, is added the sum which the sale of the present hospital building will bring, the total building fund will reach some $600,000. It is considered that this amount, together with the necessary loan, will be sufficient to finance the hospital's building plan, which was decided upon a couple of years ago. The Lutheran Hospital in Moline has some debt, and needs $100,000 for the liquidation of it, and for the current construction program.</p>
   <p>These two hospitals are not to be considered as charitable institutions, but the free medical services which are given each year represent a considerable sum.</p>
   <p>According to a written statement given out by Dr. M. Wahlstrom, superintendent of Augustana, in connection with the coming campaign, the value of free services given by this hospital since 1917 averages $10,776.24 per year. This does not include the five or six hundred free operations performed every year, representing a cash value of between fifty and sixty thousand dollars. To this must be added other services donated by the medical staff.</p>
   <p>Those in charge of the campaign are very optimistic. So far, all signs point toward success. On September 19 the nurses of the Augustana Hospital, at a banquet given for them by the campaign committee, pledged a total of $3,175. Fifty-seven nurses were present, so the average donation was fifty-six dollars. Since then, many other nurses have sent in their pledge cards. On September 23, alumni of the hospital's school of nursing gathered and pledged $1,675, an average of sixty-seven dollars per person. Hundreds of other nurses, who obtained their training at Augustana, and who are now working in other parts of the country, have indicated their desire to help make the drive a success. There is no better way in which they can show their gratitude to their alma mater, and they are setting an example which we hope will be followed by all members of all congregations in the Conference.</p>
