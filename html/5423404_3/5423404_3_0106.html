   <p>The Swedish Theatre will be presented once a month by the Swedish Dramatic Actors under the auspices of the Swedish National Society. The season will open on October 4 with the play "Varmlandingarng" at the Garrick Theatre. That which in particular will draw the Swedish public to this performance is Anna Pfeil, playing the part of "Anna." It is three years since Mrs. Pfeil moved from Chicago with best wishes from her admirers. She will surely receive a warm welcome.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Pfeil is also going to play a part in the unique play "Rospeggarna," which is making its first appearance in the U.S.A. at the Garrick on Sunday, October 11. At the beginning of these performances a group of Skansendansarna from Stockholm will perform. These should fill the house both times.</p>
