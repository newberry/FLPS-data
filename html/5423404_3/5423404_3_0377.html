   <p>p.11.................A banquet is to be given in honor of Doctor of Philosophy Hjalmar Edgren next Saturday evening at the Union League Club by his friends and admirers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Edgren is one of the few countrymen whose name is respected and honored throughout the country, not least among the Americans themselves. As professor of Roman languages and sanscrit at the Nebraska State University for a number of years, he has made himself outstanding in his own field. His fame as a Philosopher is even known in old Sweden; and has occasioned his name to be mentioned for a responsible position at the Nobel Institute of the Swedish Academy. To take over this work Dr. Edgren will begin his journey to Stockholm next week, and it is for this reason the farewell banquet will be given Saturday evening.</p>
