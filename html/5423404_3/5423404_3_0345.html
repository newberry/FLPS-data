   <p>The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the renowned Danish writer of fairy tales Hans Christian Andersen will be celebrated with great festivities in Chicago, on April 2 and April 3. In passing, it may be mentioned that similar festivities will be celebrated in about seventy other cities in America. The idea originated in Chicago, and for this reason the festivities will be of greater magnitude here then elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Charles J. Ryberg, in the county recorder's office is the originator of the idea. A committee consisting of prominent Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians has already been selected to arrange for the festivities, and this committee is at present busy arranging a banquet to be held in the Auditorium on April 2, <span class="page-break">\2</span>at which occasion Edmund James, president of the University of Illinois will be the principal speaker. In the afternoon, a mass meeting will be held at the statue of Andersen in Lincoln Park, and the chief speaker on this occasion will be Governor Deneen. The intention is to invite all the school children to the Lincoln Park meeting.</p>
   <p>A Danish folk-festival will be held on the evening of April 2 and April 3, in Orchestra Hall. Memorials of the great writer of fairy tales will be read in the public schools of the city.</p>
