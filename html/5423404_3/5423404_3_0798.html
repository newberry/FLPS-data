   <p>A few weeks ago the Swedish Free Church in Lake View opened a school for Swedish newcomers who wish to learn English. The response has been highly encouraging, and two classes have now been formed, with a total of 230 pupils. The classes meet every Monday night, and instruction is free.</p>
   <p>The congregation's pastor, Harry Lindblom, and Edith Johnson are the teachers. Years ago, the pastor was a student at one of the universities here, and he is a graduate pharmacist. Miss Johnson is employed as a teacher in the public schools, and is also a Sunday school teacher. The English instruction includes spelling, reading, and conversation.</p>
   <p>The church is located at 3516 Sheffield Avenue, just north of Newport Avenue.</p>
