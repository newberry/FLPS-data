   <p>Thursday last week was "Swedish Day" at the Fair. An appropriate program was presented under the auspices of the American Daughters of Sweden, and "the day" went on record as being a most successful event from all angles.</p>
   <p>In the Swedish section of the Fair are exhibited Swedish art, home craft, and industrial products in a great variety. A large portrait in oil of Colonel Lindbergh by Axel Linus attracted great attention and admiration.</p>
