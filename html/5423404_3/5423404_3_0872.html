   <p>"Swedish Contributions to Science" is the subject of a series of free public lectures, which will be given in the Chicago Academy of Science lecture room, in the Museum building, the first and third Fridays of February, March, and April, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>These lectures will be held under the auspices of the Swedish Study Society in conjunction with the Academy. The first lecture, which will be held Friday, Feb. 7, will deal with Linne as a zoologist. The lecturer is Dr. W.A. Locy, Professor of Zoology at Northwestern University. The following four lectures will deal with Swedish research into botany, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The lecturers are authorities on these subjects at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, Professors John M. Coulter, Julius Stieklitz, Henry Crew, and Leonard E. Dickson.</p>

   <p>The final lecture, by Mr. J. Christian Bay. the director of the John Crerar Library medical division, comes also as a representation of Swedish North Pole expeditions.</p>
   <p>These lectures, in which American scientists will present the work of Swedish scientists, should be of the greatest interest for the Swedes of Chicago. It is hoped that they will avail themselves of this unique opportunity to hear how Swedish scientific discoveries are regarded in scientific circles in this country.</p>
