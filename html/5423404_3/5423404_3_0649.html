   <p>This time of the year is inventory time, and Svenska Nyheter will follow the old custom and take stock of itself as a new year is about to begin. We have an idea that the public desires a newspaper to make a statement concerning itself at least once a year, and just as frankly as it writes about others the rest of the year.</p>
   <p>Regardless of consequences, Svenska Nyheter will in the coming year, as in the past, be independent and impartial in every respect. If we go to the front for the sons and daughters of labor, who carry the heavy burdens, toiling in the heat of summer and the cold of winter, we do so because we are convinced that their demands for a better life are justified. They are the producers of the world's goods, and where would society be without them? Our motto might well be: "He who will not work shall not eat."</p>
   <p>If we are rebuked for not throwing ourselves into the middle of the political <span class="page-break">2</span>battles, our answer is that there is too much squabbling as it is; the real issues are lost sight of as they are dragged through the dirt, and ideals are being exploited by political leaders, who only want more power for themselves. We consider it degrading to work in their behalf.</p>
   <p>If we are not always to be found by the side of our religious leaders in their work for the betterment of humanity it is because, in our judgment, they do not walk the road which leads to light and life.</p>
   <p>Svenska Nyheter will offer as great a variety of features as possible. We will present American as well as Swedish and other foreign news, and also articles from near and far. Among our weekly features will be "Answers to Legal Questions," "Women and the Home," "Among the Sons of Labor," and "Swedish-American Singers and Musicians."</p>
   <p>We enjoy presenting articles of a scientific and literary nature, and will do so as often as possible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We have had in the past and will continue to have in the future, more and better serial stories than any other Swedish-American newspaper.</p>
   <p>Our editorials will continue to express our sincere opinion on important questions of the day and of our times. We will encourage our readers to do their own thinking and act according to their thoughts.</p>
   <p>We shall continue to oppose self-styled spiritual and political guardians and bosses; they are dictators at heart.</p>
   <p>Svenska Nyheter is opposed to conducting lotteries or prize contests of any kind, for they cause much disappointment. We do want more subscribers, but we will rather close up than get them by such means.</p>
   <p>Our subscription price is one dollar per annum. We do not make promises that we cannot keep, and we do not give away prizes. But we know our worth, and we are telling the plain truth when we declare that our subscribers are getting a bargain.</p>
