   <p>The All-Swedish Day arranged by the Swedish National Association of Chicago last Sunday in the Cole's Park was favored by ideal summer weather. The program was the most ambitious and interesting one ever offered by the Association on any similar occasion, and it was executed exactly according to schedule. The attendance was quite good, but it should have been better in view of the humane purpose of the festival, namely, the raising of funds for the Association's welfare work during the coming winter. Last full and winter the organization raised twelve thousand dollars for that purpose, and every cent of that sum was sorely needed, in fact, much more could have been used to good advantage had it been available.</p>
   <p>The most interesting part of the program, and that which took the longest time, was the historical revue which depicted important happenings in Swedish and American history down through the ages, beginning with the exploits of <span class="page-break">2</span>Erik the Red and his son, Leif Erikson, the discoverer of Vinland, which is now called America.</p>
   <p>The various scenes were accompanied by appropriate music and song, and the entire performance was very fine.</p>
   <p>The program ended with the singing in unison of "America".</p>
   <p>The All-Swedish Day was an enjoyable event, and the National Association and all those who contributed their time and talent for the benefit of their needy fellow countrymen deserve our hearty thanks.</p>
