   <p>Sweden, the land of sunlit nights and majestic mountains, mysterious and romantic lakes and glittering streans, was presented [on the screen] twice last Sunday at the Selwyn Theatre, Dearborn and Lake Streets.</p>
   <p>These pictures from Sweden, better than any previously shown here, were made by the Swedish Biograph Corporation of Stockholm. The photography is excellent, and the motives well chosen. The film takes the audience on a trip from New York to Gothenburg, Sweden, and thence northwards along the coast of Bohuslan; next to Trelleborg, and from there by train to Stockholm. The views of the capital are especially fine.Many a Stockholmer in the audience had forgotten that his home town is so beautiful. The voyage continued with a side trip into Finland, and from there, by way of the Indal river, to Jamtland, and through the lake region of Lapland, smiling in the rays of the midnight sun. After having visited places of historical interest in Skane, the traveler on this magic voyage returned to Gothenburg by way of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Gota canal.</p>
   <p>Both the matinee and the evening show were given before capacity houses. There may have been some in the audience who were disappointed, because they were not given a glimpse of their own home town or that particular spot in Sweden which they love best. But they may have better luck next time. More such shows, with pictures from other parts of the Old Country, are planned. The accompanying music was furnished by Bredfield's orchestra, and beautiful Swedish songs were rendered by the tenor, Mr. Karl Wang, of Stockholm.</p>
