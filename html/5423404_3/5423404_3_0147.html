   <p>Would it not be possible for a city like Chicago, that has more than 100,000 Swedish inhabitants, to have a Swedish theater? If one considers it from an economic standpoint, it is a sheer impossibility to give a play in the North Side Turner Hall, without giving a public dance to increase the receipts. The Swedish Theater Company gave some splendid performances last winter, and it is hoped that they will continue to entertain the Swedish public.</p>
   <p>Consequently, an attempt will be made to give Swedish plays in the Studebaker Theater on Michigan Ave., commencing October 26, when "The Wedding in Ulfasa" is to be presented. Those responsible for the Swedish Theater taking this important step in the preservation of Swedish culture in America, <span class="page-break">2</span>are as follows: Othelia Myhrman, Christ Bursell, Ernst Behmer, Anna Pfeil, Anderson Wagner, Agnes Hedstrom, Ellen Graf, Hanna Hoitfeldt, Theresa Smalbarg, Mrs. Palmblad, Ernest Lindblom, Knut Schroder, Leopold Kjelland, Fred Balling, John Lindhagen, Chas. Erickson, and Carl Linneblod.</p>
