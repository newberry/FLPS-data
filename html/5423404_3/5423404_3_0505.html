   <p>The Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago held its monthly meeting at Kuntz-Remmler's last week, with Albin Rissler presiding. The subject under discussion for the evening was "The Liability Act of the United States." Insurance practices in England, France, Germany, and Sweden were compared with conditions prevailing in the United States, and it was convincingly brought out that the question of liability constitutes a problem here of major importance, which calls for a speedy and wise solution.</p>
   <p>Henry Ericsson, the building contractor, cited cases from his own experience, showing how difficult, not to say impossible, it is to obtain just settlements in accident compensation cases, and he also pointed to the excessive rates which employers must pay to private underwriters for accident insurance.</p>
   <p>Another difficulty is presented by the many attorneys who find this a profitable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>field, and often take the lion's share of their clients' compensation after the case has been successfully concluded.</p>
   <p>The discussion was very interesting and instructive, and the meeting ended with a Swedish buffet supper, song, and music.</p>
