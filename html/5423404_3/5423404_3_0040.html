   <p>The Svithoid Club will give its first offer in minstrelsy next Saturday at 8 P.M. The program will consist of two parts; the first will contain ten selections, namely: "Tantalizing Eyes," "Love's Sorrow," "Gambling Man," "The Riddle Song," "Home Ain't Nothing Like This," "Take Me for Thihe Own," "Mr. Dooley," "In a Hundred Fathoms Deep," "Closing Chorus."</p>
   <p>The second part will consist of "I'll Wed You in the Golden Summer Time," "You'll Always Be the Same Sweet Girl to Me," and the monologue "Kentucky Babe."</p>
   <p>This is a very ambitious program which required a tremendous amount of <span class="page-break">\2</span>planning and rehearsing.</p>
   <p>The show will be given in the Club's elegant quarters at 1768 Wrightwood Avenue. The tickets cost but fifty cents. Due to the length of the program, the show will start promptly at 8 P.M. without the usual academical quarter hour of lost time.</p>
