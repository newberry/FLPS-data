   <p>Gladt Humor (Happy Humor) is the title of a collection of humorous tales in verse and prose by Gus Higgins, which has just been published by And. L. Lofstrom's publishing house, 113 Oak Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Through the some one hundred pages, Wiklund tells why "He Was So Darned Happy"; Captain L. . m sits "In the Fox Trap"; then we hear the "Bjorneborg March" and Sigurd's "Mama," and "Proposal by Advertisement". We must also mention the soul-stirring poems "Fia Jansson" and "Steamboat Carl," etc.</p>
   <p>Happy Humor is well worth reading, and costs 25 cents.</p>
