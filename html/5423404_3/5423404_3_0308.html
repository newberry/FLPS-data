   <p>The Swedish National League's midsummer festival which was held in Elliott's Park last Sunday, was favored by perfect weather and attended by approximately thirty thousand people. The opening ceremony included the raising of the Maypole, accompanied by the hoisting of the American and Swedish flags to the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Du Gamla, Du Fria" (You Old, You Free).</p>
   <p>Among the choruses participating were Orpheus, Iduna, Norden, Lyran, and Zephyr, which entertained generously with the fine old Swedish folk songs. One of the most interesting numbers on the program was the selection of the May queen; the choice fell on Miss Ellen Hookanson, Brage Lodge's candidate, and she was awarded a gold medal. At the rate of five cents per vote this contest netted five hundred dollars, which was donated to the fund for Swedish tuberculosis sanitariums.</p>
   <p>Both grownups and children enjoyed themselves thoroughly,watching and <span class="page-break">\2</span>participating in athletic contests, folk dancing, modern dancing, and general merriment. One might well imagine that one had been transferred to some Swedish village green.</p>
   <p>The receipts of the day amounted to $15,000.</p>
