   <p>A History of Swedish-American Book Publishing, by Ernest W. Olson, has just been published by the Engberg-Holmberg Publishing Company, on the occasion of the firm's observance of its golden jubilee. Its present location is 358 West Chicago Avenue.</p>
   <p>The book, which is of quite a personal and polemic nature, gives a detailed and interesting story of Swedish-American publishing activities from their early beginning.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that the firm's anniversary coincides with that of Augustana College of Rockford, Illinois, the first Swedish-American institution of higher learning.</p>
   <p>This new historical work is a valuable contribution to Swedish-American cultural <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>history, and is well worth reading by everyone who is interested in that subject and wants to learn more about it.</p>
