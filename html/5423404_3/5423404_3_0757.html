   <p>The great Swedish film, "Gosta Berling's Saga," with Greta Garbo and Lars Hanson in the leading roles, and equipped with English text, was shown last Sunday afternoon in Orchestra Hall. Much has been said and written about this picture, and it was evident last Sunday that it is still a great attraction, for Orchestra Hall was almost sold out. It is not necessary to review here Selma Lagerlof's great book and the film version of it. Most Swedes know it by heart, and they, as well as the American public, have received it with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday's performance was given for the benefit of the projected Swedish charity institution, the Colony of Mercy, and marked the final Chicago showing.</p>
