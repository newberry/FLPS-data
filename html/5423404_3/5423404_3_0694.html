   <p>The Year Book of the Swedish Historical Society is just off the press.</p>
   <p>The book contains many articles of interest, chief of which may be the one relative to the awarding of a Guggenheim Foundation stipend to Dr. George M. Stephenson for studies in Sweden pertaining to the immigration of Swedes into U.S.A. What values these studies will have for the Society and research work may readily be seen by the fact that Dr. Stephenson has been chosen to edit the Society's year book from henceforth.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Chapter of the Swedish Historical Society is composed of nearly two hundred members. The Society's National president is Professor A.A. Stemberg of the University of Minnesota.</p>
