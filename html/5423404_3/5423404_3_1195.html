   <p>The last six months have been the most progressive half-year period experienced by the Svithiod order, expecially because of the increased membership. Four new local lodges were organized in the Chicago district in which no less than 514 new members have been taken in. In addition to these there are sixty-eight whose applications were accepted, raising to 582 the total accepted applications.</p>
   <p>The total membership of the Svithiod order is 4,526 in the thirty-two local lodges. During the period seventeen thousand dollars for insurance have been paid. The cooperation of the Chicago district locals is again being demonstrated by the active work [done in] arranging for the combined picnic, of Svithiod and Svenska Sangeforbundet (Swedish Singers League), which will be held at Elliotts Park on July 29, 1906. The previous picnics of these two organizations were real successes.</p>
