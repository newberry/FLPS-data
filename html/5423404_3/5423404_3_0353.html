   <p>We venture to stamp Chicago's centennial as the biggest humbug we have witnessed during the days of our life. The event was started simply to entice farmers and village people to Chicago for the benefit of the storekeepers. As citizens of Chicago, we are ashamed of this type of festival which consisted of private banquets, cheap decorations here and there on some stores, a few imported Indians....no real festival day, nor any real celebration for the people. Every effort was concentrated on milking the farmers.</p>
