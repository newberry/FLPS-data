   <p>The Nordic Country Club is the official name of an organization just formed by business and professional of Swedish birth and descent in Chicago. At a consideration of $100,000 they have purchased a 200-acre tract of land in Du Page County, a few miles west of the City Limits and not far from Irving Park Boulevard. An eighteen hole golf course will be built and plans for the club house have already been approved. In addition there will be built an outdoor swimming pool and a ski hill. When completed the project will cost about $300,000.</p>
   <p>The original organizers were the following Chicago Swedes: Attorney C. Hilding Anderson: Herman W. Carlson; Capt. Ernest G. Dahl; Thomas S. Friend; Nels O. Johnson, Nils J. Lindskoog; Attorney C. Hjalmar Lundquist; E.F.T. Lindquist; Chas. H. Rosberg; Edward E. Streed and Rudolph W.N. West.</p>
