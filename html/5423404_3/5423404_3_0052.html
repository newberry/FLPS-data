   <p>Last Thursday, a concert was given in the Auditorium by the Central Lodges as a benefit for the Swedish Old Peoples' Home.</p>
   <p>The program was very elaborate, and covered almost all phases of Swedish nationalism.</p>
   <p>The "Bjorneborgs March," "On Narvas Plains," "On Polish Land On Leipzig's Plains," and "On Lutzens Hills," were marvelously executed, and it required some time to get back to realities. The hymn, "Native Land," sung by the Swedish Glee Club, brought much applause.</p>
   <p>Senator William E. Mason, furnished the oratory for the occasion. Dr. C. A. Ervald spoke for Thanksgiving. His subject was the "Spirit of Giving." "Give and it shall be given unto you."</p>
   
   <p>Doctor Ervald's talk embraced those simple truths, which cannot be heard too often, and yet are always new to its listeners. The evening of November 28 in the Auditorium will live in the memory of the audience for a long time.</p>
