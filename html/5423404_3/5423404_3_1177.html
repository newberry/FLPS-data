   <p>The Central Society met on the 9th of this month. Forty-seven delegates from different localities were present and a report from the management of the Old People's Home for the month of August was accepted. The income for the past summer was $350.08, Swedish Lutheran Emanuel Church was $32.00, Frithiof Lodge No. 5 I.O.S. and Miner Lodge No. 4 I.O.S. $20.00, Mrs. C. A. Bergland Cambridge, Illinois $5.00 and other incomes were $41.50, altogether $473.58. Expenditures for the home's upkeep were $174.30.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Lycknells tried to get into the home but from reports was unable to do so. In the home at present there are nineteen old people, and others who wish to come in are being investigated. Emanuel Church has had a large number of people trying to get in which was lucky. At the same time others have come to the home to investigate and has brought and served coffee to the old people. For this the society is offering thanks.</p>
   <p>It has been decided to hold a bazaar in the fall of 1908, and it is urging the delegates <span class="page-break">2</span>for next year to work as hard as possible to make this bazaar a huge success as possible.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to look into the question of buying more land, for example; twenty-acres so that the home can be expanded; the matter was left to the trustees for further consideration. Nels H. Olson was elected secretary instead of Albin W. Fridell who resigned as he is leaving the city.</p>
