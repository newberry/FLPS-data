   <p>The faithful old newspaperman, Gustaf Wicklund, assistant editor of the Swedish-American Post of Minneapolis, has gone to his eternal rest.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday a telegram from Minneapolis brought us the sad news that he suffered a stroke, and his death came the same day.</p>
   <p>Gustaf Wicklund was born in Gefle, Sweden, December 8, 1852. Having passed through six grades in the elementary school in Gefle, he went to Stockholm <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and secured a position in a commercial office, where he remained until 1878.... Then the America fever took hold of him, and he came to Chicago. During his first year in America, he was working on a farm near Chicago, then became bookkeeper in a tailor shop until in 1882. Following this, he became connected with the Swedish-American press, securing a position with the Swedish-American in this city.</p>
   <p>He remained in the service of that paper until 1884, when he was engaged as editor of the comic newspaper, Kurre. For three years he was editor of the Kurre, and remained with the paper also for some months after the Kurre had its name changed to Svenska Kuriren. In May 1888, Mr. Wicklund took a position with Svenska Folkets Tidning, Minneapolis, and in November 1891, Wicklund and the noted journalist, Ninian Waerner, became editors of the comic paper, Friskytten (The Free-Gunner) in the city mentioned. In 1893, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Wicklund returned to Chicago, where he became editor of Gus Broberg's comic newspaper, Humoristen. In this capacity, he remained until July 1898, when he was appointed to the editorial staff of the Svenska Tribunen. In 1900, he once more went to Minneapolis, this time as assistant editor of Svenska Americanska Posten. He was employed on this paper when death came.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wicklund's life was full of changes; he tried many things, but under all changes he mastered the situation. He was newspaperman, poet, theatrical writer, cashier, amateur actor and singer. Within each field he has left noticeable traces. Five plays of lightening-quick contents do we have from his pen.....and all of them have been enjoyed both by Swedes and by the Swedish-American public..... His writing was ever easy and direct, whether prose or poetry.</p>

   <p>Now his day is ended; the old giant has gone to his rest. --Peace be with his dust.</p>
