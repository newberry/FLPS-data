   <p>The Swedish societies in Lake View gave a joint entertainment last Saturday, the proceeds of which were to be given to the Swedish National Sanitarium at Denver, Colorado. The large Trinity Church was filled almost to capacity by an audience which was anxious to demonstrate its sympathy for the good cause in a practical manner. The entertainment was fine, consisting mostly of music and singing. The evening was also a success financially.</p>
   <p>Similar affairs will be arranged in Chicago and vicinity from time to time, and we do not have to urge the Swedish-American public to support so worthy a cause.</p>
