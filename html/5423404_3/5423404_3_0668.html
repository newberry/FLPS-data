   <p>p.6......A remarkable type of newspaper ethics is that which is favored by our contemporary publication, Svenska Kuriren (The Swedish Courier). As we have often before pointed out - our painful duty - the program of that newspaper included the emptying of the scoop of abuse over all and everyone, and there would be something out of order in the editorial department if an opportunity for abuse were to slip by unused. Up to the present time one has for the most part been able to perceive a certain method in this madness. The contemporary has always sought to have some pretense, more or less, for its assaults; but this became in all probability too troublesome in the end, if one may judge by the newspapers latest attempt to inveigh in words of abuse, unconstrained by any consequence. We pointed to this in the number for May 28, where better remarks are made in regard to Svithiod Singing Club's annual affair, "Vernamo Marknad" (Vernamo Fair). It will do no harm to reproduce a portion of the copy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We can not call this affair anything but an annually recurring humbug. It might have been justified or excused at first because of the sponsor's ignorance and incapability, but it seems to us to smack of shamelessness to lure people there year after year to pay more money for seeing such nonsence. Not even the boldest imagination can find any resemblance between the Vernamo Marknad of the Swedish country districts and the "spectacle" which is now going on in Ferris Wheel Park in Chicago. Our final judgement must be this, that the fair is not worth two stivers, and it is certain that he who has once seen the thrash, does not long to return. But for others, possible the advertisements in the newspapers are an inducement to waste time and money, which they later will regret.</p>
   <p>Of course, Kuriren often has been an advertiser, and has for profit, made mention of this affair and it is undeniable that it has won at the expense of the sponsors of the affair. It is reasonable then to ask where "the shoe pinches." He who believes that the affair has wounded the Kuriren's national feeling, is clearly mistaken. The reason for the newspaper's violent display of anger is none other than this, that it did not get as large an advertisement for the affair as it had expected. The private <span class="page-break">\3</span>aspects of this would be of interest to no one if they did not so glaringly show up to petty mindedness and the "stand and deliver" method which distinguishes the Kuriren. When the sponsors at the newspaper asked for kind mention of the affair, it was an inexpensive request on social affairs, a type which is usually granted committees. But the Kuriren specified a high price for the mention, and was perhaps, within its right. But when later the sponsor wished to put in a paid advertisement in the Kuriren, the newspaper insolently insisted on getting twice as large an advertisement as the party concerned was able to pay for. And when this attempt on the part of the newspaper to tell the committee what to do came to naught, the newspaper could always take revenge by "running down" the affair. This happened, too. Only abuse may be had from the Kuriren gratis. In this, the newspaper wishes most likely, once and for all to proclaim as its inflexible principles:</p>
   <p>1. The Kuriren is open to humbug - advertisements, if the publisher may dictate the size of the advertisement.</p>
   <p>2. The Kuriren's advertising agent will dictate whether an affair will be a success or a fiasco.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>3. Advertise in Kuriren, or else "the crack."</p>
   <p>Now, our Swedish societies know what they must or must not, do. For this example the Kuriren has most certainly earned for itself such great "respect" among other Swedish organizations that its newly initiated expansion program is timely.</p>
   <p>The little Kuriren as we have shown, has become outwardly a large newspaper. A pity, only, that as the foregoing brings out, the soul of the enterprise is still vest-pocket size.</p>
   <p>In this week's number, the Kuriren has been successful enough to have its journalistic methods approved by a person, who still is too cowardly to expose his name. "One, but a hare."</p>
