   <p>On behalf of the workers of the Svenska Nyheter, the president of the paper arranged a farewell social at the Swedish Glee Club for Mr. C. F. Erickson, the esteemed and highly valued manager of the advertisement department, who has resigned from his position on the paper to be succeeded by Mr. Gunnar Boberg. We wish to extend our best wishes to Mr. Erickson in any line of endeavor to which he may turn. A gentleman such as he, is deserving of all good that may come his way.</p>
