   <p>The Bible Institute and Academy of the Swedish Free Church began a new school year on September 6. The number of students has increased considerably as compared to last year. Everything indicates that the congregations of the Free Church as well as outsiders are becoming increasingly aware of the high type of instruction which is being offered by this institution. Dr. Gustaf Edwards is continuing as its director. The school is located at 4211 North Hermitage Avenue, in a building which belongs to the Swedish Free Church.</p>
