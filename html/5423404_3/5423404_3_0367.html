   <p>Last Sunday, the Orphie Singing Club had a family picnic in the beautiful woods, adjacent to Irving Park Blvd. Its newly elected president, C. F. Binsen, was with them. Dr. Gust Carlson entertained those present with an open air concert which was elegant. Such well-known songs as "Vart Land" (Our Land), "Blaser Nu Alla" (Blow all), "Jag Vet Ett Land" (I Know A Land), "Hor Oss Svea," (Hear Us Svea) etc., were sung. The proceeds will defray the expenses of the trip the Singing Clubs are to make to Jamestown, N. Y.</p>
