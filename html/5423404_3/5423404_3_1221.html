   <p>The Independent Order of Svithiod held its annual meeting in this city on Wednesday, February 3. Forty-three delegates were present, representing twenty-seven lodges. The meeting was called to order by Mr. Olof Pearson, in Room 210, of the Masonic Temple. In a happy manner Mr. Pearson welcomed the delegates and congratulated them on the development of the Order, and its strong financial condition....</p>
   <p>Since it was organized, about fifteen years ago, the Order has paid the following amounts as benefits to members of the various lodges:</p>
   <p>1.) Insurance to 199 deceased members, $167,480; 2.) Aid in illness, $90,379.63; 3.) Burial aid, $20,806.68; 4.) Donations, $9,576; Total, $288,242.31.</p>
   
   <p>The fact that such large amounts have been paid to members during the past years clearly indicates the extent of the activity of the organization; it also constitutes evidence that co-operation and union will accomplish much.</p>
   <p>The cost of $1,000 life insurance amounted during the past year to $11.80, and for $500 insurance, the cost was $5.90. The contribution to the sick benefit fund is about $6 per member, per year....</p>
   <p>During the past year, 623 people have applied for membership in the Order, and 516 have been admitted. Two new lodges have been organized, and there are now twenty-seven lodges with a total membership of 3,634.</p>
   
   <p>The revision committee, consisting of Alfred Wickstrom, J. Jansson, and N. O. Wiberg have gone over the accounts of the Svithiod and reported them in good, order, and correct in every way. The capital of the Order has been deposited in the State Bank of Chicago.</p>

All the delegates expressed their satisfaction with the decisions made, convinced that they would contribute to the advancement of the interests of the Order.</p>
