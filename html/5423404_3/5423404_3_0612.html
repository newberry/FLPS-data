   <p>The Swedish American and the Swedish World have consolidated. On the front page of last issue we announced that today's paper would be eagerly read by all who received it. We recommend to our readers, men and women, that they now decide if we were right, and we ask our critics as well as our friends to pay attention to what we have to offer.</p>
   <p>This is the way the Swedish American's is going to appear from now on. It is going to have twenty good pages of interesting, educational news of all kinds. The news, editorials and fiction will be the best we can find. News will be gathered, not only from the city here and the U.S.A; but from Sweden and other parts of the world. The most important news will be carried on the front page and when possible, pictures and illustrations will be presented. New sections are being added; other additions will be added as fast as possible.</p>
   <p>The very important fact is that the Swedish American and the Swedish World have consolidated, starting with this issue. Subscribers of these two papers one with twleve pages and the other with eight will receive the two in one. The new twenty page paper <span class="page-break">2</span>will be printed in two parts of like size full of the best reading material that we can assemble. We feel certain that our friends will be satisfied with this change for the better which will not be the only one, because we shall always strive to give our people a first class newspaper in every respect.</p>
   <p>In the consolidation a change has been made in the subscription price which benefits the public. Announcements of the change will be found on the first, fourth, fifth and eighteenth pages.</p>
