   <p>The Nordic vikingship "Viking," a true copy of the old viking ships of a thousand years ago, arrived at Chicago's Worlds Fair last Wednesday. It was anchored alongside the United States warship "Illinois."</p>
   <p>The ship was received by the directors of the Fair, the mayor, the city council, a cannon salute from the warship "Michigan," custom collector "Andy Johnson," the steamer "Ivanhoe," and a crowd of other flag-adorned steamers. "Viking's" chief, Captain Magnus Anderson, and his crew were invited to the steamer "Ivanhoe" where a reception took place.</p>
   <p>The history of "Viking" is very interesting. The ship is a true copy of an old viking ship thirteen years old and was found deeply imbedded in the sands of a Norwegian shore.</p>
   <p>Close to the little town Sandefjord on the south shore of Norway is a country home called Gokstad. Alongside it is a small hill which long ago was named "Kingshight." The mythical legend tells that a king with all his treasures is buried in this hill and several of the neighbors are certain that they have seen burning candles on the hill; yea, an old man says he has seen a horseman riding around the place.</p>
   <p>This old man Hans Christian Auve asked the brothers Christian and Ole Hansen in April 1880 to dig up the place and they found a tomb 22 feet down in the earth. They continued to dig during the Summer and made the interesting discovery of a well-preserved vikingship 23 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.</p>
   <p>It was syrprising to see how skillful the Vikings must have been in selecting material and in ship building.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian sea captain, Magnus Anderson, became interested in 1889, in building a true copy of this old ship and sailed the Atlantic to Chicago; thus remembering Leif Ericson, the first European, who, at the end of the ninth century, put his foot on American soil.</p>
   <p>The idea was received with great enthusiasm and now "Viking" is here!</p>
