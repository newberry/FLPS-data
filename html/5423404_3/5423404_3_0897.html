   <p>Dr. Otto Nordenskjold, our famous Chicago Swedish explorer and scientist, gave a very interesting lecture with stereoptican views as a part of the mid-winter festival held by the Swedish National League of Chicago. The festival was held on Thursday, January 25, in the Theodore Thomas Orchestra Hall.</p>
   <p>The musical portion of the program was exceptionally good, including the following home talent offerings:</p>
   <p>Dahlmarsch (Valley March) by Widens, Harmony and Orpheum male choruses, directed by Joel Mossberg.</p>
   <p>Abt's Morgonsang (Morning Song)</p>
   <p>Fredin's Gotland</p>
   <p>Insane scene from "Lucia de Lammermoor"</p>
   <p>Swedish Ladies Quartette</p>
   <p>Orpheus Male Chorus</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hanna Butler</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Grugs Den Store, Hvide Flok (The Vast Un-numbered Throng)</p>
   <p>Harmony Male Chorus.</p>
   <p>Following the concert and lecture, Dr. Nordenskjold and Director Mossberg were honored by the vast assembly at the Hall, all joining in singing well-known Swedish songs.</p>
   <p>Following the festival, the banquet, served in honor of these two favorites of Chicago's Swedish Colony, drew a packed banquet hall. Dr. A. J. Carlson, from the University of Chicago, serving as toastmaster, honored the honor guests in a really artistic and masterly manner.</p>
   <p>The packed Orchestra Hall and the Victoria Hall are evidences of the most hearty co-operation existing between all groups in Chicago's Swedish colony.</p>
