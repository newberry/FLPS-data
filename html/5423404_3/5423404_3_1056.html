   <p>The Linne' Monument Society held its regular monthly meeting last week. The proposal of the "Committee of Nine" to issue 4,000 Linne' medals was approved of, the medals to sell at twenty-five cents apiece. The "Committee of Twelve" submitted a plan of celebrations in connection with the dedicatory ceremonies on May 23rd. To these plans we will refer more fully in a later issue, but may it be said that there will be a grand concert and a banquet to be held in the evening of the day of the dedication of the monument. The question of the four flanking, allegory figures, again gave cause to an animated discussion, but it is apparent that the problem is nearing solution.</p>
