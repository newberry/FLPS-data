   <p>The lodge, Brage of the Order of Vikings, had a highly successful meeting last Thursday in the great auditorium of the Phoenix Hall. Sixty-three young boys joined the lodge on that occasion. An excellent dinner was served at the conclusion of the meeting, proving to the new Vikings that the time of jolly parties has not yet left us.</p>
   <p>The president of the lodge, J. W. Johnson, the examining physician, Doctor Wald, and the grand chief of the Order, spoke encouragingly to the members. Brage is the largest lodge of the Order of Vikings, and perhaps, the biggest Swedish lodge in America, having 601 members in ... good standing. Its treasury is in proportion to its membership. The expenses for the evening were $49, and the income $375., so that the Sons of Brage are on the upward way.</p>
