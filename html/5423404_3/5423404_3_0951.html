   <p>The much heralded wrestling bout between the holder of the World's Championship in Heavy-weight Wrestling, Joe Stecher, and our countryman, John Frieberg, took place Friday, 19th, at the Northside Turner Hall. The outcome was a victory for Frieberg. There were no falls on either side during the one-hour period of wrestling, but Frieberg won overwhelmingly on points.</p>
