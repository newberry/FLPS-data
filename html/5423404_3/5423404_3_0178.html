   <p>The Swedish Government's decision to participate officially in the World's Fair which is to be held here in Chicago next summer, came as a pleasant surprise. Most of us had given up hope of any official representation on the part of Sweden; in fact, it had already been reported that the government did not consider such representation advisable at this time. But certain private interests, with stubborn optimism, kept up the pressure on government officials, and a compromise was finally reached whereby the government contributes only one fifth of the expenditures, and the rest is put up by other interests. This happy solution certainly is accepted with joy by all Swedish-Americans,who, naturally, are anxious to see Sweden among the nineteen foreign nations which will be officially represented at the Fair.</p>
   <p>A couple of weeks ago we presented a reproduction of Architect Bengtson's sketch of the proposed Swedish pavilion at the Fair, and a very desirable location for it has already been reserved by Fair officials. It will certainly gladden the hearts of Swedish-Americans to see the Swedish colors wave in the breeze at the entrance to the pavilion. The entrance to the pavilion will be flanked by sculptures done by the renowned Swedish artist, Carl Milles. And other visitors to the great exposition will not fail to admire the clean-cut architectural style of the building and the beautiful sculptural ornamentation.</p>
   <p>The cost of the undertaking will undoubtedly bring satisfactory returns. Among the fifty million people who are expected to visit the Fair, there is, regardless of the hard times, an immense buying power, and it will surely pay to acquaint them with Sweden and the products she has to offer. Then there is the opportunity to present Sweden's attractions as a tourist country. These possibilities have never been fully exploited, and the American tourist public has always lacked proper information about Sweden. Especially in these times it should be pointed out that one can travel more comfortably there and for less money than in almost any other European country. Her invigorating climate and advanced culture should appeal to American travelers, and it is also worth noting that official relations between Sweden and America are most friendly and always have been.</p>
   <p>The value of the favorable publicity which Sweden will obtain by participating officially in the Chicago Fair can hardly be overestimated. Not only will the ties between the old country and its sons and daughters here be strengthened but also those between it and the United States, and this again will benefit every Swedish-American. For that reason we should be, and are, grateful to those individuals who have worked so faithfully to bring about this happy solution of the problem regarding Swedish participation in the Fair. We are especially grateful to Consul Lundquist and Tage Palm of Chicago.</p>
