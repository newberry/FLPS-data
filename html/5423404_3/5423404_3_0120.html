   <p>The play "Per Olson and His Spouse" a thoroughly enjoyable farce, will be presented at the North Side Turner Hall on Sunday, January 14. The foremost Swedish theatrical forces will assist. The play has been presented in Chicago only twice, but each time to a crowded house, and in both instances, the public was in a state of complete ecstasy from start to finish. It seems rather strange, therefore, that so long a time should have been permitted to elapse before any of our enterprising theatrical companies decided to give the people the kind of play they so evidently want: a chance to laugh for two full hours.</p>
