   <p>For a number of years, architect Hugo Westerberg has contributed sketches with a variety of motifs, chiefly in a humorous vein, to the Yearbook of the Swedish Engineering Society, and many of those who have seen them have felt that the creator of those delightful drawings is a genuine artist who just does not care to take his talents seriously.</p>
   <p>But it seems that Mr. Westerberg is finally beginning to get serious about it. Last Friday he opened an exhibit in the Walton Book Shop on plymouth Court. The exhibit consists of eighteen etchings, with a great variety of motifs, indicating that his skill is not of the one-track variety. Every one of the eighteen etchings are remarkable for their finesse and technical perfection. The exhibit is attracting much attention.</p>
   <p>It is a fine beginning and we hope that Mr. Westerberg will continue his <span class="page-break">2</span>artistic career, at least as an avocation.</p>
