   <p>The Swedish Engineers Society held its monthly meeting at Kunz Remmler Co., 303 Wabash Avenue, Saturday, Dec. 5. Engineer Albin Rissler acted as president in the absence of Henry Nyberg, who went to Sweden for the Christmas holidays. Hon. G. Bernhard Anderson gave a very instructive talk on law as concerns our daily lives. Six members were taken in. Henry Ericson, the toastmaster, brought up before the Society a commercial question of such importance to Chicago that the entire evening was taken up with it, until it was decided to hold an extraordinary meeting at Kunz Remmler's, Dec. 19, when important questions relative to the Society's future will be further discussed. Mr. Albin Rissler, G. Bernhard Anderson, M. J. Eichhorn, Fred Seaberg, C. A. Bolin, Hjalmar Lundquist, F. W. Iggberg, and G. A. Akerlind took part in the debate.</p>
   <p>The meeting made possible for forty industrial men to meet friends whom they had not seen for many years; in fact they did not know until then where to find one another.</p>
