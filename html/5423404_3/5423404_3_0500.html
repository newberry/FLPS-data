   <p>The board of directors and other members of the Chicago branch of the Swedish Historical Society of America met in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Fritz Schoultz, 441 St. James Place, on October 27, to discuss ways and means of furthering the interests of the organization.</p>
   <p>The historical library of the Society now comprises some fifteen hundred volumes and is at present housed, free of charge, in the Swedish Seminary in Evanston, since the Society has no place of its own for the collection. At the meeting it was suggested that Chicago is really the logical place for the projected Swedish-American Library and Cultural and Historical Museum. Several speakers discussed the subject and all agreed that Chicago would be the most suitable place for such an institution, since it is centrally located and is also the center of a large Swedish population. It was decided to continue preparatory plans for this project.</p>

   <p>The Society now has 198 members scattered all over the country, and more are wanted. Every locality where Swedish is being printed, and where Swedes have settled and made their historical and cultural contributions, should be represented in this organization.</p>
   <p>Professor C. G. Wallenius is the Society's president, and Ernst W. Olson is secretary. After the meeting Mrs. Schoutz served an excellent Swedish buffet supper.</p>
