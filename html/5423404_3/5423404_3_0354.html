   <p>The widely heralded industrial parade, which marched through the streets of Chicago last Tuesday evening, was nearly a fiasco.... Hardly more than three thousand people marched, although the parade was supposed to have been the largest and most picturesque [spectacle] ever held in the city. Even a few days ago, it was noticed that the chairman of the committee on arrangements did not understand the art of appeal to the public; no requests had been sent to the societies of the various nationalities inviting their participation in the parade.</p>
   <p>But now for the parade itself! First, a few mounted policemen, then a company of soldiers. Next came some Sunday school boys, shouldering rifles; they were followed by our splendid fire corps, and then came our sprightly Svithiod boys. There were a few commercial "floats"; undecorated trucks belonging to the Swift and Armour Companies; a few Indians; a dozen or so <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of private carriages. That was the greatly heralded parade. As far as we could see, the members of the Order of Svithiod were the only civilians in the parade. Eight hundred strong, they marched along, accompanied by two bands, the only bands in the parade except for the Daily News band. Mounted Valkyries and a "float" representing the Valhalla of the gods quite naturally drew the attention of the people. And so the Svithiod boys were given the first prize, a silver medal.</p>
