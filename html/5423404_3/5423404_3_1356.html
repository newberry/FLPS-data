   <p>We are all more or less acquainted with the battle being waged against the dreaded disease, tuberculosis, both here and in other countries. Not least in our native country. We know it as the "White Plague," or "consumption," as it is often called.</p>
   <p>You may also know that in Chicago we have a Swedish Tuberculosis Institute, with offices at 158 Adams Street, and also the Edward Sanitarium at Naperville, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The Chicago institute is attended by the best tuberculosis specialists in the city. The president is Dr. Henry B. Favall, member of the Augustana Hospital Staff. The institution is only in its third year, but it has already accomplished some splendid work. One of the worst problems is the financial question, but progress has been made by adopting the method used in Sweden, namely, by selling good will stamps. Last year, a sum of $3000 was thus collected here in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The workers at the Augustana Hospital sold $176.48 worth of these stamps. On Augustana Hospital Day, an additional $159.19 worth of stamps were sold at the stamp stand. This year, our workers will sell the stamps through the Red Cross Association. On December 18 and December 20 at the Post Office on Clark Street near North Avenue, and at the entrance to Lincoln Park. All Swedes should buy these stamps so as to support the splendid cause involved, and so that our Augustana workers may obtain good results.</p>
