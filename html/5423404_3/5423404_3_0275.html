   <p>The Summer Festival at the Swedish Societies' Old People's Home, in Evanston, last Sunday, attracted a greater throng than ever before, and was also favored with the loveliest summer weather, that could be imagined. It is estimated that from 15,000 to 20,000 people took part, but when people come and go the whole day, it is almost impossible to even make a good guess as to the number of visitors.</p>
   <p>Of this great mass of people very few left their pocketbooks at home. Chances on The Villa were sought after, and the refreshment stands did a good business. An unofficial estimate of net receipts was $15,000; this will most likely, be increased considerably, when a final accounting is made.</p>

   <p>The program began at 4 p. m., with the "Star-Spangled Banner," sung by Swedish Singers League and Swedish Song Veterans, directed by Elof Erickson.</p>
   <p>After the National anthem was sung, Governor Lowden said he had seldom heard it sung, as it was on this occasion. The next song number was "Hor Jag Forsen's vilda Fall," whereupon the chairman Mr. John P. Friedlund, presented Mr. Aaron Miller, president of The Old People's Home Society, who made a short speech of welcome. Governor Lowden was then presented. He opened his speech urging all present to buy chances at The Villa, and also paid a fine tribute to the Swedish singers, after which he swung into the subject of World politics and the dominating position the Americans should take in the World War, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>touching upon the grand loyalty and patriotism displayed by our foreign born citizens. After his magnificent speech, several times broken by applause, "America" was sung.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was The Swedish Consul General, Sigurd T. Goes, who in well chosen words spoke on The "Old People's Home," and the unselfish work performed by those high-minded men and women, who are responsible for its existence and success.</p>
   <p>The singers then concluded the program with "Bjorneborgarnes Marsch," "Glad sasom Fageln" and "Hor oss, Svea," whereupon the chairman thanked the many, who took part in the program.</p>
   <p>Late in the evening, the winners were announced and prizes awarded as follows:</p>
