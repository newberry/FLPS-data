   <p>The Linnaeus Club some time ago sent out invitations to its members to subscribe toward the erection of a new club house. The shares were to cost $20 apiece, and the estimated cost of the building to be between $20,000 and $30,000.</p>
   <p>We have now been informed that a sum of $10,000 already has been guaranteed. This is quick work and speaks well for the success of the plan and the organization as a whole. The Executive Committee is composed of the following men, all known as energetic and progressive spokesmen of our race: W. Hussander; G. A. Bohman; Charles Netterstrom; J. N. Laws on and C. O. Williamson. The latter,as we all know, is the Cook County Agent.</p>
