   <p>The famous Swedish-American scientist and head of the Departments of Physiology and Pharmacology of the University of Chicago, Professor A. J. Carlson, lectured before the Swedish Study League last Friday night in the hall on Newport Avenue. The topic was, "Swedish Contributions to Physiology and Medicine". He outlined the life work of several Swedes who through their researches in these branches of science have earned the gratitude of their fellow men.</p>
   <p>At times the learned professor became almost too technical for an audience of laymen. But the lecture was both interesting and instructive. We are sure everyone in the audience went home filled with awe and admiration for our men of science, who through years of painstaking work add to human knowledge, progress, and happiness.</p>
