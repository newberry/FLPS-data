   <p>The American Daughters of Sweden held its annual membership meeting last Tuesday in the Drake Hotel.</p>
   <p>Reports from the various committees were read and showed that the past year was a very successful one for the organization, and that its activities in various fields are expanding. The membership increased by eighty during the year. The great opera concert netted $2,156 and the card party, which was given on March 29, brought in close to $200.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected, and Mrs. Othelia Myhrman was re-elected president.</p>
   <p>Preparations are already under way for the great bazaar which will be given next fall. It is in charge of a committee headed by Mrs. Myhrman. Another opera concert will also be given in the fall in co-operation with the Chicago Swedish Glee Club.</p>
