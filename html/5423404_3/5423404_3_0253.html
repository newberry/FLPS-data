   <p>Swedish architects in Chicago who wish to be represented at the great jubilee exposition to be held in Gothenburg next summer should get in touch with Edward L. Jarl of the State Bank of Chicago as soon as possible. Mr. Jarl is in charge of this section of Swedish-American participation in the exposition for this district.</p>
   <p>It is planned to send to Gothenburg a representative collection of building plans made by Swedish architects of Chicago. This is especially appropiate in view of the notable contribution which Swedes have made to the building industry here. Naturally, drawings of larger and more impressive structures are desired; they should be accompanied by a general description of the building, information in regard to materials used, and estimated cost of construction.</p>
