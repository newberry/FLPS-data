   <p>The concert at the Studebaker Music Salon last Saturday evening was attended by a grateful public. The enjoyable program opened with an organ solo by Professor Emanuel Anderson. A mixed chorus under the direction of Mr. Axel Hvassman then presented Oscar Lindblad's "Dalkarlesang" (Song of the Valley Men), after which the noted young violinist Carl Oscar Nelson....played "Fantasiae Apposionate". He was wildly applauded. Then the male chorus sang "Herliga Land" (Glorious Land), and Professor John R. Ortengren sang a number of baritone solos in his usual excellent manner....Professor David Nyvall delivered a touching speech on "Home and Mercy". Once more the male chorus and the violinist favored the audience with some numbers, and Elizabeth Svanstrom recited "Slag i Saken" (Battle for the Cause). The mixed chorus sang Gounod's "Gallia" as the program came to an end.....The proceeds from the concert will be given to the hospital maintained by the Swedish Mission Association in Bowmanville, where hundreds and hundreds of ailing Swedes are given care.</p>
