   <p>During the month of January of each year, a number of women's organizations in Evanston co-operate in offering a course, the purpose of which is to increase the general knowledge of foreign countries and thus to promote under-standing and good will among nations. This annual course is called the School of Foreign Affairs, and has now been in existence for five years, during which time many important problems have been the subjects of lectures and discussions.</p>
   <p>Among the topics taken up this year was the question, "Does the Press Contribute to a Better Understanding Among Nations?" and among those participating in the talks was a representative of the foreign-language press, namely, N. A. Grevstad, former editor of Skandinaven. He delivered a very interesting and enlightening discourse on "Newspapers Here and Abroad," in which he particularly stressed the important role which the American foreign-language press plays in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Americanization of immigrants. In the discussion which followed, many of his American listeners admitted freely that they had not previously been aware of this function of the foreign-language newspaper. We suspect that many Swedish-Americans are just as poorly informed about the importance of their own news-papers, and they would have benefited greatly by Mr. Grevstad's talk.</p>
   <p>The speaker declared that the press is the best medium for the spreading of good will and understanding among nations, and stated flatly that the American press is superior to the European. It may not be as academic as the latter, but it is more practical. Our papers are better news disseminators, they treat the news more impartially and arrange it better, and they also have a more attractive appearance. Finally, they are more independent than their contemporaries in continental Europe, where the leading newspapers are under the control of the government and the political leaders, or of certain financial interests. Only in Scandinavia and a few other small countries is there a free and independent press.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The average newspaper cannot spare much space for news from foreign countries. Preference is given to national news. But the American press carries more accurate and informative reports from Europe than the European papers publish on conditions in this country. Most of the American news with which the continental European newspapers serve their readers is misleading, and tends to create ill will toward this country, rather than friendly understanding.</p>
   <p>Strange as it may seem, the most accurate conception of American conditions are found among the common people of Europe. For they do not get American news from the papers of their own country alone, but to a considerable extent from a special section of the American press itself. We have in this country some five hundred newspapers printed in about thirty different languages, which serve the thirteen million foreign-born people who live in this country, as well as many of their children. Many Americans have the idea that these news-papers serve only to keep alive foreign traditions, and that their influence is therefore in direct opposition to the Americanization process. The first part of this presumption would be correct if the word "only" were removed. They do <span class="page-break">\4</span>help the newcomer maintain his connection with the old country by giving him news from the homeland. They provide nourishment for his soul, until it is able to take its food from the new environment. The process may well be compared with that which takes place when a gardener transplants a tree. Around its roots he retains some of the old soil in which the tree has been growing. This soil keeps it alive until it has taken root in the new soil, which also has become enriched by the components of the soil brought along with the tree.</p>
   <p>The most important task of the foreign-language press is that of instructing its readers about America, in the language they understand best. These news-papers constitute the best medium for the Americanization process because they reach practically all those who need instruction, and because their instruction is practical and useful, and is both given and received automatically and continuously. This kind of Americanization started years before the term itself came into general use.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The foreign-language newspapers reflect American life as it really is, and people in this country send them to relatives and friends in the Old World. Every week, hundreds of thousands of copies are mailed to Europe, some of them bound for the most remote corners of that continent, where they pass from hand to hand as long as there is anything left of them. The readers are the common people, the lower classes, and they develop a truer and more thorough understanding of America than do the upper, more educated classes, who read only their own prejudiced press. Furthermore, many of these foreign readers are prospective immigrants, and thanks to the American foreign-language press, their Americanization takes its beginning even before they set out on their voyage to the New World.</p>
