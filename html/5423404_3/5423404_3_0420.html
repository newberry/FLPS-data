   <p>All the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish Societies in Chicago were invited by the Swedish Society Svea to co-operate in order that the three nations might be represented at the World's Fair as worthily as possible.</p>
   <p>Forty Scandinavians met last Monday night at the Sherman House, representing various societies and lodges. By-laws were accepted and officers elected. The purpose of this newly formed society is to gather as much exhibition material together as possible from their native lands, as well as from the Scandinavians here in this country. The members ought also to assist visiting countrymen at the World's Fair.</p>
