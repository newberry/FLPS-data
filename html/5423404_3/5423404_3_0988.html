   <p>Some newspapers in Sweden have resented the protest which the Svenska Kuriren voiced in its columns lately. We sounded a warning to the athletes in Sweden not to come to America to participate with director Peterson and his Chicago Olympic games, because of the poor arrangements he had made for the affair. Only one athlete in Sweden responded to Mr. Peterson's invitation.</p>
   <p>A Swedish weekly newspaper in Chicago, Hemlandet, is angry because we dared to voice our opinion in the matter, but we have only told our countrymen in Sweden and in the United States the truth concerning director Peterson's Olympic games in Chicago, and we dare to stand for this, our opinion.</p>
