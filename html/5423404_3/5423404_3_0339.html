   <p>From the early morning 'till late in the evening when the god of thunder hitched his bucks to his two-wheeled carriage, and Jupiter Pluvius started laying sinister plans for the drenching of all of us without further ceremonies, the ruler of the weather was in brilliant humor and sent rich measure of his gifts to the children of men. Owing to his good humor, those many thousands of our compatriots who had met at Elliott Park to participate in the celebration of the long, luminous night, enjoyed the festivities thoroughly, imbibing from the cup of joy even as they drank their friend Ogren's foaming mjod and his unseemly expensive lemonade. But when the heavy clouds began to line up in the sky, the thunder rumbled from afar, and rain began to moisten the earth, then the sounding of the bells took another tune. But that did not happen 'till eleven o'clock that night.</p>
   
   <p>About the middle of the day, when the people had satisfied their craving for food, and red wine and other drinks had moistened their dried-up throats, the official part of the celebration started. The Swedish Singing Association had taken their places on the great stage when Uncle Old entered to give the greeting of Welcome to all the visitors. Afterwards, "Du gamla, du friska" (Thou Old Yet Vigorous Ones) was played, and the "Star Spangled Banner," "Hear Us, Svea," and "Hail to the Lofty North" were sung. Then the American and the Swedish flags were raised aloft on the Maypole, and Mr. C. R. Chindblom gave a thoughtful, appealing oration on behalf of the American flag.</p>
   <p>Then it was the turn of the justly praised Attorney, G. Bernhard Anderson. Upon his appearance on the platform, he was greeted with vigorous applause. In an enthusiastic, (we are tempted to say, "fanatic") speech of praise and devotion to our old homeland, he paid his respects to the blue and yellow banner, "....the symbol of liberty, of high honor, and of loyalty." The speaker concluded his speech with a wish of long life to the little country so far up north; the audience gave their hurrahs, hats and handkerchiefs were wafted high, and the boys joined in singing "Vart land."</p>
   <p>A veritable storm of applause rewarded the singers, and it could not be stopped until a da capo was given. The extraordinarily beautiful and manly sounding melody....was very effective. The powerful bassos were well-modulated, and the execution, excellent in every detail, was worthy of every praise. The whole chorus has proven itself to be a gathering of really outstanding, intelligent individuals, with the precise, sure, and distinct training the men have undergone, they are able to present something really extraordinary in the field of the male chorus. The musical gems enjoyed by the audience at the Maypole will not soon be forgotten.</p>
   <p>At 2:30 P.M. competition in sports made demand upon the men and women; high jumping, distance jumping, and running. We had the chance to see fat and lean fellow-citizens jumping and running as if life was at stake. Endless, almost, was the glee as the broadly built matrons came waddling on, puffing and perspiring and laughing.</p>
   <p>The folk dances conducted by the Philo-chorus Society were very pleasing, and the public indicated its appreciation of the ancient, honorable dances by vigorous applause. Watching a group of people folk-dancing is invariably enjoyable. No black formal clothes, no white shining shirt fronts - only joyous and fresh colors which appeal to our eyes.</p>
   <p>Of course, everything went on vigorously and with speed, and with a sure rhythm such as only the members of the Philo-chorus Society can dance.</p>
   
   <p>The girls participating in these dances were sweet and appealing so that it was a pleasure to watch them. Long live the Philo-chorus Society. Miss Edith Danielson, 5951 Chicago Avenue, was elected the midsummer bride.</p>
   <p>Wherever one went in the park, places of attraction met the eye. There were galleries where one's photograph could be had for ten cents; there were ice-cream stands without end; there were lottery automats where chewing-gum could be won; there were shooting galleries where valiant warriors were firing; there were carousels and restaurants, and last but not least, beautiful shaded spots where a tired youth could sit, calmly smoking, while watching the amusements and his little girl friend.</p>
   <p>The festival was attended by about 20,000 people, not 15,000 as Record Herald states. As is well known, the owner of the paper mentioned is very friendly toward the Norwegians, and it was probably for this reason that his reporters wrote that the attendance at the festival was smaller than usual, since "the Norwegians, due to the dissolution of the union, stayed away." We have never met a Norwegian at these mid-summer festivals, but last Sunday we saw 4,000 more Swedes at Elliott Park than we have seen there any time before.</p>
