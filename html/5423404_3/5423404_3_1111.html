   <p>The thirty-seventh annual membership meeting of the Swedish Methodists' Aid Society was held last week, and the report was very encouraging. During 1914 the membership increased by 182 and was, as of January 1, 1915, 5,359. It has doubled during the last fifteen years.</p>
   <p>The organization is unique in that during the thirty-seven years of its existence its membership fee has not been increased and no extra assessments levied. A membership certificate costs $1,000, and persons between the ages of eighteen and fifty of Scandinavian ancestry, who are members of an evangelical congregation are eligible.</p>
   <p>The insurance department at Springfield, as well as other experts, give this Society the highest rating. Its president is August H. Skoglund; Frank A. Johnson, secretary; John L. Alstrin, treasurer. Requests for detailed information about the organization should be addressed to Frank A. Johnson, 167 West Washington Street, Chicago.</p>
