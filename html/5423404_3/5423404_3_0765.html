   <p>Next Friday night between nine and ten o'clock Radio Station WIBO, which is owned by the Nelson Brothers Bond and Mortgage Company, will as usual offer a Swedish program. In addition to the ordinary program the listening public will this time have the pleasure of hearing Mildred Boberg, a young soprano, who within a few days is going to Europe for further instruction in singing. This will be her last appearance in Chicago for a long time, and those who have not previously heard her should not miss this opportunity to enjoy her golden voice.</p>
   <p>As usual, Gunnar Kassman is in charge of the program.</p>
