   <p>The society has recently sent out its Year Book. It has sixty-four pages. It tells of the accomplishments for 1906, as well as what part the Swedish people have played in the national life in America since the Swedish landed in Delaware in 1600 up till the present time. The Year Book has a biography of John Morton, one of the Swedish American Revolutionists - one of the patriots who undertook self preservation at that time.</p>
   <p>The Swedish American Historical Society has undertaken a splendid work; namely, the preservation of all information pertaining to Swedish American culture, and anything else that might be of historical interest in regard to the Swedish people's presence in the United States. The society's work is, therefore, worth encouragement. These interested in the work may communicate with the secretary, A. G. S. Josephson, care of John Crerar Library, 87 Wabash Ave., Chicago, Illinois.</p>
