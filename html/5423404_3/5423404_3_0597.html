   <p>Tribunen-Nyheter is trying to live up to high standards, and wants to be a guide for its readers and to march forward with them. An individual who does not move ahead will lag behind in humanity's never-ending parade, and the same fate overtakes a newspaper which, having reached a certain degree of success, lays down to rest on its laurels. Ultimate perfection is never attained, and in all phases of life there are always possibilities for improvement. A progressive, modern newspaper must always be on the alert, taking up new ideas and advocating correction of social ills. The chief ambition of Tribunen-Nyheter for the coming year is to be in close touch at all times with the public which it serves, and whose mouthpiece it wants to be. All our efforts will focus on that particular aim.</p>
   <p>We are thankful for the confidence which the Swedish-American public has shown us in the past. It has been encouraging, and convinces us that the paper's contents and policies have the approval of intelligent and farsighted countrymen. The public expects and demands more of the press today than ever before, and we have been flattered as well as spurred towards still greater efforts by the sympathetic attitude of our readers, whose numbers are steadily increasing.</p>
   <p>Such reputation, popularity, and good will as this newspaper now enjoys we attribute primarily to the fact that we always try to reflect the Swedish point of view. Tribunen-Nyheter was the first Swedish-American paper to call attention to outstanding Swedish-Americans long before they won recognition by the metropolitan dailies and the American press in general. Most of our colleagues throughout the country have now followed this example.</p>
   <p>There was a time when no Swedish political candidate could obtain the support of the Swedish-American press, unless he was approved and nominated by the favored political party. The Tribunen-Nyheter broke this precedent by at least putting in a good word for all such candidates, and pointing out that, regardless of party affiliations, they were, on the whole, just as competent as their opponents of other nationalities. Since then a remarkable change has taken place in the attitude of our press, which has now attained a high degree of political independence. Not only politically, but in many other lines of endeavor, the Tribunen-Nyheter is active every week in promoting the interests of Swedish-Americans, and preserving our Swedish culture and venerable traditions, with due regard to proper adjustments made necessary by the transplantation to foreign soil. To that end we are continually improving our news service from Sweden as well as that from Swedish-America, and our serials and short stories, together with educational articles, are also chosen with an eye to this general purpose.</p>
   <p>Impartial and just toward everybody, the Tribunen-Nyheter is the first Swedish- American newspaper of any considerable distribution and size to make itself the spokesman of the common people. Much more might be said while we are on the subject, but this will have to suffice. Our efforts have brought gratifying results, which cannot be regarded as accidental. We feel that we have the approval and backing of Swedish-America.</p>
   <p>As the old year is drawing to an end we wanted to say this to our readers. We trust them, and know that they trust us and we are conscious of a deep feeling of mutual sympathy as we now wish you all:</p>
   <p>Happy New Year!</p>
