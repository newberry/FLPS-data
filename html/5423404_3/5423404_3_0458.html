   <p>When the co-operative temperance restaurant, Idrott [Translator's note: Idrott is the Swedish word for sports and athletics], was opened at 936 Belmont Avenue seven years ago, plans for a library to be operated in connection with it were already well under way. Two years later Idrott had some two hundred volumes on its shelves, at the free disposal of its guests. It is interesting to note that for a long time no books were lost, but all of a sudden a dozen volumes disappeared, and were later recovered in a private collection. This incident caused the management to change the free library into a rental library. New books were added regularly and lent out at a nominal charge. In the beginning it was not too difficult to satisfy the hunger for knowledge. However, thanks to the energetic work by those in charge, the number of clients increased steadily, enabling the library to procure more books, and at the present time it contains some six hundred volumes of modern Swedish literature. Among them are the works of Strindberg, Hjalmar Soderberg, Karlfeldt, Gustaf Jansson, Froding and Lindorm. The charge is now five cents per week per book, and according <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the 1920 report the income from rentals amounted to sixty dollars last year. Those who hold shares in the co-operative restaurant get books free of charge.</p>
   <p>Last fall two representatives of the Swedish Government toured America in order to study library methods here. They visited the Idrott restaurant and expressed their surprise and pleasure at finding such an oasis of Swedish culture in this cosmopolitan metropolis. They also informed the library committee that under certain conditions the Swedish Government might subsidize the undertaking. They knew that several Swedish societies had collections of Swedish literature, and a meeting of representatives of these organizations was called. Only the Good Templars, the Swedish Study League, the Verdandi Study Club and the Lake View Swedish Socialist Club answered the call, and Mr. Hjelmquist, one of the Swedish Government's representatives, addressed the meeting. He explained how assistance could be obtained from the Swedish Government for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive Swedish library in Chicago, where our countrymen may obtain Swedish literature free of charge. Persons who are interested in this cause may <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>obtain more detailed information from Idrott's library committee.</p>
   <p>A catalogue of the books now in the library may be had for five cents. The library also has about thirty periodicals and newspapers, which are at the free disposal of visitors.</p>
   <p>Books may be obtained on Thursdays from 8:00 to 10:00 P. M., on Saturdays from 5:00 to 6:00 P. M. and on Sundays from 12:00 noon to 2:00 P. M.</p>
