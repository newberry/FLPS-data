   <p>p.6.... Swedish song wins even greater recognition in America. This is witnessed by all our greater and lesser singing meets, and the singing conventions in various parts of the country. Under this heading belongs, also, the yearly music-week at Bethany College, at Lindsborg.</p>
   <p>This week is called "The Messiah" week, since Handel's immortal oratorio, "The Messiah", is then presented. It has been given thirty-six times by the "Bethany Oratorio Association," a male chorus as well as a ladies' chorus, render other well-known tone-creations during this same festival week.</p>
   <p>One of the numbers this year was Grieg's "Landkjenning" with orchestra accompaniment. Sixteen extra trains, besides the regular, brought people to the little Swedish town, and the net income is over $2,000.</p>
   
   <p>In the month of July, one may expect something special in Jamestown, N.Y., when the country's best Swedish singers will assemble there at the great convention. The event is already awaited with eager interest. Yes, long live Swedish song!</p>
