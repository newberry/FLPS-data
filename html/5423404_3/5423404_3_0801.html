   <p>Heinrich W. Maurer delivered a very interesting lecture on "Immigration and Its Causes" at the last meeting of the Swedish Study League, which was held last Friday in its building on Newport Avenue. He pointed out that it has always been economic conditions which have caused great masses of people to move from one country to another. The speaker did not agree that it was love of freedom which caused the establishment of the first American colonies. Many of the early immigrants were liberty-loving men and women, to be sure, but, according to Maurer, the driving force behind their migration was the desire to make money.</p>
   <p>The lecture was the first in a series of three dealing with "The Agricultural Immigrant".</p>
