   <p>P.S.Peterson, owner of Rose Hill's Nursery, had arranged a feast last Sunday for the directors of the Swedish Exhibition and other Swedes who are visitors at the Fair from Sweden. About fifty-five persons gathered under a big tent in his beautiful garden, where he served a most delicious dinner and good wine. The guests amused themselves with plays in the afternoon and departed at sunset, happy after a happy day.</p>
