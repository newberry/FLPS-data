   <p>At the behest of the Committee for Building Funds of the Swedish Historical Society in America, Mr. Alfred Soderstrom, the authorized financial agent of the Society, issued a call, a few months ago, to the Swedish people in America, for voluntary gifts for the purpose of erecting in Chicago a building to house the rich collection of the association. Since it has come to the attention of the officers of late, that there is some misunderstaning as to the size of the building intended, it is requested that the papers that gave space to the original call will kindly give space also for the following information:</p>
   <p>It is not at all the intention of the association to seek funds at the present time for the purchase or the erection of a 'monumental' building in the heart of Chicago where real estate values are enormously swollen; such a plan we know would not be possible to execute. What the association hopes to attain, through <span class="page-break">\2</span>the present drive, is a sum sufficient for the acquisition, in some Swedish district, of a two-story fireproof house, and, in addition, a reserve fund sufficient to give an annual income of a few hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>We beg to add that our undertaking is national, not merely local. Our collections are even now accessible to researchers wherever they hail from. Our call for money is, therefore, to Swedes from all over the country.</p>
   <p>The Committee for the Building Fund of the Swedish Historical Association, A.G.S. Josephson, Pres., C.G. Wallenjus, Sec.</p>
