   <p>The Swedish Tribune recently, and during the past years has been assured of having many friends throughout the middle West. To state or admit that this has encouraged us is hardly necessary. On the other hand, we are proud of this fact, and it is enabling us to turn out a good, interesting, and wide-awake paper that has grown steadily.</p>
   <p>We are now fortunate in obtaining one of America's best wielders of an editorial pen, the genial, efficient author and editor, Carl G. Norman. Mr. Norman, for several years, has been the editor-in-chief of "Svea" (Sweden), published in Worcester, Mass. His co-workers speak very highly of his talent and genial character; their great loss being Tribunen's great gain. Our entire force will remain and serve under Mr. Norman, our new editor-in-chief.</p>
