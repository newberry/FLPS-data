   <p>The Viking Lodge held its thirty-sixth Grand Lodge meeting in the South Side Viking Temple, Chicago, June 17 and 18. The meeting was opened by the Lodge's chief executive officer, Mr. Felix Johnson, in the presence of 136 delegates from 59 Fylken (districts).</p>
   <p>Transactions Friday evening were confined to reading the protocol and reports of the activities during the last year. Grand Secretary Eric Thulin reported the acquisition of 1506 new members, making a grand total of 12,578 active members and 127 inactive. Several new districts were organized within the year; namely Portland, Oregon, Denver, Colorado, Des Moines, Iowa, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. Fifteen members passed on to their reward, for whom $26,200 was paid out in insurance.</p>
   <p>Receipts of the Grand Lodge last year were $148,852.85; disbursements, $56,561.77; and resources at May I were $169,061.14, an increase over the year preceding of $92,291.08. The market value of the Lodge's insurance fund at the end of the year was 116.158%, an increase of 7.258% over the year preceding. The report further stated that the Lodge's Old Peoples Home at Gurnee, Illinois, had five inmates; two had passed away within the year. Friday's meeting ended at 11 P. M., and the session was resumed early on Saturday morning, when several important questions came up and caused a lively discussion.</p>
   <p>A proposal to change or amend the constitution in order to admit women was discussed and rejected. The point brought out was that the Lodge had existed for thirty-seven years and had grown to be one of the strongest in the country without having to open its doors to the ladies, who ought to support their affiliated Lodge, the Ladies of the Vikings. The Lodge's property, Viking's Valhalla, which heretofore had been managed and controlled by the executive board, was turned over to a committee of five members elected at the Grand Lodge meeting. The reason for this was that the executive board must devote its time to the Lodge's work and progress.</p>
   <p>The delegation from Nebraska, with the Lodge's organizer, Mr. Emil Peterson, as spokesman, invited the Grand Lodge to Omaha for its 1928 meeting. In this connection half a dozen telegrams were read, from the Mayor of Omaha as well as from many leading clubs in that city, all supporting the [Omaha] Vikings' invitation. After a lively debate the invitation was enthusiastically accepted.</p>
   <p>In the course of the day a telegram was dispatched to the aviator hero Charles Lindberg, congratulating him on his great exploit.</p>
   <p>As Grand Officers for the ensuing year the following members were elected: Grand Chief, George R. Swanson, Frithjof District Number 6; Vice Grand Chief, John Swanson, Ring District Number 18; Grand Secretary, Eric Thulin, Gotha District Number 14 (re-elected); Grand Treasurer, Alfred Hult, Drake District Number 3 (re-elected); executive board, Felix Johnson, Brage District, John A.

   <p>The installation of the new officers was conducted by the former Grand Chiefs, Herman Carlson and Gustaf D. Carlson, assisted by John Klingstedt. Business was concluded at 9 P. M., and all the members marched down to the banquet hall, where the tables were set.</p>
   <p>The banquet, at which two hundred were present, was opened by the president of the Viking Temple's house committee, Mr. Rognar Anderson, who welcomed the Grand Lodge to its first meeting in its largest and newest building, and he then presented the Grand Secretary, Eric Thulin, as master of ceremonies for the banquet. Music was furnished by an excellent orchestra, supplemented by several solos sung by members. The Northland Trio sang a number of popular songs, old and new. As proof of their popularity, they are already engaged to sing at the banquet in Omaha next year. Our countryman, the tenor Hjalmar Orn, who in his short visit to Chicago has already sung himself into the hearts of Chicago Swedes, entertained with several numbers.</p>
   <p>The newly elected Grand Chief, Mr. George Swanson, delivered his maiden speech and presented to his predecessor, Felix Johnson, the Lodge's emblem in gold as a particular token of appreciation to the Lodge's highest officer of the previous year. Mr. Johnson thanked him for the honor with emotion. Axel C. Peterson of Moline had tuned his lyre for a song for the Skaningar in Chicago. Editor Frithjof Malmquist gave a splendid lecture on our countrymen's share in the world's historic achievements and dwelt in particular on the two aviators, Erik Nelson and Charles A. Lindberg. Shorter speeches were made by Mrs. Anna Stohl, president of the Ladies of the Vikings, Carl Lisell, Edward G. Forsten, and Albert Eck, the latter two being delegates from Portland, Oregon, and Benton Harbor, Michigan, respectively, and speaking as representatives of the new lodges. The banquet lasted until midnight.</p>
   <p>On Sunday morning an excursion was made to Viking's Volhalla, where a herring breakfast was served.</p>
   <p>The newly elected Grand Chief, George Swanson, is a painting contractor. He was born at Trollhattan, Sweden, June 5, 1892, and came here when he was quite young. He lives with his wife Olga and one daughter at 2924 Berteau Avenue.</p>
