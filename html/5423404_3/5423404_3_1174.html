   <p>Without a doubt the Brege No. 2 of the Viking Order Lodge is the largest. Last Thursday evening 633 members were counted and fifty new comes were taken in. The meeting was held in the Phoenix large Hall, which was decorated with Swedish and American flags. Besides that, side by side were hung the Swedish weapons. A forest of palms was arranged one end of the hall and here thirty members from another lodge of Bratgurmannen between three-hundred or four-hundred were present at this meeting. The officers of Brage and of Odin had charge of the ceremony. A quartet from the Orpheim sang lively songs. Comrades Otto Nelson and Ernst Ekberg thanked the public ,who were invited to lunch and smokes.</p>
