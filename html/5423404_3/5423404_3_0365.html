   <p>The Manhem Lodge No. 2 gave a very fine festival last Saturday in Wicker Park Hall, North and Milwaukee Avenues.</p>
   <p>The speaker was the former State Senator, Frank D. Camerford, who spoke on the subject: "The Swedes and their History." The speaker gave much praise to the Swedes, saying in part that no foreigners who have settled in America make better citizens than the Swedes. He said such organizations as "Svithiod's" Lodges greatly add to, and make a better citizenry. The Svea Singing Club sang several numbers.</p>
