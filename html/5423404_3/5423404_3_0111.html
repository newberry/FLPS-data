   <p>Miss Hilda Englund came to America five years ago. Prior to that time, she appeared on the stage, where besides her mother-tongue, Swedish, she could speak the German, Russian, and French languages fluently. She was also able to speak English fluently six months after her arrival in the United States, says her press agent. She has been offered several tempting engagements from several smaller theater companies during the first two years of her stay here, but she refused. Instead, she plunged into studies intensively so she could be prepared to undertake more demanding parts on the dramatical stage. She has now appeared at the Berkely Lyceum during the last two years, and has been well received by the public and critics. She won her first glory on the Anglo-American stage in a play called "On the Road." She played a difficult part at the Carnegie Lyceum in Cooppees "Pater Noster."</p>
