   <p>Since the 12th of February,until this date, the Swedish National Society has secured work for five hundred thirty-eight men, and one hundred seventy six women. During the same time the Society has donated to the needy, the sum of $442.08. An old Swedish lady eighty-eight years old was directly given help by the Society, and also by the Mission Friends Home of Bowmanville. A sum of $209.77 was obtained to buy railroad and ocean transportation for thirteen persons, who, due to illness had to seek other climates. Of these, four were sent to Sweden, five to Denver, Colo., one to Iowa, one to Michigan, and two to Nebraska. The Society wishes to thank the Augustana Hospital for free hospitalization for an ill woman.</p>
   <p>Large preparations are being made for the Society's Mid-summer festival, which will be held in Elliott's Park on a Mid-summer evening. The proceeds from this will be used to help a worthy cause for needy Swedish people, so we hope our countrymen will go to Elliott's Park on this day.</p>
   
   <p>The officers of the Society for Apr. 5, 1907 are: George E.Q.Johnson, and Othelia Myhrman.</p>
