   <p>The Swedish National Dance Club is the name of a society organized last week in this city. The purpose of the Club is to revive, the old quick folk dances which have been nearly forgotten in our day. From this point of view of both picturesqueness and health these old dances are preferable to the modern dances.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fred Bolling is the founder of the Club and the director of dancing. He is very well trained for his task. Practice takes place every Thursday evening at the Club's hall at 82 Siegel Street. All young ladies and gentlemen interested in this activity are invited to the practice sessions.</p>
