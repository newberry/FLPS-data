   <p>A newspaper in Gothenburg, Sweden, Goteborg's Handels-och Sjofarts Tidning, recently sent here, is using the above headline for a sympathetic article concerning our well-known countryman, the marine artist Charles Hallberg, of Chicago, who is now visiting his native city, Gothenburg. The paper praises Mr. Hallberg for his talent as a marine painter, because he has never had any instruction to exercise his talents. He is only lead by his natural intelligence and his experience as a seaman for many years. He was "discovered" by one of the world's most prominent Swedish artists, Anders Zorn, whose influence made it possible for Hallberg to exhibit two of his paintings at the Chicago Art Institute.</p>
