   <p>The National Folk Dance Club, which was formed a few months ago, gave its first public performance last Thursday night at the meeting of the Idrott Young People's Club in the Good Templars' clubhouse on Newport Avenue.</p>
   <p>Birger Reberg, director of the Club, gave an interesting talk on the revival of folk dancing which has been taking place in Sweden of late, and how Swedish youth reacts to it. It was a surprise to many to hear that the old dances and games have become very popular among the young people and are important factors in their recreation and social training.</p>
   <p>Twelve couples, dressed in Swedish national costumes, took part in the performance, and were rewarded with hearty applause. Looking at them, one could not help thinking that this was much more wholesome fun for young boys and <span class="page-break">\2</span>girls than dancing to the music, and in the general atmosphere, offered by public dance halls. It was evident that both the dancers and the audience enjoyed themselves very much.</p>
