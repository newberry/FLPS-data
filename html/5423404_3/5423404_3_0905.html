   <p>"Healing by faith is neither Christian nor scientific. It is one of the semi-medical, semi-religious occurences which is peculiar to all ages, having science for its mother, ignorance for its nurse, and which has its best support in fanaticism and egotism." Thus spoke our fellow-Swede, Professor C. S. Hallberg, the other day in a lecture given by him at the closing festivities of Chicago College of Pharmacy here in the city. The topic of his lecture was "The Materia Medica of Christian Science."</p>
   <p>In support of the assertion referred to, Professor Hallberg stated: Aesculapus, the god of medical science in the old Hellas is depicted as a man carrying a cane around which a snake is coiled, a symbol of life and death. The poisonous snake symbolizes death, but when the snake is controlled by man, and the snake put in his right place, then it becomes the symbol of life and indicates that death dealing poisons may save life instead of destroying it, if suitably prepared and applied.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The origin of this symbol is found in the act of Moses of erecting the copper snake in the wilderness, and the symbol was later referred to and acknowledged by Christ. Thus we find the highest exponent of law and the highest exponent of love united in a symbol which becomes what may be called the "weapon" for the profession, the objective of which is to mitigate pain and suffering, and to heal diseases.</p>
   <p>Not only did the Savior and his disciples teach the healing of diseases by means of medicine, but the former made it a point to urge the latter to speak well of the men of medicine. Paul did not heal the stomach troubles of Timatheus by a faith cure, or by prayer, but prescribed the use of wine for him. Lucas the evangelist, who, according to the records, was himself a doctor, did not believe in healing by faith, while he accompanied Paul on his travels, caring for the latter's health so that he could continue his work as a preacher.</p>
   <p>The faith healer seens to forget that the healing of diseases merely should be <span class="page-break">3</span>considered an accident. To preserve health and to prevent disease are the main objectives of the medical profession. What could the movement for healing by faith be able to accomplish, that is against epidemics such as have destroyed the lives of millions in the past? The methods of the faith healer would never bring the desired results.</p>
