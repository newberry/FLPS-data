   <p>Yesterday, when it was too late for us to give a complete report in this issue of the paper, a banquet was arranged by the Swedish Glee Club in their Lodge hall on La Salle Street to honor John Ericson, who was fifty years old yesterday.</p>
   <p>John Ericson, city engineer, was born October 21, 1858 in Litselby in Skepptuna, Sweden. At the age of 18, he went to the Technical Institute in Stockholm, and graduated four years later as a civil engineer. In 1881, he came to America, where he became district engineer for the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis railroad, and later served as bridge builder for the firm of Hopkins &amp; Company of St. Louis. The following year, he became canal engineer for the State of Illinois. Since 1884, Ericson has been <span class="page-break">2</span>employed by the city of Chicago, first as draftsman, and then assistant engineer, but since 1897, as chief engineer, which position he now holds.</p>
   <p>Four months ago Ericson was accused of something unfair, but full explanation was given by the Swedish press, which led to Mr. Ericson's being offered a position as Stockholm's building chief. He declined this offer.</p>
