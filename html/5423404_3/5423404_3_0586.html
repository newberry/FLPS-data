   <p>Svenska Amerikaneren (The Swedish-American) last number, we read the following editorial comment, which must have been deemed of very special importance, because it was printed on the front page of the paper:</p>
   <p>"The reason why poems, that are sent us, are not printed in the papers, is that occasionally, they are too long; most frequently, they are too thick."</p>
   <p>The announcement seems to be somewhat incomplete. However, it is very snappy, indeed, and at the same time, unusually polite and cordial with reference to the readers. Should there not be a line added after thick? This, of course, does not refer to poems by the editor.</p>
