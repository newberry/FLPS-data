   <p>The Salvation Army arranged a "Scandinavian demonstration" last Thursday in the Swedish Mission Church at Orleans and Whiting Street. All the Scandinavian officers and soldiers in the Salvation Army in Chicago participated. Music was furnished by an orchestra, and its members appeared in national costumes. The attendance was large, and the meeting was very successful.</p>
