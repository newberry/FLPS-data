   <p>On the opening day of the World's Fair, Sweden was represented by its minister to Washington, Wollmar Bostrom. Her special Chicago representative was Consul C. Lundquist, and our noted countryman, Charles S. Peterson, represented all Swedish-Americans. Mr. Peterson has probably done more than any other single individual to bring the Fair to a realization, for he is the one who revived the idea after it once had been dismissed due to lack of popular support.</p>
   <p>And what he has done for the exposition in general another countryman, Mr. Tage Palm, has done for Swedish participation in it. It is chiefly due to his energetic efforts that Sweden is represented in its own pavilion.</p>
