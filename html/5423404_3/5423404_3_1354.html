   <p>The Swedish-American public is taking a heartening and ever-increasing interest in the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Denver, Colorado. Meetings have been held in various parts of the city and donations are pouring in. Reverend Carl O. Dahllen, who is now devoting all his time to this cause, is elated over the results so far obtained. During his short stay in Chicago one hundred persons have pledged ten dollars each, and ten others have pledged one hundred dollars apiece. If this keeps up he will not only reach the goal set for this city, but will go beyond it.</p>
   <p>On Thursday, March 24, a mass meeting will be held at Belmont Hall, Belmont Avenue and Clark Street, with Municipal Court Justice Harry Olson presiding, for the purpose of stimulating interest in the fund-raising campaign. Admission is free and the public is invited.</p>
