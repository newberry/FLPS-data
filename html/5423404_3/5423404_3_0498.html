   <p>The Swedish Engineer Society held its annual meeting last Saturday at the Swedish Club. The following officers were elected: City Engineer, John Ericson, president; Building Engineer C. E. Carlson, vice-president; Engineer G. A. Akerlind, secretary; and Engineer C. A. Bolin, treasurer. Building Commissioner Henry Ericson and the Architects, Carl Save and Eric E. Hall, were elected directors.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Engineer Congress of 1915 will probably be held in Chicago. A message was received from the Swedish Engineer Society in Brooklyn that organization work concerning this congress has already started in the Eastern States. The newly elected officers expect very shortly to start making needed arrangements for holding the congress here. All Swedish engineers in America are to be invited to attend this congress, whether they are members of the Swedish Engineer Society or not. There are now 275 members, and it is expected that the Society's membership will increase considerably next year.</p>
