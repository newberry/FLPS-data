   <p>Svenska Nykterhets Tidningen (Swedish Temperance Journal) is the name of a new paper which is now being founded by the temperance crusader Reverend J. O. Johnson. The paper will, to start with, consist of eight pages. It will appear once a month, and will contain much good material worthy of study. We believe that the naming of Reverend Johnson as editor is sufficient assurance of the future value of the paper.</p>
   <p>Since no temperance paper is now being published among the Swedes, and since it appears that the Svenska Nykterhets Tidningen fulfils all the requirements for such a paper, it seems proper to urge all friends of temperance to subscribe to this new advocate of temperance. The address is 493 North Park Avenue, Chicago. The price is merely seventy-five cents per year, forty cents for half a year.</p>
