   <p>For the last few weeks, politics have been the talk of the day. The Danes and all the Scandinavians are inclined to be Republicans. The Danes have been accused by the Norwegians of being on the German side in politics. It is an unfair statement, and anyone who knows Danish history knows better. When we Danes go to the polls on election day we will show them how badly mistaken the Norwegians are.</p>
