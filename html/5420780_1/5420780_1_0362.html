   <p>The State legislature in Springfield, in which the Socialist party is represented by our countryman C. W. Madsen, Joseph H. Mason, H. W. Harris, and Seymour Stedman, convened a couple of days ago.</p>
   <p>The metropolitan papers are publishing a list compiled by Mr. Madsen, of twenty-eight legislative proposals which will be introduced by the Socialistic group during this session.</p>
   <p>Among the controversial questions to be taken up are the following: The right to strike, picket, and boycott; workers accident insurance; preference on the court docket for personal injury cases; the 8-hour day; women's suffrage; new municipal charter for Chicago; municipal ownership of light and power plants; warehouses; free textbooks in public schools; public unemployment insurance.</p>

   <p>Even though only a few, possibly none, of the Socialistic proposals in regard to these important issues will be made into law, practical socialism, and the demands and interests of the working class will be the subject of discussion in the legislature, and thanks to our able representatives, the lawmakers will be made to understand that the Social Democratic program is something more than empty phrases.</p>
