Most certainly there has been a tremendous increase in prices of meat products, Recently the American published the following statement made by a representative for one of the big packing firms:</p>
   <p>"The government has burdened the packers with so many inspectors and petty officials, watching the meats, that the packers find themselves on the road to losing all the profits on the business. To equalize the expense of this method of supervision, the packers have decided to raise the prices of certain meats. The packers have been forced to do it."</p>

It is a sad matter of fact that this attitude, as expressed by the meat packing industry, is typical of trusts and monopolies in general. Private profit is <span class="page-break">2</span>their essential consideration and until this attitude is eliminated, the public will be subjected to the same abuses.</p>
