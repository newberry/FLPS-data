   <p>p.4.... The Carl Marx Club arranged a social gathering last Saturday, in Jacobsen's Hall, which was well attended. A fresh socialistic atmosphere was evident, and the evening was spent in chummy comradeship. The socialistic party and its ever increasing political influence, was the subject of discussion, and the comrades agreed that the day has now come, when we must all go out and fight and in a short time Chicago, the State of Illinois, indeed the whole world, will be ours. The world belongs to us, and we shall conquer it.</p>
   <p>The comrades parted about three o'clock in the morning.</p>
