   <p>The Democrats believe that they will win in the Twenty-seventh Ward at the coming election and, of course, there are many who are seeking the nomination for alderman. So for five men have announced their candidacy for the Democratic nomination.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jens N. Hyldahl is one of the candidates for this nomination. He has all the qualifications for being the best man the Democrats can place in the field. He resides at 1385 Monticello Avenue, and owns his home. This is at the south end of the Ward where the retiring alderman also lives, so that geographic reasons ought not stand in the way of Mr. Hyldahl's selection. Without a doubt he is politically the strongest Democrat within the Ward. This was clearly indicated <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>at the election two years ago when, in spite of the Republican landslide he ran nine hundred votes ahead of his ticket.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hyldahl has been private secretary for three corporation counsels in Chicago, first under Mayor Edgar B. Tolman, then under Colonel James Hamilton Lewis, both Democrats, and finally under the present corporation counsel, Edward J. Brundage, who is a Republican. From this position he resigned to accept a place with the Commonwealth Edison Company. He left this position when he decided to seek the nomination for alderman. In political circles the statement is frequently heard that Mr. Hyldahl is the only politician in Chicago who has no enemy.</p>
   <p>Few Scandinavians in Chicago are better known than Mr. Hyldahl. He was born in Denmark....thirty-seven years ago. When he was fourteen years old he came to Chicago, and for the past twelve years he has resided in his house on Monticello Avenue. He has been married for sixteen years and has four children.</p>

   <p>The Scandinavians of the Ward will do themselves and their district a service by voting for a man like Mr. Hyldahl....</p>
