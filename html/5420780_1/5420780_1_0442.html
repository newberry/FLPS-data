   <p>These reports verify the truth of the socialistic assertion that a Socialist regime will not only benefit such as exist at a standard bordering on starvation but capitalism's own working representatives that the existing social order is driving into "the pace that kills."</p>
   <p>Capitalists on the other hand say that Socialism would destroy the incentive to personal activity and competition. This is true to this extent - it will eliminate the opportunity of personal monoply detrimental to the actual producer of the country's wealth.</p>

   <p>Harriman's object was not the building up of the country by increased rail facilities nor to make easier the lot of the laboring man by furnishing him with better pay and shorter hours. His feverish over-work was caused by his mania for greater holdings and profits for himself and his fellow parasites.</p>
   <p>If the railroads of the country were govermentally owned and run by a competent and human "Minister of Trafic" the government, the general public and the employees could reap a mutual benefit that would be universally satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Harriman's "over-work that killed" incidentally was not in recent years connected with extensions of railroads and empire, but with incessant and excessive gambling in the stock market where his deals were not in thousands but in millions.</p>
