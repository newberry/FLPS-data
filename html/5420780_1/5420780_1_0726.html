   <p>Nominations for aldermen, county commissioners, coroner, and sheriffs are now settled to every one's satisfaction. It may be necessary to check up on the candidates for aldermen, as some of them are not fit.</p>
   <p>We Danes have been ignored in former political campaigns, but times have changed. In former campaigns other nationalities were running for the different positions, and we were content with promises which were never kept; hence this movement that Danes should work and vote for candidates of our own nationality only. We do not know for sure which side we are going to take, but probably we shall vote Republican because of the promises they have made. But you never can tell.</p>
