   <p>p.2.col.1........The election next Tuesday April 6, is of great importance. The proposed program of construction will involve millions, as it includes plans for subway and labor construction. The political wolves and supergrafters are busy advocating the acceptance of the plans submitted. This is their big opportunity. The plan is to build both subway and harbor at the taxpayers expense, turning both over to private enterprise when completed as in New York City. What a chance for thievery and graft!</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily Socialist has uncovered a number of instances of graft. It is, however, hoped that its well published expose of the intended gathering of more millions in "boodle" will be the means of preventing the shrewdly calculated "steal".</p>
