   <p>The Democratic faction of Chicago's capitalist class has performed the comical stunt of re-nominating Mayor Dunne as a candidate for the coming election. As we all know Mayor Dunne was elected two years ago on his "Immediate Municipal Ownership" platform and has lived up to his promises to the astonishing effect that there is now a better than fair chance for immediate settlement of the ownership problem in a way so privately financed concerns get a strangle hold on the community, securing eternal control for themselves.</p>
   <p>Surely Mayor Dunne protested against the proposed "settlement;" but it is a matter of fact that he did not make a single effective move to bring about his municipal ownership or even attempt to improve the service offered by private concerns. Of course we realize Mayor Dunne has had the same corrupt gangs of Democratic and Republican Aldermen to wrestle with and must be excused for his short comings; but there is absolutely no excuse for him to appoint a so-called traction expert at a $10,000 a year salary when the expert is selected and recommended by the privately <span class="page-break">\2</span>owned Streetcar concerns and serve their purposes only, the very purposes Mayor Dunne was elected to oppose.</p>
   <p>Mayor Dunne's administration turned out to be a joke as far as the above plank in his platform is concerned, and for that reason his renomination is a super-joke particularly in view of the fact that he is now going to be elected on his demand for "condemnation" of the Streetcar companies.</p>
   <p>But maybe he is not supposed to be elected. The powers that be, the insiders seem to have made up their minds to pull through with their plan of giving the Streetcar companies what they want, and to serve that purpose it will be extremely convenient to have a Democratic dummy with a questionable record running against a Republican candidate who at the outset is willing to say "yes" and "Amen" to the demands made by the privately owned concerns and who is the one they are actually supporting.</p>
   <p>We wouldn't wonder to see the Republican candidate (Busse) elected by a great majority hitching on to his "immediate settlement" band wagon and at the same time, by means of "the little ballot," register their protest <span class="page-break">\3</span>against any kind of settlement, which will be brought about just the same. At any rate a result of that kind would be in full harmony with the degree of intelligence revealed by a majority of citizens who still adhere to the capitalistic principle of voting against their own individual interests.</p>
