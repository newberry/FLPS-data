   <p>The January issue of Metropolitan Magazine contains an article under the title, "The Quest of a Hen's Egg," which gives an extensive description, and a searching analysis of Danish cooperative, including the cooperation export of eggs, butter and pork to England as well as dairies, packing plants, stores, mutual insurance, etc.</p>
   <p>The author is Frederick C. Howe, who has been in Denmark studying these conditions. We quote from the article: "I journeyed to Copenhagen with a professor from the State University, who was delivering extensive lectures throughout the country. I learned that Copenhagen was a socialist city, and had been in the hands of that party for a number of years, and I found that many merchants and professional men were Socialists. But they were not revolutionary Socialists, and they have not transformed Copenhagen into a Socialist commonwealth. They <span class="page-break">2</span>have tried to do for the laboring classes what the farmer has done for himself in the country. Through cooperation, they own their own central bakeries,groceries, and laundries. They, too, buy and sell in a group, and in this way they have cut down the cost of living on the one hand, and increased the wages on the other. Like the farmer, they, too, have been greedy for education....."</p>
   <p>The well written and instructive article is a fine tribute to Danish initiative and culture, and holds out some hope that the cooperative movement which has been the salvation of Denmark, may gain a foothold in this country, for the benefit of the majority, particularly for the farmers and the working class.</p>
