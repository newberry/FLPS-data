   <p>"National Danish Political League" is the heading of a news item from New York, carried in this issue of Revyen.</p>
   <p>We believe that "Danish Political Fata Morgana," would be a more suitable name for the proposed organization, inasmuch, as the project is to be promoted on the basis of the program of the Progressive party; that is, Roosevelt's program, which is now claimed to be partly Socialistic.</p>
   <p>Danish Social-Democrats can hardly have any confidence in the political adventurer Roosevelt, who during his seven, and one-half years in the White House served the capitalistic interests to the best of his ability, and who is now being backed by the smart "trustmaker," Perkins.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>How can any Social-Democrat imagine that even a small part of the Socialistic program will be realized through Roosevelt, who in his "Outlook," pointed out "the deadening influence of Socialism," shortly before Perkins and Co., decided to use him as a bait for "radical" voters?</p>
   <p>He may catch a lot of suckers, but they will not be Socialists. Our program and our cause are better served by our loyal and tested leaders, Debs and Seidel. </p>
