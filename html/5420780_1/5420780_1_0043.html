   <p>Permit me to call your attention to an inaccuracy in A. T. Dorf's article, "The Tennessee Case," which reveals a certain degree of misunderstanding.</p>
   <p>It will not do for us to distinguish between the aims and purposes of elementary education and those of higher education, or to question our right to academic freedom. If we did, we should be supporting Bryan's theory, which holds that [proper] education is what the majority says it is, whether or not it is consistent with truth and reality. Our schools and universities should be free to teach the truth, which is discovered and promulgated by scientists and experts better than by a majority of lawmakers.</p>
   <p>The Bill of Rights in our Constitution expressly exempts the individual from majority rule in certain respects, as for instance in relgion. No majority can force the individual to join a certain religious denomination. State and <span class="page-break">\2</span>church are separate institutions. For that reason the foolish attempt made by the State of Tennessee to force school boards to adopt an orthodox theory of education will be declared unconstitutional when the case reaches the Supreme Court and probably before.</p>
   <p>To be sure, while religion is a subject banished from our schools, atheism should not be taught as a substitute; but we cannot keep out the theory of evolution by branding it as atheism. The biblical theory of creation has nothing to do with our educational system. Whatever facts science has discovered about the origin and development of our globe and of the living beings which inhabit it is a separate and distinct matter which should be available for study in educational institutions. The Montrey Act of Tennessee is a plain attempt to subjugate the church to state authority and have it made over according to orthodox Protestant doctrines, and this is against the Constitution of this country.</p>
   <p>Enforcement of the law would result in trouble and nonsense anyhow. In <span class="page-break">\3</span>geography the children would learn about the four corners of the earth, and the sun and moon hung up to furnish us with light. In zoology they would learn that rabbits and hares belong to the class of cud-chewing animals. Physics would be mostly miracle tales, as for instance the one about cold fire and the iron that could float on water. In astronomy it would not do to tell the pupils that our earth is but an infinitesimal part of the solar system, a fact gradually revealed through the ages.</p>
   <p>No; scientific discoveries cannot be abrogated. They constitute a foundation for our civilization, and it is necessary that they shall be subjected to study in our educational institutions so that the younger generation may feel at home in its environment and adjust its attitude toward religion accordingly. The Montrey Act of Tennessee contradicts the religious views of a number of people. What would be the result if the children of liberal-minded, enlightened parents were forced to learn that the earth was created in six days, and that a great flood covered it entirely some five thousand years ago, and to accept this and <span class="page-break">\4</span>the rest of the biblical legends as actual facts? Let us pray to be delivered from that evil. Fortunately our Constitution with its Bill of Rights stands as a guardian against such nefarious attempts.</p>
