   <p>Skandinavisk Socialist Agitationskomite (Scandinavian Socialist Propaganda Committee) was organized June 3, 1907. It consists of delegates from all Scandinavian Socialist societies in Chicago. The committee has tried to get Dr. Alfred Eriksen of Norway, H. Branting, of Stockholm, and C. Jeppesen, of Christiania, to come to America to speak about and for Socialism in America. However, none of them were able to come. The only one that could come was A. C. Meyer of Copenhagen, who is coming July 30, 1908, and will tour the country for five weeks. He will give thirty-two lectures.</p>
   <p>The aim of the society is not only to invite Scandinavian Socialists to come over here to speak, but also to work for the spreading of good Scandinavian Socialist literature, and the organization of Socialist societies wherever possible.</p>
