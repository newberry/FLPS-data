   <p>From January 1st to July 31st, this year, the Chicago City Railway on the Southside has earned a net profit of $503,566, of which the city gets 55% while the rest, $225,348, goes to the Company to be distributed among the people who did nothing whatever to earn that money. This is the way a system set up for private profit works. If the City Railways had been owned by the city the city would have been entitled to all the profit, or else it would have to be satisfied with the $278,218, using the rest to increase salaries or lower the fares so as to give the public a better service. Publicly owned city railways would eliminate private profit in that particular line, and it would mean a step towards a socialist system under which private profit and exploitation of the workers would be excluded entirely.</p>
