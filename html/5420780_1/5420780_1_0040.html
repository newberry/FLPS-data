   <p>Forty years ago, in the year of the last World's Fair in Chicago, an extraordinary convention of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, assembled in Chicago, directed that its national board consider the erection of a new theological seminary. Undaunted by the panic of that year and the subsequent economic exigencies, the regular conventions of 1893 and 1894 dared to propose a large plan and adopted a resolution to erect a Danish-American university.</p>
   <p>Their hopes envisaged a plant built to accomodate two hundred students and so organized as to be able to meet the expanding needs of the synod. Its fruition required the services of three men, wrote R. R. Westergaard; one who could sing, one who could fan the flames, and a daredevil.</p>

   <p>F. L. Grundtvig, son of the Danish educator, poet, historian, and bishop, became the poet laureate of the Danish immigrants; Thorvald Helveg, graduate of the University of Copenhagen, fed and fanned the feeble flame; and P. Kjolhede, trained at Askov Folk High School in Denmark, rose as a courageous giant. These three men, endowed with the life and spirit of the three great cultural centers and movements of nineteenth-century Denmark, symbolized the hope that there might arise in America a larger school, dedicated to the task of preserving the cultural values of Danish origin and of seeking the new in their adopted land. The fourth of July, 1895, the building committee secured the title to the property in Des Moines, Iowa, on which the new university was to rise.</p>
   <p>The dreams of an imposing university structure were not realized. One section of the present plant was completed and dedicated September 27, 1896; the second was erected in 1898 to meet the needs of an expanding <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>enrollment; and in 1904 the structure was completed. The joy manifested the day the school was dedicated was not dispelled by the fact that no students had as yet enrolled. The first student came that afternoon; he bore the illustrious Danish name, Niels Jul. Since then thousands of young Danish-Americans have attended the college.</p>
   <p>In November 1897, the school was named Grand View College. The thought of a university had not disappeared, but the character of the school changed to meet the needs of the synod and of the young people. As it grew, it expanded to include not only a seminary and a normal-training course for Danish-American teachers but also business course, a department of physical education, and a short winter session, patterned after the folk high schools. It incorporated later a High School and eventually a Junior College. Now it offers three years of seminary work, two years of college, Junior College, the last two years of High School, a teachers' training course preparatory for work in the vacation schools in Danish-American communities, a department of physical education, and business and technical courses.</p>
