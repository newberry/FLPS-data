   <p>The Scandinavian Painters' Union, which has about 2,000 members, and is the largest of its kind in Chicago, held a meeting last Tuesday evening, in the hall at 406 Milwaukee Avenue. After the meeting, there was a surprise for the unions popular president, Mr. Otto Damm, 730 No. Maplewood Avenue. Following an appropriate speech, Mr. Niels F. Haumerstad, presented a beautiful and valuable silver set to Otto Damm as an appreciation for his faithful service.</p>
   <p>The Messrs. John S. Kergaard, J. Runneberg, Magnus Johnson, Peter Moe and others delivered speeches, and a quartet sang Danish, Norwegian and Swedish Songs.</p>
   <p>The whole affair conveyed the impression that Mr. Otto Damm, through his untiring work for the union, has won the hearts of all the members which is something rather unusual in the American labor movement.</p>
