   <p>p.2........Revyen hereby presents for consideration this suggestion: Ex-President Roosevelt be awarded a medal designed as follows; One side to symbolize his energetic campaign against the"rich malefactors" (for example - how one of his victims, Harriman, railroad magnate was enable to build his $6,000,000.00 palace;) the reverse side to depict the Rooseveltian business stagnation, unemployment, hard times, child labor and the empty U. S. Treasury plus whatever else contributed to his matchless popularity.</p>
