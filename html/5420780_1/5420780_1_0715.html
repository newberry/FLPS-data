   <p>It is generally believed that a change in the personnel of the civil service commission will take place upon the expiration of the terms of the present commissioners. Robert Lindblom [Swede] has stated repeatedly that he does not desire a re-appointment, and rumors of other changes have been current. Assuming that the mayor will be called upon to fill at least one vacancy by the appointment of a Democrat, the name of Peter J. Thornum [Dane] has been suggested as a fitting choice. Mr. Thornum is a West Sider, which certainly under the circumstances ought to be a strong point in his favor. He is a sturdy Democrat who has ever been ready to fight the battles of his party, never yielding or compromising, always striking straight from the shoulder. He is fearless and aggressively honest at all times, a man of sturdy backbone of the very kind that a civil service commissioner needs. He is the unanimous choice of the Scandinavian Democratic Central Club of Chicago for the position, <span class="page-break">2</span>and it may be added that the Scandinavians in general, without regard to party affiliations, would approve of his appointment as a civil service commissioner.</p>
   <p>The management of Democratic politics in this bailiwick is not the concern of this paper. But the Skandinaven takes pleasure in testifying to the worth of a fellow citizen than whom no better Democrat is to be found in these parts, and whose character and honesty are valued most highly by those who know him best. Mayor Harrison would make no mistake by appointing Peter Thornum as Robert Lindblom's successor.</p>
