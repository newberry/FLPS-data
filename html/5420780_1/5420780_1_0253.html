   <p>Two weeks ago, we had an editorial about the present coal strike. This editorial has been well received by the entire American press.</p>
   <p>The Foreign Language Information Service is a federal institution. Its purpose is to translate foreign language editorials which leaders send them from American papers throughout the continent.</p>
   <p>The American Press Bureau says in its last release: "The following editorials are selected as being representative of current comment in the press of sixteen foreign language groups."</p>
   <p>They cite our editorial as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"There is only one way out of the mire into which the strike is taking us, and that is to take the coal mines from the twenty men who control them, but do not own them, and give them back to the people who own them, but have not been running them.</p>
   <p>In other words, the nation must not only own, but also run the coal mines. The government must administer the property under the supervision of the people for the profit of every inhabitant of this country.</p>
   <p>That should satisfy both the twenty-five men, who operate the mines, and the half million workers, who are striking for higher wages, if both are true citizens." From Danish Times (Danish-Non partisan) Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>So much for the prestige of your paper.</p>
