   <p>In a current issue of the American Journal we read that the Department of Justice, coinciding with President Hoover's new theory, has decided to keep hands off Communist demonstrations throughout the country.</p>
   <p>President Hoover no doubt got his cue from what he observed during his travels in England, and from his associations with British statesmen. For sometime already, British statesmen have proved their superiority over leaders of other parts of the Globe. All along they have been well aware of the fact that the only way to defeat Communism at home is to grant its adherents more privileges and liberty than they could get in Russia, during that country's experimental period.</p>
   <p>As a result of this policy of free speech, today England is the only <span class="page-break">\2</span>country on earth where anyone believing in an "ism" of any kind, whether it be Anarchism, Socialism, or Communism gets a chance to advocate it without interference from governmental authorities.</p>
   <p>(As a direct contrast Russia, under the regime of the Czar, was overrun by spies and secret service men. But in spite of these snoopers, the Russian population, because of too much oppression and too little expression, defeated their torturers over night.)</p>
   <p>England has been well paid for her liberal tendencies, for today she doubtlessly receives from Russia more orders for commodities than any other nation in the world. There is no reason why we, too, shouldn't be enjoying this commercial boon. We would soon be on the road to prosperity, if we would only see the light as England has.</p>
   <p>Following such a policy, the benefits would be manifold. Instead of laying off men, practically all the larger industries could be working <span class="page-break">\3</span>their plants with even three shifts. The workers, in turn, having plenty of labor with good pay, would be too busy to even think of communism, and thus in the end, we should have succeeded in defeating this menace without coercion, and at the same time, benefiting the country as a whole.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, the United States is not interested in establishing a better understanding or in catering to the needs of its citizens. No, indeed! The vital problem here today is who will be the winner of the World Series. So what can we expect?</p>
