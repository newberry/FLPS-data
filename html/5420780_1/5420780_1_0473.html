   <p>p.2.........A few days ago a welcome message from Washington stated that Sec. Root had reached a decision in the case of Charles Rudowitz the Russian refugee. The extradition was denied by Russia on the grounds that Mr. Rudowitz was not a criminal but a political refugee.</p>
   <p>Credit for the consideration shown this man is due neither to Secretary Root nor President Roosevelt. Were it not for Chicago's Daily Socialist, which so ably took the lead in demanding justice for Mr. Rudowitz, the Czar and his executioners would now, in all probability be rejoicing over the servility of the executives of our own U.S.A.</p>
   <p>Much credit goes to Clarence Darrow, too, as attorney for the defense. Taking up this fight was characteristic of the man who had successfully defended <span class="page-break">2</span>Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone even though they had been condemned by President Roosevelt as "undesirables" being Socialists.</p>
   <p>Had the release of Charles Rudowitz by Roosevelt and Root been motivated by humanitarian principles, the immediate discharge of Commissioner Foote would have been imperative. It was Foote who had permitted the arrest of a man alone and helpless in a strange land to which he had fled for refuge from Russia political terrorism.</p>
   <p>Such incidents, as the foregoing, should cause the U.S.A. to sever diplomatic relations with Russia and not to resume them until mass political executions cease.</p>
