   <p>A Danish lady, Miss Astrid S. Rosing, was recently awarded a contract for supplying the city of Chicago with sewer pipes for the remainder of the current year. For a number of years Miss Rosing has conducted a steadily growing business in building materials, brick, tile, cement, sand, and gravel, with offices in the Harris Trust Building.</p>
   <p>She came here from Denmark at the age of twelve, and when her father died a few years later, she took a job as bookkeeper, and advanced rapidly. After some time she became agent for a large manufacturer of clay products, and finally established her own firm, which has supplied materials for some of the largest buildings in Chicago. Her last achievement is the city contract. She informs us that the secret of her business success is service and prompt fulfilment of all promises and obligations.</p>
