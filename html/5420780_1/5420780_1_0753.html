   <p>Henry L. Hertz has now reached three score and ten. On this occasion, a group of friends and admirers of the grand old man, gave an affair at the Atlantic Hotel, which lasted two whole days, November 18 and 19. Over one hundred persons were present, in fact, as many as there was room for, in the banquet hall on the mezzanine floor. Guests from New York were, Consul-General Bech, and Director Halvor Jacobsen, who was expected later.</p>
   <p>For some unknown reason all the men wore red ties, another of Hertz weaknesses was his eternal remark "Kraft knalde mig" (May virtue smack me), which was painted in large letters on the wall.</p>
   <p>The meal, to the sweet music of J. P. Jensen's orchestra, was served at small, individual tables, and was really very elegant. The program offered many "Flnesser" (delicacies), and began with a well-arranged menu, a whole gastronomic encyclopedia, that had been arranged by Franck-Philipson. The czar of the evening, Dr. Max Henius, as usual was very witty at the expense of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>guest of honor, who almost lost his voice as a result of this.</p>
   <p>Congressman Niels Juul, who talked about Henry L. Hertz and the United States, told many humorous incidents about Hertz breaking into politics, and brought him out as a political leader of merit, and as an example of the emigrant's opportunity here in America. Long live Hertz and the United States!</p>
   <p>Consul-General Beck spoke about our friend Hertz, and Director Carl Antonsen talked about Hertz and Denmark. He told about meeting Hertz fifty years ago on Milwaukee avenue when Hertz was wearing a student's cap and riding boots. He also said that Hertz always had one foot in Denmark and the other in the United States. The Herald, in its article, gave the honor of Antonsen's speech to Consul Falkesjerne.</p>
   <p>The committee then asked Hertz to speak about his best friend, and he gave <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>a tribute to his wife, who in return sang a song written by Franck-Philipson.</p>
   <p>A number of telegrams were received and read, from America, Canada, and Denmark.</p>
   <p>Hertz was presented at the banquet with a likeness of himself hammered out of copper by the artist L. Dorge.</p>
