   <p>The socialist agitator, William Pedersen, has allied himself with the revolutionary group I. W. W. and has succeeded in having an article published in the Norwegian Socialist paper, Gaa Paa, under the caption, "Haywood to be Expelled."</p>
   <p>The reason for the proposal to expel Haywood as a member of the Socialist Party's national executive committee, now up for a vote, is simply that he has urged "direct action and sabotage," which conflicts with the platform adopted at the last convention.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pedersen says that if the Socialist Party does not want Haywood, there will be many people, who do not favor the Socialist Party.</p>

   <p>If this is true, the fact is, of course, deplorable, but nevertheless, the Socialist Party will be better off without opposition in its midst.</p>
   <p>Even if Haywood remains a member, which is up to him, or his local, to decide, it is detrimental to the ideals of the Party to have him occupy such a highly responsible position, in view of his strong opposition to the constitution of the party. He could have done the party a favor by resigning voluntarily, and a great deal of misunderstanding and dispute could have been avoided.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pedersen says further that because of the fact that ministers, businessmen, physicians, lawyers, saloonkeepers, and manufacturers constitute sixty per cent of the membership, Haywood can hardly be expected to be a desirable member of the executive committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>An idea that people belonging to the above classes are not as desirable members as the wage-earners is a mistaken one, except, perhaps, in the opinion of Mr. Haywood. Another thing is that wage-earners should be socialists from birth, so to speak, and constitute a solid nucleus in the party, but the assertion that they are better socialists is to be rejected by all genuine socialists.</p>
