   <p>We hope that the proposed new charter for the city of Chicago will be killed when it comes up for consideration next Tuesday. In its essence it will not improve conditions at all. There are several paragraphs of a progressive character, but as a whole it is aimed at increased restriction of civil liberties, a concentration of power, and putting more money at the command of the administration and the politicians.</p>
   <p>The very sponsors of the new charter are the ones who lured the majority into voting for a traction ordinance during the last election. The result is a worse confusion than we had before, and the prospect of improvement and final settlement of the problem farther removed. The new charter will have an even more disastrous effect on life in the city than the traction ordinance, because the nature of a charter is so much broader in scope. Therefore: <span class="page-break">\2</span>Vote against the new charter next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>We must, however, recommend the proposed amendment of rules for the Municipal Court.</p>
