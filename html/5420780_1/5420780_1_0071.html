   <p>Dr. Christian Fenger's influence on the development of medical science in the United States, particularly in Chicago and the Middle West has been of vital importance which is acknowledged by all physicians.</p>
   <p>This widespread appreciation was expressed at the celebration of Dr. Fenger's 60th anniversary when 500 prominent physicians from all parts of the union participated in a banquet to pay their tributes to the great master and teacher and to express their appreciation of his contributions as a physician and scientist. Dr. Fenger died one year later.</p>
   <p>His friends and fellow physicians are now planning a memorial to remind future generations of his greatness.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Medical Society was first in the line of sponsore and as a primary result The Fenger Memorial Association has been incorporated with <span class="page-break">2</span>Dr. Frank Billings as president and Dr. L. Hektoen as secretary and treasurer. The object is to collect $25,000 to establish the Fenger Memorial Fund. The interest or proceeds of the fund shall be given to one physician or student of medicine every year and to be used for medical research.</p>
   <p>We believe that this is a most worthy manner in which to pay our tribute to Dr. Fenger and the greatest honor any Danish born citizen of the United States has yet been given. We of Danish birth have every reason to contribute heavily to show our appreciation for the honor reflected on us by Dr. Christian Fenger. As a member of the committee I have been urged and authorized to appeal to my countrymen, colleagues and former patients of Dr. Fenger who may feel indebted to him for restored health many of whom perhaps owe him thanks in addition for unselfish service and assistance--for a contribution to this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>Please mail contributions to me.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Niels Johnson, Physician,</p>
   <p>741 W. North Ave., Chicago.</p>
