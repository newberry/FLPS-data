   <p>p.2......More than 100,000 American women are said to have signed a disgustingly humble petition to "Her Gracious Majesty, the Czarina of Russia" concerning the mass murders in that country. The slave-driven unenlightened people of Russia are said to regard the Czar as some kind of a god and judging by the wording of this petition, one is led to believe that the free American women regard the Czar's wife at least as a goddess, in front of whom one must crawl in the dust, instead of presenting a dignified, self respecting protest condemning these cruel murders.</p>
