   <p>It is with a feeling of disgust and pity that the thinking population of America, and Chicago in particular, view the performance of Big Bill, the elephant trainer, and Judge Lyle, the exhibitor of sawed-off shotguns. The disgust reaches its climax when we learn that hundreds of thousands of our so-called intelligent citizens have joined the carnival and nominate a "barker" as the mayor of one of the world's greatest cities. Is it any wonder, then, that we are rapidly becoming the laughing-stock of the rest of the world, the way we lay ourselves open to ridicule? We clearly see demonstrated the prophecy of Frederic Nietzsche, that "there is no sorrier instance in all human destiny than when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becomes false and distorted and monstrous." Poor Nietzsche died insane, yet one cannot help wondering how many of us will escape the same fate, at the rate we are going.</p>
