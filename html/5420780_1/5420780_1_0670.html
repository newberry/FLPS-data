   <p>A committee has been formed in New York, which will attempt to organize Danes throughout the country into a political unit, for the purpose of gaining recognition and representation for Danish-Americans in the U. S. Congress and other legislative bodies.</p>
   <p>If the idea can be materialized, the league will be affiliated with the progressive party, under the name of the Danish Progressive League.</p>
   <p>An organizing meeting was held last Friday, at which members of the committee and other prominent Danes enthusiastically pointed out the advantages of such a political organization.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were; V. A. Mortensen, chairman of the committee; Editor Emil Opfer, who is a "part time" Chicagoan, vice-chairman; Librarian Emil Elberling, and Geo. Kirkegaard, civil engineer.</p>

   <p>Meetings will now be held throughout the country, also in Chicago, which with its large Danish population, is expected to become one of the centers of the movement.</p>
