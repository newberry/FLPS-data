   <p>p.3.....Last Thursday, the day after the Danish Student Singers' Concert, the Karl Marx Club conducted a discussion on the topic. Should Social Democrats participate in the Danish patriotic movement among our countrymen in America? The following resolution was unanimously adopted: This audience wishes to express its strongest protest against any co-operation of Social Democrats, (individuals as well as societies) with Danish patriotic undertakings, as these latter can only serve to retard the class consciousness of the workers, and to undermine their organizations, by poisoning the minds of their most active leaders. All party members are therefore requested to desist from any activities, which go contrary to the interests of the organizations of the working class. We realize that if this class is to be liberated, it must be done by the workers themselves, and all their energy and ability must be directed towards this purpose, and utilized within the Social Democratic Organizations."</p>
