   <p>Sorte Hansen of Chicago was in New York last week and was there interviewed by Nordlyset. Mr. Hansen told about the socialistic colony which he and Louis Pio started in Kansas in the eighties. It failed and Hansen therefore insists that socialism is impractical and never can be carried out in practice. He also insists that the socialist leaders in Denmark know this and that they do not want to realize the socialistic program even if they had a chance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hansen is wrong. Socialism will become a political power when we have educated the masses to take care of their own interests.</p>
