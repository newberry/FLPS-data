   <p>Last week, at 300 Madison Street, a big temperance meeting was held. Every nationality was represented. The main issue was the securing of a prohibition law to prevent the manufacturing and the sale of intoxicating liquors. We owe this duty to our growing generations, and our neighbors in general. We are trying to start a campaign to get people to vote "dry".</p>
