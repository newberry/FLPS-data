   <p>The Italians have nothing to fear. The greatest Italian majority of the whole United States voted Republican. Our fellow citizens have paid a tribute of gratitude to the party which they have loved and respected. If it were entirely up to the Italians, they would vote straight Republican, but our electoral vote had not as yet determined the outcome of an election.</p>
   <p>Whose fault is it? It is our own fault. Let us all become American citizens, and in 1896 we will surely have a good quantity of Italian political votes in this town. But above all, if we want to obtain any influence, let us remain always faithful to one party, regardless of whether we win or lose. The Republican Party is the National Party of the United States.</p>
