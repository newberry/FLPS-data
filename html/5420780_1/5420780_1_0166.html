   <p>William Jennings Bryan one of the main speakers at the Norwegian National Festival in Brooklyn, says:</p>
   <p>"I consider it a privilege to participate in your nation's anniversary. I appreciate the honor shown me in the extending of this invitation. The fact that you still love the land of your birth, the fact that you are still interested in all that concerns its welfare, and the fact that you meet on such occasions as this, with a sympathy resting upon the fact that you are of one blood, does not lessen our nation's confidence in you as citizens of the United States. We could not trust you to love the land of your birth.</p>
   <p>"One of the best ways to decide whether a man will make a good husband, is to find out if he has been a loyal son. A man who doesn't love his mother, is not apt to be exemplary as a husband. So I feel that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>one who doesn't have in his heart a love of the land in which he first saw the light, cannot add much to our strength or to our citizenship."</p>
   <p>Much said in a few words.</p>
