The executive committee of the Socialist party has issued a protest against the movement of troops to the Mexican border, by the United States, for the obvious purpose of supporting the staggering regime of dictator Diaz. There is no reason to hope that the protest will have any effect, or that the troops will be withdrawn, but it is worthy of note, that there is one political party that even in international questions is determined to maintain the principles of liberty and justice on which the United States was founded.</p>
