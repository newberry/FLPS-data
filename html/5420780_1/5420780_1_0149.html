   <p>The screen has introduced to America great comedians of foreign birth and also gifted funmakers born in England; Ireland, France, Scotland, Germany, and other foreign countries, but up to the production of the "Big Parade," none seemed to have hailed from the great Scandinavian countries of the North. Into the picture walks Karl Dane of Copenhagen, who left his native Denmark in 1917 to come to this country. His "Slim Jensen" in King Vidor's great picture has made him the most talked of comedian in the country, as well as most popular.</p>
   <p>He has been a construction engineer, soldier, aviator, automobile racer, and rancher. When Ambassador Gerard's My Four Years in Germany was filmed, Karl Dane played the role of Chancellor Bethmann-Holweg. From chancellor to doughboy. You might infer that the young man has versatility.</p>
   
   <p>After playing the Chancellor, Karl decided to give up the screen, so he bought a chicken ranch in the San Fernandino Hills, near Los Angeles, and there he remained until the casting director of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer rediscovered him and engaged him for the role of "Slim." And so he is one of the three buddies, "soldiers three," sharing honors with the star, John Gilbert, in the role of "Jim" and with Tom O'Brien in the role of "Bull."</p>
   <p>Chancellor, chicken rancher, comedian, all from Copenhagen. Isn't it curious how the letter "C" creeps into this little biographical story?</p>
