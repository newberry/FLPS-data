   <p>Do you know that Niels Juul has the longest and cleanest record of all the public officers of Illinois, and that he has fathered more acts of the legislature (and all good) than any other man who ever sat in that body?</p>
   <p>That he was chairman of the judiciary committee of the State senate, and that as a member of the senate, he was responsible for the Juul law which compels the scaling down of taxes? He worked hard for the Torrens system and fathered the bill which protects girls from pandering. He has done as much for labor as any other member, and he has been indorsed by labor in general.</p>
   <p>Niels Juul came to Chicago thirty-six years ago. He was State Senator for sixteen years. He has been national president of the United Scandinavian Singers of America.</p>
