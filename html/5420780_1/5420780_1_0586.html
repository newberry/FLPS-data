   <p>Good citizens' anger and threat to hang the fifty Aldermen who are about to commit a treason against the city by granting Morgan &amp; Co., a 100 million dollar concession is not without justification, and it is possible justice would have been fulfilled had the threat been carried out. It would, however, be a better policy if our fellow citizens would reason that they themselves are to blame because they elected the ambitious Wall Streetallies now preying on the public while wearing Republican or Democratic cloaks. And if the good angry citizens would correct their mistake by voting socialistic instead of capitalistic next time they would gain more than they would by hanging fifty Aldermen.</p>
   <p>The tremendous support the petition for a referendum obtained indicates that there is actually such a thing as a public opinion in Chicago contrary to the one created and maintained by the Tribune, Record Herald, News and others all of which asserted that the public was overwhelmingly <span class="page-break">2</span>in favor of the proposed concession wanted by Morgan and Company. Next, the same papers opposed the referendum plans so persistingly that you would conclude they had been paid for doing so. To make up for their bad luck they now attempt to detract public attention from the real issue by booming the Streetcar magnates' interests for the coming election.</p>
   <p>We anticipate that the greedy franchise grabbers will get what they want somehow or other regardless of referendums, but if we have to be robbed we think it is better to register our protest than to say "Yes" and "Amen" to everything.</p>
