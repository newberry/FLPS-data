   <p>At the International Socialist Congress, recently held in Stuttgart, Mr. Beer, of Austria, acting on behalf of the majority of a commission representing Germans, Austrians, Belgians, Swedes, Danes, Bohemians and Hungarians, presented the following resolution adopted with 212 1/2 votes as against 18 1/2:</p>
   <p>"In order to rid themselves of spiritual, political and economic slavery, political and economic fronts are of equal necessity for workers of the world, or in other words; political organization and labor organization are distinct factions of the labor movement, but of equal importance. Either of these organizations is limited in scope and must act independently within its own limits. However, the territory of class struggle is steadily widening and, in order to obtain the desired results, co-operation between the two factions is becoming steadily more necessary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Therefore the worker's struggle will prove the more effective, the better the understanding between political organizations and unionism.</p>
   <p>The congress declares hereby that it must, in the interest of the workers of every country, bring about and maintain such understanding between the unions and the political party.</p>
