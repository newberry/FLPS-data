   <p>America prides herself on still being the richest country on earth. What a shame, then, that so many of her citizens, just because of growing hunger pains, become disillusioned as to her superiority, and fail to appreciate the wealth which surrounds them!</p>
   <p>Racketeering in our midst has become so far spread that even religion has been tainted by it. We now find that some of our most honored bishops devote but one day in the week for soul saving. The remaining six days they spend in keeping a vigilant eye on the Wall Street ticker. This is just as deplorable as the sort of soul savers who travel with huge tents and preach the "Gospel" with a punch, accompanied by somersaults and other acrobatics every time the name of the Lord is mentioned. Verily, the spirit of Barnum still lives.</p>
   
   <p>The American worker is easily pleased, too easily, in fact, for his own good. As long as he can fill up on a hot-dog and a cup of coffee, with a toothpick thrown in for good measure, he is satisfied. If by chance, he is able to indulge in a piece of pie, he almost feels guilty of being a gourmand. Winding up with a package of cigarette butts, he treads on air and becomes a superman, and shows his superiority over the rest of the world by pitying his brother worker across the pond. With such low aspirations, how can he better himself.</p>
   <p>If anyone dares to doubt that prosperity is running rampant in our beloved homeland today, just let him tune in and let his radio announcer convince him.</p>
