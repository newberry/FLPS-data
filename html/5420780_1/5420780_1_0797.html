   <p>There is encouraging evidence of Danish representation in the Socialist movement in Chicago. There are no less than three Danish candidates for aldermen on the Socialist ticket. Mr. Louis Dalgaard, business manager of the Chicago Daily Socialist, is running for alderman in the Third Ward. Mr. Charles Knudsen is a candidate in the Eighth Ward in South Chicago. Tailor Adolph Christensen is a candidate in the Twenty-eighth Ward. The last-mentioned ward has more Scandinavian votes than any other ward in Chicago, and Mr. Christensen, who is a good party member and respected citizen, has campaigned eagerly. His two young boys have organized a drum and bugle band to parade the streets and announce the Socialist meetings. It is, therefore, to be expected that Christensen will make a good showing. The Republicans who otherwise dominate the ward have split, and it is not entirely beyond possibility that Christensen may be elected. At any rate fellow Socialists and countrymen will do their best.</p>
