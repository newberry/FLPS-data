   <p>While the communists propose to eliminate the unemployment liability by making labor a duty and privilege for one and all, their mode of procedure for reaching this objective is such that the cure would be worse than the sickness, and under ordinary circumstances not likely to attract liberty-loving, cultured people. The reds' chief opportunity is the confusion and breakdown of capitalism from within which is noticeable in Germany and everywhere else. Only a complete readjustment of human labor values in accordance and co-ordination with wonderfully expanded productive facilities, to be accomplished largely by means of a personal income surtax, property graded up to one hundred per cent, will suffice as the fundamental step toward social and economic rejuvenation upon a basis of individualism and freedom and for taking the ground from under communism.</p>
