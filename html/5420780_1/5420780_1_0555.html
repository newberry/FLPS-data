   <p>It appears as though Mr. Haywood and the two other labor leaders arrested in Idaho are supposed to be responsible for all the crimes committed in Idaho and Colorado during the past ten years or more. Undoubtedly the Pinkerton bandits hired by the mine owners are the guilty ones, so why all that hurlyburly? If the three men are co-responsible for the death of ex-governor Stennenberg, as continuously emphasized by the capitalistic press, that alone would be sufficient evidence and reason for having them hung, particularly before a judge and jury who are prejudiced against them and would be more than eager to do their "duty," if there was a shadow of evidence to be found outside of Mr. Orchard's fabrications. The trouble of proving them guilty of all other crimes could be saved then.</p>
