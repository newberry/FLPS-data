   <p>When Ex-Mayor Harrison recommends the approval of Chicago City Council's "Traction Ordinance" and at the same time declares himself willing to support Mayor Dunne who opposes the ordinance he is apparently inconsistent. Of course we mean only apparently.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily News is now devoting space to "both sides" of the traction problem. At least it pretends it does although in reality it has only one, the capitalistic viewpoint. That there is actually an anti-capitalistic or socialistic side of this problem is hardly known by the Daily News or if it is, the paper is exceedingly scant with information to that affect.</p>
