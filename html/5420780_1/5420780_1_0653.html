   <p>An ad tells us the Danish Democratic Union on the South Side is working to get more political jobs for Danes and Swedes in Chicago. On the South Side there are many Danes in the 28th Ward, also in Brighton. In Chicago they are very numerous in Wards 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34.</p>
   <p>In this part of town live 35,000 Swedes and 15,000 Danes. But they all feel that they are not getting jobs in proportion to their number. At present these wards are to elect delegates to the four conventions (senate, congress, county and state.) Between ten and twenty-five and alternatives are to be elected from each ward. More than 1,000 jobs are available and the candidates are to be appointed for these jobs at these conventions. The final decision will be at the election of all citizens on November 8th.</p>
