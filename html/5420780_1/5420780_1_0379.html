   <p>Just as the sensational and humbug making politician T. Roosevelt suffered a decisive defeat at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, so his counterpart in the Democratic party, the newspaper king Hearst, took a thorough beating at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, where Wilson, whom Hearst had violently opposed, was nominated as the party's presidential candidate.</p>
   <p>The fact that demagogues of this type are finally put in their place, is a promising sign. Let us hope that this result will tend to purify the political air and draw up the party lines more sharply, regardless of how these two noise-makers will take their defeat. Our guess is that Hearst will crawl to the cross, and that "the thundering lion will be transformed into a meek sheep, whose bleating will not fool anybody.</p>
   <p>Neither Taft nor Wilson has the qualities which it takes to lead the people <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>astray with false words and empty phrases, qualities which Hearst and Roosevelt, and even Bryan, possess in full measure. The two candidates will be taken for what they are: Taft, the tool of one capitalistic clique; Wilson, the tool of another.</p>
   <p>Assuming that Wilson is the more liberal and progressive-minded of the two, he has nevertheless allied himself with and put his fate in the hands of the same corrupt clique headed by the gambling king, Tom Taggart, which for years has directed the Democratic party in complete understanding with the powerful capitalistic interests.</p>
   <p>Wilson has been nominated on a "teawater" platform, which blames the tariff for the high cost of living, but which does not propose any essential changes in the present system and its most devastating defect; namely, the trust rule.</p>

   <p>The Socialist party alone offers the only sure and practical cure: Let the nation take over the trusts!</p>
