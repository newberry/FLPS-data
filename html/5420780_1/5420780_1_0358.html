   <p>We are now going to have non-political municipal elections in Chicago. No doubt an arrangement of that sort will be advantageous to the capitalistic parties, the political principles of which are identical.</p>
   <p>But looking at the situation from a socialistic point of view, we must realize the primary importance of drawing the line between Socialists and anti-socialists in municipal elections. If it is the object of respectable citizens to prevent such a showdown by means of non-political capitalistic humbug, then they will learn sooner or later that the socialist movement is not to be checked or misguided by such tricks. That would take men with better brains.</p>
