   <p>The 16th ward...The Democratic Danes in this ward are working hard for the election of Olaf Hansen as alderman. He has a good record from the time he was West Town Collector in 1890-1891. But the Republican machine is doing all in its power to re-elect their old alderman, Mr. Raymer, who is a Catholic. Even such well known Danes as Henry L. Hertz and Senator Niels Juul are working for his election; that is all their love of Danes and Denmark means during election.</p>
   <p>Olaf Hansen might lose the 16th ward, but all Scandinavians in the 15th ward will surely vote for Mr. Hansen.</p>
