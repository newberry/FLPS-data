   <p>The West Irving Park district, of which a large percentage of citizens are Norwegians, has good prospects of soon having a municipal theatre to be erected on a co-operative plan. The main idea is to provide a center where the women and the children of the district can gather for real enjoyment of clean pictures and plays. To insure the right sort of entertainment a committee of censors will be elected by the bona-fide residents of the district.</p>
   <p>When one considers the general run of pictures and other shows that abound throughout the city the idea of a people's theatre owned and managed and censored by the people who have built the district is a very good one, clean entertainment being, at present, at a premium.</p>
