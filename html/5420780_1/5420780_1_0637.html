   <p>We are rather surprised to see how the Socialists and Communists talk and criticize the government of Chicago in general. They are always attacking the Relief and Aid Society with the same complaint, that the donations to the needy people are insufficient and are not of much benefit. They made up their minds, at a big mass meeting, that the officers of the Society should be discharged and that the Socialists and Communists should run the relief office. The present leaders of those on relief are dishonest; as we all can see, the whole affair is "red". Nothing came of it. Last Thursday a mass of people were outside the relief station, mostly Communists, but there was no battle.</p>
