   <p>From the present activities of the imperialistic military forces of Japan in Manchuria and China, we are slowly but surely awakened to the realization that although we thought the spirit of Mars was quelled, this wanton monster is again on foot. We were told that the object of the League of Nations, - its raison d'etre, - was for the establishment of an international court through which the nations of the world (except Russia) might sift and arbitrate their grievances and thus avoid hostility.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time, the League has proved itself a huge joke and the world anxiously awaits the next move by the venerable body of international contortionists.</p>
   <p>The showdown, however, is much closer at hand than many realize. Judging <span class="page-break">2</span>from the chaotic condition that prevails throughout the world, it will not be long before another struggle more bitter and Satanic than the late war will be fought. This time, not to save democracy, but to save our present capitalistic system. Never before, in the annals of man, have the international bankers, hiding behind the smoke-screen of the League of Nations, shown more keenly that their wits are being put to the supreme test. Thus, apparently representing a body wishing peace at any price, in reality they are setting the stage for another slaughter of innocent millions.</p>
   <p>Late reports indicate that Soviet Russia, in spite of all obstacles, is succeeding with the Five-Year Plan. And, moreover, she is actually showing the rest of the world that national communism is far less barbaric than our so-called social democracies. The international bankers, the League of Nations, if you wish, in order to save crumbling capitalistic Europe from going communistic, had no alternative but to start another war and promptly they engaged the armies of despotic Japan to set the ball rolling.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>If we recall the Treaty of Versailles, we note that great stress was laid on the fact that unless Germany and Russia were separated, capitalistic Europe would not endure. Hence, with the establishment of an independent Poland as a buffer state, and the creation by France of the Little Entente, a complete bulwark towards the west has been made to stem the tide of communism.</p>
   <p>Thus being checked on all her western borders, Soviet Russia promptly began spreading her doctrine to her eastern neighbors, with the result that in China today there are several millions avowed communists. In order, therefore, to arrest Russia's eastern success, the League found it necessary to separate Soviet Russia from China. That has been done by allowing Japan to occupy the whole of Manchuria, an area of 390,000 square miles. With Manchuria temporarily in the hands of Japan, Russia is now surrounded on all sides by hostile armies and might at the slightest pretense, who knows, be served with an ultimatum.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>With the capitalistic governments hanging by a thread and supported by only a stubborn group of international bankers who in their greed for gain fail to see the light of economic readjustment, there is but little hope for a peaceful solution of this problem.</p>
   <p>The curtain will soon rise on the starving hordes of Continental Europe as well as on the democratic workers of America, with despotic Japan swooping down on the Soviet Republic. This is hypothetical but very logical, judging from facts, that is, reading between the lines and peaking "behind the scenes." And so, our leaders will try to save imperialistic capitalism and in so doing will retard the cause of liberty for at least another hundred years.</p>
