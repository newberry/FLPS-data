   <p>p.2.........It has been reported from the large cities all over the country how thousands of poor people, ten thousand, fifteen thousand, twenty thousand, and so on, were being fed during the holidays.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago one of the daily papers, with funds obtained through public subscription, fed fifteen thousand persons and the Salvation Army fed ten thousand. What a wonderful picture does not this give us, of the "prosperity" and"plenty for all" which according to the capitalistic spokesmen we are enjoying at the present time.</p>
   <p>Nobody that is able to provide a meal for himself and with some self-respect left, would want to participate in this mass feeding during the holidays. It is the "down-and-outers," the steady growing miserable mass of "left-behinds," from the capitalistic storm-march, that are here passing review.</p>

   <p>How would it be if the Salvation Army, instead of preparing for months, with Kling-Klong and Hallelujahs, for this mass-feeding, would employ all the power and enthusiasm, which it has at its disposal, for the purpose of changing the social conditions that create so many thousands of needy people. As best charity is only a drop in the bucket. It is not charity we need, but justice.</p>
