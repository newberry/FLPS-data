   <p>"Never before has there been so much wealth in the U. S. as now, and the prospect of continued prosperity is excellent," writes Chicago Record Nerald. At the same time Prof. Charles J. Bushnell, Washington D. C., furnishes us with the following information:</p>
   <p>"Ten million people, one eighth of our population, are so festitute that they are unable to maintain their physical standard. Four million of them must be supported by the public. In 1899, another year of prosperity, 18% of the population in New York had to apply for charity. In 1903 1<span class="gap">[gap]</span>% of all families in Manhattan were expelled from their homes, and 1<span class="gap">[gap]</span>% of those who died were buried in Potter's Field."</p>
   <p>"The increased maladjustment in our industrial life," continues Prof. Bushnell, "expressed by these numbers, results in a serious increase in crime and insanity. Public charity costs the American people not less than $6,000,000 annually. There is every indication that the nation will came to financial bankruptcy."</p>
   
   <p>Before this happens, we hope humanity will have come to the realization of the fact that it would be wiser to establish an economic order under which every able-bodied person is guaranteed a fair share of the wealth so as to reduce crime and insanity to a minimum.</p>
