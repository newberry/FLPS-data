   <p>p.2. col. 1. We read in Social Demokraten (The Social Democrat) of a man who traveled from Milan, Italy to Christiania, Norway. The trip was made in three days. As he passed through the intervening countries he bought newspapers at every opportunity. In every issue throughout Italy, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway the headlines blared of unemployment.</p>
   <p>Relief and remedial measures were already being tried; legislations, collecting funds for relief, creating work for unemployed, strikes and demonstrations. We are forced to admit that these conditions exist even in our own U. S. A., which has to the oppressed European worker always represented, "The Land of Promise."</p>
   
   <p>During the last century there were occasional periods of unemployment with a crisis about every ten years. In our day we have two or three years of prosperity followed by a period of unemployment and "hard times." Particularly has this been true since the nineties. Certain prominent students of political economy who forecast a European depression of some duration are now saying "I told you so," and the events of recent years seem to justify their attitude.</p>
   <p>The world has never seen nor will it see a condition that can revolutionize individual lives as well as that of nations, as much as the problem of unemployment.</p>
   <p>Poverty has been with us throughout history; but poverty has never been a problem that could even begin to compare with the more serious and far-reaching problem of unemployment. What then of the chronic unemployment that is about to threaten the very existence of the white race?</p>
   
   <p>We hear many statements to the effect that the working class should be more conservative and that they are asking too much. Even though the standard of living is lowered to the level of the Oriental laborer, it will not make better conditions, nor increase the profits of capital. The prosperity of any land depends upon the power of the working-man to purchase the products of his own labor. New markets can only develop with purchasing power.</p>
   <p>There is one, and only one, remedy for unemployment: This is Socialism. The world has its limits as far as new markets are concerned. When this limit is reached production cannot be increased and we are forced to simply supply present needs. It is not as of old, anymore, when each family produced its own supply. Now, production is by all, for all. This, in theory and practice, is pure, unadulturated Socialism, the capitalistic moguls and press notwithstanding.</p>
   
   <p>But today capitalistic domination is controlling production in such a way as to turn Europe and America into one vast poor-house. But it will require only little effort now to awaken the working class to a realization of its strength; and the necessity of prompt, efficient and well-directed action.</p>
