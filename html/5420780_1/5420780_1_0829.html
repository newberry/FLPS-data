   <p>Fraudulent voting betrays a greater degree of corruption in our public life than anticipated by any one, and it constitutes a danger serious enough for our democratic institutions to become alarmed. It should be publicly condemned throughout the country.</p>
   <p>The capitalistic Democratic and Republican press maintain a rather indifferent attitude, and the moral preachers and reformers who usually are the first to complain in any other instance, are also silent, as are their respective organs.</p>
   <p>There can only be one answer to this problem, namely, that these <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>parties think it important to keep a socialist out of a high public office and "the end justifies the means."</p>
   <p>The general lack of a sense of and a demand for justice is even more dangerous and discouraging than the fact that corrupt politicians have deceived the public, because the first leaves out the hope for improvement until the socialist movement has established a higher public morale.</p>
