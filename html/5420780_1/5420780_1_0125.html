   <p>At a meeting of the Scandinavian Progressive Association which took place June 1 the following resolution was passed:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In the last year a powerful party has risen, which has as its aim the curtailing of religious freedom not only by bringing God and Christ into the Constitution, but also by requiring the confession of certain religious dogmas as a condition for the holding of public office, and which is attempting, through undemocratic Sunday laws, to force all the citizens to keep the Sabbath holy; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Scandinavian Progressive Association joins without reservation the political movement started by the Germans against the Sunday laws, and hopes that from this movement there will issue a new party which will supersede the Republican party, which has outlived its usefulness."</p>
