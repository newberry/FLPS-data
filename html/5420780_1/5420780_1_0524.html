   <p>In Dansk Americaneren (The Danish American), Mr. Rud Knudsen of Brooklyn recently wrote a long article in defense of Socialism, mentioning also our country man Lawrence Gronlund, who died in 1899. Revyen has continously pointed to Lawrence Gronlund, as being pioneer of socialism in America. Part of Gronlund's best and most read book, the Cooperative Commonwealth, was translated and published by Revyen in 1901. We have the impression that Mr. Knudsen thinks L. Gronlund is unknown among Danes in America. He is all wrong, at least as far as the Middle West is concerned.</p>
