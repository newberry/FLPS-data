   <p>During his recent stay in Chicago the superintendent of public schools in Porto Rico inspected the Lane Technical High School, and was so impressed by the methods employed there and by the results obtained, that he decided to engage twenty of the school's graduates to introduce its system in the government schools in Porto Rico.</p>
   <p>Among the twenty graduates chosen is the son of the Danish wholesaler Max Crown, the twenty-one year old Victor Crown, with the nick name, "Crown, the Victor," referring to the many first prizes he won while attending the school.</p>
   <p>The twenty youngsters, who are now making the front pages all over the country, are leaving Chicago on September 8, with the prospects of a great future on one rich and progressive island, and we join his many friends in wishing "Crown, the Victor" a happy voyage.</p>
