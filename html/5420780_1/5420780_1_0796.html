   <p>p.3.col.2........Jens Jensen, who for the past four years has held the position as Superintendent of the Chicago West Side Parks System has resigned. His action was brought about by the antagonistic attitude of Park Board members due to Mr. Jensen's determined refusal to "play ball" and make the parks a political foot ball and dumping ground. Were it not for Mr. Jensen's popularity he would have been taken out of office long ago. But he struggled valiantly on until he had completed a number of plans including the landscape architectural plans for Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>He will, however, still be connected with the Park Board as "Consulting Landscape Engineer" at a salary of $2400.00 per year with the privilege of engaging in outside activities at will. For example, he has designed two parks for Racine, Wis., and other projects.</p>
