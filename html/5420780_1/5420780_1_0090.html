   <p>Arnold Rasmussen writes good English. It is refreshing to see a Dane forming his phrases with such ease and force as he does. His style is excellent; his vocabulary is rich. One would think he might be reading Shakespeare. The only thing in his article that is not excellent is his attack upon Dr. Max Henius.</p>
   <p>My friends and foes in the Danish settlement know I have had many a tussle with old Dr. Max, but we were never bitter enemies; we just could not agree upon the same plan of procedure in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>committees where we served. He loved to come into our various activities with a packed committee. --I hated that method of working, but the doctor has that in him which makes him want to be sure of his position of leadership wherever he takes hold of things. </p>
   <p>He is, however, like all men of his race, an internationalist. He likes to travel; he also likes to comment on the Eighteenth Amendment. Why shouldn't he? He is a brewer, a chemist and a fermentologist. If it comes down to brass tacks that he found an error in the prohibition law (the Volstead Act), I am quite sure his arguments are sound. They will not do any good in Washington for a repeal or a change in the statutory law of the United States at this time, but this contribution may nevertheless have a valuable effect some day.</p>

   <p>Arnold Rasmussen's article is not criticism - it is ridicule of Dr. Henius' article. Sometimes I love to see my nearest friends ridiculed because I cannot do it myself, but I never like to see my opponents ridiculed. Men who can fight have something in them worth while.</p>
   <p>In spite of my differences with Dr. Henius I shall always give him credit for his valuable contribution to Danish-American relations; his energy and his contribution to pure science in his labratory of fermentology is something far beyond "Prat og snak." (prattle and talk.)</p>
