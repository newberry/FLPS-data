   <p>p.2.col.1..........Some of the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican Parties are severely criticizing the newly enacted tariff laws. This is natural enough as the new laws are making a slight inroad into acticipated profits whose destination was the bottomless money-hogs of greedy capitalists who have so faithfully listened to "their master's voice." The criticism may be very enlightening, but of what benefit, when one considers that the critics themselves are, and always have been, members of the two big parties and is therefore either insincere or conscienciously tampered to a placating mildness. The only party that sticks to its program, so that not one of its members feels called upon to defend or excuse, is the Socialist Party. This party knows what it wants and wants what it knows.</p>
