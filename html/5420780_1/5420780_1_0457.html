   <p>p.2.col.1................The present "Corner on Wheat" will, undoubtedly, bring a rise in the price of bread but no corresponding increase in the wage scale or income of the producer or processor of wheat products. This is typical of capitalism (in reality a social anarchy) under which the masses are domineered and tyrannized over by the few. Not one of these parasites ever worked for or produced one nickle of the millions, a system of monopoly and plunder has permitted them to amass.</p>
   <p>There is one and only one remedy for this cancer of injustice. A sensible arrangement of production and a just division of profits would force these capitalistic parasites to become useful producing members of the community; the burden of the farmer and laborer would be lightened,and the just share of their efforts would make their lives more livable.</p>
