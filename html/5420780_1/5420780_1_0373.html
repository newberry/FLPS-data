   <p>The political campaign, which is now about to wind up, has been comparatively peaceful and decent. The two old issues, the tariff and the trusts, which the capitalistic parties have been hashing and rehashing for more than twenty years, are not of the kind that creates violent brain storms among the candidates nor among the voters.</p>
   <p>It is generally conceded that the result of next Tuesday's election will not greatly affect the country's future, no matter which one of the three capitalistic parties comes into power.</p>
   <p>A Wilson victory would not indicate any decided political turn in the Democratic direction by the electorate; it would rather be the result of the three-cornered setup, with Roosevelt taking more votes from Taft than he takes from Wilson. It is even possible that he will take enough from both <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of them to win the election himself, for he can talk faster and shout louder than his opponents, and he is undoubtedly the most popular and illustrious of the trio.</p>
   <p>We Social-Democrats should and will, of course, support our own candidates, even though we entertain no hope of electing Debs and Seidel; but we do expect to see a considerable increase in voting strength, as compared to the last Presidential election, as an expression of the steady progress of our cause. We can readily dispense with the pseudo-radical sympathizers, who are now turning to Roosevelt, but every red-blooded socialist will demonstrate his loyalty to the cause by voting for the party candidates.</p>
   <p>In the local field, particularly in Chicago, several of our candidates have a good chance of being elected. William A. Cunnea, candidate for State's Attorney, should defeat the Hearst protegee, Hoyne, Democrat, and Rinaker, Republican, endorsed by the Tribune.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>As for the 7th Congressional District, even the Tribune concedes the possibility of a victory for Otto Christensen, and the 23rd Senatorial District is expected to send Christian M. Madsen to the state legislature.</p>
   <p>Whatever the outcome may be, let us vote the straight Social-Democratic ticket next Tuesday by placing our X in the circul opposite the names of Debs and Seidel!</p>
