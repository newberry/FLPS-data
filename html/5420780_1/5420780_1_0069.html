   <p>Mr. John Larsen, nineteen-year old son of our countryman, Mr. August Larsen, saloon owner, has been awarded a four year scholarship to Princeton University, by the Princeton Club of Chicago. The scholarship includes tuition and all other expenses at the University.</p>
   <p>Young Larsen worked his way through the Evanston Academy by tending bar in his father's establishment, and many American newspapers, commenting on the appointment, have complimented the boy on his versatility as an outstanding scholar and a first class "drink slinger".</p>
   <p>"He is a man of all around ability," says the secretary of the Princeton Club, "a good fellow, and a good mixer--speaking both of drinks and men--and we feel <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sure that he will make good at old Princeton. We believe he will show the Tiger that Chicago has some pretty good boys."</p>
   <p>Larsen is planning to specialize in civil engineering.</p>
