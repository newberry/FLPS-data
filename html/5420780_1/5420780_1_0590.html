   <p>Now and then the American press whose daily insults to our intelligence and integrity surely are hard enough pills for civilized people to swallow is indulging in a propaganda that appears wore like a paroxysm of insanity than journalism. Typical is its attitude towards the spoiled millionaire boy, Thaw, who on account of too easy access to money lost the bit of ability to reason he had and degenerated into a two-logged animal and ended as a murderer. A boy of that sort should be of interest to the public only as a product of the absurity characterizing our social conditions. Had these been organized according to principles of decency such as advocated by the socialists a boy of his kind would either have been educated and trained to be a useful citizen or, if he had proved incurable, placed in an institution where he would be properly taken care of. He is a type and an example of the demoralizing effect of Capitalistic principles and deserves no more attention than any ordinary "nut."</p>
   <p>But partly on account of pungent circumstances and party on account of the millions owned by his mother the case is held to be an event of worldwide <span class="page-break">2</span>interest overshadowing all other events "News" about developments in the case is not confined to columns in the daily press, it covers page after page. Even the more decent and conservative papers are going the limit although they cannot measure up with the Hearst papers which consider it their duty to bring at least one new photo of the murderer and two and three of his wife every day. They have about a dozen male and female correspondents competing in writing the most hysterical stories.</p>
   <p>Into the homes go that damnable stuff and is read and enjoyed by young boys and girls and by the public in general. We presume the great majority is in favor of such "literature" or it wouldn't find so great a market.</p>
   <p>But in the opinion of decent people it is poisonous and a disgrace for a civilized country. Fortunately therefore that there is at least one paper a person can read without being overwhelmed with murderous literature. This paper is the Chicago Socialist which brings a few short votes about the Thaw affair now and then and for the rest deals with more important matters.</p>
