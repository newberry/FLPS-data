   <p>The present unemployment situation which is gripping the entire world has reached the stage where our gray matter begins to raise questions.</p>
   <p>In brief, the situation is this: Previous to the World War, and before mass production had reached its present stage of super-efficiency, a worker in this country considered himself well paid if he held an eighteen-dollar-or twenty-dollars-per-week job. Then came the World War, with demand increased to the extent that every available American worker found himself confronted with more than enough work to satisfy him, and with wages unheard of before. In short, the worker was able to enjoy a period of plenty. At the close of the War there came a period of depression, and from 1919 to 1922 the workers again felt a shortage of jobs. The depression of the early twenties was due to the sudden closing of our ammunition plants, which employed <span class="page-break">\2</span>a vast number of people, and to the return of our soldiers, who soon joined the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
   <p>Aside from this, however, an important contributing factor was the Liberty Bond situation. They were in the hands of workers who during the War had followed the nation's cry to "buy till it hurts." The great industrial gamblers and bankers, with an eye for easy money, soon had the American worker in a position where he was forced to sell his Liberty Bonds at a loss of twenty-five to thirty per cent. The industrial lords gave the workers a chance to again shoulder the wheels of industry, while they reaped the profits.</p>
   <p>Now the American worker has first seen the close of another period of prosperity. This time the cause is our great surplus on hand, which American efficiency in mass production has brought about, since it has reached a point where supply exceeds demand.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Many of our great lights and economic leaders are trying to find a way whereby normalcy may be stabilized. But as long as the majority still cling to the antiquated capitalistic idea of wage cutting, this attempt is bound to fail.</p>
   <p>One cannot but wonder whether our great industrial leaders realize that with our present-day efficiency in mass production it will take but a short while before half of our population will be job-hunting from the day they reach maturity till the day they reach the age of forty. After forty, the unemployed worker will no longer seek a job, unless he has proved himself another Brisbane, Ford, or Edison, he is not wanted.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, what is to become of our surplus? Henry Ford prides himself on the efficiency of his plant. Yet what good is mass production without consumers? In other words, are we to starve because we raise too much food? Are the people to go barefoot because we have too many shoes? - If this be civilization and christianity, then we have much to learn from <span class="page-break">\4</span>our savage and primitive ancestors.</p>
   <p>The solution to this problem is a simple one. Machinery should be made for the sole purpose of setting man free by reducing working hours from eight to six, or even to four, with an increase in wages. Only by doing this, can we succeed in defeating business reaction and overproduction.</p>
   <p>At first it might seem a rather radical change, but it is the only solution, and the sooner we make capitalists realize that mass production without consumption is a losing proposition, the sooner we shall reach the state where life will be worth living, not for a "chosen few" but for the masses.</p>
   <p>Give the worker a substantial pay envelope! He is a good sport; he will return it by spending it the next day in order to enjoy some of the commodities he has produced.</p>
