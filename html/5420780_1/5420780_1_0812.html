   <p>A prominent Danish politician, Henry Hertz, met with an accident yesterday. He tried to jump on a street-car before it stopped. He missed and his left leg was smashed. Dr. Heckton and Dr. Fenger were called at once and the leg had to be amputated.</p>
   <p>(Mr. Hertz was a very powerful man in Republican Party circles here in Chicago, for many years.)</p>
