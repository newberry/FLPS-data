   <p>The Danish policeman, Mads J. Jacobsen, was suspended because he did not want to be a strikebreaker during the streetcar strike. He has not been reinstated after ten days' suspension plus thirty days' suspension for refusing to obey his superior officer. Assistant Chief Schuttler tried to have him discharged, but the trial board did not find any reason for doing so.</p>
