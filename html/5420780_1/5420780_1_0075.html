   <p>Miss Olivia Olson called a meeting last Friday at the Workingmen's Hall in regard to the question of opening Scandinavian schools, or at least one school for the progressive youth. The meeting was not as well attended as it should have been. Every one seemed to be interested and promised their support to Miss Olivia Olson. The school should be free so as to help keep the young people off the streets. They must be taught things not taught in the public schools. How to get the money to rent rooms, and pay for the gas and heat, will be taken up at the next meeting. Teachers can be secured gratis. They were sure teachers would be glad to donate a few hours a week to a project of this type.</p>
