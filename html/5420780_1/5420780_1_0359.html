   <p>The legislators of the State of Illinois have convened and the Socialist party is now represented by the Messrs. Christian M. Madsen, our countryman, Joseph M. Mason, N. W. Harris and Seymour Stedman.</p>
   <p>The Chicago newspapers, have published a list of not less than <span class="page-break">\2</span>28 bills sponsored by the Socialist party. The list has been made up by Mr. Madsen.</p>
   <p>The bills include commendable proposals; as, the abolition of prohibitive measures to prevent strikes, guarantee of the right to strike and to picket and boycott; a better system of workers' accidental insurance, particularly, consideration of legal procedures pertaining to personal injury; an eight-hour working day; public life insurance; suffrage for women; a new municipal charter for the City of Chicago; the right of cities and municipalities to establish, own, and operate electric power plants, warehouses <span class="page-break">\3</span>and other needed facilities; free books in our public schools; referendum on approval or dismissal of Supreme court decisions; public employment insurance patterned from the system in force in Denmark.</p>
   <p>Even if only a few or none of these bills will be passed, they create an opportunity for discussion of practical Socialism and an assertion of the workers' claims and interests. In this respect our representatives will no doubt understand how to set a record in the State legislature of Illinois.</p>
