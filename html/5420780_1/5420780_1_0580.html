   <p>Some time ago Revyen wrote that decent and civilized peoples would feel ashamed to read the sort of stuff that is being smeared over the pages of the daily papers about the Thaw murder case. "We indicated further that there is at least one paper in Chicago which has more important subjects to discuss. We refer to The Chicago Daily Socialist.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, nobody has to be content with idiotical journalism, particularly not when something immensely better is at his immediate service. To read and patronize a paper that presents the truth and adheres to a principle of denency is the only remedy at our disposal. In order to obtain a press whose publishers are not afraid to call things and conditions by their right names we must definitely prove that we actually want it. We must despise the tendency in journalism to lose sight of the object by indulging in hysterical sentimentality. As long as an urgent desire to that effect is not in evidence on the part of the public, and changes expressively demanded it matters not what legal measures we take to prevent the abuses. Such will only stimulate the hypocritical spirit prevailing in modern society. To check the freedom of the press in a dicatorial way may prove even more dangerous than the evils causing our objections.</p>
   <p>Despite the constitution which says: "Congress shall make no laws abridging the freedom of speech or the freedom of the press." Congress has granted, or the Federal Government has actually grabbed the power and authority to interfere with the said freedom particularly by means of postal restrictions.</p>
   <p>With President Roosevelt apparently considering a still more severe censorship on account of the dirty Thaw swearings we have reason to ask: Where is the limit or the end? The president thus giving the signal a number of hypocritical congressmen and state legislators got busy formulating plans to muzzle the press. Describing such attack on the freedom of the press the Chicago Daily News reports from Spokane:</p>
   <p>"Muzzling the press of the state of Washington and exercising a censorship more drastic than anything yet conceived in darkest Russia over newspapers and journals published in other states and widely circulated in this state is the purpose of a measure just submitted to the legislature by State Senator Will A. Graves of Spokane. The bill, if enacted, will prohibit any newspaper or other periodical published or circulated in Washington to contain any account or reference to crime, reports of police court trials or proceedings, forbidding also the details of any crime." What next?</p>
