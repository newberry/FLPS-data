   <p>It was recently reported that President Theodore Roosevelt had written an article intended as a final "knockout" to the socialistic movement in the United States of America. With the article the White House champion of capitalism expected, figuratively speaking, to make "hash" of the entire Socialist party.</p>
   <p>But what happens? According to an editorial in the capitalistic Boston Transcript "the mountains has given birth to a mouse, and a small mouse at that". President Roosevelt has written an article attacking, in his most forceful manner, what he considers to be the principles of socialism. His article was submitted to the criticism of two prominent sociologists, neither of whom were Socialists, but who were well versed in the literature of the socialistic group.</p>

   <p>The answer of these learned men was so uncomplimentary that the President tore up the article. He is determined, however, to go more deeply into the study of the doctrines of socialism.</p>
   <p>So ended President Roosevelt's first punitive expedition against socialism, and it is a question as to whether he or the leaders in socialistic circles experienced the greater disappointment in the outcome of this effort.</p>
