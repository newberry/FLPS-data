   <p>Povl Geleff's lecture of last Monday evening gathered about three hundred people into Aurora Turner Hall. Mr. Thorsmark introduced Mr. Geleff to the Singing Society "International", which sang a couple of songs; and Geleff claimed that the paper Skandinavien had been of great help to him in choosing the material for his lecture.</p>
   <p>He read an article that Skandinavien had once printed, regarding Socialism and communism as one. He contradicted that idea but said that socialism at the present time is very strong in every part of Europe. He stated that in Denmark ninety nine out of one hundred laborers were for the socialistic doctrine.</p>
