   <p>The history of the declining years of the great Roman Empire presents a striking parallel to the present situation in this country. In the book Ancient Times, by Professor J. H. Breasted, we read: "Thus under this oriental despotism, the liberty, for which men had striven so long, disappeared in Europe, and the once free Romans had no independent life of their own. For the will of the emperor had now become the law, and as such, his decrees were dispatched throughout the length and breadth of the Roman dominions.</p>
   <p>"Even the citizen's wages and the prices of the goods he bought or sold, were as far as possible fixed for him by the state. The emperor's innumerable officials kept an eye upon even the humblest citizen. They watched the grain dealers, butchers, and bakers, and saw that they properly supplied the public and never deserted their occupation. In some cases, the state even forced the son to follow the profession of his father."</p>
   <p>In a word, the Roman government now attempted to regulate almost every interest in life, and wherever the citizen turned be felt the control and oppression of the state.</p>
   <p>History repeats itself. The laws of cause and effect have not been repealed. Most of those who comment on some of the administration's policies are sincere in their criticism, and in no way partisan. It is their country too.</p>
   <p>Certainly, there can be no progress without change, but the new dealers should remember that all change is not progress.</p>
