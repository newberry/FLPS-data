   <p>Thanks to the activity of Mayor Busse, Chicago has now a School Board which will look out for the protection of the privileged class. Among other important features there are rumors to the effect that the board is in favor of giving the Tribune a new lease on the school property at half the actual rental value, which means that the schools are deprived of a $50,000 annual income. Possibly, The Tribune acquired the lease in a legitimate way long ago and had a renewal clause inserted so as to safeguard itself against a raise in rent, but this does not justify the transaction as seen from a moral point of view. When the case has been properly presented before the public we would think that the readers of the Tribune are so much in favor of justice and decency that they would object to a deal of that kind so strongly that it might prevent its consummation. A daily paper has more responsibility and is in closer contact with the public at large than any other kind of business. It should, in particular, refrain from being involved in questionable transactions because its readers will be either coresponsible or revolt and turn their backs on the paper,if it does not carry a clean coat-of-arms. A few thousand cancellations of subscriptions and advertisements, accompanied by protests, would probably give the Tribune a lesson on the subject of "Smartness and Profit Versus Public Opinion."</p>
