   <p>p.2.col.1...In Chicago our two capitalistic camps are, as usual, carrying on a campaign of brag, bluster, bluff and golden promises regarding the coming election. Everything is in a whirl, confusing and misleading to such an extent that, to an outsider, a supposedly important event like a city election resembles a gala affair in farce; a huge joke.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party has three candidates in the field; W. E. Rodriguez ( a painter) for Mayor, John C. Flora (carpenter) for City Clerk and John M. Collins (machinist) for City Treasurer. These men are picked with thoughtful care and with the best interests of Chicago at heart. The men are known for their clean records and integrity and they stand for clean politics and honest administration of the city's affairs. A vote for these men is a vote for decency and right against graft and dirt.</p>
