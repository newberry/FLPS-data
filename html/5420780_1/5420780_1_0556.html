   <p>Attorney Otto Christensen, one of the Socialist party's candidates for judge at the coming election, spoke last Friday at the meeting of the S. S. S. of 1895. In his very interesting and instructive speech Mr. Christensen reviewed some of the most noted court cases, in which the courts obviously have been prejudiced in favor of the capitalistic and employing class; particularly did he show how the courts, by means of injunctions, have tried to hamper the workers' organizations and obstruct their right to strike, a procedure well illustrated in the Ann Arbor case, the railroad strike under Debs, the Buck Stove &amp; Range case, etc.</p>
   <p>This state of affairs will, of course, continue until the workers stop electing judges nominated by corrupt politicians and capitalistic cliques and replace them with men of the Socialist party, representing the workers' own interests, and pledged to judge and act accordingly.</p>
   
   <p>The speaker was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>During President Taft's stay in Chicago Mr. Christensen wrote him a letter, accepting the president's "challenge to publicists and jurists," and pointing out the dangers inherent in the Supreme Court's recent interpretation of the anti-trust law. He further argued, as he did in his recent article in Twentieth Century Magazine, that the court, by stating that only "unreasonable restraint of trade" is against the law has usurped legislative authority. The responsibility for this dangerous prerogative falls on the president himself, by his recent appointment of two Supreme Court judges.</p>
   <p>We hope the president is contemplating our countryman's letter. It has been published in the daily papers.</p>
