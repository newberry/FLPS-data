   <p>The Pioneer has written a biography of the Danish Socialist leader, Louis Pio, who died in Chicago in 1894. The editor of Revyen thinks that the reason for this enthusiasm for Mr. Pio is the fact that he betrayed the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>He was one of the very first leaders of Socialism in Denmark, was arrested and came to America. Here he went into real-estate business, and tried to found a Danish colony in Florida for some railroad company, but this whole project failed utterly.</p>
   <p>He was always very bitter when he spoke about the leaders of the Socialist party in Denmark, and he always blamed everybody else for his hard luck.</p>
   <p>The editor believes that he should write more about another Danish-American Socialist leader, namely Laurence Gronlund, also of Chicago. Mr. Gronlund is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the author of The Co-Operative Commonwealth.</p>
