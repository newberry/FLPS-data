   <p>The three Scandinavian nationalities, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish held a splendid banquet in Scandia Hall. The meeting was a good symbol of the manner in which these three groups are attempting to unite.</p>
   <p>The committees that handled this meeting consisted of Messrs. W. Colberg, T. Jager, N. Juul, and Hohn Riise, who together represented eight singing societies. The hall was decorated with American, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish flags. The program opened with a pot-pourri of American melodies. The president, Mr. Niels Juul, spoke wittily and cleverly. He declared that these societies were Scandinavian, not Danish, not Norwegian, not Swedish.</p>
