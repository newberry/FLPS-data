   <p>The Democratic Danes in the Sixteenth Ward are working hard for the election of Olaf Hansen as alderman. He has a good record from the time he was West Town Collector in 1890-1891. But the Republican machine is doing all in its power to re-elect its old alderman, Mr. Raymer, who is a Catholic. Even such well-known Danes as Henry L. Hertz and Senator Niels Juul are working for his election; that is all their love of Danes and Denmark means during election.</p>
   <p>Olaf Hansen might lose the Sixteenth Ward but all Scandinavians in the Ward will surely vote for Mr. Hansen.</p>
