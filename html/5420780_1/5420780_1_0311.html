   <p>Know yourself and make it your point in life to live according to your own wishes.</p>
   <p>Let no one, not even your best friend, steer you away from the path that appeals most to your individual self.</p>
   <p>Following your own desires may at times prove rather dear. Yet the compensation outweighs the cost; for by giving your inner self full rein, you discover not only your own strength, but your own weaknesses as well.</p>
   <p>Having thus made acquaintances with your own imperfect self, your desire for finding faults in others should disappear as quickly as dew drops evaporate in the morning scene.</p>

   <p>Avoid following the leaders; be your own master, refuse to be guided by anyone or anything contrary to your own beliefs, - for only by so doing can you even hope to reach the individualistic state of mind.</p>
   <p>Understood by none, appreciated by only a few perhaps, you drift through life apparently a lonesome figure. A great deal of sympathy, no doubt, is thrown in your path by sentimental fools, who for the lack of something more useful to do spend their time in trying to fathom your bereaved state.</p>
   <p>This sentiment might be as beautiful as it is cheap, yet you need it not, for behind the countenance upon which they look with such pity, you can assure them that sunshine and contentment rule supreme.</p>
