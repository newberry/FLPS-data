   <p>Governor Tanner has just re-organized the West Side Park Board. Anton Pedersen, a Norwegian, was dropped as Park Commissioner. And James Jensen, a Dane, was fired as the superintendent of Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>Carter Harrison had kicked almost all Scandinavians out of the service of the city of Chicago, now it looks like Mr. Tanner is going to do the same to the Scandinavian in the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>James Jensen has been superintendent of Humboldt Park for six years, and he is everywhere recognized as an authority as to flowers and landscaping.</p>
   <p>This is an insult to the Danish colony around Humboldt Park.</p>
