   <p>p.2..........Probably many of Revyen's (The Review) readers would gladly take a good lecture, just as the coal trust and other corporations are doing now, if they as a compensation, were permitted to grab millions for themselves.</p>
   <p>The termination of the big coal strike, has been hailed by the capitalistic press, as a proud victory for the workers and "the public," and a crushing defeat for the coal barons.</p>
   <p>The hearings before the arbitration board, brought forth plenty evidence concerning the miserable conditions under which the mine workers are living. Conditions that are worse than slavery. When it is all over, their situation may be slightly improved and the public is going to pay for this improvement, just as"the public," is now paying for the strike, by freezing or by paying excessive prices for coal.</p>

   <p>The coal barons and the coal merchants are now subject to investigation "and inquiry" here and there and are being discredited by clergymen and newspapers; but this does not change the fact that they, boldly and undisturbed, keep on fleecing both the workers and the public, and will continue to do so until the majority of the population shall be able to see through the capitalistic cobweb and come to realize that every man, woman and child have just as divine a right to the coal deposits, and other natural resources as Boen and his consorts.</p>
