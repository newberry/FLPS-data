   <p>The Chicago City Council has postponed its decision on whether or not to renew the concession held by the old Telephone Company of Chicago. But don't fool yourself by thinking that the City Council has the benefit of the public in mind and is trying to stop exploitation practices in this particular line by establishing a publicly owned telephone system. Oh no! The reason for the postponement is simply that a new telephone company has been incorporated, and through the assistance of part of the capitalistic press the new company is trying to grab the concession. It is for what is "in it" that the alderman postponed action. They want to be on the side where the highest price is offered for the monopoly.</p>
