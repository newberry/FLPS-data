   <p>The worst enemies of socialism are those so-called socialists who, unwilling to subordinate themselves to the peaceful, often slow progress of real socialism, breaking away from the ranks to proclaim some revolutionary idea a method which they think will lead straight and quickly to the goal: The liberation of labor.</p>
   <p>In the old days, De Leon and his impossibilistic school went on a rampage; today anarchistic phrases, such as "sabotage" and "direct action," are being propounded, endangering the labor movement from within. By accident these "fads" succeeded in placing a representative in the executive committee itself, and they are given liberal space in a certain faction of the party press, the New York Call, International Socialist Review and other minor publications whose purpose, according to the Social-Democratic Herald, is to misinform new socialists and to steer them into the camp of anarchism.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party should shake off these irresponsible howlers and mischief-makers, the sooner the better.</p>
