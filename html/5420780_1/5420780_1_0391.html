   <p>In the march towards world collectivism and culture the United States is slowly catching up. A couple of days after the elections in Germany, Postmaster General Hitchcock came out in favor of a publicly owned telegraph system and announced that a law to that effect would be introduced in Congress. So far, the President has kept himself in the background. Probably, the postmaster general's move was just a "feeler" to probe public reaction to a more radical platform than the tariff question offers. However, the mere fact that a member of the conservative Administration made the above proposal, is more encouraging than a whole lot of progressive humbug.</p>
