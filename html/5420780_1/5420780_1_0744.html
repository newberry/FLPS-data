   <p>We all know that Congressman Niels Juul has been the father of much worthwhile legislation, and that he is a real friend of the people. The Congressman recently made a speech in the House of Representatives that, we think, was outstanding. We feel that his constituents should know what he really attempts to do for them. So we will, from time to time, print his speeches. His speech of January 24 follows:</p>
   <p>The House in Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H. R. 9054) making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919.</p>
   <p>Mr. Juul: "Mr. Chairman, some years ago as a member of a senatorial committee in my state, I visited the State University at Champaign and Urbana. Among the interesting things shown to the senators were certain machines for testing the resisting powers of wood and metal.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"I remember certain machines for testing timber: an upright piece of wood several feet long and probably six inches square was placed in this machine and pressure was applied. Over the machine was an indicator like a steam gauge, that recorded hundreds and thousands of pounds of pressure applied to the wood by the machine. I believe that finally, under ever so many thousand pounds of pressure, the fiber in the wood gave way and, technically speaking, it failed. The test had shown the number of thousands of pounds that that particular kind of wood could stand.</p>
   <p>"Under the Constitution and laws of the United States it was contemplated that the enormous pressure that this World War is forcing upon the Congress was to be divided in approximately 434 parts, each part or unit of the House to stand at least a share of it, so that no single man should go to pieces or fail, either physically or mentally, trying to stand up under the strain all alone or by himself. (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>"But by virtue of some system probably vogue for many years, before I and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>many of the gentlemen came here, it seems that the burden of the Government unjustly rests upon a very few gentlemen. I am now judging the situation by reading the Congressional Record, where I find that one gentleman addressed the House and had his name printed in the Record 118 times on a single day." (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>Mr. Garret of Tennessee: "Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?"</p>
   <p>Mr. Juul: "Oh, I will be through in half a minute."</p>
   <p>Mr. Garrett of Tennessee: "Does the gentleman think it is entirely fair to make these remarks in the absence of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Stafford)?"</p>
   <p>Mr. Juul: "I have mentioned no names. I want to say to the gentleman that once we had a police official out in Chicago who called the policemen together one morning in the squad room and said, 'I am not going to mention any names, but if Sorenson don't stop drinking, some policeman is going to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>lose his star.' (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>"The question that is naturally agitating my mind is whether the one man, or the few men, having to stand the enormous strain has railed under it, or whether the four hundred and thirty-odd gentlemen have failed under the strain of watching the few gentlemen fail under the system of placing this enormous burden upon the shoulders of a dozen men. As a failure, it is best illustrated by the fact that the great number of men in the House have become so tenderhearted that the moment the grind starts and a few gentlemen start in addressing the House, thereby assuming all the burdens, all the rest of the members desert the hall and walk out or the building. (Laughter.) Did I say walk? No, I was mistaken; they do not walk out, they run out; and it is necessary to ring a bell three times to bring them back. And when they do come back and find that the same four or five gentlemen are still under pressure trying to carry the burden that 433 men should divide and carry, these four hundred-odd men immediately, when they have responded to their names, feel so badly that as soon as they have answered 'Here' to the call of their names, they again run out, feeling that things are being attended to so much <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>better than they could possibly attend to them. (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>"If one of the gentlemen who has come over to respond to his name should for a moment forget himself and ask for permission to help carry the burden and watch the indicator, helping the few gentlemen to stand the strain, he is immediately jumped on, sat on, and squelched, and in unmistakable manner informed that the proper place for the four hundred-odd gentlemen is over in the House office building addressing envelopes and mailing seeds to their constituents in the rural districts. (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>"It is the hopeless situation created which compels the four hundred-odd gentlemen to come over and watch the indicator over the machine that is squeezing both the physical and mental life out of the half-dozen gentlemen that have succeeded in emptying the Hall of Congress so the average business is being transacted with about thirty gentlemen present. Count them now!</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"And to my mind the indicator is pointing out that one hundred times a day for one gentleman, no matter what his attainments, is too much of a physical or mental strain, both for the gentleman who is to be under the terrific pressure and also for the four hundred-odd gentlemen who have to watch him to the point of breaking of failure. And let us be fair with one another. What would happen to a manager if he was running the biggest and best show on earth if he would send his star performer out to address the audience 118 times in a single evening? His show would 'bust,' that is all. (Laughter)</p>
   <p>"When all other means have failed to drive the members away from the debates and back to the House office building, the following may be tried succesfully, and was tried the other day: A gentleman, not of the select few, had the audacity to attempt to participate in the debate and he was squelched by one of the select gentlemen in this manner: 'Has not the gentleman illustrated the fact that a little learning is sometimes a very dangerous thing?'</p>
   <p>"In other words, a colleague on the floor is willing to hold up a brother <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>member as ignorant in order to take the pep and grit out of him and thus prevent him from ever coming back; and the gentleman who used the floor over a hundred times in a single day rises and objects to another member having a few minutes of the House's time.</p>
   <p>"Verily, advertising is a good thing; and verily, verily, I say unto you that he who bloweth not his own horn, his horn, it shall be bloweth. But is there not such a thing as blowing a horn a little too often? (Laughter.)</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen, I want to say this: I have come on this floor and I have meant to participate. I have meant to work, I never was a shirker. I was the chairman on the judiciary in the senate of my state for a number of years, and I worked night and day; but I tell you it is mighty humiliating and awfully hard for all the new people to come in and be sat on and made to feel they are not wanted. I do not mean to say that is the intention of anybody to make any gentleman walk out of the hall with that feeling in his heart; but I want to tell you that I have done it time and time again when I have seen the younger members <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>stand up here only to have somebody sit on them because the older members knew the ins and outs of business and the younger ones did not. I want to conclude by saying that you gentlemen who sit here and transact business every day are putting an entirely wrong gauge on the other fellows by thinking they are ignorant because they are silent." (Applause.)</p>
   <p>Mr. Leva: "Mr. Chairman, I regret very much that the gentlemen to whom the speech seems to appeal are not present, but I hope they will read it in the Record tomorrow."</p>
   <p>Mr. Juul: "I want to say to the gentleman that I have not mentioned any names. I wanted particularly to refrain from doing so."</p>
