   <p>The results are encouraging to the Socialist leaders as the reduction in the numbers of Socialistic votes was far less than either of the old parties. It was, however, a day of capitalistic victory. Republicans and Democrats, in brotherly unselfishness, shared the jobs, the power and the glory. The old ring of "boodlers," elite and rough-neck alike, still control the City Council, and we have but to be patient a few days and we will observe the slicing of the "melon of special privilege."</p>

   <p>Chicago, right now, needs, more than anything else, a few Socialists in the City Council. The presence of these active citizens would nip such city budget raids in the bud and help make Chicago safe for worker and taxpayer.</p>
   <p>Your vote, on Tuesday, for Socialist candidates will be the best indication of your personal desire for a clean and honest city administration.</p>
