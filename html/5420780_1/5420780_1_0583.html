   <p>The Socialist party held its convention last week and nominated George Koop, a well-known member of the printers' union, as a candidate for mayor in the election next spring.</p>
   <p>The platform agreed upon adheres to the principles of International Socialism, pointing out that the workers can never expect nor depend on the capitalistic parties to improve their conditions.</p>
   <p>The platform demands an 8 hour working day on all public works; thorough inspection of factories and workshops; public work for the unemployed; establishment of municipal coalyards, refrigerating plants, bakeries and packing plants; expansion of the public parks in Chicago; democratically elected Board of Directors for our public schools as well as demand for initiative and referendum and the right to impeach and expel duly elected officers if they prove unworthy of public trust.</p>
