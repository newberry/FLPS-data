   <p>The County Commissioners have appointed Louis Pio as County architect and head of the County Hospital.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pio was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. His background is rather varied. He was appointed second Lieutenant in the Danish Army in 1864, he afterwards became a teacher, and later a journalist. He came to America in the seventies. We feel that Mr. Pio is far from qualified for these posts. He is not a Doctor nor is he an architect. We think that the county has again given its "favors" in the wrong quarters. We may just as well appoint a barber to design battleships, or tailor as a Civil Engineer.</p>
   <p>We give Mr. Pio just one month before he gets his dismissal slip.</p>
