   <p>In an article in Revyen the editor writes that the paper is interested in Socialism, but that it does not want to join any specific socialistic party.</p>
   <p>The paper does not like the Republican party, which it regards as a merely capitalistic party. In 1896 the paper supported the Democrats because it thought that this party would help the workingmen, but the last four years have shown that really there is no difference between the two major parties in American politics; they both stand for the capitalism.</p>
   <p>The paper is for reform and it fully understands that much has to happen and many years will pass before the laboring class will get the majority of votes in United States. The paper wants to work for the economic independence of the common people, and any reform that will bring us nearer this goal has the full support of Revyen.</p>
