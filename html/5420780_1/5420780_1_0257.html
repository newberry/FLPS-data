   <p>p.2.....The great number of strikes declared during the last couple of years, indicates a steadily growing dissatisfaction among the workers of the country. New trade unions are being organized daily, and almost as soon as a trade is organized, a strike is declared for higher pay and shorter hours.</p>
   <p>No wonder that the dissatisfaction grows. The U.S. census for 1900 shows that, when using the newest and best machines, the value of the workers daily production is $10.00, out of which he receives on the average of $1.37. The attempt to get some of the $8.63 which now go into the pockets of the non-producing classes, will not succeed as long as the tools for production and the finished products belong to the capitalist class. Experience shows that as soon as organized labor, by means of a strike, obtains higher pay, the price of living increases proportionally more than the wages, and in many cases the worker is worse off than before.</p>

   <p>While the organization of labor into unions is in itself no solution of the economic problem, it certainly may be considered the first step towards the emancipation of the working class. The thousands of new recruits, which annually enroll in the army of organized labor, receive a beneficial understanding of discipline and come to realize that united action of the working class is imperative in its dealings with the employers.</p>
