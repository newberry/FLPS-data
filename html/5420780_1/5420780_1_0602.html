   <p>p.2.........This year the United States' Navy is costing the country $70,000,000.00, and for the next year, Secretary Moody is going to demand, and undoubtedly get, $100,000,000.00.</p>
   <p>This is a great deal of money to literally throw into the sea, and to spend for instruments of murder and for unproductive and inhuman purposes.</p>
   <p>Consider for a momemt what could be accomplished with such a sum of money, if it were spent yearly for the benefit of sick and worn-out old people, or for feeding and educating poor and neglected children, and turning them into useful and self-respecting citizens. To do so would be human. Militarism is inhuman.</p>
