   <p>The capitalists' delight over the apparent defeat of the socialists in Germany did not last long. In fact the tremendous progress they have made in Finland was a virtual blow to the triumphants, not to mention what success they have had in Russia and lately in Austria. Whether they like it or not the capitalists have to reckon with such evidence of vitality on the part of the socialistic movement. They cannot deny that it is progressing all over the civilized world. Says the Evening Mail of New York: "It is the worst of folly for defenders of conservatism and individualism throughout the world to blind themselves to the steady advance of the ever increasing strength of the socialist movement in every country. The Austrian election is merely the latest warning of a peril common to the nations. The assault upon property rights, religion and the family comes earlier in Europe than in America. But sooner or later it will be our turn to face it."</p>
   
   <p>Sooner or later also it will be "our"job that is: The defenders of capitalism to meet the socialists on the battle-ground of realities. The outworn phrases about annihilation of property rights, religion and the family life will soon cease to have effect. The kind of property rights that permit an upper class to prey on labor is objectionable in the opinion of the socialists and should be abolished for the benefit of the state in order to permit the existence of actual property rights, and to provide an opportunity for everybody to acquire property as long as he is willing and able to work for it. But to proclaim that this will interfere with a man's religious views and family life is plain nonsense.In all fairness we hold that a man shall be entitled to the fruits of his labor instead of being compelled to hand most of it over to a parasitical upper class who produce nothing themselves.</p>
   <p>If the defenders of capitalism would be successful in their attempts to stem the tide of socialism they will have to employ other means than their bargain phrases because these are too silly to throw at people who are able to think and figure.</p>
