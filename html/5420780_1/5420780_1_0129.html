   <p>Mr. M. Salamonsen [a Dane], clerk of the marriage bureau, was very much offended yesterday when Frank Lee, a Chinese, and Jennie Ericksen, a Swedish girl, applied for a license. Mr. Salamonsen does not like the idea of Scandinavian girls marrying Chinese. Jennie lives at 821 Dania Avenue.</p>
