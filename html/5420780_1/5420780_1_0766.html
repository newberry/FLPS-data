   <p>State Representative Christian Madsen says the following regarding the defeating of the Chicago Home Rule Bill:</p>
   <p>"As the session of the State Legislature is nearing adjournment it becomes more and more apparent that very few, if any, measures for the benefit of the working people of this State will be enacted into laws.</p>
   <p>Practically every labor measure that might have had a fighting chance of passing in the Senate has been defeated in the House, and it seems reasonably certain that the few measures that may pass in the House will be defeated in the Senate.</p>
   <p>There was never a more striking example of the utter disregard for the welfare of the workers by legislative bodies, elected presumably to represent these same workers, than that furnished by the Forty-Ninth General Assembly of the Senate of Illinois.</p>
