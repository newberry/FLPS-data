   <p>Our new Secretary of the Interior, Walter L. Fisher of Chicago, fits perfectly into the general pattern. He is as changeable as a chameleon, and slippery as an eel; one can never determine where he stands nor for how long. There is only one point on which we can be absolutely sure; he will always be found at the spot where the richest crumbs fall from the capitalistic table.</p>
