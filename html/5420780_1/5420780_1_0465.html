   <p>p.2.col.1........Socialists and liberal groups in France are working for the establishment of an income tax. Needless to state,Capital is fighting this proposal, tooth and nail. The capitalistic reacting force, in order to avoid this catastrophy points out the fact that, in the United States, the enactment of an income tax law was prevented by the Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>The open-minded French, however, will hardly permit the example set by the U.S. Supreme Court to influence their action in so important a piece of legislation. Instead they will take into consideration the weak-kneed action of a national legislative body whose makeup does not include one solitary Socialist nor any other representative of the laboring class.</p>

   <p>We salute France, a true democracy, where the power to make the laws and the power to enforce them are nested in the people who are to live under the enacted laws. In France real democracy is in power and God help the miserable judge who may be caught tampering with laws enacted by the legally elected representatives of the people.	</p>
