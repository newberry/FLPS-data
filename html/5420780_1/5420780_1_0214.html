   <p>Why is it that those who do not produce anything are living in luxury, while those who work and create the wealth are going through life in utter poverty? Keir Hardi, the great English labor leader and member of Parliament, asked this question in his unforgetable speech last Sunday in Riverview Park, and he went on to say that this is the problem which is confronting the civilized world today. It is not a question of how to produce wealth, we are doing that, but rather of how to justly distribute this wealth.</p>
   <p>The famous champion of labor hit the nail on the head. This is the center around which all social problems and also the current political campaigns revolve. When all is said and done, and in spite of all empty catch-phrases, the chief aim of the capitalistic parties, the Republicans, Democrats and Progressives alike, is to preserve and "improve" our present economic system, under which those who do the work but do not own anything, receive an insignificant share of the wealth they produce, while those who already have too <span class="page-break">\2</span>much take practically all.</p>
   <p>The aim of the Socialist party is to secure for the workers, all the products of their labor, so that there will be no place in society for a parasitic luxury-class, for, according to the Bible, "he who will not work, shall not eat."</p>
   <p>This is the issue between the Social-Democratic and the three capitalistic parties.</p>
