   <p>p.2....La Follette and his insurgents seem to be repeating the Bryan incident, with the difference that this time the movement originates in the Republican party.</p>
   <p>La Follette, like Bryan,does not propound any real radical idea or policy, only noisy and empty demagogue claims for reforms, which either coincide with the capitalistic interests, or serve as bait for these voters of the old parties whose patience is about to break.</p>
   <p>La Follette, no more than Bryan or Hearst, will be able to mislead the socialists. The latter party is very active and influential in Wisconsin, the home of La Follette and his insurgent movement. To start with, he may <span class="page-break">2</span>possibly attract a few of those who would otherwise have joined the socialist ranks, but they will eventually desert him, when he has gone the way of Bryan, Hearst, Roosevelt, etc., when he has been put on the scale and deemed too light as a political prophet and saviour.</p>
