   <p>p. 2. President Taft is now proclaiming new accusations against the steel trust of violating the Sherman antitrust law; the result will of course be nil, as was the case with Roosevelt's efforts in the same direction.</p>
   <p>Far be it from Taft and his administration to threaten and inconvenience the mighty financial barons of the steel trust. Most likely they themselves are behind this action because they desire a general slump in the stock market making it possible for them to buy cheap and later "clean up. It is a well-known fact financiers by means of such artificially created "slumps have pocketed millions.</p>
   <p>But simultaneously with this trick in financial juggling comes the news from Milwaukee that Victor L. Berger during the next session of the Congress is going to introduce a resolution proposing that the obsolete antitrust law be invalidated and new legislation formulated according to which any combination controlling more than 60 per cent of the production of any industry shall be taken over by the government at its actual cash value, and operated "for the <span class="page-break">2</span>benefit of all the people."</p>
   <p>This is good sense, and the only logical solution of the trust problem. Let the nation own the trusts!</p>
