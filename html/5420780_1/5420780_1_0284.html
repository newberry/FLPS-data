   <p>What will Franklin D. Roosevelt do to make his memory outlast that of his cousin, "Teddy", who built the Panama Canal? Although the answer is not constructively-minded politically, "Teddy" Roosevelt, in a constructive way, succeeded in setting up for himself a lasting monument by building the Panama Canal.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, his cousin F. D., destructively inclined, already has set himself a no less lasting monument by experimenting with the N. R. A. and other New Deal tomfoolery, which have been unanimously rejected by the United States Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>Whether or not our present President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, really has any constructive ideas, or if his "reddish brain spinners" of both sexes will be given a chance to put them into effect remains to be seen.</p>
