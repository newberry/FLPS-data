   <p>(Tues. 1:5) A meeting of Danish citizens residing in the Eleventh Ward was held at 104 Milwaukee Avenue for the purpose of organizing a Republican Club. C.W.Woodman was chosen temporary chairman, and Mr. Andrew H.Smith kept the records. Messrs. Harrison, Lurrinson and Howman were elected as the executive committee. Mr. Woodman addressed a few brief remarks to the one hundred voters present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Allstross was called upon, and the chairman stated that he suspected the gentleman was an oppositionist, but if he would speak good Republican principles, he might take the floor. Mr. Allstross said he was a "Dansk," and claimed the right to say what he pleased. He started out on a first-class Scandinavian oration, but proved to be too heretical in his views, and the president began to knock the table with his knuckles in order to call the gentlemen to order. But Mr. Allstross would not be put down so easily. He insisted on saying what he had to say, then and there. Then the crowd began to take sides with one party and the other, and there seemed to be a right lively chance for a gentle row. The bar-tender came to the rescue, and after bouncing one or two of the more noisy ones, order was restored again. Mr. Allstross subsided.</p>
   <p>Mr. C.F.Periolat next took the floor, and made a few remarks about the American flag, proving himself about as successful a speechmaker as a bartender. He assured those present that he had been a Democrat until after the Republican Party came into power, and then be became a Republican. He now honestly hated the Democratic Party. It had no bottom to it.</p>
