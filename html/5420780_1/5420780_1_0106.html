   <p>President Hammerling of the American League of Foreign Language Newspapers has written a series of articles in the American Leader, in which he discusses the trend toward restrictions of personal liberty which is beginning to make itself felt in this country. He is particularly concerned about the proposed legislative action in regard to alcoholic beverages.</p>
   <p>Two proposals for Constitutional amendment will be presented to Congress in the near future. One of them prohibits the sale, manufacture, and import of alcoholic beverages other than wine and beer, the other one prohibits the sale, manufacture, and import of any beverage of alcoholic content.</p>
   <p>If one of these amendments is adopted by Congress and subsequently approved by three fourths of the states' legislatures, it will become law and thus there will be a danger that a minority of the population may be able to impose its will on the majority, since the vote of a state with a small population counts as much as that of a populous state. There are ten states the aggregate populations of which is less than that of the State of New York, and they have 10 votes as compared to New York's 1.</p>
   <p>The author urges all friends of personal liberty and enjoyment of life to organize and meet this challenge before it is too late, and we think the American people should heed this warning.</p>
