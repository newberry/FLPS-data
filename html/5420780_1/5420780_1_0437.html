   <p>p.2.col.1.... If Sam Gompers and a couple of other A.F.L. leaders are to do their promenading (in the near future) in prison, they are, clearly enough, sent there thru class intolerance, a result of capitalistic greed and terrorism. This trait of the capitalistic element is coming to the surface more arrogantly as time goes on and we must still say "When - Oh When."</p>
   <p>Socialists thoroughly understand conditions and, to a certain degree sympathize with the three sentenced labor leaders. On the other hand they feel that "Gompers &amp; Co." have "made their own beds," etc. and they are only reaping what they themselves have sown. A "bootlicker" deserves the "good kick" when it is administered. There is a bare possibility that this experience will be a lesson to the laborers so they will no longer allow themselves to be led around by the nose.</p>
