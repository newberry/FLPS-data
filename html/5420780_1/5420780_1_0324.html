   <p>That the Revyen does not stand alone in its viewpoint of social progress and the means to obtain it will be seen from the following quotation from an editorial in the Chicago Daily News:</p>
   <p>"Emile Vandervelde, the eminent Belgian Socialist statesman and author, told an international Socialist congress several months ago that he preferred the British way of obtaining social reforms to the Lenin way in Russia, or the Spartarist way in Prussia, or the Bela Kun way in Hungary. In Great Britain, he pointed out that evolution is perhaps, slower than radicals might wish, but it is steady and sure."</p>
   <p>What Mr. Vandervelde said at that time certain German and Austrian Socialist leaders, including Baur, the German premier, and Kautsky, the foremost German exponent of Marxian socialism, have been saying in interviews with an American Socialist editor, Abraham Cahan of New York. Mr. Cahan has been studying the revolutionary movement in central Europe.</p>
