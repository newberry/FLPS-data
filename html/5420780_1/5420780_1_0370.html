   <p>What was originally acclaimed as a Democratic landslide, when boiled down, is simply an increase of a few thousand votes for the Democrats, and this result was chiefly caused by the split in the Republican ranks.</p>
   <p>In spite of Wilson's large majority of electoral votes, he was elected by a minority, receiving some six million votes, as compared to roughly nine million votes cast for all the other candidates combined.</p>
   <p>Dissatisfaction with the Taft regime, the high cost of living and the Republican cleavage caused this transition of votes. There was no threat of a Wall Street panic in case of a Democratic victory; on the contrary the Wall Street Journal informed its readers that business, financial and industrial, felt no apprehension in regard to the election, and therefore was paying little attention to politics this year.</p>
   <p>Those who desired a change of administration without any fundamental change of policies could thus safely cast their vote for Wilson, and give the Democrats the same opportunity that the Republicans have had to demonstrate their incapacity for dealing with our pressing social problems.</p>
   <p>From a Socialistic point of view, the result was encouraging, indicating our party's steady progress all along the line. Complete returns are lacking, but Debs probably received close to a million votes, more than twice as many as in 1908.</p>
   <p>Otto Christensen, our candidate for Congressman from the 7th District, was a close race. The Socialist candidate for state's attorney, William Cunnea, received more than 100,000 votes, an expression of the general disgust with the newspaper trust, whose Democratic candidate was elected, however, with a majority of a few thousand votes.</p>
   <p>Four Socialists were elected State representatives from Chicago, and we are particularly pleased to see our countryman, Christian M. Madsen go to Springfield, for we know that he will command the respect of the legislature and be an honor to his party.</p>
