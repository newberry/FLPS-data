Such an injunction, and also the decision rendered in the Taff - Vale case in England, according to which a union may be held financially responsible for losses caused by a strike, certainly ought to act as an eye-opener for many workers, and make them realize that trade organizations are not a sufficient defense apparatus for the rights and demands of labor as long as the workers politically follow the instructions of the capitalists and place men like Judge Adams in administrative positions. Judge Adams is a Democrat.</p>
