   <p>Rasmus Troldahl, who not so long ago was arrested for having used for private purposes money that was paid him for steamship tickets, has again opened an office of the same kind at the old place, 169 E. Harrison Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Troldahl had no intention of fraud, he just got behind in his payments, and a couple of lawyers wanted to get hold of the money left and his business. But two fine lawyers, Patrick O'Donnell and Johan Waage, got him out of all the trouble and helped him to start out anew.</p>
