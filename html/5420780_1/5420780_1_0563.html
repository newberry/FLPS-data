   <p>President Roosevelt's uncalled for condemnation of the two labor leaders held in Idaho on a criminal charge (but not convicted) has caused so much indignation that the President himself found it appropriate to come forward with an explanation which, by the way, did anything but justify his statement. On the contrary, it shows that the President is not only apt to commit a terrible blunder in a moment of anger but that he also is too stubborn, cowardly and dishonest to admit his mistakes, and therefore attempts to worm away from the incident by means of eccentric arguments and false statements, all in order to save his face.</p>
   <p>By arguing that the workers all over the country have taken sides with the accused men, he tries to hide his own mistake of joining their accusers. We would think that the workers of America, who sincerely believe in the innocence of their unfortunate trusted agents, should be free to make use of all legitimate means in order to save their comrades from the gallows <span class="page-break">2</span>on which they most likely <span class="gap">[gap]</span> irrespective of built or evidence, had act public opinion and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> be their rescue.</p>
   <p>The President did not mean to accuse the two men and declare them guilty of the crime, say he, but <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, "undesirable citizens," just the same. Why these <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the rest of an the President does <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and for good reasons, because Moyer and Haywood law pet be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of any ill gitimate action. But the fact that the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> authorities in Colorado have committed crimes and a still <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, that would but even the tyr any of the Russian <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, has <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in court and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by the President's own commisioner, Carroll, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is assigned to the case. The kidnapping of Moyer and Haywood was but the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of a tyranny long in existence about which even a Justice of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> spoke in words not to be mistaken.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Roosevelt  does not find anything "undesirable" about the capitalistic tyrants roaming the hills and plains of Idaho and Colorado and terrorizing the <span class="page-break">3</span>working class. They are of his kind and by is their faithful servant, which he has proved by his attitude in this case better than ever. But this very attitude on the part of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ent did also serve to open the eyes of the workers. The case, originally scheduled for the purpose of crushing the Western Federation of Miners, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> served to raise and strengthen the brotherly feeling among the workers of the nation in a most excellent way, and might turn out to be a bad boomerang for the capitalistic bosses and their hirelings throughout the country.</p>
