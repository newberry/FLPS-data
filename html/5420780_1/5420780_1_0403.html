   <p>p. 2.. The election last Tuesday shows that while the great majority of voters are still vacillating between the two capitalistic parties, the Socialistic movement is gaining in many of the medium sized cities; in some of them the progress is amazing.</p>
   <p>Schenectady, New York, with a population of 40,000, and a score of other cities of varying size in Ohio, Utah and other states have "gone socialistic." America has never witnessed such a socialistic "landslide," and the capitalistic apprehension and rage is as easy to understand as is the joy, hope, and inspiration within our own camp.</p>
   <p>If the Socialists give all those cities, in which they have been victorious, the same sensible, courageous administration that they have given Milwaukee, we do not have to worry about the future of the Socialistic movement in America.</p>
