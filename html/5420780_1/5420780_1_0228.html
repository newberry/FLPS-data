   <p>William Gerner has organized a new concern dealing in pianos, under the name of William Gerner &amp; Son, with sales and show rooms at 2355 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The firm is handling the products of old and well-established manufacturers only, and is also planning to enter the manufacturing field. As a beginning it has acquired the rights to manufacture the Grieg piano, which is now enjoying a great sale.</p>
   <p>Scandinavians, in particular, to whom Mr. Gerner's name sounds as good as his pianos, will welcome this establishment on the Northwest Side.</p>
