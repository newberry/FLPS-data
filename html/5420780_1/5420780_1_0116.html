   <p>The social given by the Broderbaandet at Harmony Hall, Saturday evening, was a great success. The program was scheduled to begin at nine o'clock, but was delayed because some of those who were to assist arrived late. Fortunately, however, the president of the Harmonien (Harmony) Singing Society, an energetic worker for temperance, Mr. Hans Larsen, was present together with the well-known temperance lady, Mrs. Ulrikka Feltman Brun.</p>
   <p>Both of these temperance soldiers were willing to speak at the meeting, and the program started. One by one those who were to take part in the program arrived. Dr. O. Z. A. Hanish arrived later in the evening. The result was a program of unusual interest, consisting of music, singing, speeches, and declamations.</p>
