   <p>We take no stand in the fight between Capital and Labor. We receive paid advertisements from capitalists, but at the same time, we receive articles from our correspondents on labor issues without receiving money for this service. We are the Danish colony's paper, and because the Danish colony has both workers and employers, it is not our policy to take sides. Our columns are open to both parties, because honest discussion may sometimes bring understanding between two opposing camps; we will continue to keep our paper open to both factions.</p>
   <p>In the coming political campaign, we will at no time take a stand for either side, but this will not hinder us from supporting the cause of the Danes or Scandinavians who run for office. This is our duty. We stand for Scandinavianism, whether it be Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish. The more good men we can elect to office, the greater will be the prestige of the Scandinavian people.</p>
   <p>The Americans do not differentiate between the three Scandinavian nations. To them, we are just Scandinavians, nothing else, and the more public offices we can fill with Scandinavians, the more respect will be had for us.</p>
   <p>It can be seen by our program that our main issue is to fight for unity in the three Scandinavian colonies, and to help our countrymen to gain as many public offices as possible, if they are worthy.</p>
   <p>In party politics and labor trouble, it is not our policy to take issue. This would be against the interest of the Danish colony.</p>
