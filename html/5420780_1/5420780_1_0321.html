   <p>After fourteen long years of unjustly inflicted suffering for Tom J. Mooney and Warren K. Billings, it look as though Nemesis, the goddess of retributive justice, has invaded the state of California in order to vindicate them of a crime that no one, not even all the men who put them behind the bars, believed them guilty of.</p>
   <p>Many different times their names have been chief subject among the class which they represented, and for which they have been doomed to suffer fourteen years. Yet that class, representing fully ninety-five per cent of the entire population of this country, have proved to the world their lack of temerity by not demanding that justice be done.</p>
   <p>When Mooney and Billings were first convicted, they were sentenced to be hanged, and only a last minute reprieve by the late President Wilson saved them from a fate which has befallen many workers who have had the courage to form an opinion above a whisper.</p>
   <p>It has been stated in our constitution that no man is a felon until he is proved guilty. It therefore became necessary to find someone who could testify that Mooney and Billings were the men responsible for the bomb outrage that destroyed so many lives. Such a degenerate was found in the person of John MacDonald, who, in his attempt to gain a few paltry dollars, turned Judas twice, thus sending two innocent men to their doom.</p>
   <p>In the Bible, Judas, after having received his filthy thirty pieces of silver, regretted his act, and committed hari-kari. John MacDonald had neither such courage nor the slightest intention of doing any harm to himself, and only after fourteen years, since he has become a decrepit old man with an evertortured conscience, does he appear on the scene and admit that he committed the perjury which sent two innocent men whom he did not know to a felon's cell for life.</p>
   <p>There are many, many others involved in this contemptible case, whose actions are even blacker than that of John MacDonald, but let us stop with the latter, and thus save what can be saved of American Justice.</p>
