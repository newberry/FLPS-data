   <p>The systematic fraud which was organized last year in order to secure the election of the Democrat Maclay Hoyne as State's attorney, and to which Revyen repeatedly called attention, is now beginning to cause alarm in official political circles, and even within the capitalistic press.</p>
   <p>The official recount of the ballots, which has just been completed, reduces Hoyne's original majority by 5,000 votes, and increases the number of ballots cast for the socialistic candidate, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Cunnea, by 4,000. About 2,000 ballots are doubtful, and it has furthermore been discovered that in a number of precincts more votes have been cast than there are qualified voters, while in others there are fewer ballots than there should be, according to the official list. Hoyne was originally given majority of a little more than 14,000, and it may therefore be assumed that if the election had been properly conducted he would have been defeated by Cunnea.</p>

   <p>It should not be difficult to find and expose those that are responsible for this election swindle; but we don't expect that any effort will be made to that effect. It is now being proposed to have Hoyne himself make an investigation of the case, and if he does, one can easily guess the result.</p>
