   <p>We quote the endorsement of the Illinois State Federation of Labor:</p>
   <p>"Madsen is on the job morning, noon, and night. He instinctively knows labor's need, and just as certain as you vote to return him just as certain you can be that your trust will not be betrayed.</p>
   <p>"He has proved himself to be a staunch defender of public rights and has made a splendid record that will stand the closest scrutiny.</p>
   <p>"During his term of office he has been a conscientious student of legislative affairs and few men in the State Legislature are better informed on matters that come before that body for consideration.</p>
   <p>"Regardless of party Mr. Madsen should be supported by all the voters in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Twenty-third District. You can depend upon him to support legislation that has merit and that is in the interest of good government in Illinois."</p>
