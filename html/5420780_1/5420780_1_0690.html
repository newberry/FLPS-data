   <p>We are rather surprised to see how the Socialists and Communists talk and criticize the government of Chicago in general. They are always attacking the Relief and Aid Societies with the same complaint, that the donations to the needy people are insufficient and are not of much benefit. They made up their minds at a big mass meeting, that the office holders of the Society should be discharged and the Socialists and Communists run the Relief office. At present the leaders of the relief are dishonest, as we all can see, the whole affair is Red. Nothing came of it. Last Thursday a mass of people were outside the Relief Station, mostly Communists, but there was no battle.</p>
