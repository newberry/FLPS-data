   <p>p.2.col.1...........With reference to the recent sentence meted out to Gompers Mitchell and Morrison we find this headline in a Danish paper. "How a Socialistic Blockade is Punished in America." In the old country it is hard to conceive of a labor movement that is not socialistic. In the U.S.A. 'however'it is sadly different.</p>
   <p>Saul Gompers and his followers are anything but Socialists; on the contrary, they are anti-Socialist in the fullest sense of the word. Their faith in the blessings of capitalism is as firm as Gibralter, and there seems to be no hope that even the judgment recently passed will in any way change their attitudes toward capitalism.</p>
   <p>The old saying, "The worm will turn," will never prove true in the case of Gompers and those, among his followers, in high command. How long this will prove true of the rank and file of his followers only time will reveal. If present conditions in labor circles are to continue, freedom and justice for the working man will become a thing of the past.</p>
