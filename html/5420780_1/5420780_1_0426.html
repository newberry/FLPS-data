   <p>p.2.col.2........."Who is Putting Up"? asks the "Tribune" in reference to the extensive propaganda furnished by no less than eight candidates, for the mayoralty, within the two big parties. It is both langhable and disgusting to have such a question from the paper that above all others is stuped in graft and hypocricy; the paper that was "smart" enough (undoubtedly added by bribary) to secure for itself tenacies that are annually(literally) stealing a small fortune from the school children of Chicago. The "Tribune" through the experience of its own example is thoroughly qualified to detect and demand explanation of grafters in general. Truth and frankness do occasionally slip into Tribune statements too as in comments about the campaign of the Socialistic candidate for mayor. The Tribune says "we all know that sweat and blood furnish campaign funds with which his party (Socialists) fight its battles."</p>
   <p>We know also, just as positively, that regardless of whether the opposing candidate be Republican or Democratic, it is Capitalism that is "putting up" for each and every one of them.</p>
