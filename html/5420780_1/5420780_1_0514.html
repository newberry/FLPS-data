   <p>Three or four big concerns that have a virtual come only on the distribution of coal in Chicago are now conspiring to leave the small distributors a still smaller margin of profit and raise the price to the consumers still higher.</p>

If, in addition, the coal mines and transportation facilities were confiscated and henceforth owned and operated by and for the benefit of the public, thus eliminating capitalistic profit in these lines also, the price on coal would be about one fourth of what it is at present.</p>
