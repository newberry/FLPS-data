   <p>Last Wednesday, Dr. P. C. Clemensen, the well-known Danish physician on the South Side, was appointed to the Board of Education by Mayor Harrison.</p>
   <p>Dr. Clemensen came from Denmark with his parents while he was a boy, he obtained his medical education here, and now enjoys a large practice on the South Side, where his home and office are located at Evans Avenue and 62nd Street.</p>
   <p>While a Norwegian has been on the Board of Education for a long time, Doctor Clemensen is the first Dane to be so honored.</p>
   <p>Sometime ago, Dr. M. Henius, was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Chicago Public Library, and these two appointments are pleasing signs of the prestige which our group enjoys among Chicago's leaders.</p>
