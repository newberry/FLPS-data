Harrison for Mayor must be a bitter pill for the thousands who, at the primaries, voted for the honest and upright Mr. Dunne, as the direct opposite of Harrison. Now we wonder - will these same thousands suffer themselves to be "delivered" and blindly vote as the party orders or will they have learned to shun the suffocating web of humbug and hypocris that is so characteristic of policies and tactics of both capitalistic parties?</p>
