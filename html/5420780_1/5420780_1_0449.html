Capitalists would probably breathe more easily, for a while at least, if a number of thousands of hungry laborers could be turned into cannon fodder and valuable property destroyed.</p>
   <p>There was a time, not so long ago, that such a catastrophy could be brought about at will. Now, however, the masses have learned better that to allow their hunger and suffering to be converted into a hysteria for war and destruction. They can no longer be stampeded into taking up arms against their fellow men in a strange land, who are, in all probability,suffering unemployment and hunger also.</p>

This clean-up will have to be accomplished by ballots, not by bullets.</p>
