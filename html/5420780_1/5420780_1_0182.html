   <p>The paper has a new writer, Mr. Jean Figaro, who writes the weekly column: Gennem Lorgnetten (Through my glasses). He finds that there are five kinds of Danes in America: 1. Danish-Danes; 2. Danish-Americans; 3. The Cosmopolitans; 4. The monkeys; 5. The common mortals.</p>
   <p>The Danish Danes always wear a pin from a Danish society in their button hole; the Danish colors are on the wall of their homes and also a picture of king Christian IX or Frederik VII. Most of them also have a picture of both Peter Noer and Viggo Danielson in full regalia. Over the lady's writing table you will generally find a picture of the Danish Old Peoples Home.</p>
   <p>The Danish Americans are the politicians or would-be-politicians. They are well dressed and wear glasses, their homes are without style. And they never read Danish papers except during election times.</p>
