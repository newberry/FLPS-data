That this announcement has created neither surprise nor indignation is due to the general knowledge that he is neither better nor worse than his predecessors in both democratic and republican camps. The one exception is former mayor Dunne, whose administration was a perfect fiasco, an absolute proof that the more honest and well-meaning a man elected by either of the big parties may be, the more impossible and helpless he is as mayor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Party offers the only solution, the only way out of the political muddle and graft of the capitalistic system, as it has been convincingly demonstrated at Milwaukee, Wis.</p>
