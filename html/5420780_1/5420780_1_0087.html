   <p>The Board of Education is conducting thirty-three public evening schools in various parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Instruction is given in English and elementary school subjects, as well as in handicraft and cooking, and it is free.</p>
   <p>We particularly recommend these schools to Danish newcomers as good places in which to learn English.</p>
