   <p>In the August issue of Smuler (Tidbits), edited by Herman Wang, we read the following:</p>
   <p>"A Socialist writes that, once socialism is established, class struggle will have come to an end. But don't you think there will be at least two classes under socialist rule as well? There will be the ambitious, who want to work, and the lazy, who do not want to work. How are the former going to make the latter do their duty? I mean, not merely apparently, but in reality. Because you can be reasonably sure there will be smart people under socialist rule also. It has been said that socialism will eliminate the incentive for stealing; but what about the time thieves?"</p>
   <p>A writer who, in efforts to defend the old time let-it-go-as-it-is philosophy, voices that kind of objection, is not far from being unduly comical or, may be rather tragicomical, like children and old women seeing ghost in broad daylight.</p>
   <p>The fear of laziness under a socialist system, we suspect, is a result <span class="page-break">2</span>of the acknowledgement that a lot of people are trying to avoid their duties as workers under the old system. The question is therefore: will that tendency be aggravated under socialism or will it be effectively curbed?</p>
   <p>The writer himself, we hope, is willing to admit that conditions are far from ideal right now. We have not alone a lot of people who do not want to do any work; we have a number of people who are not allowed to work, people suffering from the effects of seasonal unemployment and having no greater desire than that of being allowed to work. The latter kind would be more than happy for the better paid and less tedious work available under a system of socialism; while a large army of strike-breakers, employed in order to maintain a low wage standard, is a virtual necessity for the preservation of capitalism.</p>
   <p>Maybe also the majority of those who are apparently too lazy to work, and therefore try to keep the wolf from the door by turning to crime, would return to honest employment if such was offered them under more <span class="page-break">3</span>humane conditions than those prevailing under the system of exploitation which threw them on the human junk heap. There would be less excuse for their actions and ways, and therefore they would arouse less sympathy. Moreover, a Socialist government is likely to do more in the way of reforming them, if necessary, by means of a reasonable degree of compulsion, in order to make them useful citizens. Most likely there would be but a few recruits to join their ranks, and their "race" would therefore vanish from the surface of the earth sooner or later.</p>
   <p>Another group, the parasites who live in luxury, avoiding work of any kind from cradle to grave, will be eliminated completely under a socialist system and will have to look for other means of support. Why does not the writer mention these loafers of both sexes, whose luxury and debauchery cost the country more than do all the poor devils and criminals combined?</p>
   <p>Together with the capitalist aristocracy goes an army of servants and people who thrive on the falsehood of capitalism and who are, in effect, also loafers and thieves of time. All these would have an opportunity for useful employment under a well organized socialist system.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The final adjustment of these conditions will be made when the time is ripe for socialism's principles of equality and justice to be carried out in practice. It is absurd to believe that a system based on these principles should be more attractive for permanent loafers than the one we have, or that the incentive to work should disappear in the face of a prospect for the full benefit of labor. It is no more likely to happen than it is for one wheel on a two-wheeled wagon in forward motion to turn the other way.</p>
