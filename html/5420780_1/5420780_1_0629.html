   <p>Peter Thornum was not nominated for alderman of the Fifteenth Ward (formerly the Fourteenth). The Irishmen in control of the City Hall preferred a Jewish saloonkeeper.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party of the same ward nominated for alderman a well-known Dane, Lauritz Olesen, who for many years has worked hard for Socialism on the West Side. There are many Danish votes in the Fifteenth Ward, which is one of the strongest Socialist wards in Chicago. This ward gave six hundred votes to Debs at the last national election. But without the co-operation of another party Lauritz Olesen has not a chance of being elected.</p>
