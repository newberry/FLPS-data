   <p>Governor Tanner has just re-organized the West Side Park Board. Anton Pedersen, a Norwegian, was dropped as Park Commissioner, and James Jensen, a Dane, was fired as the superintendent of Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>Carter Harrison has kicked almost all Scandinavians out of the service of the City of Chicago, and now it looks as if Governor Tanner were going to do the same to the Scandinavians in the service of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>James Jensen has been superintendent of Humboldt Park for six years, and is everywhere recognized as an authority on flowers and landscaping.</p>
   <p>This is an insult to the Danish colony around Humboldt Park.</p>
