   <p>Denmark! There is in the nature of her people, underlying their fine subtleties and modern dash and style of living, an undeparted trace of the virility of a long-gone Viking breed, with its direct and simple human approaches. I sense this as if the olden frank, stark vitality of those uncomplicated beginnings resided still very close under the surface gloss of present civilized conditions.</p>
   <p>Thus, a sudden contact of thought or glance of eye often as not brings response from the Scandinavian of today, a response, like a dream understood clear, open, intuitive; unspoiled by the "beating about the bush" that taints the intercourse of the bulk of humankind. I find in my Danish friends an undecadent taking for granted of one's own franknesses. This links them in my mind with their elemental prototype which had developed in a region of stern requirements toward utmost utility and economy in human relations.</p>
