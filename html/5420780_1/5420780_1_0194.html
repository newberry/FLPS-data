   <p>Some time ago an article, "A word to the Republican Politicians," appeared in Skandinaven. In answer to this very able (?) analysis of the situation, we want to say that all Scandinavians are not Republicans. Because the Skandinaven is Republican and Conservative does not prove that every one else is of the same opinion.</p>
   <p>There are hundreds of Democrats, hundreds of Socialists, and many, many hundreds of Radicals among the Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The Danes object to being classed as Republicans, because the majority of them are Democrats and Socialists. This is only natural because Denmark is much more to the left politically than Norway.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven calls itself a Scandinavian paper, but it is not. First, it is a paper that is one hundred per cent Norwegian, and secondly, it prints more news about the Irish, Germans, and the Poles than about the Swedes and Danes.</p>
   <p>In closing, let us remind you that all Scandinavians are not Republicans.</p>
