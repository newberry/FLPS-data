   <p>A sergeant of the division of U.S. army now operating on the Philippine Islands has been unfortunate enough to kill big superior, a lieutenant, and consequently the killer had to pay with his life. Our patriotic daily papers point to the fact that the sergeant is the first "slayer" in the U. S. army in the Philippine Islands.</p>
   <p>When they are killing thousands of natives for no other reason than that the latter try to stick to the fight principle of patriotism, namely, to resist invasion, our soldiers are not regarded as slayers, at least,not in the opinion of the capitalists; if it serves their purpose the government, sanctioned by respectable citizens and blessed by the church, is privileged to murder to its heart's content.</p>
   <p>In the name of humanity, the Socialists, register their protest, demanding justice and peace for all, regardless of race, color on location.</p>
