   <p>P.2.....In his first announcement the new pope enphasizes "the people's obedience to their rulers, who derive their power directly from God." How long is the papal church going to offer its adherents this kind of worn out phrases, which may have been swallowed hundreds of years ago, but are entirely out of place today. In our enlightened times and under our democratic institutions the "rulers" should be the servants of the people, who elect them.</p>
