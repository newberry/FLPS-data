   <p>p.4......It happened during the World War. The Jacob Riis League worked hard for the Liberty Loan. A large meeting was planned in West Pullman, but nobody wanted to take the responsibility of conducting the meeting without being assured that the "Governor" would come and speak. I promised to contact him, which I did the same evening, and explained the situation. The "Governor's" answer came quickly.</p>
   <p>"I am going to St. Louis on Saturday; Omaha on Monday; from there to New York and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> be back in Chicago next Saturday morning, Call the meeting!"</p>
   <p>Together on Saturday, we drove the long way out to West Pullman, where a brilliant meeting greeted us. The "Governor" spoke, and "Liberty Loan" subscriptions flowed in. He,himself,subscribed for a large amount, as he did wherever he went.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Altogether $25,000 was subscribed. Late that night we drove back north and when he left me, I received a hand-clasp which almost electrified me. That hand-clasp and the energy which radiated from his eyes I shall never forget, and the effects were noticeable in my work long after the cessation of hostilities.</p>
