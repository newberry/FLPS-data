   <p>We hear so seldom about our Danish Colleges in the Danish-American press. Why? Is it because the press does not understand that our schools keep up the Danish language.</p>
   <p>The Danish schools have followed wherever there was Danish emigration, farther and farther to the West. First there was the college in Ashland, Michigan, where Kristian Baun did wonderful work in spreading the idea of Danish people's colleges. Next came Elkhorn, Iowa, and Tyler, Minnesota.</p>

   <p>The next outstanding college was in Nysted, Nebraska, where Reverend Barbjerg was the founder and builder, and lastly, Solvang in California. Following these came several high schools of an advanced type: in Blair, Nebraska, and Grand View, in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
   <p>We want to fight for the continuation of these schools and colleges. It makes no difference to which church organization these educational institutions belong; they must continue.</p>
