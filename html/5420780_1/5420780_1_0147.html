True, but where there is hope, there also follows disappointment and when disappointment outweighs man's hope, then disillusion takes hold, and eventually, a death far worse than the physical end of life, death of the spirit.</p>
   <p>Soviet Russia, which has gained the distinction of being the black sheep among nations, is reported to be suffering from internal strife and perpetual <span class="page-break">\2</span>chaos of one sort or another. But we must not forget that these invectives are hurled by the strictly anti-Soviet press, and therefore must be taken with more than a grain of salt. The fact remains that Russia is still able to function and carry on her great program. Certainly that is proof enough.</p>
   <p>News comes to us that a California legionnaire strongly resents the entrance of Mr. Albert Einstein into the United States. He bases his complaint on the mere fact that the great scientist happens to be a pacifist, and what is worse, dared to air his ideas on peace, upon landing. Taking for granted that this legionnaire knows but very little of the world, and nothing at all about life in the aggregate, any thinking person cannot but help feeling sympathy rather than contempt for him, the poor sap.</p>
