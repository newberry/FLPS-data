   <p>New York public schools have hired 20 dentists to take care of the children's teeth, much to the annoyance of the Chicago Chronicle, Banker Walsh's paper, in which the following ironic statement appeared:</p>
   <p>"If this is wise there does not appear to be any good reason why other free services should not be furnished. Tailors might go around and mend their clothes. Cobblers might call and repair their shoes. Manicurists might look after their finger nails. Barbers ought to be there to trim their hair. Physicians might drop in and administer quinine or a purgative. All these things are just as proper as dental work."</p>
   <p>Yes why not? Why shouldn't the kids have all these things and more in addition? We would think regular daily meals for every one would be at least as important as shoes and clothes, and free transportation to and <span class="page-break">\2</span>from school should not be despised either. And perhaps it would be advisable also to have a Children's Welfare Department and see to that the little ones are not being neglected in the homes. The cost of it all would be negligible compared with the vast sums of money squandered by the privileged class on comfort and pleasure.</p>
