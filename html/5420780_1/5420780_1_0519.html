   <p>Mr. Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, sharply criticises Secretary of State Taft, who seams to be favored by the Republicans as a candidate for president, after Roosevelt, provided, of course, Roosevelt himself does not have in mind to seek a third term. Gompers calls Taft "the injunction standard bearer" whose entire record, from the time he was judge in Ohio and up to date, shows him to be a fee of labor and servile to capitalism.</p>
   <p>So far so good, even though a warning warning foe as obvious a Mr. Taft may seem superfluous. It would be more necessary for Gompers to issue warnings against such false friends as Bryan and Hearst, who are as ardent defenders of capitalistic barbarism as Mr. Taft. But this does not occur to Mr. Gompers, because he belongs to the "old school" and is part and parcel of the selfsame system as are Taft, Bryan and Hearst. Despite experience and in defiance of common sense, Mr. Gompers is still foolish enough to believe that peace and harmony can be established between the exploiters and the exploited.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, there is no doubt that the rank and file of the American Federation of Labor are gradually realizing the futility and inconsequence of Mr. Gompers' policy and are turning their backs on both the outstanding foes of labor and their less outstanding self-seeking hirelings.</p>
