   <p>In one of the American papers we found a statement saying the Danes-Norwegians and Swedes as emigrants are very desirable, they are honest, industrious and willing to be American citizens very quickly. There was a time when we didn't care about politics, but we have opened our eyes and ears. We understand today that we must vote as good citizens. The Republican party was the party we liked at first, but the Scandinavians are better educated, not one sided. The Republicans have been fooling around too much, breaking promises, etc., so the Scandinavians, like the others, have changed.</p>
   <p>We are for Tilden, we don't care if he only weighs 120 lbs. and is unmarried, we will vote for the best man, and may he always win.</p>
