   <p>"Water is the best drink in the world," says the Danish physiologist Dr. M. Hindhede in an interview, adding "Americans never drink anything but water with their meals, unless they have been in Europe and have become demoralized".</p>
   <p>We agree with the eminent scientist on the excellent qualities of water, but his statement indicates that during his stay in America he did not get around much where drinking is being done.</p>
   <p>Americans of all classes, whether they have been demoralized in Europe or not, have pretty much the same drinking habits as Europeans. Some are temperate and others drink more than is good for them, and there is on both continents, considerable drinking of alcholic beverages, before, during, after, and between meals.</p>
   <p>The nice American front such as the ordinance closing the front door of saloons on Sunday has fooled the doctor; the back door is wide open.</p>

   <p>Dr. Hindhede does not further the highly commendable temperance cause by making statements based on such superficial observations.</p>
