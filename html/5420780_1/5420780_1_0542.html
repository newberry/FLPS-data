   <p>With the object of unfolding effective socialist propaganda for the benefit of Scandinavian workers in America, a committee consisting of delegates from Scandinavian Socialist societies under the name of Scandinavian Socialist Propaganda Committee was organized June 30th this year.</p>
   <p>The course of procedure will be as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To engage a noted lecturer from one of the Scandinavian countries and to arrange for him a tour throughout America.</p>
   <p>2. To sponsor publication of Scandinavian socialist literature in America.</p>
   <p>3. To organize Scandinavian branches of the Socialist Party wherever possible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>With the first point of the program in mind the committee has made arrangements with the noted leader of the Norwegian Socialist Party Stortingsmand (Senator), Dr. Alfred Eriksen, to come here. At this moment the negotiations are so nearly completed that it is almost certain that Dr. Eriksen will arrive sometime during the summer 1908.</p>
   <p>It so happens that the Presidential campaign will be in full swing at that time.</p>
   <p>Concerning points 2 and 3 of the program, preparations are being made rapidly. If the idea wins popular support throughout the country, which we hope most sincerely, it will not be long before we are able to send a skilled organizer wherever there is a possibility for establishing a branch of the Socialist Party. But in order to accomplish that the moral and financial support from all Socialists in this country is needed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In order to obtain sufficient funds with which to carry out our plans we have decided to take up a national collection. We depend on voluntary contributions because we are convinced that every Scandinavian Socialist of this country will be happy to be instrumental in this great cause.</p>
   <p>Therefore we appeal to you, comrades. Being thoroughly convinced that you are in sympathy with and have a keen understanding of the importance of the Socialist movement in America, we urge you to mail your contributions as soon as possible. Your contribution will be listed, and thus receipted, in our daily papers. Also the papers will keep you posted as to the activity of the committee.</p>
   <p>All contributions must be mailed to the financial secretary, Mr. O. Swenson, 471 W. Erie St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
