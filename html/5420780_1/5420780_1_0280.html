   <p>p.2.....Last Monday Chicago Evening papers reported the following: "This morning, the Illinois Steel Works in South Chicago, was besigned by an unruly mob of 3000 who fought among themselves and with the police in an effort to enter the plant in answer to a call for about 1000 workers."</p>
   <p>This episode clearly illustrated the worthlessness of promises of prosperity for which the workers, time after time, cast their votes for the capitalists and their party.</p>
   <p>Consider then, these big politicians and industrialists who have the affrontery to announce that there is plenty of work for those who want work Have they no sense of shame or decency?</p>
