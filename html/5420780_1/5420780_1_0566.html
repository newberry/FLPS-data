   <p>The huge sums of money being spent by the U. S. Government on the Philippine Islands are a matter of worry for the plutocrats. Total expenditures up to date have been estimated at the astounding figure of $30,000,000, while American expert to the islands last year amounted to $7,000,000 only. Lost of people do willingly admit that the Philippine Islands are the world's most expensive islands. Of course, the working population must pay the expenses, but this is not the cause for concern; the thing is that the plutocrats have begun to realize that instead of using all that money without getting satisfactory returns they could just as well use it like the rest of the wealth we produce for the benefit of the plutocrats.</p>
   <p>The fact that a great many human lives were sacrificed for the Philippine cause is not being mentioned, because prices on human lives are reasonable. Neither does anybody find everything objectionable in the fact that the acquisition of the island was just plain robbery. In fact robbery whether domestic or foreign, is considered a legitimate and patriotic enterprise in our days as long as it serves to promote the interests of the upper class. But a lot of money is being handled and spent without a reasonable make-off for the plutocrats. They think, of course, that this should be stopped.</p>
