   <p>p.2.......The Hon. Wm. J. Bryan has at last as a result of much deep thinking, came to the conclusion that his failure of election to the presidency, is due to a distressingly weak Democratic Press.</p>
   <p>Had he continued his study he might in time, have realized that this same press was weak because it was the organ of a superfluous party; a party having nothing new to offer. In fact, the party platform is nothing but a subdued mummery of the principles of the same reactionary, plutocratic interests that the Republican party openly proclaimed. A party buffeted about by wind and wave with neither a substantial aim nor a definite mission, existing by piracy in its own press.</p>
