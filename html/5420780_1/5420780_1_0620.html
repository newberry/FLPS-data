   <p>p.2.......According to a Norwegian paper, Senator Knute Nelson some time ago made this statement: "In my opinion the most important question now before the American people, is the one concerning the control of corporations, through congressional legislation."</p>
   <p>As is well known, the corporations are controlling both the republican and the democratic parties, and the congress as well, and the important thing for politicians like Knute Nelson is,of course,to make the public believe that this situation might be reversed. If only the public could be made to believe that the congress and the government hold the upper hand over the corporations, the latter are safe enough, and the main problems for prominent politicians like Senator Nelson consists, therefore, in getting people to live and die in this happy political belief. They have succeeded well enough so far, and will probably continue to succeed for some time to come.</p>
