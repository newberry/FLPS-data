   <p>"In numbers there is strength." This aphorism must be true, at least in one respect, for it is a daily occurrence for us to meet workers who, because they do not belong to any labor organization, are wholly disregarded and deprived of the chance to make a livelihood for themselves and their families.</p>
   <p>We grant, of course, that there are also thousands of organized workers, who, in spite of affiliation with the Union, are confronted with the same problem of inadequate work. This situation naturally gives rise to the question: Does it really pay for labor to be organized? This question is easily answered.</p>
   
   <p>No matter what grievance may be held against Unionism, we cannot refuse to recognize one fact. That is, workers who are without any representation, become reduced to the same level as were their colored brothers prior to the Civil War.</p>
   <p>Our present masters of society keep them under their heels--like mere slaves--as did the plantation owners of the South. Plantation owners at least made it their business to see that their slaves were well fed. This was not from a humanitarian reason, since a slave, being private property, always represented so much capital.</p>
   <p>The white skinned slaves, however, do not fare so well, for if the industrial masters cannot visualize great profit by keeping them in bondage, then they are released from the factory, and sent out to shift for themselves.</p>
   
   <p>It is, therefore, apparent that the only way by which the workers can ever succeed in gaining their rights to live is by mass organization.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, some workers are under the impression that there exists no such thing as friction or antagonistic feelings between Labor and Capital; they actually believe that everything is right with the world. But actions always speak louder than words, and the actions of the industrial leaders clearly show they are preparing for battle, to crush the unions wherever there is a weak link.</p>
   <p>There are many reasons for the lack of force in our present day labor organizations. For instance, many workers, who really are eager to devote their whole life to the success of Unionism, are kept from helping the cause on account of the exorbitant dues demanded for the privilege of becoming a member.</p>
   
   <p>Since the Union means strength, it is clearly the duty of every organized worker to see that his brother worker gets a fair chance to join the ranks of organized labor. If deprived of this right, who can blame the same brother worker if he turns against his union brother eventually, with as bitter resentment as the industrial masters themselves.</p>
   <p>Every worker should be afforded the opportunity to carry a union card. Within a short time, the workers, through their organized strength, will become the main factor in American life. The workers of the world should unite. By so doing, they have nothing to lose, but everything to gain.</p>
