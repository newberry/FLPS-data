   <p>Every day articles are appearing in our daily newspapers denouncing Russia and its experiment of a system which they evidently borrowed from none other than our own Captain John Smith, of Virginia Colony fame. He, the leader and Commissary of that little flock of pioneers, upon setting foot on the shores in 1607, lost no time in laying down the iron-bound rule that everyone able to work had to do so or not eat.</p>
   <p>The world has progressed considerably since 1607; however, quite a number of our present-day members of society, although able to work, are stealing free rides on the back of their fellow men.</p>
   <p>Tolstoy wrote that the rich will do everything for the poor except to get off their back. No doubt most of the riders are hanging on from fear that <span class="page-break">\2</span>once they are let down, they themselves would become what they have made out of their brothers, namely, common jackasses.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, quite natural that those occupying a rider's seat should object to a system which eventually would put them all on par with the common herd.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, Arthur Brisbane wrote: "When the one hundred and twenty million in this country get ready to think, use their brains and their votes, they will improve their condition. Meanwhile, they will contribute to the sixteen thousand that do think or hire corporation lawyers, members of Congress, and other officials to think and work for them."</p>
   <p>This statement of Mr. Brisbane sounds radical enough, yet Mr. Brisbane is well aware of the fact that if, by a miracle, the hundred and twenty million should take a notion to go in for heavy thinking, it would only be a matter of hours before the authorities would denounce them as Bolshevist, and treat them accordingly.</p>

   <p>The brain of the average American workman, thanks to this sixteen thousand, have been imbued with hopes and filled with ideas as to his own importance, to the extent that his mind has become short-circuited. No wonder that in this country, millions of dollars are donated annually to schools and universities, with the sole object of training the young people to be faithful to a class that never works, but always pay the bill where their own interests are involved.</p>
   <p>In Russia, on the other hand, where people did not receive schooling of any kind, and where professors were not hired to prostitute their knowledge for the benefit of the few, thinking has become an art. The poor muzhit, after once reaching a decision, was swayed neither by beautiful phrases nor scholastic hokum. But when the time for action arrived, soldiers, sailors and peasants alike, joined hands in a common cause, that of getting rid of the drones.</p>
   <p>Entirely too much criticism is meted out to Russia by our daily press, with the idea that Russian culture will invade our land of the free (?). But it is a <span class="page-break">\4</span>safe bet that it will take fully a century and a half, before the American workingman up and realizes his plight.</p>
