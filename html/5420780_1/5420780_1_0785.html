   <p>Poor President Taft has been slipping lately. This kindly man is no match for Roosevelt. The latter is the thundering lion of the political circus, while Taft is the thundering cow who, when once asked what a poor unemployed fellow could do to better his lot, replied: "God knows."</p>
   <p>Were the same question asked of Roosevelt, he would undoubtedly, without batting an eye, answer that he would take care of the unemployed in no time, if he were only given a chance to get at the unscrupulous politicians and wicked big bankers who exploit the poor people.</p>
   <p>In answering the question, he would employ such brilliant logic and overwhelming oratory that the poor unemployed devil would forget his misery for sheer Rooseveltian enthusiasm; unless he happened to be a socialist, as the latter finds it difficult to swallow Roosevelt's radicalism in view of his political servitude to the country's mightiest capitalist monster, J. P. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Morgan and Co., and also in view of his record during two previous terms as President.</p>
   <p>However, it looks as if he will be able to dupe a sufficient number of people with his crushing oratory so that he will be both nominated and elected as the best trained thundering lion the capitalists have at their disposal at the present time.</p>
