   <p>p.4.col. 3........The special meeting for women, held by the Scandinavian Karl Marx Club, on Tuesday January 26, 1909, drew a full house and, for once, the attendance, at such a meeting, was overwhelmingly feminine. The meeting was conducted by Mrs. C. Madsen and Mrs. Allen D. Mejow, last Sunday's speaker, at Dania Hall. They delivered a clear and concise lecture on socialism, its ideals, and woman's part in the movement, and delivered an urgent appeal to those present to take an active part in promoting the ideals of socialism wherever possible. The high-light of the program were the contributions of the Socialistiske Dame-Sangforening (Socialist Women's Singing Society) and vocal solos by Mrs. Valborg Kleven.</p>
   <p>The next public meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 23, with an opening lecture by Christian Madsen and singing by the Scandinavian Workers Male Chorus.</p>
