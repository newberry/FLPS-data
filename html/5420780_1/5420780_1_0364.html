   <p>With the death of Thomas J. Morgan, the American Socialist Party has lost one of its pioneers and best advocates, a man of sincere purpose.</p>
   <p>About 25 years ago I had the pleasure, for the first time of attending a meeting in the well-known Greif's Hall on Lake Street where Mr. Morgan was the principal speaker. To advocate Socialism in those days took men of courage, brains and integrity. Morgan was one of them, small of build, but great of spirit. He attracted thinking people like a magnet. His irony and satirical criticism would make a laughing stock of selfish, ignorant and dishonest persons preying on society. Unfailingly he would emerge as <span class="page-break">2</span>the victor in a debate. No wonder the newspapers called him "the silver tongued orator". He was the very soul of the Socialistic movement, its untiring moral and financial supporter.</p>
   <p>An army of ambitious persons generally follow important movements, and their motives for support originate in selfishness. As a rule they are watching developements at a distance ready to act when an opportunity appears for them to enrich themselves to the detriment of the movement. Morgan was observing and quick to identify these parasites, and he attacked them mercilessly. He saw clearly that if there was to be hope for the Socialist party to survive and win public approval it was of extreme importance to keep it free of dishonest and corruptive elements.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Instead of covering up corrupt affairs, a practice so commonly used by the old parties, Morgan wanted criticism to sweep through our social structure like a refreshing gale removing old dust and cobwebs. To this principle he adhered faithfully until his death.</p>
   <p>The result was of course that Morgan saw his criticism and stern attitude reflect upon himself. He had a host of enemies who spared no efforts to expell him from the party; but his would-be political assassins did not succeed. Morgan's many years of honest work and sacrifice for the benefit of the party had inspired the majority of the members with unshaken faith in his integrity, so he withstood his enemies sinister attacks. Only death <span class="page-break">4</span>could defeat the old champion.</p>
   <p>For the sake of our party let us hope that a great number of brother members will take up the fight to uphold the ideals so faithfully pursued by the late Thomas J. Morgan. Then we can look forward to the future with confidence and be sure our goal will be reached.</p>
   <p>In an earlier issue of Revyen, Editor Botker made a statement to the effect that if any man ever made himself worthy of a memorial, it was Thomas J. Morgan. I fully agree with Christian Botker, but even if no memorial is erected, his name will remain fresh in the memory of those who knew him. They will never forget that dauntless pioneer, Thomas J. Morgan!</p>
