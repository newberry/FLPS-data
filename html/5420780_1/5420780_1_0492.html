   <p>A 50-year old Polish worker of Chicago was found to be in possession of $600 which he said was money he had saved up for a rainy day. However, both his wife and the police decided his story was so incredible that they deemed it necessary to arrest the man.</p>
   <p>Had a speculator, or a rich good-for-nothing who never did a useful day's work in all his life been found with ten or 100 times as much money, a suggestion to arrest him would have been entirely out of place.</p>
   <p>Peculiar differences we have in this world.</p>
