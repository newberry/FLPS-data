   <p>p.4..........The Illinois Supreme Court has recently handed down a decision declaring it illegal for any club or society to serve alcoholic drinks to its members or guests at dances, picnics, etc., unless the regular $500.00 license has been taken out.</p>
   <p>This decision does not affect seriously the swanky downtown clubs, with a turnover of hundreds or thousands of dollars a day, but it is obvious, that no ordinary, small society, which arranges only one ball or one picnic a year, is able to stand such a taxation. Such organizations will now have to devise means whereby these new regulations may be circumvented. Another proof of what a free and blessed country we are living in.</p>
