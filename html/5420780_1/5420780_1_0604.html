   <p>p.2......Chicago's Chronicle "is sounding a warning" against public ownership, pointing to the existing corruption and graft among public office holders, particularly in the Post Office department. The logic seems to be this: Because our republican and democratic officials and public servants are stealing the people's money, or are accepting bribes from the capitalists, so that these latter may get a chance to steal, everything ought to be running undisturbed along the old track, and that the exploitation be permitted to continue. As the system becomes more and more corrupt it achieves such holiness that it can not be touched. What a wonderful morale!</p>
