   <p>p.2.... Through the efforts of the socialistic congressman Berger, the first step has now been taken by the United States to line up with the other civilized nations of the world in regard to assistance for poor and worn out old people. He has proposed that all persons over sixty years of age be granted a sum of from $1.00 to $4.00 per week, depending on their income.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berger has further proposed that a parliamentary investigating committee be established which is to report its findings notlater than March next year. He estimates that the annual expenditures will amount to $347,000,000 and in this connection points out that at the present time we are spending $381,000,000 annually for the maintenance of the army and navy, and for military pensions.</p>
   <p>The only socialistic member of the Congress has thus sponsored a cause which the capitalistic parties, however, much they may dislike to do so, undoubtedly will be forced to support. From the humanitarian point <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of view, it is so sound and just that it can not be ignored.</p>
   <p>To his proposal, Mr. Berger, has added a paragraph intended to prevent the Federal Courts from declaring such legislation void. Certain capitalistic newspapers have suggested that federal judges might take action and have this paragraph nullified. However, in our constitutional history we have precedents of such paragraphs being adopted and legally recognized.</p>
   <p>Such an attempt at legal trickery calls our attention to the absurdity in our legislative setup of placing the judges above the law, whereas in other constitutionally governed countries the position is reversed.</p>
