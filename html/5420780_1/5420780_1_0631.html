   <p>The result of the election in Chicago was, as far as the Socialists are concerned, that Debs and Harriman received five thousand votes. Four years ago they received only seven hundred votes in Chicago. It is of interest to know that most of the Socialist votes came from wards where the Danes are in the majority; the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Wards on the West Side and the Thirty-fourth Ward on the South Side each gave Debs and Harriman from five hundred to six hundred votes.</p>
