   <p>Henry L. Hertz does not like the political earthquake that occurred May 26, when Wm. Lorimer was elected United States senator. The Irishman and Mr. Hertz had been good friends; they belong to the same party, the Republican, but recently they became foes. Mr. Hertz, for many years has been Internal Revenue Collector. There is little doubt that he will soon lose his job. We hope that when he retires, without pension, Mr. Hertz will have more time to devote to the interests of the Danish colony in Chicago.</p>
