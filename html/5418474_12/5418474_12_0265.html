   <p>Brand's Hall belonged to Hamburg Germans on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The sons and daughters who are as courteous and beautiful as the Hansa City, came in abundant numbers; there was such a multitude that the spacious hall was hardly large enough to accommodate them all. The club, only two years old, is one of Chicago's most popular amongst the Hansa adherents. The masquerade brought us "typical" Hamburg costumes, also very original sartorial conceptions. The watch word given by the Committee was: Joviality, and all who joined found it a delightful festival.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Arrangements did not fail to five constant attention to its guests, and the employed assistants functioned in the same spirit.</p>
   <p>All in all, the festival was an entire success.</p>
