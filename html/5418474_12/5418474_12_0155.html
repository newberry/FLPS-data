   <p>The nomination of the Hon. George Schneider, president of the National Bank of Illinois, to the Swiss mission (now the diplomatic grade of Charge d'Affaires), will be very gratifying to the people of this city and state. The mission is that filled by Horace Rublee, of Wisconsin, for so many years, and the appointment of Mr. Schneider is a recognition of an editorial lien on the place, as he was for many years owner and editor of the Staats-Zeitung, though he has since retrograded to the condition of a prosperous bank president. Mr. Schneider is a German by birth, coming from the southern Germany, we believe, and not far from Switzerland, and is conversant with the Continental languages. He has been a resident of America for thirty years or more, and has become a thorough American in sympathy and attachments. He will be a creditable representative of the people, and will maintain for the Seiss mission the same excellent reputation for propriety, dignity, and courtesy which Horace Rublee gained for it.</p>
