   <p>In the theater of the Aurora Turnhall, the audience came to celebrate a rare occasion. It was the 30th anniversary of its manageress, the popular and beloved Mrs. Marie Schaumberg. An outburst of applause filled the auditorium, magnificent flowers and bouquets were given to the well-known variety actress, as she appeared on the stage. As the curtain was lowered and raised again, in response to prolonged applause, Mr. Stolte, in faultless dresssuit, in the presence of the entire members of the Schindler-Schaumberg troupe, recited a poem he had written, depicting the excellent abilities and capacities of Mrs. Schaumberg as artist and theater-manager. Thereupon Mr. Rodenberg presented an impressive, beautiful silver laurel wreath, in the name of all the members and he further expressed his hope that someday he might have the opportunity of tendering the golden one. Mrs. Schaumberg thanked her associates and the public in a few short but sincere words and became so happily eleted that tears of joy threatened to constrict her throat and voice. As far as the play was concerned, a song farce, "Air Castles" by MannStaedt and Weller, was smoothly produced and well received.</p>

   <p>When one sees Mrs. Schaumberg and hears her take a juvenile role, one must doubt, that she is the identical individual, who was just celebrated- and given an ovation in recognition of a long career as artist. The other parts were also well represented and taken care of.</p>
