He trembles, he has barricaded himself. No one may see him. If he hears the slightest noise, he believes that murderers are on his tracks.</p>
   <p>He sent a reporter to fetch Mathews. "Mathews," Storey said to him, "Go at once to Judge Hinsdale and have Hesing arrested, because he has threatened to shoot you."</p>
   <p>Judge Hinsdale wrote the warrant and Mathews then signed it. The warrant was given to constable Laimbeer who was to arrest A. C. Hesing the next day.</p>

What do we care about Storey. Let the rascal take care of himself. Mathews got the warrant back and burned it.</p>
