   <p>An immense crowd assembled yesterday morning in St. Paul's Church in order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Rev. Hartmann's pastorship. Each one of the 1,500 seats was occupied, not only by members of the parish but also by people who did not belong to any religious denomination. They wanted to give proof of their friendship to the cultured and tolerant preacher. The church was beautifully adorned. Over the pulpit hung a garland with the dates "1851-1876."</p>
   <p>Besides a great number of old German settlers there were also many preachers present.</p>
