   <p>Last night, at eight o'clock, Wilhelm Seipp received a very pleasant surprise. While the newly elected City Treasurer of Chicago [W. Seipp] was eating dinner at his home, 247 South Park Avenue, he heard the strains of an orchestral overture, and saw a light flickering through the window, and, as he opened the door, he was confronted by employees of Seipp's Brewery carrying torches. A large number of citizens from the Fourth Ward had joined the group of employees. After the Chicago orchestra's trumpets had sounded a flourish, one of the Brewery teamsters, Wilhelm Steiger, made a brief speech, declaring that the workers of the Brewery could not refrain from expressing their satisfaction at the election of their chief to this responsible political post. His election is an honor, indeed, since he is the youngest treasurer Chicago has ever had, and probably ever will have. His election is proof that regardless of his comparative youth, he enjoys a reputation as a thorough and capable businessman, that he has the confidence of his fellow citizens and brings additional glory to the name of Seipp. The speaker then called for a cheer and Wilhelm Seipp, in a few words, <span class="page-break">\2</span>expressed his sincere appreciation, whereupon the crowd broke into another cheer. Continuing his speech, Mr. Steiger emphasized the fact that if there were employers and employees anywhere who worked harmoniously together, and proved that they benefited mutually thereby, Conrad Seipp and his force were an example of that type of relationship. Probably at no time have men of eminence tried so zealously and unselfishly to further the interests of their workers as Messrs. Seipp, father and son, and,consequently, everyone works gladly at his appointed task and has the interest of the company at heart.</p>
   <p>After the orchestra played a few additional selections and the torches, now thrown in a heap, had burned out, Mr. Seipp invited the whole group to Binz's Hall, where, until midnight, refreshments were served and fervent speeches were delivered, extolling the solidarity of Seipp and his brewery employees, as well as the cordiality shown by citizens of the neighborhood.</p>
