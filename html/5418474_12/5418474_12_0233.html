   <p>A great number of our German colleagues have suffered terribly by the conflagration of October 9. Some of them have hardly been able to save anything and are facing, with their families, the direst need, because even with a sufficient practice they can hardly hope for any cash income during the next winter. The quickest help is necessary. I therefore ask you all that you organize yourselves everywhere for the purpose of mutual help, and that you send the amounts realized to the German Consul here, Mr. Claussenius. Of the right use and faithful accounting of all moneys received, the utmost care will be taken.</p>
