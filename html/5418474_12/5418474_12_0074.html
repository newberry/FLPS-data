   <p>Cur readers may probably recall, that Mrs. Mary Grauperer of Desplaines brought suit against John Hintz, a walthy farmer of that district, for alleged slander, in Judge Altgeld's Court. $2000 damages have been awarded.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Grauperer had been accused of stealing $80 from Mrs. Emma Kohlberg, also of Desplaines. The defendant (Hintz) entered a motion for the granting of a new trial on the grounds that he is the victim of a conspiracy. The Judge dismissed his petition since it was issued to late, and signed an order for the execution of judgment, a demand for payment. Mr. Hintz will appeal.</p>
   <p>Later, Agust Muldenhauer, father of Mrs. Grauperer filed a damage suit for $10,000 against Hintz, since the latter called him " a (dirty) character."</p>
