   <p>The Chicago "Turn" Community again lost yesterday one of its most beloved members in the person of August Timm, who had belonged since 1883 when he chose Chicago as his domicile and joined the Chicago Turn Community, after having been a member of various other Turn Societies outside Chicago. At the age of Thirteen Timm and his parents immigrated to this country settling in Davenport, Iowa. Still extremely young, he joined the First Company of the First Iowa Infantry Regiment at the out break of the Civil War and showed, in spite of his youth, so much courage and discretion in his army work, that he was promoted within two years to the rank of Captain. He also had the bitter experience of being a war prisoner at Andersonville, returning finally to the home of his parents with all the glory of a hero. Timm was then appointed assistant postmaster of Davenprot in President Grant's administration. Later on he managed the Wagner Brewery at Rock Island, Ill., and still later the "Turnhalle" Brewery in Moline, Ill. Some time later the "Liquor Dealers' Protective Association" of Illinois won him over and appointed him to the office of Secretary of Finance and before long he held in addition to that, the office of the Corresponding Secretary. He engaged in splendid work in 1883 <span class="page-break">\2</span>when he first came to Chicago in the Innkeepers Union of Illinois. Timm worked in the County Agency when Mr. Sceberger, Collector of inland taxes, appointed him superintendent of the "Barge Office", in which capacity he fully satisfied his superiors, until ill health put an end to his career. Death, yesterday, put an end to his suffering.</p>
