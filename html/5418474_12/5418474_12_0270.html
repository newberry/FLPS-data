   <p>As the saying goes "The Crown to the Worthy". At the last meeting of the Platt Deutschen Verein, the Committee gave a special toast to Mr. George B. Tiarks, who was their President four times, and who now is their ex-President. And again a toast was drunk by the Lodge, the Lodge members using the slogan of the Lodge "Boy Hold On;" as they did so, they presented Mr. Tiarks with a cane which had a gold tip.</p>
   <p>Afterwards the Committee and members presented Mr. Tiakrs with a Poem, which had been dedicated to him, for his faithful and untiring service, which he had rendered during his terms of President.</p>
