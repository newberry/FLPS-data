   <p>The other two indictments against A. C. Hesing were nol prossed on Monday with the consent of Federal Attorney Bangs and upon recommendation of Mr. Anderson, the partner of Jussen. The proof, that Judge Blodgett is prejudiced against A. C. Hesing is to be found in the remark he made to Mr. Anderson.</p>
   <p>He said: "It seems to me that Mr. Bangs should now go to Mr. Hesing and apologize to him for ever having indicted him." One can understand that Judge Blodgett is not in good humor; then Hesing's pardon, especially the reason for which it was granted, is equivalent to a complete defeat for him. It is not pleasant for a judge to be rebuffed by the President of the United States and by a man like Taft, who has more juridical knowledge in his little finger than Judge Blodgett in his whole body.</p>
   <p>What the public thinks about him, Mr. Blodgett found out the day before yesterday at a meeting of the 11th Ward, where a Republican and almost completely American assembly applauded the speaker, W. Stanley, who declared concerning the distiller's situation, that had he the choice, he would a thousand times prefer to have the reputation and the past of A. C. Hesing than to have the past and the reputation of Judge Blodgett. He added that the greatest danger for this country was a corrupt and partial court.</p>

   <p>So clearly did the assembly give its approval, that W. Woodard, the next speaker who had worked against a pardon for A. C. Hesing, made no allusion to it, but confined himself to a temperamce speech.</p>
