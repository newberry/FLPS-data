   <p>The German actor and director of the German theater in Chicago, Mr. Julius Richard, who died so suddenly a few days ago, will be buried today in Milwaukee. All Germans mourn deeply over the great loss inflicted by the sudden death of J. Richard, who was highly esteemed for his untiring efforts directed towards improving the art of acting, and for being a great actor himself.....</p>
   <p>At the age of twenty he tore off the unbearable shackles (of his previous vocation) and for the first time played the role of an actor at Sternberg, but he failed utterly.... About one year later he was entrusted for the first time with an important role at the theater of Schleswig, Germany.. From that time on his success was assured. He acted in succession in Hamburg, Cassel, Goettingen, Berlin, Potsdam, Hanover, and Weimar. In 1881 he received two offers of engagements, one came from St. Petersburg, Russia, and the other from a Chicago theater. He accepted the latter.</p>
   <p>Richard remained in Chicago until 1884, when he became one of the directors of the local German theater.....</p>
