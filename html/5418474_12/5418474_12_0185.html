   <p>Anton Berg was awarded the gold medal at the Old Settlers' Picnic. He was adjudged the oldest settler who could show continuous residence in Chicago. The medal was given to him yesterday morning at his home, by a committee of the Chicago Turngemeinde, since he had left the picnic grounds before the prizes were distributed. Henry Greenebaum presented the gold medal to the recipient with a few suitable words. Mr. Berg expressed his thanks and promised to preserve the medal as a keepsake and to bequeath it to his heirs. He invited the committee and other friends present to have some wine and thus a pleasant hour was spent....</p>
