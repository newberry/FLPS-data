   <p>Conrad Folz, one of the oldest settlers and one of our most renowned, faithful office holders of the city and county, died yesterday evening at his home, corner North Avenue and Larrabee Street. He also had been a victim of the epidemic (La Grippe), which played such havoc in Chicago last winter. Contrary to his doctor's advice, he only remained four days at home, and driven by ambition, he resumed his work. Since that time he often complained of aches in the pulmonary region. Yesterday the pain became so severe, that he found it necessary to return home earlier than usual. His physician, Dr. Hessert, diagnosed pneumonia which he was not destined to survive. Yesterday morning, the crisis appeared to turn towards improvement. He was fully conscious but seemed to be aware of approaching death, since his assertions showed, that he held little hope for a possible recovery. Sheriff Marson visited him at 6 o'clock and remained with him until his demise. His sons, Otto and Charles, sat on his bed, until a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>short, gurgling sound proclaimed the sleep which leads to the great beyond. When they spoke to him, he was dead. Tranquil and painless was his death. A varied life of a typical German pioneer has thus come to its end. He saw Chicago in its infancy. He survived the storms and stress of the young, gigantic city and, starting from small, impecunious, surroundings, he gradually achieved importance and died as a highly respected member of the community.</p>
   <p>Conrad Folz was born in Rampstein, in the Rheinpfalz, (River Rhein, southern German District) 64 years ago. In the year 1849, during the insurrection he emigrated to America with his future father-in-law, Michael Rose. During the first year he was in Pennsylvania, in New York, and finally a canal worker, in Buffalo. Here he married his first wife with whom he shared a contented existence until 1864.</p>
   <p>In the year 1850 he came to Chicago and settled on the location where the station on the corner of Larrabee Street is now situated. He and his <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>father-in-law lived there. His shack was in the middle of a field, outside the city limits. He was the first settler of that district which is a thriving, industrial center today. He remained in possession of this corner throughout his life. Long before the fire he built a two story frame house and added a barn later. It is now the site of Folz's Hall. At that early period this locality was the focal point of the social element from the North Side and those men who took an interest in politics. During his early years, Folz's vocation in Chicago consisted in surveying and plotting streets. He continued in this calling until 1857, when Mayor Tom Dyer, for whom he worked as gardener, gave him the job of Custodian of the Belfry, in City Hall. This, his first public office, he held for three years, until 1860, when he was appointed director of the prison by the former Sheriff, A. E. Hesing. In this responsible position he remained for twenty-four years. His administration proved so profoundly satisfactory to the citizens and the Sheriff's force, that it seemed unnecessary to select some one else. The history of the city and its lurid crimes, which brought sordid tales beyond the confines of their environment, were often chronologically recorded in his <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>prison office which became a mirror of the underworld's conniving. Often he labored amid difficulties and responsibilities but his conduct was always so honorable, that the city considered him to be one of its most reliable officials. The sheriffs; Beveridge, Bradley, Nelson, and Fischer prolonged his official duration. Not until 1874, when F. Agnew became sheriff, did he have a successor. Kern and Hoffmann would not recall him but in 1880, when General O. L. Mann became sheriff of Cook county, he was reappointed. Hanchett and Marson did not change that arrangement.</p>
   <p>The anarchists, The five who were the indicted murderers of Dr. i were entrusted to him for safekeeping. Even these men whose execution he performed, considered him humane because of the many favors he bestowed upon them, as long as the accommodations were compatible with his conscience. The "Great Fire" also destroyed his property but regardless of his personal impending loss, he save 120 prisoners. With a few thousand dollars insurance indemnity he again reached affluence leaving his offspring <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in prosperous circustances. He was a staunch Roman Catholic, helped to build a church and was socially prominent in the German clubs. Funeral on Sunday.</p>
