   <p>In answer to the letter of Orville S. Grant, Esq. to President Grant, published in the morning papers, Col. E. Jussen, collector of internal revenue, has sent the following dispatch to the commissioner of internal revenue:</p>
   <p>"The Chicago papers published a letter purporting to have been written on June 18, 1870 by Orville S. Grant, Esq., to President Grant, charging me with corruptly suppressing a prosecution instituted against Kirchhoff &amp; Co., distillers, for violation of the revenue laws. This charge, as well as every other direct or indirect insinuation against my integrity contained in said letter, is a malicious falsehood. The case against Kirchhoff &amp; Co. is on the trial docket for the present term of the United States District Court. If the letter in question is genuine and published by authority, I respectfully demand an immediate investigation."</p>
   <p>Edmund Jussen</p>
   <p>Collector, First District of Illinois</p>
