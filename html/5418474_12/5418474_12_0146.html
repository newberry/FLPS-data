   <p>General Lieb's claim that he has managed the affairs of the County Clerk's office with economy has been looked upon generally with great distrust. It is true that he has made the assertion day in and day out, but the figures, twist them how you will, did not seem to bear out his assertion. An examination into Lieb's private affairs, however, goes to show that, as far as he himself is concerned, he knows what economy is and practices it. So it is possible, after all, that there is something in his claim that he is running his office economically, and that it is only the stupidity of the rest of mankind which prevents their seeing it.</p>
   <p>Lieb turned up here along in 1867, a shabbily dressed, long-legged soldier of fortune. He started an evening German paper, known as the Abend Zeitung. It is believed to have been started upon credit, and was published as long as that article was to be found. When his stock of that ran out, the newspaper stopped also. During the 1869 campaign he made speeches on behalf of the Citizens' Ticket, and the shabby old cloak, and the rusty old hat, and the dilapidated old shoes, are vividly remembered by the frequenters of the ward club meetings of that year. Though he had <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>worked for the successful ticket he got nothing by it, and soon after left the city for the purpose of heading a German colony which was to settle near Memphis. The colony was a failure, and Lieb returned with the same old cloak, hat, and shoes, a little rustier and a little shabbier, but still the same. He started another evening paper, but his stock of credit was so slight that it soon died. Subsequently, with money borrowed from various individuals, he bought into the Union, the German Democratic paper. In 1873 he joined the Irish-Democratic coalition, contributing his paper, his oratorical power, and some pretended influence over the Germans. He was nominated and elected County Clerk by the People's party in the fall of 1873, and went into the office in December of that year. At that time he had nothing but debts and old clothes. He owed from $6,000 to $10,000, money borrowed from gentlemen who befriended him in his hour of need, who had stood by him when he was ragged and forlorn, and whom he surely never would desert after he came to be fat and saucy</p>
   <p>Gen. Lieb is, of course, an honorable man. We have his word for it, and that of all the clerks in his employ. Those debts, therefore, have unquestionably been paid. He has not gone into bankruptcy, for the Democracy would put no bankrupt on their ticket. The workingmen would nominate nobody but an honest, hard-working fellow <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with horny hands and sweaty face, who had paid off all his honest debts to the last dollar. By December of this year he will have received tha last of his pay for 1877. He gets $3,000 a year. That makes $12,000 which he has received since he went into office.</p>
   <p>Now, to look at that ecomony which makes Lieb a model for imitation by young men, - that economy which should replace Poor Richard by Hermann Lieb.</p>
   <p>Honest debts paid $6,000 to $10,000. Lot on Freemont Street, costing $3,000, all paid, and release given March, 1876.</p>
   <p>One hundred feet on La Salle Street purchased in 1874 and 1876; cost, $7,500. The last $1,500, paid for sub-lot 6, was planked down in cash in September 1876.</p>
   <p>A house has been erected on the La Salle Street property costing at the inside $2,000. This makes a total of about $18,000 at the inside which has been paid out of $12,000 received during four years.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>By dint of practicing rigid economy, the household expenses for the County Clerk's family, additional clothing, etc. - for the old cloak, and hat, and shoes have gone, - might be kept within $500 a year, which would make a total of $2,000 more, or a grand total of about $20,000 saved out of $12,000, with doctor's bills, charity, horsecar rides, donations to benevolent institutions, and political expenses yet to be heard from.</p>
   <p>In view of such economy, it is possible that Lieb's claim that he administers the County Clerk's office economically is a justifiable one. Still, it would be desirable if he could set it out a little more plainly, just as plainly, for instance, as the Tribune has set forth his economy in the management of his private affairs.</p>
