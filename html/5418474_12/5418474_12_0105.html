   <p>The robust health of Friedrich Hecker was indicative of a long life, but a stroke of paralysis a few days ago ended the colorful career of this fighter for liberty.</p>
   <p>Hecker was born on September 28, 1811, at Eichtersheim, in Baden. He received an excellent education, and became a very successful lawyer in the city of Mannheim.... His political career began in 1842, when he was elected representative to the Parliament of Baden. Be immediately became one of the most prominent leaders of the opposition party, defending the rights of the people. He also fought for a united Germany, this at a time when Prissia and Austria were still absolutist countries. He thus commanded the attention of all the German people.</p>
   <p>At the outbreak of the revolution in 1848, Hecker became the leader of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Republican Party of South Germany. He engaged in a combat with the regular Baden and Hessian troops at Constans, on April 12, 1848, but was defeated at Kamden, on April 20. Hecker then became a political refugee in Switzerland, with hardly any friends. While in exile, he was repeatedlly elected by the district of Thiengen, in Baden, as representative to the parliament in Frankfurt, although the majority declared the election of one guilty of high treason to be null and void.</p>
   <p>In September of the same year, having lost faith in the progress of the cause of liberty in Germany, he emigrated to America, where he was received most enthusiastically. He came to Illinois and bought a farm in St. Claire's County, which remained his residence throughout his life....</p>
   <p>Hecker joined the yet young Republican party in the fight against slavery, and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>toured the East and the West in 1856, giving enthusiastic speeches in favor or Mr. Fremont, the Republican presidential condidate.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted as common soldier in the Regiment of Volunteers, formed in St. Louis by Franz Sigel, his countryman. While there he was appointed Commander of the 24th Infantry Regiment of Volunteers of Illinois. With this German regiment he went into the field of action. Nevertheless, the discord among his officers resulted in his early resignation. German patriotism was not dead, however, and the German citizens of Chicago, assisted by the Staats-Zeitung, formed in 1862 another German regiment, known as the 82nd Infantry Regiment of the Volunteers of Illinois, standing under Hecker's command. As a constituent to the Eleventh Army Corps of the Potomac <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>army, this regiment fought under Hooker the battle of Virginia against Gerneral Lee in 1863, and was also engaged in the bloody combat at Chancellorsville. There Colonel Hecker received a serious injury to his leg on May 3, while repelling Stonewall Jackson's forces. It was then that our troops suffered heavily, and nothing could have saved Hecker from being captured if it were not for his presence of mind. With supernatural will-power, disregarding the dangerous wound, he dragged himself into safety, behind trees and shrubs. He was taken to the home of his brother-in-law, Doctor Tiedemann, in Philadelphia, as soon as his condition permitted him to travel. At the end of convalescence he returned to the command of his regiment, which together with the Eleventh corps was transferred to the Western front. Hecker thus fought the battle of Chattanooga culminating in victory under General Grant. Not yet fully recovered from the war injury he resigned and returned to his farm in Illinois.</p>

   <p>Although retired from the army, Hecker's interest in public affairs did not diminish. And once again, during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, he showed that his love for Germany was not extinct and that he remained a patriot of that country just as much as he proved an ardent Republican here. This he demonstrated in a magnificent speech delivered in St. Louis on the occasion of the victory of the German army. But he delivered an equally excellent fourth of July address the same year, at a Turner festival in Indiana, glorifying the American Republican Fatherland. He participated in the National Convention of the Liberals in Cincinnati, in May 1872. However, after the appointment of Greeley, he had become thoroughly disgusted with the Liberal movement and displayed a neutrality with almost a friendly attitude toward Grant. Nevertheless he supported the Democratic party at the election of members of Congress in 1874, which however was a manoenvre in order to bring about the unity of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>corrupt Republican Party. But during the last two presidential elections he had resumed his old associations with the Republican Party. He was well-known for his excellent character and for his quick temper. He had been a correspondent for the Illinois Staats-Zeitung for many years, although he occasionally disagreed with the publisher over the "struggle between the state and the church in Prussia."</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, his articles have been published by this newspaper without any interruption and only the other day we published his noble protest against the persecution of Jews in Germany. As a foe of the Temperance movement, he has written many a word with a dynamic force behind it against the ill doings of fanatics.</p>

   <p>In tribute to the memory of Friedrich Heckner we again publish these excellent words, an extract from a letter written by him to his Chicago companions in arms, four months ago.</p>
   <p>"The warm invitation from you, my courageous brothers in arms, who were among the first to offer yourselves at the altar of the great union, now leading the march of nations, perplexing thereby the entire world, was for me a panacea which rendered me oblivious to my suffering. All the struggles and disappointments of life diminish for each of us at the mere thought, that we too have helped with manly loyalty and devotion in building this great structure of Democracy, watching and guarding that precious institution. Especially now, since the ship of this mighty nation is piloted by our genial citizen-soldier, I would appreciate to meet you, old and loyal comrades, to recall with you the <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>past and make plans for the future. But advancing years and poor health forbid me this happy reunion.... Convey, please, to each comrade my brotherly salute and my deepest appreciation for the high honor and the preservation of kind memories for their old commander."</p>
