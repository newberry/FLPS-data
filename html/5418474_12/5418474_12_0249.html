   <p>The following article is quoted from the Chicago Tribune, September 5:</p>
   <p>"George Schneider, Esquire, editor-in-chief and owner of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, has been appointed United States Consul at Helsingoer (Elsinore), Denmark, and we hear that he will leave for that post very soon. It may be said that for the past twelve years his indefatigable endeavors in the publishing and political fields, during which time he made the Illinois Staats-Zeitung one of the leading journals of the United States and gained for himself an envious reputation in social and political circles, has earned for him the right to the short but pleasant rest which is in prospect for him on his trip to Europe. He takes with him the best wishes of all of his brother editors, who earnestly hope that he will soon return safely to his adopted country and city."</p>

   <p>The Chicago Evening Star has this to say:</p>
   <p>"Captain George Schneider, editor and owner of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, has been appointed United States Consul at Helsingoer, Denmark. Helsingoer was made famous by Shakespeare, who selected the city for the scene of his tragedy "Hamlet" The importance of this place as a commercial or political center is not known to us, but we believe that the post is one of great consequence. We hope so, for nobody in Chicago deserves a good position more than Mr. Schneider. We have known him for few years, and during the greater part of this time we have seen him fight for freedom and against slavery, laboring to spread those principles which found their personification in the Republican party. He has made his newspaper an excellent one, and except on a very few occasions, has used its influence to promote just causes. He is a radical anti-slaver, and in his appointment, as well as in that of Mr. Z. Eastman, Esquire, who is an abolitionist of the old school, we see the proof that the Administration does not intend to deny its obligations to the radical, anti-slavery element."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Post remarks:</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"To our great satisfaction we learn that our fellow citizen Mr. George Schneider, publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, has been appointed to the United States Consulate at Helsingoer, Denmark. The post is a good one. Helsingoer lies on one of the most important trade routes leading to the Baltic Sea. Mr Schneider will do his official duties well; he is a very able man, and, as far as personal relations are concerned, he will soon win the respect and confidence of the people with whom he will be associated for some time.</p>
   <p>"We gladly testify to the high character of Mr. Schneider. He is an able editor and has always conducted himself like a gentleman. Even in the heat of battle and in the excitement created by the rapidly transpiring events and by the violence of party strife, he has always acted with the dignity and decorum of an honorable opponent. For ten years he did editorial work, for ten years he was an industrious partner. During the time he served this city and state he was ten times as successful as some men who had held office, and he reaped a rich harvest from the gratitude of the people. By appointing Mr. Schneider to this post Mr. Lincoln is merely performing a duty towards a political friend.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The President has selected a competent and honorable gentleman to undertake very responsible and confidential work. We will miss the friendly countenance of our friend as we wend our way through the streets of the city, and his name will no more appear on the list of journalists. But when he tires of his official position, and longs for the excitement which is always present in the life of a journalist, we hope to be able to welcome his return to his city and his profession."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Telegraph, a German evening newspaper which was lately established by Georg Feuchtinger, long a foreman in the printing shop of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, says:</p>
   <p>"President Lincoln has appointed Mr. George Schneider, one of the publishers of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, to the United States Consulate at Helsingoer, Denmark. Mr. Schneider was called to Washington by telegram, for the purpose of receiving special messages.</p>
   <p>"We are happy to know that the editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung has <span class="page-break">5</span>received honorable recognition from our Government. His publication was founded thirteen years ago, and since then it has developed from an insignificant beginning to a position of competitive equality with the largest establishments of its kind in the country. Everybody knows that the lives of editors and newspaper publishers are not beds of roses, and therefore we can sincerely congratulate our colleague upon his good fortune."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Evening Journal publishes the news of Mr. Schneider's appointment, but makes no comment, and the Chicago Times does not mention the appointment, very likely because the editors of that paper are still quite unfamiliar with the local publishing business and do not know Mr. Schneider personally.</p>
   <p>The members of the Anglo-American press, whose comments we have reported above, and one of whom (the editor of the Chicago Post), has had a long political feud with the publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, have shown that they are gentlemen in the true sense of the word. We can only regret that among the representatives of the German press there is one mean fop so completely in the <span class="page-break">6</span>power of his jealousy and diabolical malice that he is not ashamed to slander a man under whose supervision he worked for many years, and who is just about to leave for Europe on a confidential mission for his adopted country.</p>
   <p>We refer our readers to an article published by Mr. Schlaeger in last Friday's issue of the so-called Chicago Union.</p>
