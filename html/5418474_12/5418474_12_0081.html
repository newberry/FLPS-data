   <p>The officers of the 2nd regiment nominated Dr. Florenz Ziegeld, to the post of Superior.</p>
   <p>In the beginning the Doctor declined resolutely, to accept the command, but when he was assured of support by some of the West Side's prominent citizens, he finally agreed. Official election will be to-morrow evening. Dr. Ziegfeld was born at Jever, Oldenburg, where his father was prominet at the Court of the Grandduke. The elder Ziegfeld, was an ardent lover of music and guided his young son towards the realm of art. Ziegfeld, Jr., at the early age of 15, was sent to America to recuperate, but returned to study at the Leipzig conservatory. Upon graduation he revisited our shores, and became associated with many ventures, especially those where diplomatic conduct and capacity are essential. His education is thorough and versatile, his title of doctor identifies him as an M.D.</p>
   <p>His last important position was Inspector of Marksmen at the Staff of General Fitz Simmons. Under his supervision, the marksmanship of the 1st Brigade has been greatly improved.</p>
