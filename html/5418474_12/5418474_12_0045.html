   <p>A man died yesterday whose memory will be highly honored, particularly by the Germanic descendants of our population. Frederick C. Hieronimus departed this life in quiet solitude at his home, 4400 St. Lawrence Avenue. He is the man that brewed the first beer here in Chicago, more than thirty years ago. In 1860 he arrived in Chicago and found employment by H. V. Bemis. Not having material wealth, and not being able to speak English, he nevertheless, carried a treasure within his head, namely, the knowledge of beer brewing. The firm of Bemis and Ringe made the first use of his knowledge, and what a colossal industry the brewing of beer has become! Two years ago Hieronimus celebrated his fiftieth anniversary as master of the art of brewing. As a pioneer of brewing he undoubtedly remembered, when he was able to observe in his quiet seclusion the fabulous growth of this industry, the old days of his activities.</p>
   <p>Hieronimus left a fortune of $300,000.00 which will be inherited by his sons and daughters.</p>
