   <p>Your assertion in today's extra edition wherein you declare Clybourn Avenue to be the foremost street of the North Side, prompts me to inform you that my husband, Casper Hahn, was the first to build a house and store at 35 Clybourn Ave. During the removal of the still smoldering debris, it was necessary to drench the ground constantly as the fire continued to rekindle itself. There are witnesses living today who can affirm my statements. For instance, Mr. Heinrich Giesel, of Chaska, Minn., who has come to our city to celebrate Chicago Day.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, I may add that three years ago my husband was honored with a gold medal for having been in business for 39 years at the same location.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Casper Hahn</p>
