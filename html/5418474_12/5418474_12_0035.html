   <p>It is indeed commendable of Chicago's English press to forget former political animosities, and to remind their readers on the occasion of C. Hesing's 69th birthday, of his many distinguished services and merits. These manifestations on the part of the English press came entirely unexpectedly for Hesing, and since the English press has so kindly consented to give him credit, it is fitting that we summarize briefly what they have to say about his outstanding achievements for this city and its German population.</p>
   <p>The English press enphasizes in particular Hesing's fruitful activity in behalf of the Union during the Civil War; his great zeal against slavery prior to the Civil War; his talents for organization and his political strategy when he was the leader in local politics; his powerful as well as successful life as publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung; his unexcelled political and strategical mastery by which he defeated in an intensive battle the domination of puritanical Sunday laws and thereby assured a reasonably free Sunday, as well as civil liberty for seven days of the week for the young metropolis; and finally his tact which he manifested in demanding equal rights for the German-Americans and in increasing their prestige, <span class="page-break">2</span>without ever denying his American patriotism, but on the contrary, harmonizing his ambition with his patriotism.</p>
   <p>The press also generously gave him credit for the humane and self-sacrificing manner in which he devotes all his time and strength, since he no longer takes active part in politics, to those excellent German charitable institutions, as for instance, the Elizabeth Hospital, the House of Providence, and especially the German Old People's Home, Of course, they do not forget his energetic efforts for the German Schiller Theater.</p>
