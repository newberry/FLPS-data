   <p>Last night many of the friends of John G. Gindele, former chairman of the Board of Public Works, met in the hall of the Concordia Maennerchor, on Randolph Street, to give recognition, by word and act, to the long and faithful service which he rendered to the public of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>If any official of our city deserves the gratitude of his fellow citizens, it is Mr. Gindele. Numerous magnificient buildings, which will be the pride of Chicago for centuries to come, were erected under the direct supervision of Mr. Gindele, and many of them according to plans which he drew up personally. The lake tunnel would still exist only on paper, if he had not used his engineering knowledge and experience, and, not least, his influence to see the project through. It was he who recommended the use of great iron conduits which served their purpose well, both as water and land shafts; and it was he also who carefully superintended and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>personally directed the construction of the tunnel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gindele himself made the plans for the Washington Street tunnel and supervised the construction of its first units. Before a decade has passed, communication between the various parts of the city will be made chiefly by tunnels, the practicability of which has been proved by the Washington Street tunnel, which was designed by, and partly built under the supervision of, John G. Gindele.</p>
   <p>Another Public project for which he made the plans, and which will exercise a great influence upon the commerce of Chicago for years to come, is the deepening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which will give us a direct waterway for shipping via the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
   <p>The reconstruction and enlargement of the building housing the city <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>waterworks, the splendid water tower, and a host of smaller structures that were made necessary by the marvelous growth of Chicago, also testify to the skill of John G. Gindele, and to his untiring zeal for the welfare of the citizens of the metropolis of the West.</p>
   <p>As stated before, the gathering at Concordia Hall was attended by a great many of Mr. Gindele's friends; among them were the members of the board of Public Works and of Concordia Maennerchor. Mr. J. K. Thompson, chairman of the Board of Public Works, addressed him as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Gindele! You have been invited to meet some of your friends who desire to again voice their recognition and appreciation of the many services which you have rendered to your fellow citizens during your able administration of a public office, as well as in your private life. I have been chosen to present this token of appreciation and esteem (two <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>thousand five hundred dollars' worth of bonds) to you, whom we all know to be, and respect as, a good friend and an able and conscientious public official. Please accept this token in the same spirit in which we tender it, and be assured that we shall always deem it an honor to be counted among your friends. We wish you continued success during the remaining days of your life.</p>
   <p>Ex-Governor Hoffman, president of Concordia Maennerchor, then addressed Mr. Gindele as follows:</p>
   <p>"Permit me to thank you, Mr. Gindele, and to shake your hand, in the name of the Germans of Chicago, for bringing honor upon the German name by your splendid work as an officer of the city and by your kindness to many unfortunates. We are proud, very prous, of you, and we want you and all citizens of Chicago to know it."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Mr. Gindele was deeply touched and responded thus:</p>
   <p>"Misfortune at home makes it impossible for me adequately to express my feelings at the moment. I was very much surprised this morning when your committee invited me to appear here this evening. I am especially pleased to see so many members of the Board of Public Works with whom I had the pleasure of working for a number of years. They were always friendly and always willing to co-operate in promoting the welfare of their fellow citizens of Chicago. Friends, you have gathered here to do me honor. I assure you that I know of no reason why you should do so. I was elected by the people, and the people expected me to do my full duty. I did the work involved in my responsible office as well as I could; if I have thereby merited the recognition of my fellow citizens--well, that is all that is necessary, and I am perfectly satisfied. I shall never forget this moment. I shall always remember it with a heart filled with gratitude. I thank you for the honor you have bestowed upon me and for the tangible <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>evidence of your esteem."</p>
