   <p>An eloquent pen is silent, and a leader of the people is dead! H. Raster graced and enriched journalism, because he aspired to lofty aims, and his methods were clean and genuine. He penetrated powerfully into the chaos of politics. He was too magnanimous for party bickerings. He served his party well, but better still did he serve his country. His best thoughts and efforts were not tendered to politics only, but to the best interests and progress of humanity in particular. Science, art, and literature were his joy and recreation.</p>
   <p>As a German-American journalist, which was his special field of activity, he attained justly immortal fame. Having a thorough understanding of German thoughts, his efforts were directed towards liberalizing and harmonizing them with American institutions. He believed in the cultural mission of German pedagogy, and he also thought that the higher German ideals could develop freely under the American form of government. No American patriot ever manifested <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>greater devotion to true liberty under the stars and stripes than Mr. Raster. Being an ideal of a German-American patriot and being highly cultured and educated, his peculiar characteristics as a natural born leader exerted great influence, of which he made use for the general public welfare. Journalism is suffering a great loss due to his death. His high intellectual capacities were joined to a noble heart, and to have lost him as citizen and friend will be sincerely deplored. However, his works and his accomplishments will not perish, although the silent grave demands the mortal remains.</p>
