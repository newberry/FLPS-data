   <p>Last Wednesday I received a copy of the Chicago Times, which in the form of an interview with a certain Matthews and others makes a number of accusations against certain county commissioners and against myself relative to the sale of a plot of land for the county hospital.</p>
   <p>Although these accusations were based only on hearsay, they were worded so, as to give the reader the impression that they were based on incontrovertible facts. The headings were worded with such diabolical skill, that one who perused them cursorily, would draw the conclusion that a great theft had been committed. It was asserted that Mr. Mathews had said, that Mr. Periolat had told him, that a certain amount of money ($5,000.00) would be necessary to assure my influence; that an assignation for this amount had been given to Mr. Periolat, but had later been returned to the giver.</p>
   <p>To all this I have to answer that every word of it is an infamous lie. In order to remove any doubts in the mind of the reader, I wish to give a brief summary of all the transactions involved.</p>
   <p>The county commissioners decided on August 18, 1873, to buy the plot of Mr. Mathews, at the corner of Ashland and 12th Street. As I considered the price too high and as I was opposed to its location, I went to see Mr. H. B. Miller and told him so. Mr. Miller informed me that eight commissioners had voted "aye" and that he as chairman had done the same.</p>
   <p>An article, inspired by me appeared in the Staats Zeitung of August 25, stating the reasons why the hospital should not be built there. The article mentioned that a location close to the new marine hospital (Lakeview) would be much more desirable.</p>
   <p>At their next meeting the county commissioners reconsidered their first decision.</p>
   <p>During the following three months all my time was taken up by the elections and I did not hear a word concerning the hospital.</p>
   
   <p>After the elections, a man who introduced himself as Mr. Matthews, came to see me. He said to me: "Mr. Hesing, I wish to satisfy you. You can make 1,000 dollars in this business if you drop your opposition against the purchase of my plot. I told him that I was not interested in such an unethical transaction and please not to importune me any more.</p>
   <p>As for Mr. Periolat, I never had any dealings with him. I know nothing of the purchase of Col. Baldwin's plot. Although Col. Baldwin is one of my old friends, I have never spoken to him, nor to any of the commissioners concerning the purchase of his plot.</p>
   <p>I never allow the Times to enter my house because I do not want to see it polluted. And I say that if some one should shoot W. F. Storey down in the open street as one would a mad dog, no jury of 12 men could be found in this city, which would consider this man guilty of murder.</p>
