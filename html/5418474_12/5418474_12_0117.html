   <p>We have again lost a Comrade. Wilhelm Bracke died yesterday after a long illiness.</p>
   <p>He was an example of a Socialist Comrade, true to the last.</p>
   <p>Knowing that death was coming he chose for his successor a true blue comrade like himself; his successor's name is Auer. Wilhelm Bracke will be missed by all his Comrades.</p>
