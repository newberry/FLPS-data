   <p>The young attorney, Joseph Kennard, was listed this morning on Judge Altgeld's docket accused of flagrant, leech-like tactics. Kennard succeeded in obtaining a verdict of $3000 as compensation for damages awarded to Miss Hawlick, a poor girl, who became permanently crippled as a result of having been run over by a cab of the "Chicago Hansom Cab Co." and thereafter he demanded $1750 for his services.</p>
   <p>Judge Altgeld gave lecture of disapprobation to the youthful extortioner (Verbatim-leech) and advised him in strong terms to voluntarily decrease his demans by next Tuesday, at which time the judge will give his verdict.</p>
