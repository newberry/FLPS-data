   <p>Two meetings are given in its interest.</p>
   <p>The mass-meeting of last Saturday at the Armory of the 2nd Begiment which was to be a great demonstration in favor of the 8 hour day did not come up to the predicted expectations. Not more than 500 people were present and only 3 of the 7 speakers who were announced, appeared. Nevertheless, these three, Judge Altgeld, Mr. Hempstead Washburne and Assistant Corporation Counsel Darrow received generous applause, in recognition of their statments.</p>
   <p>Judge Altgeld disapproved all the 8 hour law objections with great ingenuity and showed, that high wages go hand in hand with good times. A splendidly arranged dance finished the program of the evening.</p>
   <p>(Next meeting, at the Vorwaerts-Turnhalle under the auspices of the Central Labor Union.)</p>
