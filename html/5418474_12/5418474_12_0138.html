   <p>Your "absolutely reliable source of information" is not quite as trustworthy as you assume. I refer to your statement in this column that I wanted to become a justice of the peace and police court judge on the North Side.</p>
   <p>I was not an applicant. (As you undoubtedly know, a police court judge is appointed by the mayor with the consent of the City Council.) However, one of the county judges who wanted to make some recommendations for this office, which vitally concerns the poor man, asked me if I would accept such an appointment, and I replied that I would if I received the unanimous vote of the judges.</p>
   <p>This explains everything, as far as I am concerned. Among the friends who regret that the decision of the judges was that only one German should be <span class="page-break">\2</span>nominated in each division, I count my friend Michaelis, and, presumably, also the editor in chief of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. (Editor's note: "Why, of course!")</p>
   <p>With sincere thanks for your interest, I remain,</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>L. Brentano.</p>
