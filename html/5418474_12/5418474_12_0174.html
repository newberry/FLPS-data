   <p>For several days you has been invited, by public papers and posters, to attend a meeting to be held at Farwell Hall, on Friday, Oct. 29th, for the purpose of downing all attempts to destroy the purity of the ballot box. It was distinctly announced that the meeting would have no partisan character, since the purity of elections was the common interest of all honest and well meaning citizens, without regard to their political preference.</p>
   <p>In the course of the day appointed for the meeting, a number of friends urged me to attend. I thus went there in obedience to the public call, as a business man, to attend a non-partisan meeting. Taking a seat in the rear of the hall, I listened to the speeches of Mr. E. C. Larned and Mr. Thomas Hoyne, approving of and applauding almost everything they said. When at the close of Mr. Larned's speech some over-zealous friend of mine called my name, I took no notice of it, and continued in my seat as a quiet listener.</p>
   <p>But what was my surprise when Mr. Hoyne having closed his remarks, a set of resolutions, not prepared by a committed appointed for that purpose by the meeting itself, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but evidently manufactured in the Republican central committee, was sprung upon the assemblage - a set of resolutions replete with wild, reckless and utterly unfounded charges against me. In this resolutions it was averred that a "gross outrage upon the sacred rights of the people" had been committed by a majority of the Board of County Commissioners, in having refused to give to the Republican party a fair representation in the several boards of election; that by such arbitrary action the opposition ticket was convicted of intent to cheat at the polls; that the action of the County Commissioners was a monstrous infringement of the fundamental right of the American citizen, and that allying himself with members of the Board of County Commissioners, known to be corrupt, Mr. A. C. Hesing has forfeited the respect and confidence of the better class of our citizens.</p>
   <p>Now, I put it to you, every one of you, merchants and business men of Chicago, whether any of you, if present at a meeting where such charges were brought against you, would quietly pocket the insult and would renounce the right of every free man to be heard in reply to charges consisting of reckless assertions without the slightest supporting evidence of facts?</p>
   <p>Messrs merchants and business man of Chicago, there is a belief prevailing abroad - <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>among the foreigners - that America is the country of free speech and of fairness even among political adversaries. But the meeting of last Friday, in Farwell Hall, has shown that that belief is wrong; that free speech and the defense of a man charged with heinous offenses in a public meeting is not tolerated; that a so-called non-partisan meeting may be dragged so far down as to seek to destroy the character and good name of a business man and to hoot him down and hustle him off the stand if he attempts to refute the charges brought against him.</p>
   <p>In conclusion I wish to say that you, merchants and business men of Chicago, are made the willing fools of a political clique, whose principal stock in trade consists of the vilest slander. You mean to, and you believe you do, act as honest citizens, when such men as Wilbur F. Storey, that curse and bane of the city of Chicago, are laughing in their sleeves at the gullibility with which you swallow the tallest lies got up for the purpose of blackening the character of a man who for nearly twenty years, has stood before the people of this city and who is willing to have his record for honor and honesty compared with that of any of you, Messrs. merchants and business men of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A. C. Hesing</p>
