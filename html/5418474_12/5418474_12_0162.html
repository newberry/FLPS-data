   <p>We have no special objection to urge against the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>es' opposition to Mr. Brentano; judging by the past, it augurs well for Mr.Brentano's success.But the Times cannot be per<span class="gap">[gap]</span>itte to lie about him.The fact is, that Mr.Brentano is a thorough linguis, a fine English,<span class="gap">[gap]</span>,French, and classical scholar. Partly owing <span class="gap">[gap]</span> foreign bir <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and partly owing to his manner of speech, his accent is so<span class="gap">[gap]</span> noticeable,but never unintelligible. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ut as to his knowledge of the English language,he certainly <span class="gap">[gap]</span> it better th<span class="gap">[gap]</span>n the gentlemen <span class="gap">[gap]</span> have the run of the editorial page of the Chicago Times.</p>
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span> chronic talker is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to be a nuisance than a benefit in Congress. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span>on. Carter <span class="gap">[gap]</span>arrison has done something in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of demonstrating this proposi<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ion. Ready speech-making is not the best recommendation for a congression<span class="gap">[gap]</span>l candidate, and, if it were, we do not see that Mr. Le Moyne (who didn't open his <span class="gap">[gap]</span>outh at the last session of Congress that we know of) <span class="gap">[gap]</span>s any advantage over Mr. Brentano.</p>
