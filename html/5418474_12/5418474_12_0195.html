   <p>There is a rumor about that I intend to withdraw my candidacy for congress in the 3rd district. Two newspapers have made a remark to that effect. I wish to contradict such an assertion and to state that I shall present myself as candidate before the opposition convention. But should there by any one better fitted to unite all the people against the party of corruption and monopoly, I shall gladly withdraw and support any one who can bring us victory. May I add here that I only expect honest votes and that I do not intend to get any support through the influence of money.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing.</p>
