   <p>p. 4.. Hundreds of Americans who received kind and courteous treatment at the hands of Mr. Brentano when he was consul at Dresden will resent as false and slanderous what the Chicago Times asserts respoecting that gentleman. We can tell Mr. LeMoyne, in whose interest those untrue and defamatory charges are made, that the wisest thing he can do is to call off his dog.</p>
   <p>He is not going to beat the Republican candidate by getting his organ to publish a mess of contemptible lies against him. Mr. Brentano was the best and most efficient consul that has ever held office at Dresden, and our minister at Berlin stated that he was one of the very best in Germany. It is rather contemptible for LeMoyne to be making these mean attacks upon a man who is his superior in ability, attainments, and statesmanship.</p>
