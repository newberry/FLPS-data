   <p>The people of Illinois elect one hundred and fifty representatives and fifty senators to do their legislative business..... The making of the laws, such a representative body reflecting the likeness of the people, is what has been called "government of the people by the people," in contradistinction to "personal government," of the "one man power."</p>
   <p>But a person of the name of Antony Caesar Hesing - a man born under the flag of foreign despot, inheriting from an indefinite ancestry a personal character fashioned, modified, and molded by the influences of despotic institutions; educated in a despotic school, and brought up, until past middle age, in the habits and modes of life and thought peculiar to a despotic state, which habits and modes, instead of endeavoring to outgrow them, he has persistently stuck to in a spirit of clannish fanaticism; this man enters the lobby of the House of Assembly, gives a signal to some servile place-hunters in the body, and, lo! an act of legislation which he commands, is done!</p>
   <p>..... Suppose that the transplanted Austria, Hesing, or one of his servile parasites (say Mr. John Rountree) were mayor of Chicago, and the municipal <span class="page-break">\2</span>legislature should decline any longer to commit an annual violation of the supreme law of the state by voting away the money to taxpayers to pay for publishing the public records of the city in a foreign language. Does any gentleman at Springfield doubt that the one man interested in the German printing steal would forbear to use the one-man power conferred on him by this most mischievous device of legislative folly, to bring the municipal legislature into obedience to his mercenary desire?</p>
   <p>If any man thinks so, charity compels the opinion that he must be very ignorant of the character of the transplanted Austrian, and of those characters most apt to profit by his favor.</p>
   <p>It is said that "the Cook County members will probably be a unit in favor of the measure." Do they then all confess themselves to be humble servants of the transplanted Austrian who boasts that he carries the "German vote" in his pocket? Do they seek for no higher or worthier guide of political action than the behest of a person trained in the habits and methods of old-world despotism, and who, as an American citizen, has shown a persistent unsympathy with and dislike of American institutions - nay, whose vehement boast of a desire to Austrianize this country is notorious?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Do they think that the true conception of a popular representative government is a law-making system allowing laws made by a representative body of the people to be amended by the decree of a single individual? Do they think that one manin a magic seat is more likely to be endowed with greater wisdom, honesty, and integrity than twenty-seven men in legislative chairs? Do they think it reconcilable with any principle of free government that the executive function should be made to include the major part of the legislative or sovereign function?</p>
   <p>If the "Cook County members" think these things, the best advice that can be given them is that they give a little time to the study of the rudiments, to the acquisition of some knowledge of the A. B. C.'s, of the institutions of the country in which they live.</p>
