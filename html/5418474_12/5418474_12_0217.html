   <p>The Tribune, which is not able to talk any longer about "liberal" assemblies because there are not any, is resorting to misrepresentations and lies about the Republican meetings. In yesterday's edition it lies as follows: "In administrative circles a story is told about Mr. Washington Hesing, the son of the owner of the "Illinois Staats Zeitung." His friends say that he recently made a speech at a Grant meeting. After having praised Grant excessively, he tore down Greeley. His sttacks on Greeley were so exaggerated that some of the audience protested.</p>
   <p>This interruption so angered the speaker that he invited all the Greeleyites to leave the place. When Mr. Hesing made this request there were about 130 persons present, when he wanted to continue his speech for the grantists, there were only six people left."</p>
   <p>Every word of this account is a lie.</p>
