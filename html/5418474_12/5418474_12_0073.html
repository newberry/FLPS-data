   <p>Sometime ago we were informed that Mr. E. H. Lehmann, millionaire and well known owner of "The Fair", the gigantic department store, was gradually losing his mind. A telegram we received today, from Little Rock, Arkansas, fully confirms this. He is amaniac. While the train stopped at the depot, Mr. Lehmann escaped from his attendants; he was recaptured with considerable difficulty and returned to the train.</p>
   <p>His condition has been diagnosed as paresis, (softening of the brain) Apparently, there is no hope for a cure.</p>
