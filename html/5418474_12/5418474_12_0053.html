   <p>Later, the revolutionists were persecuted, and Raster was compelled to emigrate. He chose the United States, and came here with the determination to become a good citizen of the republic, and to establish a home of his own....</p>
   <p>A short time after, he became editor of the (German) Evening Newspaper in New York. Through his brilliant articles, and attractive arrangements of the reading matter, he soon gained a good reputation. At that time he became a reformer of the German-American Press, by fighting for a better style and against the use of foreign words.</p>
   <p>When the Republican Party was organized he took part with ardent zeal and enthusiasm, and although he had shortly before received his citizenship papers, he was made an elector at the presidential election in 1856. This proves his great popularity even at that time.</p>

In his reports and letters he stood definitely and with convincing power on the side of the Union, thereby creating a friendly attitude toward the union in Germany, which favored the acceptance of her bonds.....</p>
   <p>In 1867 Raster was called by A. C. Hesing to become the chief editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, which opened for him a tremendous field of activity. The Staats Zeitung was then one of the largest German newspapers. He quickly became familiar with the public life of the West, and not only achieved greatness in journalism in western journalism, but he also became quite eminent in national politics.....</p>
   <p>As a member of the Republican National convention at Philadelphia in 1872, he was the author of that famous paragraph 16 of the Republican platform, which led the party at that time towards liberal tendencies in regard to the matter of alcoholic drinks.....</p>

   <p>As a member of the first Board of Directors of the Public Library in Chicago, Raster attained also great merits! He contributed much to a practical and sound policy and it therefore rapidly became a hugh success.

   <p>During the last years he was also a member of the directors of the School Board in Cook County. In this capacity he fought for a sensible method of instruction.</p>
   <p>His greatness, however, was most apparent in his German American journalistic activity.
