   <p>Mr. Carl Sievers died in his apartment, at 15 S. Desplaines Street, two days ago. He was born October 13, 1829, in Gross-Burgwedel near Hannover. In 1844 he passed his examination as a blacksmith. In 1847 he joined the Engineers' Corps in Hannover and attended technical and other high schools. Due to his industry and perseverance he was made an officer. As a special distinction he was made a tax official in Emden, Oldenburg.</p>
   <p>In October, 1865, he came to Chicago. He immediately joined the Arbeiter Verein and in due time became a member of its board, its president, treasurer, secretary, and librarian. He was of those who worked with all their strength to make the Arbeiter Verein, as it were, the German central association on the South Side. Nevertheless, he remained true to it when the Arbeiter Verein was transferred to the West Side, thereby irrevocably degenerating into a merely local organization. Sievers was one of the main supporters of the Arbeiter Verein when it got into financial difficulties. His influence among the members who are otherwise not easily managed, was great.</p>

   <p>Sievers had a tavern on S. Wells (between Lake and Randolph), the upper floor of which he used to give, free of charge, to the Arbeiter Verein and craft associations.</p>
   <p>Der Deutsche Arbeiter (the German worker), a weekly that treated the labor question from the point of view of La Salle, was for several years assisted by Sievers with money, work and free space, until it ceased publication at the beginning of the Franco-German War.</p>
   <p>In the electoral campaign of 1869, he was very active in getting together a labor ticket and helped to nominate and elect Max Eberhardt as Justice of the Peace, and Daniel Cameron as member of the Legislature. He was one of the best agitators and knew how to organize meetings; in the past five years he was especially active in the anti-Temperance movement.</p>

   <p>Sievers was a member of Concordia Lodge of the Druids, of the William Tell Lodge of the Harugari, and of the Pocahontas Tribe of the Red Men, and filled responsible positions. His death is a loss to the Germanism of Chicago.</p>
