Songs, plays and dancing followed in gay succession and entertained the guests satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>The main celebration was the transmission of the magnificent flag by Miss Batter to the president Albert Floms who took possession of same with a heart-felt speech. The festival speech held by Mr.G.Roessler was a masterpiece of real German popular National people's festival, which caused jubilant applause in the great hall.
