   <p>Considerable disappointment awaits us as an announcement from reliable quarters proclaims that next year's census may exclude information about language origin of individuals, only the question of birthplace being considered. What reasons prompted this change in the questionnaire has not been divulged, since the assertion of lack of space to print it is hardly tenable and cannot be regarded seriously. Evidently such an omission will surely conjure some awful discrepancies on the origin of many present-day Americans. A statement of the immigrant's birthplace is no criterion for his bona fide nationality, i. e., the original race to which he claims kinship.</p>
   <p>A German, for instance, may have been born in the erstwhile Austrian Bohemia, but in the next enumeration, if the present plan is followed, <span class="page-break">2</span>he would be designated as a native Czechoslovak, yet the fact that he is a product of German culture disappears in the subsequent statistical conclusions of the census. A Hungarian who years ago migrated from Siebenbuergen does not become a Rumanian because his native land has been ceded to Rumania, but the census statistics regard him as one. Does a Lithuanian from Wilno become a Pole quite suddenly, because the Poles grabbed that city? Will the German-speaking Balto-Slavs be Letts or Estonians due to political changes resulting from the World War? And what about the Germanborn Alsatians during the German regime, will they be French now since that land was given over to France? And those actually born in the newly formed European states, will they be weaned thereby from their original language and cultural surroundings? Those who are born in Poland today may be Poles according to political definitions, but ethnologically, if their parents are German, they belong to the German and not to the Polish race, and therefore must be counted as Germans.</p>
   <p>A political classification of immigrants based on birthplace has no significance <span class="page-break">3</span>whatever in giving a clue to the composite character of the American people. The racial origin of our settlers is the only factor which affects us. The confusion also will be greatly increased, because many former immigrants do not know definitely to which country their birthplace belongs at present. And, if the immigrants know it, most of their children lack this information. To offset this, however, every child knows positively what language the parents spoke. He may not be able to speak the parental tongue but he understands it in his own way, at least enough to differentiate mother's words from other languages. The Slovene whose natal home belongs to Italy today, may not be aware of this fact. He only knows that his parents spoke the Slovene language and not Italian. He will therefore consider them and also himself as being of Slovene origin. The immigrant does not bring his natal place to America, but the language remains, and it irks him that he should suddenly be forced to belong to a nation with which he never had anything in common.</p>
   <p>Whoever knows the fundamental racial contrasts existing among certain European people, will fully understand the immigrant's antipathy when he is suddenly <span class="page-break">4</span>enumerated as a member of a nation which he has been taught from infancy to regard as an enemy.</p>
   <p>The question of native language should not be omitted, for it is it alone that guides us in a correct analysis of our mixed American people. One could even disregard the information about nativity in its entirety. Where someone was born is immaterial, as far as the purpose of our statistics is concerned. The important point is the race from which the enumerated claims descent.</p>
   <p>The question about the mother tongue will always be answered correctly, be it about one's own language or the parents', but any inquiry involving one's birthplace is prone to give rise to many errors as well as falsifications, and statistics based thereon become worthless.</p>
