   <p>Conrade Paul Grottkau announced in yesterday's Arbeiter Zeitung, that he never in a meeting or in private circles had let himself be influenced by friend or enemy.</p>
   <p>Grattkau is right in saying the statement is false. "As long as I have been in politics I have always been independent and never listened to any advice, always done what I thought was right regardless of friend or enemy, and that I have never belonged to the Lycer Clique."</p>
