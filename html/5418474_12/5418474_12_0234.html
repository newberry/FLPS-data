   <p>The burial of E. H. Stein took place yesterday from the house of the deceased, at 520 N. Dearborn. The grandmaster of the lodge to which Mr. Stein belonged, Mr. Spiegel, spoke at the coffin the prayers and formulas which the Masonic rites prescribes. Otherwise no religious or any other ceremonies were performed in the house. At one o'clock the procession of about thirty carriages started for Rosehill. Shortly before three, it arrived at the entrance of the cemetery.</p>
   <p>The wind seemed to bring greetings from the old blackened Taborite city on the Moldau where stood the cradle of the deceased. Aside from the Masonic Lodge about thirty friends and acquaintances were present. None of the singing societies to which Mr. Stein belonged and who might have sung many a song about his generosity were represented.</p>
   <p>Stein was a noble man and in that lay the secret of his popularity. He enjoyed no career in public office, and his business success, though great, would not have been sufficient to bring his name to everybody's tongue nor to make him the idol of his countrymen as well as of his American fellow citizens.</p>
