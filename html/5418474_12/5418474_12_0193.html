   <p>An action, as few are to be recorded in the political history of our times, has taken place in Chicago. Mr. Hesing, who at the convention of the opposition party on October 5th, had unanimously been nominated as representative of the third congressional district, declined to accept the nomination. As reason for his declinature he gave the strange condition of his financial situation. In spite of his declinature he was renominated four times by the convention, and each time he refused the nomination in the same stoical manner. Finally his name was withdrawn and on the advice of Mr. Hesing, Mr. Le Moine was nominated.</p>
   <p>There are few today who can resist the temptation of entering congress, especially men in the situation of Mr. Hesing, to whom the election to such an office offers, the opportunity of regaining his lost fortune. The declination of the honor and of the position is an eloquent proof, that Mr. Hesing stands above any suspicion of corruption. Such a case is rare and on account of that, deserves recognition. This action honors not only Mr. Hesing, but all the German citizens. (The New Yorker Democrat, is a bitter political adversary of Hesing and of the Illinois Staats Zeitung.)</p>
