   <p>Pastor Joseph Hartmann succumbed, yesterday, after a short illness, at the home of his daughter. The great loss is felt not only by his family but by his parishioners in whose welfare he was deeply interested. The poorer class has lost a faithful friend and helper, the Evangelical Church of America one of its most prominent representatives, and the city of Chicago a noble citizen. Pastor Hartmann was born September 18th, 1823 at Bornheim in the Bavarian Rheinpfalz. Showing a very keen intellect, in his youth, the clerical profession was chosen for him and he soon entered the Latin School at Speyer for the intended educacation. Later he attended the college at Zweibrucken and had the distinction of being its model student. He studied philosophy and theology at the Universities of Bonn and Utrecht in Holland, in both of which he soon was recognized as an excellent orator and chosen by the latter student body as its president and official speaker. Showing distinctly his partisanship during the year 1848, he knew that Germany wouldn't require his services and therefore, decided with his young wife, Eva, to make America a future home. The officials of the United Synod at Cleveland examined and ordained him. His first position <span class="page-break">\2</span>was at Constableville, New York, and he was worshipped by the members of the community. In 1851 he was called to St. Paul's Evangelical Community of Chicago, to succeed the Pastor, Dr. Fischer, arriving at his post November 18th, 1851. His brilliant sermons were so magnetic, that the little church soon proved too small for so many hundreds of people anxious to attend services on Sunday. The result was that in 1854 a big and beautiful church, the first to be built of brick in Chicago, replaced the little church. Soon this church also proved too small and he began, with that admirable energy of his, to build schools on the south west and the west sides and, later, even began to build independent communities. Pastor Hartmann contributed greatly to the development of the Evangelical church in the west, and consecrated not less than forty two churches. At the outbreak of the Civil War Pastor Hartmann was one of the first to defend from the pulpit, and also in the periodical Der <span class="gap">[gap]</span>nsfreund which he managed, the abolition of slavery and the cause of the union. To soften the heart ache caused by the death of members of the immediate family, he took a trip to Europe financed by members of the community and participated at the dedication of the Luther monument at Worms. After his return to this country, he erected an orphan's home known as the Uhlich Orphan's <span class="page-break">\3</span>Home. <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
