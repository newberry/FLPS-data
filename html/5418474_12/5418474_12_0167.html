   <p>It will be sad news for the music loving people of Chicago to learn that Mr. H. Balatka, musical conductor, has decided to leave the city where he has spent 16 years and to go to St. Louis.</p>
   <p>Those who have witnessed the energetic efforts of Mr. Balatka to give the public a better and finer understanding of music, will be deeply grieved by this announcement. Chicago has not at present another conductor with the abilities of Mr. Balatka. The greatest loss is suffered by the "Liederkranz" as Mr. Balatka had such a prominent part in its organization and development. Mr. Balatka goes to St. Louis to become music instructor at a great school there and to become director of the singers' club, "Arion of the West".</p>
