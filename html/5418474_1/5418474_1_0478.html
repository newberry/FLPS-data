   <p>During the German Teachers Day in Milwankee, Mr. Emil Dapprich, director of the German-Teachers Seminary, gave an interesting lecture on the State of German instruction in city and country. The statistics were obtained through answers to about 3000 circular letters sent to the schools of the United States.</p>
   <p>A survey of the statistics obtained, which will be published in detail, as a handbook of German school affairs in America, contains the following table:-</p>

   <p>Mr. Dapprich called his statistical information incomplete. He said:-</p>
   <p>"As a report that stretches over such a wide-spread territory, cannot reach all necessary points in one short year, the defect of incompleteness is attached to it. We know through personal experience, that, in hundreds of schools, German is taught but this could not be taken into consideration, as the teachers concerned neglected to give us their answers. If we had received from all schools, especially the public institutions, accurate reports, the result would be more gratifying. The number of pupils and teachers would be much larger, for instance, in Texas where there are counties, in which nearly every public school has German as a subject of education. As in cities, with considerable German population, the cultivation of the German language stands in no proportion to the population, it is evident, that one could bring these cities into three groups according to the rating of German as a means of culture." In the:-</p>
   <p>1. Honor group: Cincinnati, Belleville, Cleveland, Indianapolis, New Braunfels, Saginaw, Erie, Evansville, Tell City, Columbus, Hamilton, Dayton, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Davenport, Carlsstadt.</p>
   <p>2. So-So group: New York, Buffalo, Hoboken, Chicago, Sheboygan, Akron, Lancaster.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>3. Mourning group:- Detroit, Dubuque, St. Louis, Quincy, Newark, St. Paul, Pittsburg, Brooklyn, Peoria, Allegheny, Rochester, Covington, Galveston.</p>
   <p>The above notices show, that by such incomplete school statistics, this classification also, cannot make a claim to correctness.</p>
