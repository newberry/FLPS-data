   <p>In Lake Bluff, the Rendezvous of "cranks" of the most varied coloring yesterday a meeting of German Drys was held or rather it should have been held. It was a pitiful fiasco, aside from a few ministers and crazy women, the latter in deference to the holy gospel, having left their husbands at home in order to follow a far younger Reverend. Nobody appeared. The first speaker was the editor of a small church paper, The Pioneer (Der BahnBrecher)-"Prof." J. A. Schintz. The burden of his jeremiad was that the Germans had quite enough money to invest daily in some beer and liquor, but for the "Pioneer" they have nothing, nothing to spare.</p>
   <p>On the program we noticed first the far from unknown name of Pastor Schiele of the Trinity Church. After a few inquiries the reporter learned, that the Pastor probably would not speak because being much addicted to guzzling himself, he would make himself more than ridiculous by a temperance speech.</p>
