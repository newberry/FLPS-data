   <p>The National German-American School Association of Chicago, held a meeting last Thursday, with Mr. Schuricht as Chairman and Mr. Fick as Secretary. The resignation of Dr. Fredericks as member of the Board of Directors, was generally regretted. Mr. Frick proposed that two more members be added to the Board of Directors, but Mr. Schoepflin was of the opinion that it would be more to the point to appoint an agitation/committee for the purpose of propaganda. This committee shall consist of the director and ten members. This proposal met with approval and the following members of the committee were elected: Messrs. William Vocke, Emil Hoechster, Franz Gindele, Frank Arnold, Max Stern, Dr. Christmann and W. H. Lotz, Mrs. Talika Baur, Miss Anna E. Hundt and Miss Elsbeth Thiclepape. The vacant position of Dr. Fredericks was filled by the appointment of Dr. R. Seiffert. The Chairman then proposed several things of which the following were approved.</p>
   <p>I. To direct a written request to all German lodges and societies of the city of Chicago to join this association with an annual donation in accordance with the statutes.</p>
   <p>II. Public meetings in various parts of the city, under the auspices <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the German-American Societies, with the purpoze of working on the aims of the Society.</p>
   <p>III. To appoint a committee for every part of the city, and to win speakers for the meetings.</p>
   <p>IV. To keep the German language alive, all the German Societies are requested to give their support to the establishment of public German-English Kindergartens. Especially the church communities, school boards and Turn societies are requested to donate rooms necessary to house the proposed kindergartens.</p>
   <p>V. To express to the school board our appreciation for the re-installation of German in the upper primary grades of public schools, with the hope that teaching German in the lower grades will be only a question of time.</p>
   <p>VI. To acquaint all school boards and teachers that offers as well as applications for aid of German teachers will be published by the Correspondenz-Blatt free of charge.</p>
