   <p>Several independent clubs have nominated as their legislator in the Sixth District, proprietor of a brickyard in Lakeview. He is a middle aged man, born in this country, of German parents, and up to the present time has had no connection with party politics.</p>
   <p>He was nominated at a joint meeting of the independent clubs, and has accepted the nomination. His platform is opposition to the present form of the Compulsory Education law. The clubs sent the "pledge" gotten up by the German Lutheran Committee to the regular candidates in the Sixth District, and receiving no reply that was satisfactory to them made their own nomination.</p>
   <p>It is claimed by one of the most active German Lutherans who are in the present fight against the school law that Mr. Schlake as well as Mr. Wagner, who is running in the Seventh District, will if elected vote with the Democrats in the legislature on party questions. The same man says that the Lutherans expect to have six members devoted to their ideas in the legislature from Cook County. As to the County ticket he considers the chances of the Republicans good. He believes that nine-tenths of the German Lutherans and Catholics will vote either for the Democrats or for the independent candidates for the legislature and for Raab for state superintendent of schools, but otherwise, being naturally Republicans will vote their county ticket. Many Lutherans are opposed to the policy adopted by their committee.</p>
   <p>It was erroneously stated in an interview in yesterday's Tribune that the German Lutherans were fighting compulsory education. The situation, as repeatedly explained, is that, in the first place, only a portion of them is engaged in the present fight, and, secondly, that they do not mean to oppose compulsory education but only certain features of the present law.</p>
   <p>It should be remembered by them, however, that while they do not mean to oppose compulsory education, while their declaration of principles strongly indorses compulsory education, and tradition and descent naturally disposes them to be friendly to such a measure, the unfortunate wording of the pledge which their committee asks the candidates to sign commits them to a course opposing compulsory education, and not only places them in a false light, but causes candidates to withhold their signatures who are really in favor of their position.</p>
   <p>It cannot be repeated too often that this pledge has created nothing but confusion. A sentiment is growing among the German Lutherans that the committee made a mistake and ought to recall a pledge that is so unfortunately worded and return to the lines on which the fight was commenced. One of the committee said yesterday: "We are too deep in it now. We must fight it out. We cannot retreat."</p>
   <p>But they decline to send out a circular explaining their "pledge" in that sense and setting the matter in its proper light before their voters.</p>
