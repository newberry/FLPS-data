   <p>The Lilliputian and the great American press, particularly the small, which in proportion to its size makes the loudest racket, has evidently, for lack of a more auspicious topic, worked itself into such feverish truculence about the so-called "fads" in our schools, that it finally succumbed and lost its senses. A European who comes to Chicago and reads that trash inadvertently indulges in some introspection and ponders:</p>
   <p>"What sort of a dementia is it that afflicts these unfortunates? Music, drawing, claymodelling, gymnastics, mastery of another language, subjects which are everywhere considered to be the essentials of an education, are to be dispensed with, nay, are considered detrimental and must be abolished!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Don't they comprehend, that a child's inquisitive, active mind suffers from ennui and loses its powers of concentration if attention is restricted to a single subject? That variety is as much of a treat for the mind as for the stomach? That singing, gymnastics, drawing and modelling in clay are welcome exercises which interrupt the incessant, monotonous learning by heart, the three "R's" and grammar; that they expand and strengthen our lungs, give suppleness to the body, make our eyes more discerning and awaken the sense of beauty; that they create a diversified education which is necessary in the fight for existence in a modern complex civilization? Among how many gifted musicians has the love for music been aroused in the public schools, and how many great artists discovered their trend and talent during the drawing period! These obstructionists of instruction are unalterably opposed to the accumulated experience of our Old World pedagogues!"</p>

   <p>This would be the verdict of a European, and we cannot see how we can embellish it, if we were to comment on instruction in the German language: One of our contemporary newspapers feels incensed that we referred to it as the "Know-Nothing sheet." But pray tell us what other title we should deign to bestow, when it proclaims a "Know-Nothing" attitude?</p>
   <p>While it wants to have German instruction in the public schools poked, pulled, tugged and steered out of it, it is on a par with the clique which insists that in the U. S. or in Chicago, only English shall be spoken with the traditional twang of the guttural, drawling, cockney English and the genuine brogue of the Irish. The old "Know-Nothing party" discovered the principle "America for Americans!", the new one changes the quotation: "America for the English language!" And after all, English is only one of the many languages which acquired an existence here through the assimilation of immigrants who became citizens. Because the English language is an <span class="page-break">\4</span>important and indispensible means of communication for our polyglot population is no reason why it should banish all other languages in order to be omnipotent. That would make the mortar more important than the stones! It is established beyond doubt, that another language is of benefit to the pupils. Common sense tells us that in a city like Chicago, where a second language is chosen, it should be the one represented by a third of its population. Strange to say, this particular group speaks the language of a people which has reached the top of civilization. The argument as to the efficacy of the German instruction should be referred to the school board. We have the verdict of an experienced and qualified German teacher in our favor, although his personal interests rests with the other side. If results do not come up to our expectations, then the methods must be changed! If an apprentice cannot do everything which might be expected, then we don't kill him, but give him good advice so that he can do better work; and if some arrangement proves deficient, then we do not improve it by throwing it overboard.</p>

   <p>This antithesis towards the teaching of German, singing, gymnastics, drawing, clay modelling and sewing, is the fight of the "ignorant" and "dunces-by-preference" class against the seekers of knowledge; it is the spirit of medievalism against the permeable light of modernity; the banner bearers of retrogression who resent progress.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that our school board will not be influenced by the senseless gibberish of a retrogressive element, which wishes to conjure up the abysmal medieval past; we feel certain that our educators will retaliate by unfurling the flag of progress, so that Chicago may not be ridiculed by a civilized world.</p>
