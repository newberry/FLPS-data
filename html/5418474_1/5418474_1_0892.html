   <p>The Archbishop Michael Heiss of Milwaukee invites, in an enthusiastic petition, the Catholic-Americans of German origin to become actively interested in the Catholic University that is to be founded in Washington. He proposes, in his character as member of the Board of Directors, that German-American Catholics should provide the means to establish three German professorships at the University, namely a St. Bonivacius professorship in theology, a Goerres professorship in philosophy and a Windhorst professorship in jurisprudence. The foundation of the first clerical chair would require a capital of $50,000 and each of the other professorships would be $100,000. Such abundant German donations should also secure a proper representative of the Germans on the Board of Directors, forever.</p>
   <p>Archbishop Heiss turns for the above purpose, at the first, to the many wealthy among the German-American Catholics and says: "We want to enter this Spring into the almanac of the Catholic University one-hundred Germans' names who have each paid $1,000 and a thousand Germans' names that represent each a gift of $100. We all are witnesses that God has blessed many more than 1,100 German Catholics with sufficient earthly possessions; and that <span class="page-break">\2</span>no nation does more for instruction and education than has the German is proved by history. Let us do our share, so that also the Catholic University of America gives evidence of this."</p>
   <p>Also for non-Catholics it is very desirable that the purpose of the Archbishop be carried out, for such German professorships would of course contribute very much to the maintenance of German nationality within and outside the Catholic Church of this country.....</p>
