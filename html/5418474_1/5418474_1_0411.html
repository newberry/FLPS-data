   <p>While the whole nation was revelling in "prosperity", to judge from all published reports, our School Board had to contend with a lamentable shortage of funds. This scarcity of the wherewithal was so acute, that it was necessary, with the profound regrets of Mr. Cooley of course, to limit and practically abolish German in the public schools, so that the children have practically no opportunity to learn this language in the free schools. The Germans protested against the crippling of this branch but they are sensible, and consented, when it had been proven to them, that there was no alternative and the promise was given, that the German instruction program will be improved as soon as the necessary money is forthcoming.</p>
   <p>This period is now here. The money stringency has passed. For the 1903 school year considerably larger sums are available for educational purposes than have been in the previous year. For educational use, exclusive of building costs etc. $7,082,074 have been granted, and last year only $6,344,201. The Germans and other friends of German instruction have been promised, that the subject will be resumed when the means are found, but evidently no one thinks about keeping this promise. One feels assured that the dumb "Dutch" will forget it soon, and Mr.</p>

   <p>Cooley's ingenious methods will eventually do away with it entirely.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cooley devised an excellent scheme....The children are advised not to bother with it, and it appears it is the intention not to let them learn it. A diminishing of German speaking students is then a natural cause, and at the end of the school year, it can be shown that there is no demand for German instruction, according to numerical indications. For this great accomplishments, a salary increase of $3,000 is probably not too much. The plan might work well, except for one thing: the Germans will not tolerate the swindle which has been and is connected with this part of the curriculum. They will not accept it meekly, nor will they forget the promise. They will demand that it be kept, and if necessary, they know how to exert the proper pressure to procure attention. Even German patience has an end.</p>
