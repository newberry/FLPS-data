   <p>School Councilor Huttmann asked for an explanation in the meeting of the school board, held yesterday, of the justification of the move whereby the German Gymnastic System has been replaced by the Swedish Ling system in four public schools namely, the Armstrong, the Brown, the Youngman and the Drake schools, whilst in all other schools the German system is prevalent. Dr. Carl Ryder had been entrusted with the instruction of the Swedish system in the above mentioned schools. It has been aksed that a report should be made at the next meeting about this affair. The fact is that the school council has not approved of an experimental introduction of the Swedish system. Mr. Hutmann pointed out that it was intended to extend the Ling system to all the other schools and there can be no doubt that this innovation has been caused by the four Swedish school members. The report will be awaited with interest.</p>
