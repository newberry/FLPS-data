   <p>Because the income of the City of Chicago does proportionally decrease from year to year and bonds cannot be issued any more, the City Council resolved to lessen all expenses. At the most it cut down the grants for the public schools, which shall get along with $1,600,000 less than was demanded by the finance committee of the School Board. On account of this, not only all new buildings have to remain undone, although they are planned and absolutely necessary to remedy the overcrowding of many school buildings, but without doubt the attempt will be renewed to eliminate all the "fads" from instruction. As a fad is counted, not only instruction of the German language, but also drawing, gymnastics and singing as qualified branches of teaching only reading, writing and arithmetic will be allowed. This means that the public schools of the City of Chicago shall be suppressed below the average of the very poorest German village schools. Nothing shall be done to develop the body, the eye, and the talent for art. The entire education shall be organized as if all the pupils are to become "Grocery Clerks" in their later life. Individual thinking, manual training, and taste are articles of luxury which the rich city of Chicago must deny to their increasing citizenry.</p>
