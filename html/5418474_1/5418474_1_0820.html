   <p>The German language is from now on to be again a subject of instruction in those schools where it was taught before the great fire. Nine women teachers are to start again their work. The debate that extended over several sessions of the City Council showed that no member was opposed to the teaching of German on principle. Thousands of German children now have to learn to read and to write German in free schools, or have to renounce it altogether, because so many community and private schools exist no longer since the great fire.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the school Board will take these circumstances into account.</p>
