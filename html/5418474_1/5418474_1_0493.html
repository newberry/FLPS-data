   <p>p. 4 - Mayor Harrison won, as we predicted last Tuesday. The battle of the city council is now a past event, and the six gentlemen and Mrs. Sherman will be approved by the board on Monday (tomorrow) evening. The resolution of the city council's committee, which recommended yesterday that all the nominations be accepted, does not change matters in the least.</p>
   <p>Halle and Mrs. Sherman will probably gain final approval after a prolonged argument, even if 20 or 30 aldermen should vote against them. Mayor Harrison will be triumphant and after next Monday the Germans will find that their status has not been changed.</p>
   <p>If the question should arise during the next year, whether gymnastics or German should be taught again in the primary classes, we may expect only two favorable votes. Bluthardt and Halle will be our only standard bearers. Thornton, Mrs. Sherman and members of the city council, who advocated the discontinuance of the special branches last spring, are opposed to any changes now.</p>
   <p>A reporter of the Staats Zeitung elicited some information from them; their attitude is: "Let well enough alone".... The prospects are, that in this branch of our administration, we may only have three German-Americans on the board by next year, instead of four or five....</p>
   <p>The committee meeting of the city council on school matters, which ended with the non-acceptance of Halle and the approval of all the others, was indeed a stormy session. Four aldermen, Martin, Tripp, Kamerling, and Knowles, were conspicuous by their absence, and the other committee members were held at bay with the patronage-whip; all, except Noble, Sayle, and Kerr.... Grandiloquent Madden, as usual, danced to the tune of those who dole out the most jobs.</p>
   <p>Alderman Gallagher applied the only proper principle. He declared most emphatically, that the committee's only, concern must be to consider the character of the candidate and his qualifications; but the nominee's commitment to any question is, and must remain an unquestioned privilege. The decision on the German instruction in the lower classes, should be submitted to a public election and not to a half dozen aldermen.</p>
   <p>Kerr and Noble dissented, and after a short debate the matter was put to a vote. Gallagher's resolution to accept all the appointees, on masse, failed..... Halle's nomination was defeated.</p>
