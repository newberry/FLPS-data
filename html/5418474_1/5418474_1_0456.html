   <p>The Central Alliance of German Military Societies of Chicago and Suburbs resolved at its recent meeting, to protest categorically against the intended decrease of the appropriation for German instruction. The letter of protest is as follows: "It is nothing new for the School Board to feel that it has to lower the expenditures of some branch of the educational system. Nor is it new, that the German department was chosen at every crisis of that kind as being able to most easily stand the savings. It has been found, however, that children who learn German are quicker to absorb the grammar of their own mother tongue, the English language. The saving proposed by the School Board must not only be prevented, but in our opinion, the German instruction in schools should branch out more extensively. This society has authorized its committee to send a copy of this declaration to all newspapers, to the mayor, and to the School Board."</p>
