   <p>We hear that a movement has been started to induce the German women of our city to take an active interest in the German language instruction problem. This is a move in the right direction. The German woman is the best qualified judge; she, above all others, can determine the true value of German instruction in our public schools, and therefore will be a most welcome ally in the fight for its continuance. A council meeting is to be held at a private residence, in order to make arrangements for a mass meeting at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
