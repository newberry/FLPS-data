   <p>Mr. Nettelhorst presided at yesterday's meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sundrell, a School Board member, of Swedish descent, who has prospered on the "fat American soil," stood up and entertained his colleagues. He demanded the acceptance of the following resolution.</p>
   <p>Resolved, that the teaching in the German language in the primary and grammar classes of the public schools, be stopped by the end of the present school year, and that the labor and money which has been alloted until now for these lessons, be used for the teaching of English and other useful purposes, in such a way as the committee for school superintendence and the superintendent may recommend!</p>
   <p>He did not have much luck with his blooming nonsense. The School Board members, Beale, Kozminski, Wenter and Doolittle protested against his demand, and succeeded in having it sent to a committee for school supervision and German teaching, for further examination.</p>
   
   <p>The request for abolishing German lessons was supposed to have been started some months ago. The voters of the Chicago Turner district protested that time and will, by all means, remind the School Board of that protest. Mr. Sundell confessed he had delayed the motion until the elections were passed.</p>
   <p>The 230,000 German inhabitants of Chicago would certainly have made the retaining of German teaching a campaign issue, and defeated Sundell's intentions.</p>
