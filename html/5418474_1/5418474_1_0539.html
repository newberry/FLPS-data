   <p>Although the weather was very unfavorable, nearly 600 German women came to a mass meeting in the North Side Turner Hall, held in the interest of retaining German instruction and other special branches in our public schools. The hall was too small to hold so many women, and many had to stand. The endurance of these courageous defenders of German in our public schools was, indeed, admirable. A deep interest and a real enthusiasm could be noticed among them.</p>
   <p>Of course, this great cause is of unusual interest to German mothers, since they are the natural teachers and educators and have the welfare of the growing generation at heart. The German women have furnished most convincing evidence through their demonstration yesterday, that the propaganda for the retention of German instruction and the other special branches can not be entrusted to better hands.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The courageous and energetic efforts of these German women should serve a spur for the so-called stronger sex, to likewise manifest a great zeal for this cause.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dorothea Boettcher called the meeting to order. Then Mrs. H. Voss was elected Chairman, Mrs. Boettcher, Secretary, and Mrs. S. Wolf, Treasurer. Mrs. M. Werkmeister, one of the speakers, said:</p>
   <p>"There are many women in this meeting who are more capable than I to give you a clear analysis of the respective branches of study in danger of elimination. However, since the honor of addressing you is conferred upon me irrespective of this fact, 1 can do so only as a wife and a mother. As such only am I concerned about the school question; and to arrive at my conclusions I have not been assisted by anything but my own understanding and good sense.</p>
   <p>"The highest aim of a mother is the physical and spiritual welfare and progress of her children. A mother considers the school as a sacred institution.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The teachers are her friends and allies, whether or not she is closely acquainted with them. Their calling is her calling likewise, for home and school, and mother and teacher go hand in hand, as it were...</p>
   <p>"Our public schools have several special branches of study. Many of our citizens consider them as very useful for. the children, and the latter take advantage of this opportunity. These special studies include German, gymnastics, drawing, and singing.</p>
   <p>"These branches of study are stigmatized by another part of the population as "fads" or as worthless, and as such they want to banish them from our schools.</p>
   <p>"May I ask, how is it possible that the study of German, a world language, can be considered useless and treated accordingly in a cosmopolitan city like Chicago? Those of us who call two countries their own, who in their childhood studied two or more languages, know what treasures were opened to us. The knowledge of both languages is an advantage for our children, and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>is essential for their success. It is also of benefit to them in their social standing if they can express themselves in two different languages.</p>
   <p>"We have all met Americans who expressed their regret in not being able to speak German. They did not say this to please us, but had their own advantage in mind. As a mother and a wife, I appeal to you to unite your efforts in order to prevent the elimination of German instruction from our schools. Our children must not be deprived of German, because it will be of untold benefit to them later...</p>
   <p>"Today, here, in a city of millions, in a prosperous country, we are fighting for the same branches of study, which have been recognized as valuable factors in education, ever since schools existed!</p>
   <p>"Fight, my ladies, - is an ugly word, because we are German women, and German women shun fighting. We are satisfied with our sphere of activities. We do not push ourselves forward, nor do we demand anything. We live for our children only and their welfare is our aim and pride.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"These children are children of this country. Chicago is their home. They will become patriotic Americans who will love and respect their forefathers. To preserve their mother-tongue for their children is the duty of all German wives and mothers...</p>
   <p>"It is your immediate task to overcome your aversion to fighting. You must do everything in your power to prevent the curtailment or complete suppression of German in our schools. It is your duty to fight for progress and for companionship between mother and child. You all think as I do, or else you would not be here.</p>
   <p>"Let us remind the gentleman of the school board through our signatures that we consider them trustworthy men, the protectors of our rights, to whom we have entrusted the welfare of our children.</p>
   <p>"let us tell them that we do not believe that a branch of study, such as German, should be banished from our schools, because it is of so much benefit to the children in the future.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"If complaints are made about these branches of study, or if the results obtained are not satisfactory, then improvements should be made. We do not believe that these studies should be banished from our schools because of complaints. And we, the German women of Chicago, shall be the first ones to support any improvement, provided that it promotes our cause."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Brown, president of the Chicago Women's Alliance requested permission to speak. This woman is well known in American society. She gave a very intelligent and brief speech in English, in which she expressed her joy concerning the interest manifested in these special branches of study by her German-American sisters. She criticized the school board for the absurd assertion that the city can not afford to spend the money for the special studies any longer.</p>
   <p>"For the education of our youth," she continued, "no sacrifice' is too great. Every sensible taxpayer is willing to do his share." She recommended very vigorously, not only the retention but also an addition of suitable special studies. In closing her remarks she expressed the hope that in the future American and German women would cooperate more closely in the field of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>education and similar matters.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary Burt, a member of the school board, was the next speaker. Miss Burt is heartily in favor of German instruction in all the grades of our schools. Not only did she defend it at yesterday's meeting, but she also does so at sessions of the board. Again she emphasized the fact that the best part of the English language is of German origin, and that German is entitled to be studied in American schools.</p>
   <p>The speeches of both American ladies were received with enthusiastic applause. The whole audience arose to give recognition to Miss Burt for her great efforts in behalf of German instruction.</p>
   <p>After the speeches came the reading of the following protest in German and English, written by Mrs. D. Boettcher, which will be presented to the school board:</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The Protest.</p>
   <p>"To the Honorable Members of the School Board of Chicago:</p>
   <p>"The signatures below are those of Chicago women whose children attend public schools. These women held a mass meeting on Saturday, March 11th, and resolved to present a petition requesting the Board to retain in our public schools the so-called special branches, such as German, gymnastics, singing, drawing and sewing for the following reasons:</p>
   <p>"First, the above mentioned subjects are indispensable to a thorough public education in our age. By restricting or banishing the same, many parents would have to take their children out of the public schools, and place them in private or parochial schools.</p>
   <p>"Second, because a school in which the most elementary branches only are taught, is not achieving its primary objective of being the educational <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>institution of a people destined to govern itself. One of the cardinal duties of a republic, like ours, is the education of the masses. We would consider it an injustice against the growing generation, if a city like Chicago should reduce its educational institutions to mere pauper schools, notwithstanding the fact that Chicago is rich and prosperous and presumably at the head of progress and civilization. To furnish such a spectacle of retrogression to the civilized world, which is looking to us today more than ever before, would be, indeed, very humiliating and confusing for us, inasmuch as the whole world is progressing in culture very rapidly.</p>
   <p>"Third, we have convinced ourselves that the overwhelming majority of the citizens of Chicago are ready and willing to pay the small extra expense for a better education for their children, because such an investment bears a high rate of interest, not only for the individual, but also for the whole community. The better the growing generation is prepared and equipped for the struggles and duties of the future, the more useful will be their services to their country. There will be also less danger of their going astray, or becoming dependent on public charity. Better schools and <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>educational institutions will reduce the number of poor houses and jails. Under no consideration should the school problem become a question of money.</p>
   <p>"Fourth, the study of another language besides the native one is of inestimable benefit to every child. Goethe, the great poet and scholar, asserted, and all the pedagogues have confirmed, that "whoever knows no foreign language, knows nothing of his own.'  Likewise, experience in our schools has taught us that those children who participated in German instruction were able to pass the examinations from grade to grade just as well as the others, and, in many instances, even better. Undoubtedly the German language only can come into consideration as a second language next to English, because one-third of Chicago's population speaks and understands German. It is also true that this instruction should begin as early as possible, preferably in the lower grades, in order to obtain results. This would enable many of the poorer children who usually quit school early to get at least a foundation, upon which they can build later in life, if they are ambitious.</p>
   <p>"Fifth, it is said that the time devoted to German is at the expense of the <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>study of English, but this reason is just as untenable as the question of space. In regard to the question of space we point out that according to official reports all children, who have been registered until now, have also been placed. The introduction of half-days in the lower grades has not been considered a detriment, because most parents are of the opinion that three hours per day of school is sufficient for small children.</p>
   <p>"Sixth, gymnastics in our schools are an absolute necessity. The development of the body must keep pace with intellectual progress. The former is just as essential and is never underestimated nor neglected by any pedagogue of the civilised world. The health of the children is just as important to the parents and to the state as their intellectual development. The school is to a certain extent responsible for the health of the pupils. Of equal importance is the instruction in drawing. It is a training in skill which is basic in nearly every trade and profession. And what drawing is to the boys, needlework is to the girls. Many of the girls have no opportunity in their homes to learn how to sew, hence the school is an appropriate place for it. Finally, vocal music can be justified from an ethical standpoint. Singing affects the mind of the child in a stimulating, uplifting and ennobling <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>manner, and discloses to the child an ideal world in the midst of the crass materialism of our age.</p>
   <p>"All these branches, important and necessary in themselves, add variety to the general instruction. Since the child can grasp only a little at a time a change, and a variety in the branches of study, constitutes an important factor in his education.</p>
   <p>"Being convinced of the above facts, we, the undersigned, feel under obligation not to deprive our children of any of the mentioned subjects in our public schools. On the contrary, we will strive to have them improved and enlarged so that public education may gradually reach the highest peak possible, for the benefit of our children and to the advantage of our country.</p>
   <p>"In this sense, we, the women citizens of Chicago, request the honorable school board to examine our petition. We have the welfare of our children at heart. We trust that the reasons we have stated shall possess sufficient persuasive power to refute all the proposals of any opponents."</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>The protest was approved unanimously. Blanks were distributed among the women, and all of them promised to get as many signatures of married women as they possibly could. The assemblage expressed its gratitude to Mrs. Boettcher for the excellent wording of the petition, and for her other efforts.</p>
   <p>A committee was then appointed to present the protest to the school board at its next session. Mrs. Dorothea Boettcher will act as the spokesman of the committee.</p>
