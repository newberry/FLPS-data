   <p>Interesting disclosures on Germanism were made yesterday at the meeting of the Board of Education when Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, the superintendent of schools, read the annual report. The largest groups attending elementary and high school classes in evening schools are German, according to the report read. During the past school year not less than 2,616 German pupils, Swiss and Austrians not included, have enrolled in the elementary classes, while 1,750 have taken advantage of high school classes in the evening schools. There were also 652 Austrians enrolled in the elementary classes and 73 in the high school classes of the evening schools. Natives of Switzerland attending the evening schools altogether were 44. of the 2,616 German students who attended the elementary classes of the evening schools, 880 were native Americans.</p>
   <p>The German element is leading in high school attendance by a great majority. The next largest group is the Irish, which is 616; followed by the Swedish, 587; The Poles, 397; the Russians, 343; the English, 263; the Bohemians, 261; and the Norwegians, 197. China, Cuba, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Egypt, Turkey, and the Isle of Manx (noted for its stump-tailed cats), were represented by one member each....</p>
   <p>Statistics reveal that 87 males and 70 females have taken advantage of the German instructions in evening schools during the past school year. In regard to elementary schools, no record of the number of students taking the study of German was available. However, Gertrud E. English, the district superintendent, informed the meeting that the German classes were considerably larger since a modification of rules governing that subject was introduced. According to her, the study of German has been added to the curriculum of a number of other schools as the direct result of the change of rules. "Moreover," said Miss English, "Taking the method of teaching into consideration, I fully share the opinion expressed by teachers in general that the abolition of the instruction of German grammar would prove essential. Fluency of expression could be obtained more easily by devoting more time to the instruction of writing, reading, and conversation. The German language should be taught, but its instruction should be so organized <span class="page-break">\3</span>that proportionate progress would be the result of every successive lesson, until a reasonable fluency would be obtained....Every school that includes German in its curriculum should employ a special instructor for that subject; in many instances this special instructor could give his services to two schools".....</p>
