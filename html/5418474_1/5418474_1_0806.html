   <p>The Chicago Union asserted in an article yesterday, that the Germans are entitled to at least three representatives in the school board, and, that before the school board confirms the nominations of the mayor, another German candidate besides Jussen and Vocke should be chosen. There would be no objection to that, if the Union had not overlooked, as it seems to have done, purposely, the fact that the Germans have on the school board, in the person of John C. Richberg, a friend and a representative. If he is confirmed, as it is to be hoped, the Germans will indeed be satisfied. Everybody knows that it due to Mr. Richberg, that the efforts of Goggin to abolish German instruction have failed so far. Besides it would be a disadvantage, to Jusse and Vocke, if they did not find among the old members one who is equainted with the German instruction problem, and who knows its friends and enemies on the school board. How, that the mayor has not reappointed either Mr. Prussing nor Mr. Hesing, the first because his presence on the school board was undesirable, and the second for reasons of political hatred, it is imperative, that Mr. Richberg be reappointed, because otherwise no one from the German committee would be remaining on the school board. We thus hope that the city council will confirm the reappointment of Mr. Richberg and keep on the school board a true friend of the Germans.</p>
