   <p>"To the Editor, In your paper of the 14th of this month several fathers of families from the North Side have expressed their surprise, that the undersigned should have voted, "Against the committee report for obligatory German school instruction". I would like to ask those fathers to follow the actions of the school board a little more closely. It is evident to me, that actually the majority of the school board is inimical to German instruction. Private association with each of the members is required, before any success can be gained. It is hard work to win friends for the new cause. But the tender resolutions, the rejection of which can be foreseen, does not seem to be justified. By voting with the majority against the amendment, I reserved to myself the right to submit the matter to the voters again when circumstances are more favorable. For that reason alone I voted against the amendment.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>Ernst Prussing."</p>
