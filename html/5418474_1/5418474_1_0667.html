   <p>Friend of the Arbeiter Zeitung: Why did the Arbeiter Zeitung alone among German papers in Chicago, publish the exact details from the report of one school director regarding the position and progress of German teaching?</p>
   <p>To all appearances it is her principle to supply her readers all interesting news in short but thorough fashion. That a paper like that "criminal's mouthpiece" (Illinois Staats Zeitung) ignores German instruction entirely is evident.</p>
