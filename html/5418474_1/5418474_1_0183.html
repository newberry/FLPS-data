   <p>The salary reductions recommended by the Economy Committee of the school board, which had been prevented in January by the opposition of Messrs. Thornton, Brennan etc. will be proposed again on account of the large reduction in the school funds, ordered by the Council. It is expected that the proposal this time will be accepted. The reductions will be made in all salaries in such a way that wages above $2,000 will be cut 10% above $1,000 5% and smaller ones 2 and 21/2%. In that manner a saving of $600,000 may be attained. The old enemies of the special courses, (German, gymnastic, singing and drawing), will take advantage of this favorable opportunity and will propose the elimination of those courses for a temporary period of one year. The budget of the high schools in any case will be reduced very considerably. The administration of the high school in Hyde Park for instance, in the month of February has spent #152 for natural gas in the biological department of the school to keep alive some frogs. The heating of the entire school by coal has not cost much more for this month.</p>
   <p>A number of unemployed have applied for service with the school census. Members of the school board and especially members of the census committee are at present very much worried persons.</p>
