   <p>Yesterday's proceedings at the Board of Education revealed, that a motion was made by Mr. Covert to completely eliminate German instruction from the public schools. Occasion to that motion was given by the proposed reappointment of Miss Regina Schauer as superintendent of German instruction. Her rainstatement is not favored by several, even by some who are well disposed toward German instruction, because until the return of better times this office can be dispensed with. The motion of Covert followed, after Miss Schauer had received a majority, but not the required absolute majority. The same motion will probably be made again next Wednesday.</p>
