   <p>The English word "Temperance" means moderation, but nevertheless, the Temperance Societies do not preach moderation but absolute abstinence. If these Abstinence-fanatics could make the laws, they would punish the use of anything, containing alcohol, as a severe crime.</p>
   <p>We have studied the temperance-movement thoroughly and cannot agree with any of its hypocritical doctrines. Experience has taught that legalized temperance has made drunkards, criminals and hopeless hypocrites out of people.</p>
   <p>We are glad to say, that particularly German elements have kept away from this Temperance movement with its hidden attacks on personal freedom. The German-people as a rule believe in a sensible use of beverages of any kind, containing alcohol, and harmonize this standpoint with medical science, which is favoring the absorption of proportionally small quantities of alcohol through the use of beer, wine, etc. as a healing, nourishing and disinfecting effect on the human body.</p>
