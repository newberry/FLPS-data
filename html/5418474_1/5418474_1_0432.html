   <p>p. 4 - The financial status of our school department is never bad except when it comes to teaching German, gymnastics, drawing and singing in our public schools. Shortage of funds is said to be responsible for shortening the period of instruction in these subjects by one month. The financial mismanagement is so great, that education has to be curtailed. What a disgrace for Chicago! The continuous interruption in the teaching of these important subjects may prove quite disastrous to the students. German was added to the curriculum of public schools way back during the Civil War. Despite the heavy financial burden incurred by the war, Chicago was able to maintain a broad and extensive public school education. And now during the greatest period of prosperity the nation has ever had, Chicago, for financial reasons, has to shorten the school year for those important subjects. The Americans are a shrewd people and they should be able to do something about it...</p>
