   <p>A meeting was hold yesterday at the North Side Turnhalle, at the instance of the Chicago Turngemeinde (Gymnastic community), which deserves great credit for raising this protest against the proposal of the School Board to eliminate German, drawing and singing from the curricula of the public schools. A large crowd was present, chiefly our older and most respected Germans, of whose faithfulness toward the land of their adoption one entertains no doubt: men who shared the vicissitudes of the nation during hours of danger.</p>
   <p>The prevailing sentiment was of a definite character and gave no unmistakable signs about the lofty purpose of the assembly. Emil Hoechster, speaker of the Turngemeinde, gave the opening address and declared that the Chicago Turrgemeinde called upon the people to be present in order to formulate a justified, emphatic protest against the School Board's intent to abolish German-language instruction, drawing and singing from the public schools.</p>

   <p>Dr. Hessert was nominated president of the meeting, and was elected. He eschewed speeches and suggested that the assembly proceed forthwith to the business on hand. Max Stern was elected secretary. Dr. Schmidt was asked to give his views on the matter and he said that he could give little additional information on the question. Those at the meeting by their very presence prove that they are fully aware of the significance of the present issue (the attempt to eliminate German from the public schools); that this intention is merely an abominable attack against the German people and culture; and that we are duty-bound to defend ourselves. It is not a mere question of nationalities; it entails culture in general. Acquiring another language is important and necessary. If some other nationality of greater numerical strength were present in Chicago, then he [Dr. Schmidt] would just as gladly vote for the learning of that language. [The tenor of his views was expressed by the following]:</p>
   <p>In a country where such stupendous sums are spent for education, only a nincompoop could use the pretext of saving a paltry twelve or thirteen thousand dollars by abolishing German instruction. If the gentlemen who wish to save the twelve thousand dollars would consider that they, individually, owe at least that much <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in taxes, whereas the free schools which are used by the preponderant majority, belong to the people who, by the sweat of their brow, earned their living and paid taxes promptly, then these economists would not attempt such penury. Besides, these people bought land at a high price from the same gentlemen who wish to effect savings in school instruction. They are the same miserable, shabby curs who are at the bottom of the movement to deprive the poor workers of their Sunday pleasures. The speaker [Dr. Schmidt] then asserted that he greatly respects the cultured Americans, but not the dishonest, depraved horde known as nativists who can only be convinced by the fist.</p>
   <p>"The movement [Dr. Schmidt continued] would not have originated in the School Board--it was inaugurated by two unimportant members--if they were not sure of large party support. They'll back water quickly if they find that the Germans won't consent, but instead will clench their teeth and declare unequivocally that the language expressing the greatest thoughts of men, is to remain a heritage for posterity. However, organization is necessary. It is difficult to reach the masses, but they must be induced to make demonstrations which will convince certain people that their intentions are not enforceable, and that the Teutons adhere <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to the principle: 'German is spoken here!'"</p>
   <p>Lively applause often interrupted the forceful speaker.</p>
   <p>Upon a motion of Philip Stein, the chairman was requested to appoint a committee to formulate resolutions. The following gentlemen were nominated: Vergho, Emil Hoechster, Adolph Schoeninger, Philip Stein and Floto.</p>
   <p>Hiram Barber was the next speaker. He said the free schools are the pride of the nation and that he knew of nothing more appropriate than a meeting of this kind to consider questions of this nature. Lincoln said that this is "a government of the people, by the people, for the people"; in other words, it is expected that the government should exercise the will of the people. Consideration of public affairs by the people is a necessity, and such actions should be fostered in every conceivable manner. In regard to the present problem there are, of course, divergent views. One group believes it is a waste of time and money to teach German and to support a foreign type of know-nothingness; that [if one language is taught] others must be, also; that this is an American nation and immigrants must be assimilated, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>etc.</p>
   <p>Such arguments never fully convinced him [Hiram Barber, the speaker]; he believes that a man forgetting his fatherland, and those pliant fellows who endeavor to be absorbed instantly by another country, are not worth much. He regards the teaching of German no more than a reasonable concession to the 150,000 Germans living here. For four thousand years the world paid homage to the Greek language, and German literature is fully as voluminous and versatile--presenting a wealth of romanticism, sane logic, science, and philosophy. A knowledge of German proves valuable indeed. Should the world ever hear that the teaching of German had been discontinued in Chicago because it involved the trifling sum of twelve thousand dollars? It may be proper to teach French in New Orleans, and the Scandinavian languages in some of our schools as well as in certain districts of Minnesota; and it is certainly justifiable to teach German in our local schools.</p>
   <p>An opinion prevails that the children are not given sufficient time to master the language--none are fully educated in school--the institutions providing only the foundation upon which further progress depends.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>He considered the protest of the Germans to be fully justified, and hoped that the matter would be vigorously prosecuted. (Applause)</p>
   <p>Mr. Wilhelm Vocke was called next and said that since he had been a member of the School Board this debate had been an annual affair, and it always took place when the salary of the German principal came up for discussion. Formerly this amounted to fifteen hundred dollars, but last year, in common with others, it was decreased to twelve hundred dollars. This year the salaries of most of the other teachers were raised, and the German Committee tried to obtain the original scale for the German principal, but it brought energetic opposition. The enemies of German-language instruction used the salary issue as a pretext for attacking German in general.</p>
   <p>One must admit that the German lessons were nothing to boast of; however, when Dr. Zimmermann became principal, conditions improved considerably. The Committee also hopes that no extra sums need be expended for German instruction in the future, because teachers should be employed who are equally proficient in both languages.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Mr. Vocke then spoke about the "common schools"-whatever one understands by that term--and disproved the current belief that only the most essential branches--reading, writing and arithmetic--must be taught. The appellation "common schools" applies to all public institutions of learning, regardless of whether they are of an elementary character or are universities.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the speaker criticized the nearsightedness of the people who were interviewed by the Times last week on the present question, and, in conclusion, said that the commonest public school in Germany offers more than we do. We should work zealously toward an increase of school subjects, if possible.</p>
   <p>In Germany, at the Gymnasien, the students; when seven or eight years old, study Latin; it is a compulsory measure. And why not study German here? As teaching subjects become more varied, the ambitions increase!</p>
   <p>Mr. Barber knows how he was benefited by a thorough knowledge of German. No American who learned the German language will deny that it proved of incalculable value. It is quite true, of course, that many children who study Germany now do <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>not learn to speak the language; but no one is able to predict what will prove advantageous in later years. To promote assimilation [of immigrants] the Americans can do nothing better than to induce German children to visit the public schools by promising German lessons.</p>
   <p>The speaker [Vocke] said that he had no doubt of the effectiveness of the protest now being formulated here to be presented to the school board next Thursday.</p>
   <p>Philip Stein, Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, submitted the record of his members, an English document, wherein various reasons for the continuance of German-language instruction, drawing and singing were given, and to which the following resolutions were appended:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we emphatically protest against the discontinuance of German, drawing and signing in the public schools.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we are always ready and willing to pay our taxes for the maintenance of our city and its credit; but we do not believe that an annual saving of <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>twelve to thirteen thousand dollars--the amount heretofore paid for the above cultural branches--constitutes sufficient reason for the abolition of these subjects from the school curriculum, by an administration of a city of half a million people, which expends four million dollars yearly for its operating costs.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the attempts to eliminate the aforesaid studies from the school plan are prompted by the nativistic attitude, and if this attitude is encouraged and continues, it will undermine the friendly relations now existing between the various nationalities, and is likely to produce again for our city a rule of corruption, plunder and venal office seekers.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That in the interests of true economy, and with due consideration to education in its broadest sense, we hereby respectfully, but emphatically, request that every member of the Board of Education vote against the abolition of German, singing and drawing, and do everything within his individual power to bring these branches to the same standard as other studies."</p>
   <p>Casper Butz reflected that the resolutions were somewhat too long. "I might <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>add," he said, "that the question of German instruction has already been decided--and favorably. A meeting of School Board members was held last Thursday and therein it was agreed that the majority would vote for German instruction."</p>
   <p>German culture is destined to play an important part in this country. He [Butz] remembers well the effects of the German Christmas. But it is necessary that the Germans be united, for if they are divided they will be the prey of the nativistic Americans--substantially as before.</p>
   <p>"Thank God, he said, "this know-nothing movement is gradually becoming extinct. The people who emigrated from Germany are now already more numerous than the descendants from the inhabitants of the New England States, because these Yankees are too comfort-loving to think of propogation.</p>
   <p>"English is but the proud, insolent daughter of the German language, and now the mother tongue is to be condemned in a city of half a million people, because twelve thousand dollars for instruction is involved. It is ridiculous. Incidentally, the language lessons need improvement. The subject should not be a matter <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>of choice; it ought to he compulsory and on an equal footing with other studies. In Cincinnati and Cleveland German instruction thrives, but not here. We must equal the accomplishments of that small nation, Switzerland. In that Alpine country three languages are accorded equal recognition, and if a representative of Tessin speaks at the national council, then it is expected that every member of the assembly should understand him,as if he spoke in German or French."</p>
   <p>In his closing remarks the speaker [Butz] said that we should continue to "speak German" in our schools.</p>
   <p>General Schaffner made a motion that the resolutions read by Philip Stein be accepted and given to the School Board by a committee of five, together with the chairman, who was to be a delegate, also. Messrs. Emil Hoechster, Philip Stein, Adolph Schoeninger, Max Stern, General Schaffner and the chairman were nominated to this committee.</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Meyer moved that a vote of thanks be accorded to the Chicago Turngemeinde.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>[The motion was] accepted.</p>
   <p>Max Stern asked the assembly to procure many signatures for the protest, regardless of the fact that the peril seemed to be obviated; it might be beneficial in the future to have an imposing array of names.</p>
   <p>Adjournment [followed thereafter].</p>
