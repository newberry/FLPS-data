   <p>The measure of Germany's value to the world is reflected in the measure of the world's appreciation of the German language. During the war the fury of the allied countries was aimed at the extermination of the German language, which was eliminated from the school curriculum everywhere. Even after the war, this condition prevailed for a long time. For about five years now conditions have slowly improved. In America, England and France the German language has been reintroduced as a special subject, partly elective, but partly required. In Czechoslovakia, people are beginning to realize that ignorance of the German language is disadvantageous to the Czechs. Just recently, the government of Esthonia revoked the former decisions of the cabinet which replaced German with English as the leading language taught in the high schools. Now again the German language ranks as the leading language.</p>
   <p>In Roumania a congress of high school teacher's demanded the immediate reintroduction of the German language as a compulsory subject in all schools. All <span class="page-break">2</span>participants at the congress agreed that knowledge of German, for economic reasons, and in consideration of the cultural German minority in Roumania, is absolutely necessary, and that development of Roumanian culture, without knowledge of the German language and products of German Culture would be hampered.</p>
   <p>Only nearsightedness can overlook the fact that such peaceful victories of German science and culture are of the highest value. They naturally cannot accomplish and substitute what only the external powerful political positions of a country can give, but even if not always discernible, their effect under circumstances can be more lasting and effective.</p>
