   <p>As the enemies of the proposed new Illinois School law are on the increase, the Republican sponsors of this unfortunate and malicious law are changing tactics, and this only in due consideration of the coming presidential election.</p>
   <p>Now these Republicans, propose and promise the complete rejection of the whole School Law, in its present form. But they are leaving so many back doors and classes open for the comeback of the said law, that we cannot trust the Republican standpoint. From the beginning of this fight, the Democrats, have stressed the standpoint, to accept the School Enforcement Law, but at the same time to report as a principal, any School Language instruction Law. But the Republicans insisted, that not only in public schools but also in church and private schools, the language of instruction should be exclusively English. Time will show, which way the public and the voters will force the issue.</p>
