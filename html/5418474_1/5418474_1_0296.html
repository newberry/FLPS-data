   <p>According to reliable reports, a plan is being considered to transfer the high school which is now located on the West Side of the city of Chicago (and thus is practically inaccessible to people who live on the North Side) to a place where it can be reached from all three parts of the city with equal ease and comfort. The place referred to is Dearborn Park, on Michigan Avenue. Since it is close to the junction of the horsecar lines, pupils who live on the outskirts of the South and West Sides could reach it without the least difficulty, and North Siders, too, would find it within easy reach.</p>
   <p>The site has been deeded to the city by the Federal Government with the understanding that it is to be used for public purposes. The value of the property has increased greatly since the presentation. In fact, its present <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>worth makes its use for park-purposes prohibitive. As a park, it has no more value for Chicago than the Battery has for the city of New York, which has spent millions to add more ground to the little plot, without succeeding in making it more attractive even as a place to take a stroll; but as a building site it has an immense value.</p>
   <p>Now, if the city council would consent (that is all that is necessary), a magnificent building could be erected in Dearborn Park, a building which would not only be a credit to the architectural taste and skill of our citizens and contractors, but could also be made a source of income for the school treasury, if its basement were rented to businessmen for storage purposes. The net proceeds from rentals could be used to improve the high school to such an extent that it would compare favorably with the best secondary schools of Europe, and prepare its students for entry into universities.</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that this plan is fully in keeping with the marvelous <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>progress which the city has made during the past decade. The good reputation which our school system already has won among the intelligent citizens of our country is no reason why we should halt in our endeavors to progress, but should be an incentive to continue in our efforts to make our educational institutions more adequate to their purpose; and we are convinced that the plan outlined above would be a long step toward that end.</p>
