   <p>A society of fellow Germans was founded yesterday afternoon in the beautiful garden city of Chicago. The aims of this society will be to hire pious recruits for the faithful army of the drys. These good-natured reformers and some of the rough and simple German Michael realize that the world is in a bad condition and they will try therefore to bring back humanity, especially thirsty humanity, to the natural health-springs of Mother Earth.</p>
   <p>It is a classical idea and we congratulate these sincere water apostles for their laudable efforts and wish them the best of luck now that they start under the new name of the National German- American Prohibition League.</p>
   <p>Therefore, good luck, once more, to such an important undertaking. May God bless you, you dear German fellow-countrymen!</p>
