   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>In yesterday's Westen (Sunday edition of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung) you gave us the information that in the last meeting of the Board of Education Mr. Covert made the proposal to do away with German instruction with the addition: - Characteristically the motion came right after the protest from the German-American Republican Society had been received.</p>
   <p>For those who so far did not believe your communications and information about this matter, this should be a sign, and I hope the last one, of how consistently and ruthlessly those gentlemen pursue their aim! There is only one weapon left: many votes and a clever, honest deal in votes (stimmenschacher). In the last meeting of the Board of Education, evidence enough was produced that German instruction hangs on a thread. Only one vote more or less might overnight give it the death blow. He who is sincerely concerned about this matter, will realize quickly, that this is not the time to toss, nor for <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>uncertain, experiments, but that the entire German public should be glad about the present composition of the Board of Education and about its representatives.</p>
   <p>For changes, that possibly may be desirable, there will be more occasions in future.</p>
   <p>Signed,</p>
   <p>S.</p>
