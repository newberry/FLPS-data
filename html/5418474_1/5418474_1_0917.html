   <p>The Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was ratified -- i.e., accepted and confirmed--by the states of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina and Illinois.</p>
   <p>This means that thirty states have now favored national prohibition, and that it will take only six more states to make up the required three-fourths majority of all states.</p>
   <p>The legislatures of eight of those states which still have to vote on the constitutional amendment will, in all probability, also ratify this Prohibition Amendment, so that it must seem almost certain that by March 1 the approval of more than thirty-six of the forty-eight states will be assured, and a year later, about March 1, 1920, prohibition will have become part of the fundamental law of the country--unless something unexpected happens.</p>

   <p>What does that mean? Judging by the superficiality and indifference with which the whole problem was handled, first in Congress and later in the various legislatures, one must conclude that the proposing of an amendment to the United States Constitution and its ratification by the state legislatures was an everyday affair of little importance, and that the possible consequences of the adoption of this particular amendment were a minor matter. In reality the consequences will be incalculably grave and will have far-reaching effects. In reality the adoption of the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution is of much greater significance than the majority of citizens--including the opponents of prohibition--seem to think.</p>
   <p>It means not only the confiscation of property, the destruction of the livelihood and employment of hundreds and thousands, and the restriction of the personal freedom of many millions--which in itself constitutes the gravest violation of the rights of citizens which are guaranteed by the Constitution--but it also means an actual rape of the Constitution itself; a rape, which strips this constitution of its original spirit and purpose and which converts it from a solid wall of defense against tyranny and suppression into a convenient tool <span class="page-break">\3</span>of tyranny and a means for oppressing the citizens and for destroying those liberties which the Constitution was conceived and written down in order to guarantee and safeguard against any and all possible assaults.</p>
   <p>The introduction of national prohibition by a constitutional amendment would in fact be tantamount to a successful revolution against the basic law and concept of America and would, as surely as morning follows night, lead to a counterrevolution which would not progress so smoothly as the present extinction of American liberty and ideals from American soil.</p>
   <p>This is quite a statement, but it is not exaggerated. Anyone who does not believe that what has been said above is justified, will soon realize its truth. The damage has not yet been done, and there is still some hope that the expected calamity can be averted. A constitutional amendment which is so opposed to the spirit of the Constitution as is this Prohibition Amendment--which, in its entire nature and in the manner in which it was submitted to the state legislatures, so boldly assaults the Constitution itself--cannot be considered <span class="page-break">\4</span>constitutional! We still have the Supreme Court, to which an appeal will certainly be made. Moreover, the American people have not entirely lost their common sense and good judgment, even if their representatives in Congress and in the state legislatures are trying to do without common sense in handling the prohibition problem.</p>
   <p>So far the question has been argued chiefly from the standpoint of the "wets" and "drys". The Prohibition Amendment has been advocated and opposed only by those who were immediately interested, and the general public has considered it mainly a clash of opposing interests and not a conflict involving the great problem of civil liberties, as it really is. The fight of the opposing interests has befogged the people's vision and has beclouded their mental horizon so that they have not quite realized the peril with which their liberty is threatened. Many have refrained from entering the fight against the Prohibition Amendment because they do not care to be considered friends of the "beer and booze interests."</p>

   <p>The same statement holds true for the people's representatives in Congress and in the legislatures. Like the greater part of the citizenry, they let themselves be fooled by the bogeyman of the notoriety which they will receive if they support the "beer and booze interests." Of course this was clearly a prohibitionist invention. But they will not be intimidated any longer, once it is proved that it is not a question of beer and liquor, "wet" and "dry", but that the Constitution is at stake under which the country became great, strong, and prosperous; that the liberties are at stake to which the American people owe their greatness, and the preservation of democracy in their native land--the preservation of American democracy, for the extension of which to the rest of the world America gave her substance and shed her blood.</p>
