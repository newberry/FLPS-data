   <p>At its last meeting the school board decided to discontinue the teaching of German in the primary classes of our public schools. In vain did the minority of the school board, and in particular, the German members, Halle, Bluthardt, Boldenweck, and F. Goetz, put up a vigorous and obstinate battle. At the beginning of the next semester the German language will not be taught anymore in the primary classes, unless the new members of the school board, soon to be appointed by Mayor Harrison, repeal the ordinance. This is what the nativists have accomplished with their fight against the so-called fads.</p>
   <p>Here is the report. We may as well state right here that this report will be accepted at the next meeting of the school board.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>After considering the different motions, previously made in regard to the special branches, the report continues:</p>
   <p>The Committee of School-Management obtained the opinion of the director of schools, of his assistants, as well as of the teachers and of eminent pedagogs. It also has taken under consideration the statements of the press and periodicals. Being in possession of all this information, the committee arrived at the following conclusion: All of these various branches of study under consideration have a certain educational value, and, therefore, should not be completely abolished.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, however, these special branches of study are now taking up too much of the pupils' time, and this often to the disadvantage of the more important studies. The committee, therefore, came to the conclusion <span class="page-break">3</span>that these special branches of study should be continued, though with certain modifications.</p>
   <p>As far as the study of German is concerned, the committee points to the report which has been already submitted.</p>
   <p>Gymnastics should be continued in the primary and grammar classes as long as it is of a recreational nature.</p>
   <p>Drawing should be discontinued in the lowest grade. The teaching of clay modelling and painting should be discontinued in the three lowest grades. Instruction in drawing is to be curtailed in the second and third grade.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Singing should be maintained in all grades. Technical instruction in music is to be discontinued in the first and second grade...</p>
   <p>Sewing is to be completed at the end of one semester.</p>
   <p>Instruction in manual skill is to be retained in all the four schools of Lake View No. 2, Foster, Jones, and Tilden...</p>
