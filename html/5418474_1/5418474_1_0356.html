   <p>The American School Association held a well attended reception, yesterday evening in the Stratford Hotel. In his welcoming progress, the President, Dr. Maxin Niven, compared the Germans in America with the vine, which a Roman emperor brought to Gaul. The fruit of the sten was not pears, but grapes; and the Germans in America their habits and their language. But in the same way as the vine planted in France, rooted in the French soil, the German should find his footing in American soil, draw his nutrition from it, but should give the country the fruits of United States of America, that part of the country belongs to him that he belongs to the country, and that he has obligations towards the country which granted him protection. As typical, Dr. Niven pointed to the position and activity of two members of the society, Madame Ernestine Schuman-Neink and Martin Schmidhofer. Madme Schuman-Heink, last Saturday, before her departure to California, expressed her sincere loyalty with the assurance that she hopes to visit all the members personally in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the fall. Martin Schmidhofer is considered by all educated Chicagoans as a man of sacrificing industry, exceptional proficiency and inflexible integrity. The presentation of an honorary document, became a great ovation for Mr. Schmidhofer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krutgen, a member of the school board, spoke in a very interesting manner on what the Germans had brought to the country of their choice, America, in German habits, German songs and German poetry. The speaker regretted that the Germans do not occupy a greater leading role in politics and administration, but hopes that in the course of time, an improvement will occur.</p>
   <p>After the banquet, with which the meeting started, Mr. Schmidhofer, supervisor of German in the Chicago Schools, gave an interesting report on the beginning of German instructions in the country in general and in the city's schools in particular. The able pedagogue pointed to its importance in the universal scheme of education and regretted, that it is not fully appreciated by the German parents, because two thirds of the children, participating in the instruction, were of American parentage, who acknowledged the usefulness of mother tongue.</p>

   <p>Under the benevolent consideration of the present school board the number of schools in which German instruction is given has increased from 35 to 135, and the number of children who participated have increased from 7,000 to 23,000. Mr. Schmidhofer expressed the hope, that in the future the German parents will show more interest in this part of their children's education.</p>
