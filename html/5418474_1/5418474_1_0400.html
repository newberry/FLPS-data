   <p>During the monthly meeting yesterday of the officials of the German-American National Alliance a resolution was unanimously accepted, to urge immediately the promotion and furtherance of instructions in the German language in Chicago's public schools. The board of education, and the directors of the school board are favorably inclined toward this matter. Great efforts will now be made to prove the great advantage of knowing the German language not only to the German families, but also to the Anglo-Americans and others. A systematic plan of operation is being prepared.</p>
