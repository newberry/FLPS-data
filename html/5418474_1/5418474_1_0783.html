   <p>The appointment of a superintendent for the German language in public schools shall be decided tomorrow. It is strange that the election of teachers for special subjects does not take place at the same time with the election of other teachers, and that Mr. Schoninger's proposal to reelect Hiss Regina Schauer, who enjoys a splendid reputation has been postponed....</p>
   <p>A story is in circulation according to which Mr. Ernst Trussing and the insane Haring Rodney Welch of the Times formed an offensive and defensive alliance by which Welch declared himself willing to support Prussing in all of his movements to eliminate the words "God" and "Christianity" from the school's text-books and he (Prussing) in turn pledged himself to Welch and the Tribune to eliminate the German language from public schools at the earliest possible moment, but until then will endorse Mrs. Cornientl (Welch's sister-in-law) as a German teacher. It is almost impossible to believe this story, although Mr. Prussing is well known for his atheistic inclinations and could be well compared to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>rudeness and harshness of the infallibility of the raging Puritans. But that he would be willing to sacrifice the German instruction in public schools, for the sake of his religion, which has been added at the cost of intense efforts as one of the subjects in public schools, seems really impossible. One thing is certain, this is the opposition of Prussing against the re-election of Miss Regina Schauer, insisting that Miss Schauer has not the adequate knowledge to fill this position satisfactorily. But this assertion is not at all in accordance with the observations made by other German members of the School Board. In search for the truth we interviewed Messrs Dr. Bluthardt, Washington Hesing, John C. Richberg and Adolph Schoninger, all of whom speak highly of Miss Schauer's ability, praise her energy, diligence and excellent discipline not omitting the fact, that the pupils who took German in public schools made remarkable progress during the last few years while under the direction of Miss Schauer.</p>
   <p>This opinion is shared by a large number of the best German teachers...But where does Mr. Prussing get all his information from? Did he personally attend <span class="page-break">\3</span>her classes to make this sort of accusations? If he did he must have changed greatly and must take his duty much more seriously since his re-election than formerly, as member of the School Board.</p>
   <p>It was notorious that although President of the Committee for teaching German, he never was present at any German class instruction, not even at examinations but spent all of his time in activities of denouncing the dear Lord whom he would have liked to eliminate from school books. If he did change, which would be greatly desirable, it is unknown to us. He never showed any interest in investigating the ability of the teachers or the progress of the pupils studying German, but with one exception, the visit to the district high school of the North Side....</p>
