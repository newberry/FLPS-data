   <p>It is customary, that whenever something goes wrong, or finances necessitate the reduction or expenditures in public schools, it is always the German language which suffers from the attack.... A local English newspaper made the idiotic remark, that teaching German in schools is simply a "farce without any educational value". Perplexed at this, we ask: What are the causes for these malicious attacks? The answer could be found in the blind hatred for anything foreign, with especially deeply rooted hatred for the German people and their language. The German's usually bright outlook on life, and their well known capability in trade and profession is scoffed at, just because the beneficial influence of the German spirit and German activity has been felt, but for lack of understanding is hated. Wasn't it the German immigrant who transformed this western part of this great and glorious country, which was nothing but a wild and devastated land, into fertile fields? German intelligence, their untiring diligence and thrift, was influential in all phases of business and professional life. To whom are we especially indebted for introducing and cultivating music in this country? It was again the German element. Therefore they are justified in cultivating and preserving the German language and German customs. Another reason why teaching German in schools does not meet with more enthusiasm is <span class="page-break">2</span>found in the fact, that most people have no understanding of the value of knowing a foreign language.... However, a certain indifference by a large number of German-Americans, could be looked upon, as supplying added strength for these attacks.... The financial dilemma of our School Board, is the cause for the present attack on the German language. There are numerous things causing this condition, but we are not inclined either to investigate nor to discuss this. We are disinclined to blame the School Board for this deplorable situation, for it is our candid opinion that most of its members have the welfare of the teachers as well as that of the school at heart. Will the financial ills of the School Board be cured, if the German language is dropped from the school plan?.....</p>
