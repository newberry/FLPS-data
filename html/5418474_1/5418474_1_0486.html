   <p>In yesterday's paper the expectation expressed, that the Superintendent of German instruction would very well be able to refute the attacks made by School Board Member Thorntion, against his department, is punctually answered by the Tev. Zimmermann, by submission of the following numbers:</p>
   <p>"In the four classes of the Middle Schools, consisting of 49,181 pupils altogether, not less than 24,346, that is nearly 50%, participlate in German instruction! In the fifth grade with 19,956 pupils, 10,216 take German instruction; in the sixth grade there are 7,050 of 13,147 pupils; in the seventh grade 5,706 of 9,470 pupils. The eighth grade indeed shows a notable decrease. Of the 6,708 pupils, only 1,374 pupils take German lessons. This is explained by the overburdening of the pupils with preparations for graduation and entry into High School. Very many teachers advise those pupils who cannot get along in all branches, to drop temporily the "unnecessary" study of the German language and this advice is obeyed.</p>
   <p>This explanation of the state of affairs is plain and evident enough. May it satisfy Mr. Thornton and his supporters.</p>
