   <p>If one wants to have good pupils, one first must have good teachers. This fact the gentlemen of the School Board don't seem to have yet understood. They do not say, that in order to have good pupils one must have good women-teachers, but they show through their actions that they are deeply convinced of the truth of this statement. We surely do not belong to those who would deny to women the ability of teaching. We are even convinced that for schools for the smallest children (Kleinkinderschulen) a good woman teacher is to be preferred to a good male teacher. But if one asserts, as the Superintendent has done, that the women have shown themselves better teachers of the German language than the men, one must have selected intentionally, or from ignorance, the worst men teachers.</p>
   <p>In today's session of the School Board, the Committee for the German Language is scheduled to give its report on the examinations of women-teachers. The German-American School Society of Chicago is going to present a petition in which it will be explained at length why men also should be admitted to the examinations, respectively why they should have a chance to be appointed as teachers of German.</p>
   
   <p>We hope that this time the Committee for German instruction - the Messrs. Wunsche, Richberg, and Schintz will fight on the side of reason. Mr. Schintz who could adduce like no one else, the most convincing proofs for the appointment of German men-teachers, unfortunately is (as he is said to have expressed himself) to intensely occupied with his own practical future that it is quite impossible for him to think of his pedagogical present.</p>
   <p>The question of money, with which one counters our argument, should not be considered, quite aside from the fact that the men-teachers offer to teach for the same salary as the women. The German language, at present, is being taught in the public schools almost in the same way as one teaches a dead language, the poor students are being badgered with vocabulary and spelling, but of the spirit and the individuality of the language, they hear nothing. And it is a question if this system could not be changed by the appointment of some able German men-teachers. We are inclined to answer in the affirmative.</p>
