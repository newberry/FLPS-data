   <p>The school board made an important decision yesterday, by abolishing the regulation, according to which pupils were obliged to pursue the entire course once they had taken up a subject. This applies to the courses in German, drawing and music. Now they may drop these subjects any time after having taken them up. This is mostly aimed against the teaching of German. The teaching of these subjects will suffer greatly in efficiency following this change in regulations.</p>
