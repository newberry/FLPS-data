   <p>If the Germans of Chicago desire to prevent the partial or complete suppression of instruction in German, drawing, singing, gymnastics, and sewing in our public schools, then they must defend themselves. Of course, a partial restriction would only be a preparatory step to complete suppression. It is true that nothing can be achieved by force, but we should open the eyes of the school board and convince the members that the newspapers do not represent the opinions of the majority of the people, although they do attack these special branches of instruction with much ado. If we defend ourselves effectively, the weaklings of the school board will soon change their minds. They have no opinions of their own, but repeat only what newspapers have to say.</p>
   
   <p>If the circular requesting the maintenance of the previously mentioned branches of instruction shows a large number of signatures, the school board will not dare to vote for their discontinuation against the expressed desire of the people. However, the time is very short, and much effort is necessary. Everybody who is in favor of maintaining these branches, should get as many signatures as possible. Teachers in particular, should take this matter to heart.</p>
   <p>A meeting of German women will take place at the North Side Turner Hall on Saturday afternoon. If this meeting has a large attendance, it will be an effective and weighty support for the petition.</p>
   <p>Let us go to work: If we protect ourselves, we will at the same time protect our public schools from deterioration.</p>
