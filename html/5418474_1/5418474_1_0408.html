   <p>In the November meeting of the Board of the National German-American Teachers Seminary in Milwankee it was noted with great satisfaction that the Chicago Schwaben Verein resolved to send $100.00 to this institution as a contribution. The Seminary sees in the action of this Club a sign of recognition of its work in the service of education in general and in the concern of the German Americans in particular.</p>
   <p>By this honoring of the institution the Club has also proved that in it lives the aptitude for the higher tasks, of the Germans, and that the Club is willing to prove it by deeds, wherever it is necessary, and therefore the honest thanks of all friends of this educational institution is due to it.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Max Griebsch,</p>
   <p>Director.</p>
