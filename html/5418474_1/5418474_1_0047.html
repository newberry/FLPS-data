   <p>Next week, according to reports, the Chicago teachers will receive the money due them, for which they have been waiting a long time. It would really be desirable if this cruel game were ended, for the employees of the School Board have been waiting long enough for their well-earned salaries, and have been disappointed so often that probably they have completely lost their belief in mankind. Moreover the case is, in many respects, instructive. It shows how a lofty bureaucracy can complicate even the simplest matters, and in this way cause endless mischief.</p>
   <p>The money was on hand, the loan was legally authorized, the necessary safeguards were present; but the teachers have not yet received their pay. The occurrence further shows that the old proverb; "If two do the same thing, then it is not the same," still holds true. A local newspaper, which attacks the City administration every day for its extravagance and careless financial policies, <span class="page-break">2</span>considers it quite in order for this administration to borrow $22,500,000 from the Chicago School Board. For this is the attitude about borrowing this money: It is thoughtless, reprehensible, even criminal, if others get the money; but it is good and honorable and statesmanlike, if we get it....</p>
   <p>It is to be feared that this great act of giving aid to the teachers will have a serious sequel. It drew the attention of the school politicians to the fact that Uncle Sam still has some money at his disposal, and they would very much like to annex it. As is well known, the organized school politicians have been trying, for a long time, to enlarge the school system. Their aim is to place more teachers, of both sexes, on the pay roll. Up to the present their success in carrying out this plan has been attained by the creation of new departments and their inclusion in the school curriculum. Now they are seeking to gain their ends by another method.</p>
   <p>As has been reported, forty thousand teachers are to be employed to do away with illiteracy. What is meant by this can be seen from the following statement: "The school program will be expanded in such manner that two million <span class="page-break">3</span>people are reached whose formal education is not in conformity with the requirements of the cities and states." Hence, anyone whose education does not meet with the approval of the school politicians must go back to school, so that the defects in his education can be corrected under expert leadership. Formerly the school politicians were satisfied if they had the children to practice their profession on; now they want the adults, too. And they may well get what they are after!</p>
