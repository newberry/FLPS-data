   <p>The lack of  adequate schoolrooms has never been so great in Chicago as last Monday, the first schoolday after vacation.</p>
   <p>There are about 10,000 pupils in the schools, according to statistics, for whom there is no provision made. The city school board has no desire to look after their whereabouts as there is not enough room for those who are attending now.</p>
   <p>It is indeed a shame for the city and especially for the school board that they will not find any way out of this mess. Of course, we understand that the members of the school board, being capitalists, are not interested in providing education for the children of proletarians, even when seasoned with patriotism. For the last years the board has taken great care to give out contracts only where they proved to be most advantageous to its members.</p>
   <p>Occasionally there were exorbitant sums of money spend for the erection of palatial buildings, like the one on 32nd and Forrest Streets, but there never was any money left for the simplest school buildings in laborers districts.</p>
