   <p>The Board of Education authorized $150,000 for this year, the same among as in the previous year, for German tuition, but the cost was in excess of $169,000. Mr. Harris said, that the appropriation must not be exceeded this year. It will therefore be necessary to dismiss 15 ladies, teachers of the German languages and their work-quota will be distributed among the more fortunate teachers remaining.</p>
