   <p>A reader of about 200 pages containing a selection of biblical sayings and stories - the result of several years of work by the gentlemen C.C. Bonney (Universalist), J. H. Barrows (Presbyterian) and W.T. Onahan (Catholic) - is now completed and will be laid before the School Board shortly, together with a monster petition of pious men, women and children who ask for the introduction of this "Guide to Morals" in the Public Schools.</p>
   <p>In former times, up to the year 1874, the Bible itself was in use as an instruction book in the free schools of our city. The teachers were obliged to read every day to their pupils a chapter from the old respected Book of Books. But the Bible contains so many and so different essays that the reports which the children brought home about them caused, in many instances, vexation and displeasure. The clearness with which the Old Testament prophets expressed their anger over governing inconveniences; the harmless frankness with which in many chapters of the book is spoken about occurrences which are covered nowadays with a heavy cloak of convenience; the immoral illustration of many things as they appear to modern people in contrast to the natural attitude in olden times - this all conspired to banish the Bible from the schools.</p>

   <p>Even pious Christians protested for these or similar reasons against the dangerous literature which the reader may enjoy without danger only in riper years. The principal adversaries of religious instruction at the Public Schools were of course also at that time already against the use of the Bible in the school, but their influence was minor at that time. Now, when the various Christian denominations made a joint effort to attain their former aim in a new and milder way, the School Board entered a troubled situation for some weeks. Threatened from two sides, the Board probably will find it as the most advantageous solution to assign the booklet of the Messrs Barros, Bonney and Onahan erstwhile to a Committee that will not be pressed for speed. Because of its personnel the Board may not accede to the proponents of biblical ethics. It will depend upon the new nominations, which the Mayor has to make in summer, whether the zeal of the Bible friends will prevail or not.</p>
   <p>The ethical teachings of the new reader are largely taken from the Old Testament especially from the "Proverbs of Solomon", from the book "Ecclesiastes", and from the "Psalms". Put on the head of the book are "The two noblest commandments", which Jesus gave to his disciples (St. Mark 12-30 &amp; 31): "You shall love God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your power. This is the first commandment, but the second one equals this: You shall <span class="page-break">3</span>love your neighbor as you love yourself. There is no higher commandment than this."</p>
   <p>Under the title, "Blessed children" is narrated, how Jesus of Nazareth said, "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven." Of the traditions of the Jewish nation are recorded the dreams and adventures of Joseph, who although sold into slavery by his brothers, became, through virtue and wit, ruler of the Egyptian Empire. Further, the book contains extracts from the penal code of Moses, which certainly stands in shocking contrast to the corresponding paragraphs of the regulations of Illinois.</p>
