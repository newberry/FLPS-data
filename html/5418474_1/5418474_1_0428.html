   <p>p. 5 - The Executive Committee of the United German Societies met in conference last night. A letter of protest having been read and approved was sent to the school board. Then, a petition with 1,500 signatures, drawn up by Mrs. Hulda B. Fox, a teacher at the George Howland School, was read. The contents of the petition are as follows:</p>
   <p>"The undersigned tax-payers of Chicago desire every advantage which the public schools may offer to their children. These words of the great poet Goethe are well known: 'To know well one's own language one must also know another one.' We ask the esteemed members of the school board not to curtail the teaching of German in the public schools at any time during the regular school year. German as taught in our schools is undoubtedly an asset to education. Therefore, the undersigned request the school board to maintain the German classes in our public schools."</p>
   <p>Arrangements are being made for a protest mass meeting which the entire German population of Chicago will be invited to attend.</p>
