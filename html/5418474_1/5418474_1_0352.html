   <p>School Commissioner Anton Czarnecki has again taken up his fight against the teaching of German in the public schools. As everybody knows, there has been no teaching of German for some time, although an order issued by Superintendent Mortenson on August 30 merely says that, until further notice, no new German classes should be started. This order could of course be interpreted to mean that in those [classes] already established, instruction could be resumed, provided that a sufficient number of pupils were available. This has exasperated Anton Czarnecki. At yesterday's meeting of the school board, he proposed two resolutions, one of which would immediately discontinue the teaching of German in the public schools, while the other would put all other languages which are not now taught in the public schools on an equal footing with German. Both proposals were referred to the committee on resolutions, whose chairman is Mrs. Lulu M. Snodgrass.</p>
