   <p>The list of those books, made up by Dr. B. C. Cigraud, president of the "Flag Day Association" will be given by Dr. Otto Schmidt to the school superintendent McAndrews. The list contains the following books: Eggleston's History, Goodrich History, Gilmon's History, Muzzey's History, McLaughlin History, Gordy, Swinson, Taylor, McCabe's History, Hale's History, Mary Barnes History, Thompson's History, Edna Turpin's History, and Foreman's History.
