   <p>Last night's affair, which was given by the German University students under the auspices of the International Students Association in the Leon Mandel Hall, proved to be a great success. The large auditorium was filled to capacity....</p>
   <p>The evening began with two German student songs. After the audience sang the American national anthem while standing, Attorney Leopold Saltiel took the platform and spoke about student life of today. He condemned the aims of the strict nationalistic circles, as well as the totally international circles of students, and suggested to adopt a golden mean as the only righeous way.</p>
   <p>In the arrangement to exchange students of different nationalities he detected a step for closer relations between individual nations, states, and races.</p>
   <p>After several laudatory comments about the endeavors of the German students in Chicago, the first verse of the German National anthem was sung.</p>

   <p>German music was the principal content of the entire evening. The German soul speaks genuinely and deeply through its music, which is also well understandable.</p>
   <p>Miss Anne Marie Girts who sang two songs by Schubert received great applause. Miss Eugenic Lanberg who followed her with an offering of three violin solos of which the Minuet by Mozart was the liveliest, although she awakened genuine acclaim with all three.</p>
   <p>With Styrian national dances which enlivened the audience, the first part of the evening closed.</p>
