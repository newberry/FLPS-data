   <p>On November 5 the citizens of Illinois have to elect a new state legislature or assembly.</p>
   <p>Legislature or assembly elections are always of great importance for the state and for each individual citizen, for the citizen is part of the state; the state is made up of the aggregate of its citizens.</p>
   <p>This year's legislative election is just as interesting and important as this year's Congressional elections.</p>
   <p>The next Illinois State Assembly, like the Congress to be elected, will have to deal with the task of reconstruction, which calls for the job of putting <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the war industry back on a peacetime basis and of easing this period of transition from war to peace. In addition, the Fifty-first General Assembly of Illinois will have to vote on the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It will depend on those who become State Senators and members of the Illinois House of Representatives after Tuesday's election, whether the important vote of the State of Illinois is cast for or against prohibition.</p>
   <p>This vote may either make all America "dry," or may save this great republic from the preposterous and degrading injustice, the grave moral damage, and the political rape of our democracy which prohibition will bring about.</p>
   <p>Our fate will be decided by the type of men elected next Tuesday, when we choose the representatives of the people (Senators and House Members). If a majority of Prohibitionists, unreliable persons, weaklings, and moral <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>cowards are elected, then we will have state prohibition, and the state will vote for national prohibition; then property worth many millions will be destroyed, thousands will lose their jobs and means of livelihood, and the citizens who drink a stein of beer or a glass of wine with their dinner, or in the company of good friends, after a hard day's work, will then have to be content with water or resort to illegal moonshine, which certainly will be plentifully supplied. Rightly they will feel like schoolboys or like people who are out under police surveillance because they don't know what is good for them and they cannot be trusted anyway.</p>
   <p>That in itself would be bad enough, but a prohibitionist victory in Illinois would mean much more. It would mean the victory of injustice and autocratic intolerance and fanatical and zealous despotism. It would also be an inglorious defeat of true democracy, striving after absolute justice, a democracy which promises, not only to all nations but also to all individuals-- <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>within the limits of the common welfare--the right to shape their own fate and mode of living and to govern themselves. Prohibition would mean an abrogation of the democracy of President Wilson, whom alone we have to thank that the country has not been "blessed" already with prohibition by an act of Congress. The people would lose their faith in democracy; law and justice would be scoffed at, and the door would be opened to legal anarchy which would not make for prosperity. From national prohibition we could most certainly expect an infamous corruption of the population with dire consequences, and national prohibition would become a certainty if the Fifty-first Illinois Assembly, the members of which are to be elected next Tuesday, voted for the adoption of the Prohibition Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
   <p>The injustice and damage of prohibition can only be averted if all citizens-- whether they themselves drink or not--are willing to maintain justice, personal liberty, and true democracy by favoring those candidates for the legislature who are known to be avowed foes of prohibition.</p>
