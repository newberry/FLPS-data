   <p>A storm in a tea kettle was provoked by Dr. Eduard Meyer, Professor of Jurisprudence at the Berlin University, and one of the five visiting German scholars, by his defense of college life in Germany. Among the temperance advocates a storm of indignation rages because the Professor related that as student he frequented drinking bouts and participated in many an improper prank. And his declaration, that if he were a student once more he would do the same things again, created cramps among many of the temperance ladies.</p>
   <p>These words, which caused such a storm of indignation among the enemies of beer in Chicago, fell yesterday during an informal student meeting at the Chicago University. Professor Meyer was announced as speaker and for his subject he selected a description of college life in Germany. He told his listeners how the German <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>student connects the earnest study with the gay life of youth, how he fosters sociableness and tests his personal courage at the fencing loft. Here he pointed to his beard, which he said, was hiding many cuts he received on the fencing-ground, but of which he is still proud. That the students, who listened to the lecture, did not conceive the matter like the temperance disciples, was shown by the storm of applause that greeted the end of the speech, and which was supported by the participating female students.</p>
   <p>The most angry of the entire temperance society is Miss Shontz, the President of the League of Christian Temperance Ladies. She declared that these expressions of the Professor definitely prove that he is no representative of the highest intellectual life in Germany.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock the main act of the fiftieth valediction celebration of the University of Chicago began the bestowal of the honorary Doctor degrees to a number of persons and the granting of the certificates of maturity to students. The celebration took place at the Mandel Hall of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>University Building in the presence of eight hundred persons. To the left and right hand side of the stage were placed two large banners, the German and the United States colors. The members of the faculty appeared in their black robes and tassel ornated caps. Accompanied by the sound of music the procession entered the hall. After a short prayer, President Harper bestowed the honors upon the students and held a short address, in which he enlarged upon the duties, aims and purposes of a university. Not only in the homeland shall it form a connection between the masses, no, it also must tie the different countries together. After this Professor John Herle Coulter delivered his announced commencement address, which contained a description of German scholarship and its successes. After Coulter Professor Meyer spoke. He spoke mainly about the war, a very dear subject to the historian. He explained that war is not only inevitable, but is a necessity. The anxiety for the preservation of the homeland arouses a nation and makes it strong. A war between Germany and the United States, which is so frequently mentioned, will, in his opinion, never occur; for this, both countries are too powerful and also too sensible. The representative of the German Emperor, Ambassador Hermann Freiherr Speck von Sternburg, then held a short address and read the message of the Kaiser. The Deacon of the institution, Mr. Judson, then read a congratulatory telegram from President Roosevelt in which he pointed to the prominent part the Germans play in the success of science. He also <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>remembered the share that is due to the Germans for the building up of the United States.</p>
   <p>Then began the bestowal of the Doctor degrees. Led by the Deacons of the concerned faculty the five German scholars stepped forward and received the degree. Each one in a few short words, rendered thanks for the honors. Then the Ambassador of the United States in Berlin, Charlemagne Tower, was bestowed in absentia - as a reward for his efforts to preserve the good relations between Germany and the United States. Ambassador von Sternburg also became an honorary Doctor of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>President Harper then announced that Mrs. Catherine Seipp has founded three prizes which will be known as "Conrad Seipp Memorial German Prizes". They amount to $3,000, $2000 and $1000 and shall be given to those who furnish the best essays on the subject: "The German element in the United States with special consideration of its political, moral, social and educational influence."</p>
   <p>With a banquet on which 250 guests participated, the celebration came to a conclusion.</p>
