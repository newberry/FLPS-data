   <p>It is generally known, that Sundell twice offered a resolution to exclude German from the primary and grammar grades of Chicago's public schools. He requested that the committee which was to investigate his German hate steeped resolution should submit its report. He said: "Thus far, the committee has been mute, it did not even utter a single syllable about it". And he considers such conduct as most peculiar. Mr. Nettelhorst, one of the members replied: "If Mr. Sundell is in such a hurry, and if there are no objections, then the matter may be decided forthwith, without waiting for the committee's recommendations."</p>
   <p>Evidently this did not auger well for Mr. Sundell's purposes, as he insisted on being informed about the committee's dissertations. Perhaps they will be available in the near future.</p>
