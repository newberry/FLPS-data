   <p>Yesterday's regular semi-monthly meeting of the school board presided over by Pres. Delaney, was taken up with the report for the school-year, 1879-80. The report stated that the study of German in public schools had made great progress under the guidance of Dr. Zimmermann. The Foster and Pickard schools had added this subject to their curriculum in the past year. The Jones, Nickersonville, Raymond, and the Marquette schools have also made application to include the subject in their studies. At the beginning of the school-year, 1900 students requested German instruction, an increase of 500 pupils.</p>
