   <p>The German beer and whisky papers in this country could not forbear from disgracing the memory of a brave man among the Germans in America, accusing him of being a "fanatical Temperance advocate and a cracked hypocrite". The man of when we speak is the late Wendell Phillips. By accident we got possession of one of his speeches, in which he touches on the temperance question. We repeat what he says: "I am a follower of the temperance movement. I adhered for 40 years to the principles of moderation, which I consider the best teacher of life." Same is the basis of self denial and self determination.</p>
   <p>Immoderation is one reason of poverty, but there is another side to it, too. Poverty is the cause of immoderation, drunkenness! Compel a man to work 14 hours a day and you degrade him to the life of an animal. You destroy his highest ambitions, jade his taste, kill his spirit! you make an automatic tool of him, who slaves 14 hours a day. If among 100, one through an iron will and resistance remains a man, it is a fact that 99 are lost under the pressure of conditions.</p>

   <p>Our German news cossacks and beer drinkers, whose highest ideal the saloon represents, must naturally consider such views and expressions as "crazy".</p>
   <p>This we have to admit.</p>
