   <p>We publish here a report from the school board for the past year. During the school year ending June 28, 1872, 2,359 pupils received German instruction in eight district schools. At the beginning of the school year, June 20, 1873, German instruction was continued in these eight schools and was taken up in two new schools, the Scannon and the Skinner. Immediately after the reconstruction of the Franklin, Ogden and Kinzie Schools, the German instruction was resumed there. The following table (furnished by the lady teachers) contains a few statistical statements concerning the German instruction:</p>
