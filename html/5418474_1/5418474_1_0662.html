   <p>The members of the board for German instruction held a special meeting, yesterday, presided over by Mr. D. Zimmermann, Superintendent of the Board of Education. Since Dr. Zimmermann has held this important position, the study of the German language has gained considerably in Chicago. He knew how to select a staff of capable German instructors, who are now teaching in all upper grades of our public schools. As a fact, more than half of all pupils are learning the German language.</p>
   <p>During yesterday's meeting, Dr. Zimmermann presented plans on how to intensify interest in the German language and thus carry its study to all parts of the city.</p>
