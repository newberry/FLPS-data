   <p>The National Education Association is an organization composed of school politicians. Its avowed objective is to obtain the greatest possible appropriation for school purposes. It has little interest in the disposition of the money. The Association takes the viewpoint that the money must first be appropriated; and that when that has been done a suitable use will soon be found for it. The February issue of the official organ of this Association tells of a widespread agitation for the purpose or eliciting money from the Federal Treasury.</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that these school politicians know how to propagandize and to influence Congress, and they are evidently determined to educate the teachers under their influence, in this remunerative act. In the aforementioned issue of their magazine we find the following instructions:</p>
   <p>1) Write immediately to your congressional representative and to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>President of the United States and urgently request them to support our public schools.</p>
   <p>2) Co-operate with the advisors of the General Committee for the Support of Schools, and with other friends of the school in your state, to influence public opinion on behalf of appropriating money for our schools from the Federal treasury.</p>
   <p>3) Request organizations to which you belong, or in which you hold positions on executive committees to demand that the members of Congress and of the Executive Department appropriate money for our schools from the National Treasury.</p>
   <p>4) Report what you have done, or what you intend, to do, to the Chairman of the General Committee for the Support of Schools.</p>
   <p>5) Act immediately--today!. The amount of success depends upon how soon <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and how energetically the organized teachers of our country act to attain the desired coal.</p>
   <p>One can easily imagine what an effect such propaganda will have in Washington. The leaders of the Government oust gain the impression that the entire country is making strong demands for appropriations for school purposes. Of course that impression would be inaccurate, for an overwhelming majority of our people, especially the much-plagued taxpayers, are urging greater economy in the operation of schools and a decrease in expenditures for educational purposes, What will sound in Washington like the powerful voice of the people will be nothing but the systematic and organized agitation of school politicians.</p>
   <p>How, what do these people really want. They want the Federal Government to appropriate money to pay teachers who work in communities which are not able to pay their teachers promptly, or which are forced to reduce expenditures for educational purposes. Part of the money is to be used to prevent the responsible authorities from carrying out sensible ana necessary economic measures, and part <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of it is to be used to help out, of their dilemma politicians who are in financial difficulties because of their dishonesty, extravagance, or incompetence.</p>
   <p>In other words, this organization with the nice long name is trying to create a widespread and intense agitation with the view of causing the Federal Government to pay a premium on graft, incompetence, ana extravagance. Let us hope that the teachers nave too much self-respect to help promote such a fraud.</p>
