   <p>Evanston has a growing colony of wealthy or well-to-do German residents, who are sending their children by preference to the Evanston University. It is this growing German element at the said University, which is attracting every year more students of German parentage to Evanston from all over Chicago. Professor Cohn has contributed enormously, by his splendid supervising activity, to further the good reputation of his German Department.</p>
