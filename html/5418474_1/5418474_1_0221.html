   <p>Our teachers, particularly the teachers of primary schools, are inclined to believe, that a child is the property of the School. This is an error. We have of course a law, which compels the child to go to School. As a rule, all parents are glad and willing to send the child to school for its own benefit and future. But the child belongs first and last to the family, which has the right to dispose of all free time, left for the child after leaving the school-house for home. No child should learn and study without the actual assistance of the teacher. Therefore, during the school hours the child should be completely under the guiding authority of the teacher. Home work should be avoided, as they will always interfere with the recreation and time of the child and the Home-Authority of the parents.</p>
