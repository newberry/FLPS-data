   <p>To the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>Your committee for the teaching of German wishes to hand you the following report for the year 1873-74.</p>
   <p>Last year the committee made two important recommendations, namely that the teaching in German should be organized gradually and that a superintendent should be appointed for German instruction. During the last year the Board of Education realized the necessity for these recommendations, The office of superintendent of German instruction was created, and Miss Regina Schauer, who at the Haven school had revealed remarkable teaching ability, was appointed to this position. A systematic course for the teaching of German has been worked out. It is to be found in the report of school superintendent Pickar. The committee has strictly adhered to the rule that candidates for German teaching positions must be as proficient in English as in German.</p>
   <p>The table below will be of interest as it shows that the children of all nationalities <span class="page-break">2</span>participate at the German classes.</p>
