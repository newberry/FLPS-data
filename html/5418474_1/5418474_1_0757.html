   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde (Gymnastic Community) arranged a mass meeting for tonight to enable the Germans and the friends of German-language instruction to devise ways and means for the continuance of that subject, as well as drawing and music, in our public schools. These cultural subjects are imperiled and an energetic protest aginst the proposed abolition of these educational branches must be considered. The matter is exceedingly important to all Germans.</p>
   <p>Considering the taxes which the Germans pay, they may and can demand that the ridiculously small amount which goes for German-language instruction shall be paid, so that the new generation will not be deprived of an opportunity to be thoroughly grounded in the tongue of their forefathers.</p>

   <p>The discontinuance of German is attempted under the guise of an economy measure; but, in reality, we are faced with a political measure whose purpose is--in the last analysis--the completed subjugation of the German element. No one need appear tonight at the Turnhalle who desires to see a reversion to the old days, when the Germans were absolutely devoid of influence in shaping the destiny of this country--the period when the Germans were dragged to the ballot box or kicked out of the polling places, depending on which was expedient at the moment. But anyone who believes that the Germans should have an equal opportunity in shaping our developing nation, and who intends to have his children study the ancestral language and remain Teutonic in spirit, should come to the meeting and bring his friends.</p>
   <p>The School Board will be influenced in direct ratio to the impressiveness of the meeting, and will drop its projected plan if the meeting is sufficiently attended.</p>

   <p>The preliminaries involving this protest have already shown a beneficial aspect, as we note from the appended article of the Inter-Ocean, quoted herewith:</p>
   <p>German in the Public Schools</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: As the article is available in English, it has not been translated here. However, a few excerpts are given to provide a reasonable continuity.]</p>
   <p>"Nearly every year at this time a loud outcry goes up....in an effort to prevail upon the School Board to eliminate German from our public schools.... Since economy is the slogan, one might think that a huge sum was at issue, but actually the sum involved is only twelve thousand dollars. The Germans....as law-abiding citizens....and taxpayers....are entitled to it....Does one care to revert to the mob rule of the former administration because of a doubtful saving of twelve thousand dollars?...."</p>

   <p>The article shows that the Inter-Ocean is well informed, and besides, it gives the consoling assurance that George B. Armstrong, one of the members of the School Board and local editor of the Inter-Ocean, will vote against the discontinuance of German--if for political reasons only.</p>
   <p>We repeat: The meeting should be well attended and it is hoped that no citizen of the North Side will be absent!</p>
   <p>The Aurora Turnverein (Aurora Gymnastic Club) and many citizens of the North Side will participate [in the meeting]. They will march in a body to the meeting, leaving the Aurora Turnhalle at 7:45 P.M.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if other associations would follow the example of the Aurora Turnverein.</p>
