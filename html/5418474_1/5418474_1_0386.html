   <p>Although no definite figures are as yet available, there are nevertheless certain indications that the attendance of German classes during the present school year has greatly increased. It is due to the modification of the requirement in connection with the attendance. Miss Gertrud E. English, the District Superintendent and head of the German him that while the study of German had not been included in the curriculum of the Kenwood School last year, it has been added to the plan of study for the present school year, due to the fact that the request of students for German were numerous. A similar step was taken in the newly erected Mozart School, at North Hamlin and Humboldt Avenues. Furthermore, the request for German instruction at the Gladstone School was so overwhelming that one more German instructor had to be added to the teaching force of the school. Procuring the services of qualified German teachers, is one of the greatest difficulties, according to Miss English.</p>
