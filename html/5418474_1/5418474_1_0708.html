   <p>The school board held a special session yesterday and the following members were present: P. A. Hoyne, president, and the inspectors: Stone, Vocke, Keith, Armstrong, Frake, Curran, and Delaney.</p>
   <p>The complaints of the citizens that the Wells Street school was in an unsanitary condition were referred to the committee on public buildings, likewise a report by the board of health on ventilation, sewers, and other conditions involving schools, and particularly the Scammon school.</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued on appropriations for salaries of special teachers, involving instruction in German, music, and drawing. Board members English and Stiles wanted a detailed account of all appropriations granted for the special branches [German, music, drawing] to be submitted to the city council. Stone relinquished his chairmanship temporarily to Frake, and declared that he would like to have German language instruction excluded from the public schools. Stiles remarked that he considered the request justified. Only recently General Lieb, an influential, highly respected German, said at a public meeting that German instruction in our public schools was a humbug, prompted by politics.</p>
   <p>Curran made a motion to give an estimate to the city council, and inform that body what the cost of each of the separate special subjects would be. The motion was accepted.</p>
   <p>Stone made a motion to eliminate the appropriation for German instruction. The motion was declared out of order.</p>
   <p>The report of the committee was submitted and considered. Stone made a motion to restrict appropriations for the salaries of special teachers to an amount sufficient to pay them for the current year. The motion was carried.</p>
   
   <p>According to the aforesaid, no appropriations were made for German instruction, drawing, and music beyond the end of the school term, July, 1880.</p>
   <p>In favor of Stone's motion were: W. J. English, M. E. Stone, E. G. Keith, J. Frake, W. Curran, M. A. Delaney, and J. N. Stiles--seven.</p>
   <p>Opposed were: W. Vocke, A. C. Bartlett, E. Frankenthal, Hoyne, and Armstrong--five.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
