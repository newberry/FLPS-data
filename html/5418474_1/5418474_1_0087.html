   <p>Yesterday the City Council approved the Mayor's School Board appointments which were made according to the new school law of 1917. The vote was forty-three to twenty-six, and there was no debate on the matter. The new Board, which consists of eleven members, takes the place of the old Board of twenty-one members. The commissioners, who were formerly members of the Board--and among whom are the "solid six"--lost their positions as a result of a decision of the State Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>Following is a list of the members and the terms for which they were appointed: Mrs. Lulu M. Snodgrass and Samuel Gessler, five years; Dr. Boleslaus Klarkowski and James B. Rezny, four years; Mrs. Francis E. Thornton and Dr. Sadie Bey Adair, three years; Edwin S. Davis and Albert H. Severinghaus, two years; Hart Hanson, Francis B. Croarkin, and George B. Arnold, one year.</p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile, Jacob M. Loeb, ex-president, and other officers and members of the deposed Board awaited developments. Commissioner Loeb declared that he would contest his dismissal.</p>
