   <p>The meeting of delegates from all the German clubs in Chicago, which was held yesterday at the North Side Turner Hall at the behest of the Chicago Turngemeinde, (Gymnastic Association) as a protest against the recently attempted discontinuation of German instruction as well as other special branches in our public schools, brought a very gratifying response.</p>
   <p>The sentiment of the assembly may be described as having been lukewarm, since nobody was in a particular hurry to offer any resolutions. The general attitude changed instantly, however, when it became known that a definite decision may be given on next Thursday at a special session <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the school board, when the question about these branches comes before it. The abolition of German instruction would of course also affect gymnastics, singing, manual training and several kindred subjects which are standard components of the present curriculum. That the school board could or might make such a drastic cut at the instigation of the sensation-mongers, our yellow press - that appeared to be real news for some of the delegates, but this denouncement sufficed to bring them into a huddle for contemplation. If the resolutions are followed and worked out in detail, success will be assured.</p>
   <p>The committee considered it expedient not to divulge the plans of the assembly until they are given to the school board, so that this body may not be given time to concoct a few excuses. But the essence of the text, <span class="page-break">\3</span>in its spiritual appeal, might be outlined. The undeniable arguments in support of truth and powerful appeals for the development of the soul in mankind, the intrinsic, yet dormant qualities which are still within the innermost recesses of a subtle heart, the German character, which, in the assimilative process forms a previous part of future generations in this new fatherland - these topics are part and parcel of the resolutions.</p>
   <p>The walls in our schools shall not reverberate with songs any more; the tiny hands must not acquire skill; forming, shaping of paper and clay is superfluous, gymnastics is a waste of time....for a school system which requires $6,000,000 per year and proudly calls itself the best in the world: The training of a child's hands, in order to make it conversant with drawing and modelling, which may be the only opportunity it ever <span class="page-break">\4</span>will have to awaken its latent talents; that shall be abolished. Yea, the public schools do not serve cream and "tidbits" on their bill of fare; the guests don't pay and ought to be satisfied with water and bread.</p>
   <p>How decidedly different do the retaliatory arguments sound: Is it your intention that our youths shall be cold creations from lifeless patterns? Don't you wish to implant something into their growing minds which creates happy, impressionable and alert children?</p>
   <p>Don't you desire to broadcast seed which, perchance, might lodge in some fertile spot and there mature as a magnificent flower? A shallow versatility deserves condemnation. Surely, therein we agree with you; but a heartless restriction to a mere cultural vegetating - that is a boundless evil!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We should enlarge our educational plan! Chicago has been bragging about its cultural system, now let it live up to it!</p>
   <p>Now, as to the German language. The resolutions showed, that the young mind attains the greatest proficiency when learning another language; that Chicago's German population hovers around the 400,000 mark. Mr. Hibbeler deserves credit for having this statistical reference inserted and Mr. Theo. G. Steinke added a few significant remarks. Our logical answer to that frequent question why German should be taught, is: Chicago has a colony of more than 400,000 Americans of German origin, nearly one-half of the city's entire population; that next to English, German is mostly used throughout the world. Finally, after considering these proofs, Mr. Steinke insisted upon a more energetic presentation of all phases pertaining to the cause. The delegates were now fully aware of the importance and magnitude of this problem, prompting them to add further <span class="page-break">\6</span>resolutions which will all be presented to the school board next Thursday by the committee of five. The members are: Messrs. Julius Goldzier, Geo. O. Schmidt, O. L. Wullweber, J. P. Hand, Louis Schutt and Max Stern. A roll-call showed the following participation: Veterans of the German Army, 80 members; Fortschritt Turnverein (Gymnastic Society); Harugari Order, 3,000 members; the Rothmaenner, (Red Men), 1,600 members; Germania Male Chorus, 750 members; German Press Club, and a long list of other German clubs, representing 15,000 members. The agitation will affect the entire city within the near future.</p>
