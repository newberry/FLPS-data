   <p>Next Tuesday, there will be in all probabilty, a decision reached, about the German teaching. It seems that the Committee for School Affairs have agreed to accept the proposition of Mr. F. C. Halle, who as is well known, is in favor of same. Only the teaching of some special subjects will be limited. A number of German women have issued an appeal, according to which a mass meeting will be held of all the friends of German teaching, in a week from to-day in the Northside Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>The ladies consider the subject too important, not to pay the greatest attention to it therefore they expect, that the meeting, which they arrange, will be well attended.</p>
