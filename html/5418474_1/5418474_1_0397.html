   <p>The loss of the German language in the open schools of Chicago has been reported by the Abendpost on various occasions, and it is the business of the Germans in Chicago to find a way to improve the same. To maintain German Ways, German culture and German influence, in the development of the history of our new country, we must preserve the German language for ourselves and our descendants. With the loss of the German language goes the power of Germanism in this country. If the best results should be attained, domestic education must cooperate with school education. According to the Illinois law, German lessons in schools must be taught if a certain number of parents demand it. This law certainly seems to be much in favor of the system, and even an anti-German school board cannot suppress the teaching of the German language.</p>
   <p>This law, however, does not fit our modern conditions. From Great Britain and Germany came the majority of immigrants. Other nationalities were in a great minority. The German element was the only large foreign element in this country. Conditions have greatly changed, as statistics of the present immigration proves. Poles, Bohemians, Russians, Hungarians, Italians, counted by the hundred thousands, are a political power and in many instances opposed to the Germans.</p>
   
   <p>They demand equal right in the teaching of their language if German is taught. The native-born take excellent advantage of this situation. Six years ago 30,000 pupils participated in the German lessons, whilst in the last year there were 6,827 students of German registered. This is a serious relapse. Many superintendents of schools are averse to the teaching of foreign languages, as they teaching of foreign languages, as they themselves speak only one language and have no understanding and love for others. If they have a chance to work against them, they will do so. One superintendent, instead of distributing the official questionnaire for the parents, just asked pupils if they wished to take part in the German lessons, mentioning that they would have to work harder though their work would not rate them higher in total achievements. Naturally only fifty-six pupils applied in the entire school, which number was insufficient according to the rules.</p>
   <p>The Chicago German element must help themselves and give the problem more serious consideration. The parents of the children of German descent should demand/the participation of their children in German lessons. The German citizens should place the power of their votes on this important cause. The German population is justified in this demand. The German language is one of the greatest cultural languages and it has a great educational value. One of the greatest sponsors has been our unforgettable Karl Schurz.</p>
