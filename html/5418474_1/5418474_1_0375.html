   <p>In the May issue of the "Reports of the German-American National Bund", the following reminder appears, asking for energetic propaganda by the state and local chapters of the Bund for the introduction of German instruction in the schools:</p>
   <p>"On the occasion of 'Schoolmen's Week', which took place in Houston Hall of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Dr. W. A. Haussmann of Central High School spoke on the German language. He declared German to be the finest of all modern languages, and put it on a par with Greek and Latin for its usefulness in philosophy, science, and technical arts."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is gratifying to learn that in these times, when even American school bigwigs and university professors indulge in Herman-baiting with such brazen shamelessness, Professor Haussmann had the courage to emphasize the beauty and the importance of the German language at a gathering of his colleagues and superiors. By this act, he has merited the respect of all German-Americans, who love, cherish, and cultivate their native tongue.</p>
   <p>Of course, much more could be done in this respect. There could be many more homes in America subscribing to the proud motto "German spoken here." The agitation for the introduction of German instruction in public schools, so successfully begun by the German-American National Bund and its school committee, has unfortunately been relegated to the background by the new and tremendous job, which the German element in the United States had to cope with on account of the war and the [anti-German] incitation of the American masses by the British-controlled press. And yet we think that right now, even granting that the chances for a successful agitation are not so good at present, a forceful support of the demand for German language instruction in elementary schools would be commendable and desirable, if <span class="page-break">3</span>only for the moral effect.</p>
   <p>He who lacks the courage to attain anything for himself and to make demands will never get any place in life. If you want to sit back and modestly wait until other people give you what you desire, you can grow as old as Methuselah without coming any nearer to the realization of your dreams.</p>
   <p>Particularly in American public affairs, one must make demands if one wants to get something. If it is made clear to our dear politicians that the demand for the introduction of German in public schools and its advancement to an obligatory subject in the high schools is widely supported by all citizens of German descent, whose ranks would surely be augmented by our Irish friends and many unprejudiced native-born Americans, these politicians would certainly take notice and at least be willing to compromise.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Right now we must make up our minds again to do something for our native tongue, for its preservation and propagation. We must forge the iron while it is hot, and never were conditions for a concerted action by all citizens than they are at present. The patriotic [German] meetings held during the last few months demonstrate that.</p>
   <p>All that is necessary is a strong appeal, and the German element will not fail. There they are, making sacrifices, proving that they are ready to promote German causes with all means at their command. Enthusiasm cannot be worked up with halfhearted measures and a lukewarm attitude. Neither can masses be aroused that way. There must be genuine and true enthusiasm in German hearts that will carry them away.Goethe once said, "Enthusiasm is not like picked herring, that'll keep for years." It would be good to remember that saying when it comes to making propaganda for the introduction of German language instruction in the public schools.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"Let 'em have it" is the battle cry of our brothers over there in the old country. And "Let 'em have it" should also be the motto of all German-Americans, who would like to do propaganda work for the preservation and propagation of their native tongue. Keeping this in mind, we welcome the manly words spoken by Professor Haussmann with sincere satisfaction. May they serve as a new incentive for our agitation for the introduction of German language lessons as a standard subject in our elementary schools and for the extension of the curriculum in our high schools as far as German instruction is concerned.</p>
