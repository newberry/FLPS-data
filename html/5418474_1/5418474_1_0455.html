   <p>The committee in charge of drawing up a protest in the German controversy submitted the document to the delegates of the turn societies for their approval today. The text of the unanimously approved protest is as follows: "The turn societies of Chicago are very anxious and uneasy in regard to the proposed reduction of the appropriation for certain instructions in public schools so necessary to modern education. The turn societies are well aware of the fact that the School Board's task in the present crisis is not an enviable one. The School Board experiences the difficulty of a financial orisis, and deems it necessary to limit the instruction of German gymnastics, drawing, music, and kindergarten work. It is the opinion of these societies that no modern educational system can be considered complete, without the teaching of those subjects. Considering further, that through these proposed limitations the efficacy of the school system would be badly shaken, we, the representatives of all turn societies of Chicago, raise our voices in protest against any possible limitations of the aforementioned subjects. It is our advice to the School Board to do its utmost in order to avert this financial crisis."</p>
