   <p>The following people, representing about seventy German clubs and societies, presented Mayor Harrison with a memorandum: Messrs. M. Stern, J. Goldzier, G. A. Schmidt, J. P. Hand, O. L. Wullweber, L. Schutt, Th. Naerup, L. O. Kohtz, and Ph. Koehler.</p>
   <p>The memorandum has a splendid appearance. It is bound in blue leather trimmed in silver.</p>
   <p>It refers to the maintenance of the special branches of study, particularly the instruction of German in public schools.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Including the pages on which appear the signatures of representatives of German clubs and societies, it contains nearly one hundred pages. The work is embellished with a pen and ink sketch of the mayor, and bears the following inscription on a plate of silver:</p>
   <p>"The friends of the new educational system to Carter H. Harrison."</p>
   <p>It pays tribute to the mayor for his interest in a progressive school system, in accord with the desires of the Germans. This was manifest in his first appointment of a new member to the School Board. The arguments of the opponents have proven to be unsound and faulty, and an urgent appeal is addressed to him, requesting his co-operation with the best elements of the citizens for the prevention of a lowering of educational standards, and to protect our system of public schools <span class="page-break">3</span>from becoming poverty-stricken institutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stern handed the memorandum over with a brief address in which he expressed the sentiment of the Germans about this important matter. Mayor Harrison replied that, as mayor, he would always have the interest of the schools at heart, and that, although he may differ in some points with the opinions of the committee, he also favors a good education. He also pointed out that the School Board should pay more attention to incumbent business affairs, than to the inner management of the schools. Furthermore, he hinted at a proposal, which would remove financial difficulties, thus frustrating the arguments of the enemies of German instructions.</p>

   <p>Another recommendation made by the mayor was that students of German attending schools where only a few participate in German classes should be assigned to these districts where the number of students is larger. He did not disclose any further details about his intentions, but promised merely that he would study the contents of the memorandum, and give the matter consideration as soon as possible.</p>
