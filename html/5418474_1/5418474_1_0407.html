   <p>Students of the German department of the "Northwestern University" performed last night in the County Club Building at Evanston before a large audience the drama: "Heines Youthful Sufferings" by Dr. A. Metz in the German language with excellent success. The public followed the performance with the greatest interest and the performance of the actors and rewarded them with much applause.</p>
   <p>The performance gave ample proof of the activity and capability of the students and their able department chief, Prof. James H. Taft. During the intervals entertaining performances were given by Mrs. Minnie Fish-Griffin, by Heinischer, by Rob. Franz, etc.</p>
   <p>The remarkable progress made in the German language by the performing students was very encouraging.</p>
