   <p>The Schiller Lodge, No. 347, has passed the following resolutions: As in recent times some intolerant and reactionary "un-Americans" have attacked instruction in German, as well as drawing, singing and gymnastics in our public schools, we, the members of Schiller Lodge, No. 347, D. O. H., are of the definite opinion that the above mentioned branches are exceedingly beneficial and conducive to mental and physical development of the growing generations, and,</p>
   <p>As we are good American citizens and taxpayers, and as such feel that we have the right to express our wishes in regard to the spending of taxes for the education of our children; we resolve, therefore, to protest against the removal of the previously mentioned branches from our public schools, and urgently request the honorable Board of Education to promote these branches in our public schools as much in the future as has been done in the past.</p>
