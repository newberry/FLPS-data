   <p>Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, the Superintendent of the Public Schools is planning to make definite changes regarding the instruction of "German." She will recommend in her next yearly report to substitute the Roman characters for the "German" in writing and in print.</p>
   <p>She asserts that the "German" characters cause a greater strain on the eyes and that children who must learn to write both the "Roman" and "German" characters usually are defective in both. Mrs. Young expects to discuss this matter with eminent "Germans" in the city before she proceeds with the recommendation.</p>
