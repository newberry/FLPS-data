   <p>During the war our school system, like many other things, has suffered to quite an extent. Even if we take into account the fact that the overwhelming majority of the teachers were women and that only a comparatively small number of the male teachers were of conscription age and subject to the first draft, the fact remains that the number of male and female teachers in the country has dwindled quite considerably, because the immense growth of the war industries has offered people of their education a far better chance for material success than the teaching profession ever did. Consequently, not only male teachers but also a large number of female teachers have left the schools and turned to more lucrative positions. Many of them are, in all probability, permanently lost to the teaching profession. Under the present extraordinary circumstances they will adapt themselves to a new application of their mental faculties and to a different utilization of their knowledge more easily than would otherwise be the case.</p>

   <p>After the war they will either remain in these better-paying positions, or, profiting by the experience gained in commerce and industry, will look for similar jobs, which would seem to them more profitable than a return to the teaching profession.</p>
   <p>The gaps thus created in the teaching body of the country will have to be filled somehow or other. If this were not done, the quality of American schools would suffer and the general education of adolescent youth would sink to a lower level, a possibility which we can only view with apprehension. The struggle to make a living after the war will require a much more complete equipment of mental capacity and practical knowledge than ever before. The competition of nations in commerce and industry will be keener than ever and every nation will have to tax her powers to the utmost in order to maintain her former position in the world market, to say nothing of improving it. We must not, therefore, neglect the systematic training of our young people. On the contrary, they will have to be given much more careful attention. For this purpose, the training of a teaching personnel which is efficient and in every respect adequate is of the first importance. In former years, the examinations taken by teachers <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in order to qualify for these responsible positions were not always given the necessary consideration. In many of the smaller localities and in rural districts, especially, more interest was shown in getting cheap teaching personnel than in testing the qualifications of the candidates who applied. In the larger cities this tendency was not so evident, but very frequently, even here, persons not suited to the task have been assigned to teaching positions. Not everyone can be a schoolmaster, even if he has the necessary knowledge. It takes much natural talent, skill, and tact, traits of character which cannot be learned but are, to a certain extent, inherited. Political influence in the large cities has enabled hundreds of thousands to secure positions as teachers of youth whose defects of character or insufficient knowledge made them unfit for the job right at the beginning.</p>
   <p>To a certain degree, this may be excused by the rapid increase in population and an undeniable lack of suitable candidates. It is regrettable that the teaching profession does not attract capable persons in this country to the same degree that it does elsewhere. An attempt has been made to explain <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>this phenomenon by calling attention to the meagre pay of the teachers. This may be true of many teaching positions in rural districts and in small towns, but in the larger cities this argument does not hold water. In no other profession do young people of both sexes so quickly attain a salary which makes them independent of subsidies from their parents. Moreover, the working year is only forty weeks at the most and the working week only five days. This does not take into account the many holidays which schools observe as conscientiously as banks.</p>
   <p>For the talented, industrious, and ambitious teacher who is willing to work hard in order to get ahead, a quick promotion and an honorable career are in most cases assured. Young people of this type, who have to decide on a vocation now or within the next few years, have a very excellent chance for quick promotion within the teaching profession if they attend a normal school after graduating from high school. No one who has a natural talent or inclination for teaching should give his desire free rein. The accumulation of earthly goods is not the main requisite for human happiness.</p>
