   <p>March 26, 1878.</p>
   <p>The German language was taught in all primary and high schools of Chicago, instituted by the educational program of the Board of Education, until June 1876, when a decision of the same Board of Education left the teaching of German to the children, to the free will of the parents. In spite of this decision the number of pupils of German learning was 2098 in June of last year, and rose in March of this year to 2193 pupils.</p>
   <p>We owe this result to the untiring efforts of the Committee for German Instruction, which had to fight a powerful propaganda of English-American newspapers which were against the teaching of foreign languages, particularly German. It is up to the alertness of all Germans and German-Americans to fight for the German mother tongue and support the hard task of the German Committee (for German instruction) in every direction.</p>
