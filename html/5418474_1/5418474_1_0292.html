   <p>The St. Louis German papers justly rejoice about the partial introduction of the German teaching method( so-called "visual instruction") into the public schools of their city. It has, been ordered that every week one hour of physics shall be taught with Hotze's "First Lessons of Physics" as a test... The Chicago School Board would do well to imitate St. Louis' example.</p>
   <p>Until now, in the middle schools here, no word of physics is being taught, and of gases and their qualities, of thermometer and barometer, of the three forms of aggregation, the vast majority of the pupils who do not enter high school, never hear the faintest syllable.</p>
