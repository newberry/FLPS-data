   <p>German was taught in Chicago at the Washington School before the year 1865, Mr. Lorenz Brentano who at the time was School Superintendent suggested it and through his influence German became one of the languages which the School now offered. The first German instructor became Mrs. Pauline Reed, an extremely well educated young woman. In the year 1866 Mrs. Reed was transferred to the Karolina McFee School. The School already had an enrollment of 115 students. The experiment was a success and the School Superintendent decided that German instructions should be offered as he believed they were definitely a success. At the beginning it was announced that in the near future in all Schools where 115 children or more are in attendance and parents wish their children to take up the study of German, that such instructions be made available. Through this German was offered at once at four schools, the Mosely, Franklin, Newberry, and Wells Schools. In the next few years came the Cottage Grove, Kinzie, Carpenter, the LaSalle, the Skinner, Scammon and the Lincoln Schools all of which offered German. At the end of the school years 1870-1871, 4297 students took up the study of the German Language. 1441 students in the secondary grades; 2856 students in the primary grades.</p>

   <p>Through the big fire, the city of Chicago, was in smoke and in an awful condition. Of course German instruction was ruined. After Chicago recovered from the shock it was decided in the year 1873 by the School Superintendent to appoint some one as director to organize and prepare German lessons. The one selected was Miss Regina Schauer. At the same time it was decided to have German prepared into certain courses. Heretofore, the teachers prepared and selected their own work in German.</p>
   <p>Then in the year 1877 through the influence of the well-known attorney Mr.M.Corke, Dr.G.A. Zimmermann became head of the German Department. At the time 1912 scholars were taking German in 18 schools. Sixteen teachers were employed in the eighteen schools. The interest in German instruction among the public at that time had died away. The result was tremendous sensation.</p>
   <p>In the year 1880 German was taught in twelve more schools and in three high schools. The teaching personnel consisted of 28 persons and the scholars numbered 3981. Four years later 10,696 scholars received German lessons in 43 schools from 73 teachers. When in the year 1885 German was again taught in the third and fourth grades the number of scholars reached 29,440 and number of teacher had reached 143.</p>
   <p>In the year 1890 German was also taught in the suburbs in 26 schools. It was necessary to engage 207 teachers to teach 34,801 scholars and Dr.Zimmermann received a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>most capable assistant by securing the services of M.T.River. In the year 1892 and 1893 German instruction had reached its peak. Not less than 44,270 scholars and 242 teachers were working under the direction of Dr.Zimmermann. Because of financial conditions the School Board was compelled to decrease its personnel, so German was taught only in the upper grades and this of course was a set back. Nearly one hundred teachers lost their positions and 20,000 scholars were unable to take German. However the teachers all of them received positions as English instructors.</p>
   <p>Since that time however, the number of teachers and scholars have again increased. Since the last report 40,003 scholars asked for German instructions. From this amount 15,020 were of German descent, 12,195 Anglo-American and 12,788 belonged to different nationalities. These instructions were given by 210 teachers so that each teacher had 190 students. In the High Schools 2481 students took German, 1310 French and 12 Spanish.</p>
   <p>As far as Dr.Zimmermann's report was concerned, the year ending 1899 was a most critical year as will be seen soon, as just a big crisis had past for the School Board. Even as early as the year 1900 the School Supt. was ordered to discontinue altogether German instructions due to financial conditions. One such proposal which had even the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>support of such an influential newspaper as the "Times Herald", also agreed that German instructions should be discontinued. That is why in the year 1900-1901, 42,000 students took German in the public schools and 3000 students took German in the High School. In the public schools 215 teachers and 27 teachers in the High School. Since then unfortunately there has been a steady decline. Mr.E.G.Colley, the present School Supt. was asked a direct question by the Author which Mr.Colley recently answered. "Since you made your inquiry, the situation has changed somewhat. Since 1902 the special teachers were ordered to supervise a classroom and to teach German and other courses and subjects. The German teacher now teaches German in her own classrooms but also teaches German in other classrooms in the same school. During the time the German teacher teaches in another classroom her own room is being occupied by the teacher whose room she is using and that teacher teaches another subject outside of German and sometimes more than one subject. In this way, you will note that the cost is reduced which otherwise would exist through the German Instructions, as now it isn't necessary any longer to engage special German teachers also, these teachers now receive only five dollars a month extra. In the High School there has been no change, German is being taught there just as before. By the end of February 16,269 students in the Elementary schools will have taken German. The rule for the Elementary Schools are, that at least 75 students have to ask for German Instructions before <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>a German teacher will be engaged to start a class when there are at least 25 students present."</p>
   <p>As far as the letter of the Superintendent was concerned he had about 60 percent of the public schools offering German Instructions. But since something like this has happened for the past ten years and afterwards always turned out better there is hope that this report will not be the worst one.</p>
   <p>Through Dr. Zimmermann's efforts he finally succeeded in awakening the interest of the public again. He made several changes in the methods. Discarded a four hundred page book containing too many rules and replaced this one through a practical reader.</p>
