   <p>Richberg said: "The Supreme Court has decided that all studies must be regarded as a part of the regular curriculum. Not only reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also German, music, and drawing--in fact, every study--must be regarded as a part of the regular curriculum. Instruction in German or in drawing cannot be denied a child on the grounds that not more than twenty children would take the course, just as the School Board cannot pass a rule that arithmetic shall be taught only if twenty or more children take up the subject."</p>
   <p>Richberg quoted the Supreme Court decision in support of his statement, and made a motion to nominate a committee to investigate the matter. His motion was carried.</p>
