   <p>p. 5. The Germans of Chicago are well aware of the fact that a certain group here is trying to have the German language and gymnastics eliminated from the public school's curriculum. The enemies of the German language have so far succeeded in having instruction of German in public schools curtailed considerably. But they will not be satisfied unless they can be complete victors in this fight against better education as advocated by them.</p>
   <p>This has prompted the Chicago Turner district to action. It was decided at their last meeting to entrust the committee for intellectual aspirations with the task of interesting the Germans of Chicago more deeply in the present fight for retention of the German language and German gymnastics in public schools. In compliance with this decision, the committee invited all German societies of Chicago to send their representatives to a joint meeting, at which ways and means will be discussed on how to remove the danger of elimination of the German language and gymnastics from public schools. The meeting will be held June 12th at Eicke's Hall, Randolph Street. Each society is requested to send two delegates and to provide each delegate with a letter of credentials. Every German society, regardless of its political alliance, its religious belief, or sex of its membership, is entitled to cast its vote at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The Committee of the Chicago Turner District.</p>
