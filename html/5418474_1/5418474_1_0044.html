   <p>Twenty-six pupils of an elementary school in Milwaukee have staged a strike the carrying out of which is an outright paragon of childish ability to observe and to emulate [the actions of adults]; at the same time it throws a rather odd light upon the art of education as practiced in this country.</p>
   <p>Basically, this strike of saplings of the sixth, seventh, and eight grades was ludicrous. They demanded--what is humanly understandable--shorter school hours and longer vacations, abolition of homework (which they seem to have felt to be especially irksome) and--only Heaven knows why--provision of more sandpaper for use in the instruction of manual arts.</p>
   <p>Otherwise, the strike appears to have been quite amusing to those not interested in it. The leaders of the strike leaped up, at an agreed moment, in their school-rooms, proclaimed the strike, and stormed out into the schoolyard. There they formed processions of strikers, carrying posters and shouting their demands with much force of lungs. Sharpshooters, equipped with blowing tubes and catapults, bombarded the windows with pebbles and peas, in short the saplings deported themselves entirely like their respectable parents, except that the latter employ bricks in place of peas in similar instances.</p>
   <p>One could dismiss the whole strike of the pupils as a cheap joke and go on with our routine work, had the affair not shown us once again the weak spots in our educational system.</p>
   <p>Hand in hand with weak discipline at school stands, in most cases, a complete lack of discipline in the home. No wonder, therefore, that we read that the school principal was helpless when confronted with that boyish prank in Milwaukee. The respect she enjoyed at the hands of her pupils was probably not great, because she finally had to call for police intervention to restore peace and order in the school. All the schoolboys failed to do was to shoot at the police with their blowing pipes.</p>
   
   <p>The strike of Milwaukee boys is undoubtedly a product of the spirit of our times, which seems to have thoroughly infected the world of these trousered saplings, for whom school has been a necessary evil where games and carefree gayety have reigned supreme. As the adults strike, so seem the young ones to strike, emulating their elders in a most exemplary manner. The unconcerned bystander seems to think it advisable to administer to the little strikers, in place of the larger quantity of sandpaper demanded, a few doses of other rubbing remedies, so as to cure them of hankerings for strikes. Much more desirable, however, although to our regret not possible of execution, would be the adequate education of the teaching personnel, of whom the majority lacks understanding of how to assert and maintain their authority.</p>
