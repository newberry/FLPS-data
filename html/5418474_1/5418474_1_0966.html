   <p>According to the standpoint of noted physicians, humanity never will do away completely with alcohol and certain kinds of liquids or solutions, containing a percentage of alcohol. Most medicines to-day could not be manufactured without the additional alcohol.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, we do not believe in prohibition-laws, forbidding the use of wine, beer and liquor by human beings. The sale of alcohol or any drinks, containing alcohol, should be controlled or regulated by law, but not eliminated as it is the heart's desire of our dry fanatics.</p>
   <p>There are and always will be drunkards- with prohibition or no prohibition-, and the use of drinks, containing alcohol, always will depend on man's commonsense, which can be learned only by patient teaching of selfcontrol in human habits.</p>
