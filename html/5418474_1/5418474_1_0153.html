   <p>The School Board Committee for Instruction affairs has resolved to recommend that those teachers of German in the public schools, who already have 19 years of service and therefore in the next year are entitled to a pension, shall be freed of the new examination demanded. Originally it was motioned that this privilege should be extended to all teachers who have at least 15 years of service, but the Committee refused to take this up.</p>
   <p>Member Loesch was against any exception whatsoever.</p>
