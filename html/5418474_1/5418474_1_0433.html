   <p>In the Louis Nettelhorst School, - named after the late German "Turner" and President of the School Board - German instruction was omitted for the new school year in the sixth and seventh grade. In vain were complaints made of many parents to the Principal of the School, to the President of the School Board, Emil Ritter, whose own children are affected by it, and to Superintendent Cooley.</p>
   <p>The number of pupils who registered for participation in German instruction had sunk to nineteen, and the classes depend on the participation of twenty-five students. By entering the fifth grade the parents must obligate themselves that their children shall take up the full four years' course in German.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the class teachers of this school did not take German very seriously; there were even reports of cases, in which the teachers threatened some children that they would not pass if they did not quit the German classes.</p>
   
   <p>Why just this study should prevent promotion, and not also the participation in any other "fad", can only be explained by hatred against the German. The Principal complains besides, that it is so hard to get good German teachers; for this they need not wonder after the systematic cutting of German instruction, and still they would be available without doubt if the teachers themselves would not be disgusted.</p>
