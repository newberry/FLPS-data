   <p>The Innkeepers of this district, which includes Cook County, met, this morning, at the Northside Turnhalle, for their annual convention. Mr. George opened the convention and read a report to the effect that the Society has a membership list of 526, of which 140 have joined the Union since last year.</p>
   <p>He further stated with satisfaction; that the English Innkeepers, lately joined our organization. As for the question of Temperance, it would seem necessary to join the party, which pledges itself to actively fight the temperance movement.</p>
   <p>The factory owners and wholesale dealers were criticised for their indifference toward the activities of the organization, although, they are the ones who would suffer the most under the proposed temperance law. The sums of money they donated were appreciated, but we need their undivided moral and personal support.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. George was elected President, and the Treasurer gave the report on finances. For the inspection of mandates Messrs. A. Miller, P. Miller and Hansburg, were appointed and within ten minutes a report was made that 40 delegates had been present. The next point of discussion was the permanent organization. Adolf Mille was appointed President and Frank Adams, Secretary.</p>
