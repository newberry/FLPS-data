   <p>That the supplying of schoolbooks by the state is to be regarded as a Socialistic measure cannot be denied. So if a Democratic Governor, like Campbell of Ohio gives his official approval on this innovation, then it adds new proof, that the American Democracy is as little addicted to unlimited individualism as the Manchester School in England. The essential reasons Campbell gives, in justification of his claims are hereby appended. The state builds schoolhouses, supplies instructors, supervises details pertaining to education--excepting the supply of books. Does any sensible reason exist, to deter the state from accepting this obligation? New experiences in the state of Indiana demonstrate that books of similar standard as ours, are obtained in this state at a saving of 35 -50%. Other states have enjoyed equal results. It appears to be a definite fact that books supplied directly by the state, or by contract sanctioned by it--are more reasonable. (Comment by Editor) Very true, yet individualism's replys <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will be: It is not the state's duty to conduct a publishing concern thus infering that clothing, shoes, meals are also to be included. These are exaggerations, Society knows how Socialism may be practiced and within what bounds, etc.</p>
