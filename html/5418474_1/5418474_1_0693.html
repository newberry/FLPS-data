   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>In considering your remarks regarding the resolutions passed by the school board, involving the salaries for special teachers in our public schools, it appears that you regard this as tantamount to abolishing German instruction in our schools. This assumption, however, is not based on fact, as may be deduced from the following items:</p>
   <p>The Committee on Salaries called attention to an entry of $2,340 for special teachers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frankenthal made a motion to add $1,560 to the above sum. A vote on the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>question resulted in acceptance of the committee's report and the sum of $2,340 was set aside for special teachers.</p>
   <p>In reality these special teachers are not only teachers but also superintendents. A few years ago, they were called superintendents, but the public ridiculed the Board of Education because of the large number of superintendents in that department and therefore the title "special teachers for German, music, and drawing" was used instead.</p>
   <p>All our teachers give instruction in singing and drawing whenever required, and therefore I cannot see the need of having superintendents for the special branches. We have a few special teachers who give German instruction in the so-called grammar classes [lower grades] and, as far as I know, they are fully capable; but we also have a superintendent of German language instruction who is also a "special teacher" and, it appears, his only duty is to supervise other teachers. I am convinced that these three superintendents or special teachers are superfluous, and that the other teachers who give German instruction <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>are fully capable of doing the work without supervision, or without the help of a superintendent. If the afore-mentioned teachers should prove unsatisfactory, then the Committee on German Instruction should notify the Board of Education and proficient ones will be found.</p>
   <p>In regard to salaries, to which we referred before, enough money is available to pay the three superintendents (special teachers) of German, music, and drawing, up to July 1, 1888, which is the end of their term. At the end of that period all superintendents would be dispensed with, because they would be unnecessary and instruction in German, music, and drawing, would continue just as satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>The regular German instructors are paid from the teachers' fund, and no distinction exists. The appropriations made at the time covered all salaries, and no attempt was made to discontinue any of the special branches. I am willing at any time to vote for an increase in the staff of German teachers, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>if the number of children taking, or desiring to obtain, language instruction make that step necessary. On the other hand, I am decidedly opposed to pay for so-called superintendents if we can get along without them.</p>
   <p>"Hoping that you may find space in your valued publication to submit this explanation to your readers.</p>
   <p>I remain</p>
   <p>Very respectfully</p>
   <p>M. A. Delany</p>
