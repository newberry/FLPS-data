   <p>The German societies of local universities are preparing two theatrical performances at which the comedies "Under Four Eyes" by Ludwig Fulda and "The Distant Princess" by Hermann Sudermann, will be played.</p>
   <p>The first performance will be held at the Anna May Swift Hall of Northwestern University in Evanston and the second performance will be given at the Reynolds Club of the University of Chicago. The fact that these theatrical performances are taking place again is a good sign of the revival of the German language at the higher educational institutions.</p>
   <p>Since 1920, after the reintroduction of German in the high schools and colleges, the number of students has increased constantly. Recognition of the great importance of the German language has at last penetrated the academic circles. It is expected that this interest will increase steadily, especially if supported by such means as the theatrical performances.</p>
