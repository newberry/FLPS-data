   <p>The school board held a special meeting yesterday evening, at seven o'clock, to consider unfinished business for the month of June. Mr. Wells was chairman; Hoyne, Jacobs, Armstrong, Bartlett, Frankenthal, Frake, Keith, Arnold, Brennan, Vocke, and Pruessing were present.</p>
   <p>Business matters were considered immediately. Hoyne made a motion that the salaries of the teachers in the special branches be approved in accordance with the recommendations of the committee. This applies to German language instructors who are to receive a salary of $1350, for music drawing instructors, $1350, and for music teachers $1200. The motion was carried; Jacobs was the only member who objected. Without delay, Orlando Blockmann was unanimously appointed music teacher for the next year; Mrs. E. F. Dimock, as drawing teacher, and Dr. G. A. Zimmermann, as German language instructor.</p>
