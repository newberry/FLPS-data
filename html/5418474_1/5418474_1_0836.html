   <p>Dr. Lyman Bryson, professor of pedagogy at the teachers' seminary of Columbia University, recently declared that the education and training of adults will, in the next ten years, become an essential part of public education. Dr. Bryson is employed at an institution which has for its task the training of teachers of both sexes. One may, therefore, well assume that he has good information on the point. He may perhaps not know how the development may proceed in the next ten years, but he is undoubtedly familiar with the plans of leading persons in the field.</p>
   <p>Looking backward over the history of education in this country, one arrives at the reassuring conclusion that Dr. Bryson is quite correct in his prophecy. American education has, in a relatively brief period, developed from the most primitive beginnings to a large-scale undertaking which is assuming colossal <span class="page-break">2</span>proportions. The schools of today are by far the most expensive in the world. In most countries, the greatest part of the public revenue is swallowed by the army and navy. Added to this are payments of interest on public debts, the latter having arisen largely from wars. In one word, national defense, and all connected with it, swallows the greatest part of the national income.</p>
   <p>It is not that way in the United States. The costs of the army and of the fleet are, as compared with the cost of education, almost negligible. Even the amortization of interest is, compared to the sums spent for training the youth, quite modest. When the war veterans received, in one year, nine hundred millions from the federal treasury, they proved themselves rather timid as compared with the educators of youth. The costs for schools are not particularly conspicuous, because they are not footed by the federal government, but largely by cities and counties.</p>
   <p>In most larger cities of America, the situation is now such that the expenditures for schools are considerably higher than the expenditures for all other <span class="page-break">3</span>community purposes combined. Of course, the schools are doing something and there are, to be sure, serious-minded educators who adhere to the point of view that the system, as a whole, is a total failure, that it brings up the youth systematically to materialism and to superficiality, and that the grave evils from which American life suffers are attributable to faulty education received in the schools. It is primarily the enormous overcrowding of the teaching program, with all possible and impossible curricula, which is the main cause of the superficiality of our school children. This is exactly what the school politicians have sought for decades. By conducting this fight to its desired end, they finally succeeded in making school administration exceedingly expensive.</p>
   <p>This fight was skillfully conducted by the National Educational Association, and the gentlemen from the teachers' seminary of Columbia University rendered valuable service in this connection. Professor Bryson knows, therefore, what he is talking about when he announces a further expansion of the educational program on a colossal scale. It seems that the brave educators have arrived at the <span class="page-break">4</span>opinion that they no longer can increase the cost of children's education. That is why they chose adults for their victims. This danger must not be underestimated, because everything is possible with God and the National Educational Association.</p>
