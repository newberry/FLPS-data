   <p>Some months ago the English Press almost unanimously recommended the benefits of manual instruction for our youth, and demanded its introduction into all public schools. The Chicago Herald and the Chicago Evening Post indulged in these praises especially enthusiastically, and surpassed all other newspapers.</p>
   <p>However, now that the Board of Education has appropriated a small amount for an experimental introduction of manual training in the public schools, the same press is howling fiercely against wasting the money of the taxpayers, on the introduction of a fad. Again it is the Herald and the Evening Post which are the loudest in their protest against something which they formerly recommended so highly.</p>
   <p>It is indeed, permissible to change one's mind in regard to certain matters, and to renounce a thing which we have acclaimed previously, if this change is based upon bad results of a test which has been executed. But to change one's mind before a test is made, and to bitterly criticize officials, because they did what was urgently demanded of them, is indeed an absurdity. Perhaps the English press was of the opinion that manual training could be introduced and instructions given without any expense and if so, their raving should be directed against their own folly.</p>
   <p>Manual training is recognized by all modern pedagogues as an excellent and indispensable means of education. It is worth a trial even if it should cost more than has been calculated.</p>
   <p>Instruction in German in our public schools is also considered a fad by the English press, against which they are raving. Usually it continues until the budget consultations are completed and then nothing more is heard about it, and being accustomed to it, it is of no effect. However, it does not matter! If they and their readers derive pleasure from this, let them rave.</p>
