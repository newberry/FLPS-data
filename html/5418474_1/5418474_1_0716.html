   <p>It came to our attention that Mr. Walsh, is strongly opposing the teaching of German in the Public Schools. He took the same stand as Alderman in 1862, and later as a member of the Board of Education. As proof of Mr. Walsh's hate for the Germans we state, that he was opposed to allowing the City's printing work to be published in any German newspaper. He thought the German language, has no right in this country. It would be advisable for the Socialistic Alderman to look up the past records of this candidate for Justice of Peace, before they cast their votes for him. More information as to Mr. Walsh's views could be obtained from the Alderman Messrs. H. Schubert, L. Brentana, ex-Alderman Schaffner, Conrad Fols, ex-Alderman Lengacher, John Buhler and Peter Mahr. These Alderman have been co-workers of Mr. Walsh, (part of the time) and have to some extent protested against his hostile attitude towards the Germans. Why could the "Illinois Staats Reitung" not get the proper information about Mr. Walsh and expose his hatred of them to the German people.</p>
