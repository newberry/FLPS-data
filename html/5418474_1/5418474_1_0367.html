   <p>Those Germans mothers and fathers who permit their children to study the German language will never face the day when their growing sons and daughters will be parted from them, because the mother tongue forges a closer alliance. Our public schools will teach German if there are enough demands for it.</p>
   <p>Anyone who can speak German and English can travel throughout the world and make himself understood. Many business-men demand that their employees <span class="page-break">\2</span>know German. Therefore, avail yourself of the opportunity and allow your children to learn the German language. It will be taught in our public schools in the four higher grades.</p>
