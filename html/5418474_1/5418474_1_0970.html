   <p>A new society under the name of the "National German American Prohibition League" was founded yesterday by our German temperance fanatics. The "noble" aim of this society is to employ all possible means for the enforcement of prohibition. Yesterday's meeting was called in order to organize, but if we could arrive at conclusions, judging by the size of the attendance, the life of the newly formed society is as good as doomed. The stand of the Germans on the question of prohibition is well known and only a day dreamer or a cold water apostle could hope for success. There were hardly enough persons present to appoint the necessary officers. After they had satisfied themselves reciting many empty phrases, the following officers were elected: Henry Ricke, President; B. A. Eisener, Wheaton, Illinois, and J. H. Nitz, St. Joseph, Michigan, Vice-Presidents; J. H. Reissman, Madison, Wisconsin, Secretary and E. G. Schultz, Elgin, Illinois, Treasurer.</p>
