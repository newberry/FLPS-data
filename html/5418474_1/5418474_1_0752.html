   <p>Our School Board of Chicago, consisting of thirteen Republicans and two Democrats, intends to abolish German instruction in our public schools. This is by no means the initial attempt, though it is the first one which shows indications of success. The Yankees, Stone and Keith, and the Swede, Jacobs, who display particular antagonism toward Germans, are the ringleaders of the movement. These three call themselves Republicans. Whether they really are is somewhat doubtful, because the greatest enemy of the Republican party can devise no more effective means to demote it to a minority in Chicago than by abolishing German in our public schools.</p>
   <p>The Germans and taxpayers of our city demand the continuance as well as improvement of the language course, and they do not regard the matter as a favor; they consider that they are fully entitled to this part of the curriculum.</p>
   <p>The Germans will never submit to the impudent presumption that this cosmopolitan city is a Yankee village. What the city represents today was realized by <span class="page-break">2</span>co-operative effort of the most divergent nationalities, and the Germans are at least equal in number to the native-born Americans. The German-speaking citizens of Chicago are the most conscientious and prompt taxpayers of the city; for every twenty Yankee taxdodgers, one finds hardly a single German. Our German-Americans are the most reliable supporters of the public school system, provided they are given the consideration to which they believe themselves entitled--not otherwise. They will regard as antagonistic every party which denies this right: let everyone who is concerned in this remember it. The assertion, which is repeated ad nauseam, that German instruction costs tremendous sums is a baseless, malicious lie. The expense is trivial--slightly more than twelve thousand dollars; hence, a paltry amount.</p>
   <p>The extra appropriations could be eliminated entirely if teachers were selected who could handle other classes together with the German classes, as is practised by other cities. This would constitute an improvement quite independent of the cost problem, and in this way the study of languages would lose its specialized character. The students would then cease to regard linguistic instruction as an <span class="page-break">3</span>extraneous addition, but would come to consider it as a regular part of a comprehensive school plan. The import of this branch and the participation therein can make an impression only if language instruction is restored to a place in the school curriculum on a par with other subjects.</p>
   <p>If this antagonism to German instruction were not based on a narrow-mindedness and hatred of Germans and German culture that is more or less subconscious, then it would be worth while to tell our American bigots that their intentions will not be realized even if German is excluded from the public schools. Our nativists desire that the German people should discard their aloofness in order that they may be fully Americanized. But that object cannot be attained--in fact, the opposite will prevail--if we cause Germans to disapprove of our public schools.</p>
   <p>Parents wishing to avoid the possibility that their children will grow away from them-- if German is excluded from the public schools--will send their children to private institutions or community schools, which in turn would only widen the chasm between the offspring of Americans and the descendants of Germans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Actually, those Germans who harbor such resentment toward Americanism that they would like to prevent their children from being absorbed by the new land, would be well satisfied if German instruction were to be eliminated from the public schools. In that manner German Know-Nothingism would be fostered just as much as the American variety.</p>
   <p>We like neither faction. Hence we demand that German be taught, and instruction be improved to the point where it is adequate for the purpose for which it is intended.</p>
   <p>We would consider it a declaration of war by Republican Yankeeism against the German-speaking citizens, if the School Board abolishes German instruction, because the English-speaking Republicans on the School Board are responsible for its decisions. If Messrs. Wells, Armstrong, Hoyne, Arnold, Bartlett and Frake combine their votes with the four German members, then German in our schools will be safe. We hope so--but the gentlemen should fully understand <span class="page-break">5</span>the far-reaching consequences of their conclusions.</p>
   <p>If human judgment is at all reliable, the discontinuance of German instruction by a majority vote by the School Board would be tantamount to a Democratic victory at the next city election, particularly if the two Democrats of the Board (Brennan and English) ally themselves with the friends of German instruction.</p>
