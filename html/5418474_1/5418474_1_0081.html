   <p>When the public schools open tomorrow and the five planned junior high schools will begin operations, the school administration will meet with the most intense opposition from the leaders of labor. Miss Margaret Haley, of the teachers union, which from the beginning was opposed to the plan, will fight against its realization. Besides, the school administration will have to quiet many parents, among them those of children who attended the Harper School, 6520 S. Wood Street.</p>
   <p>This elementary school is intended to be changed into a junior high school, and its pupils are to be distributed among the Earle, Raster, and Bass schools. It is this circumstance, the planned removal of the children to those other schools, against which six hundred citizens of West Englewood, in a meeting held last Friday, protested, mainly for the reason that the children, on their way to the three schools, have to pass many dangerous street crossings. The Harper School, they claim, is situated in the center of the school district, is easily accessible and the intended change, therefore, is not desirable. It is hinted that the parents if necessary are going to ask the courts for an injunction. Also strong opposition can be expected to the change of the Sabin, Herzl, Wendell Phillips and Parker schools into junior high schools. According to the plans of the Board of Education a new grouping of the classes will be inaugurated, namely that the teaching in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>first six classes of the elementary schools will continue according to the present system, the seventh, eighth and ninth classes will be taught in another school, and the senior high schools will have three grades. Labor leaders are opposed to the plan and consider it an attempt to discourage those who are destined to belong to the laboring class from acquiring a higher education. As Victor A. Olander, secretary of the Illinois Federation of Labor said yesterday, he is going to fight the plan to the bitter end. In the same sense spoke Margaret Haley, business agent of the teachers union, who is also opposed to the layer system... Neither she, nor the teachers, whom she represents, knew whether the layer system will be introduced tomorrow, nobody has been officially notified. C. M. Moderwell, president of the Board of Education, informed her that the execution of the plan has been postponed till February 1st, but that it has by no means been given up.</p>
