   <p>The German Catholic Societies obtained a temporary injunction from Judge Vail, to prevent the distribution of free text books at the Public Schools for the first four grades, but it appears that this legal action will not be very effective, since the books were promptly purchased and distributed in the forenoon, while the judicial writ was issued in the afternoon. Vice-President Mark, who presides over the schoolboard during the absence of its chief, President Harris, bought the books without delay; first, because the children needed them, and secondly, he probably desired to avoid the court order. Although the legal advisers of the Catholic Association mentioned their intentions to the school authorities in the morning, even this notification came too late, to prevent the purchase. Lawyer McMahon, Attorney for the School Board, gave the following version: The plaintiffs missed the proper legal time limit, to object to the payment of the $40,000 appropriation, which was to be used for this purpose. Altogether $90,000 has been set aside for free school books, and in regard to the remaining $50,000, another desist demand may be obtained. The petition for an injunction was to be argued originally before Judge Hutchinson, but since he holds no afternoon sessions, Judge Vail had to consider it. A copy of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>document was sent to Superintendent Cooley and Secretary Larson, although those gentlemen had nothing to do with the book-buying episode. Vice President Mark, who in the absence of the business manager, Guilford, ordered the purchase of the textbooks, knew nothing officially about the restraining command.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the various "Turn Clubs" and the "Chicago Federation of Labor" adopted a resolution last evening, advising the parents of all children of the four elementary grades, not to buy any instruction books but to await the court decision. A mass meeting is to be called, to protest against the elimination of free books.</p>
