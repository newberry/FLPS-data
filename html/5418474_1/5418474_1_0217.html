   <p>To combine educational problems with politics can only be justified in a case of emergency. Such a case existed for the Germans at the last state election in Illinois, therefore they supported unitedly one party against the other, because a very urgent educational problem was involved.</p>
   <p>It is absurd, however, to arouse animosity against an educator under ordinary circumstances, because of his party affiliations. A revolting case of this kind happened several years ago when a predominantly Republican School Board fired one of the best men, because he was a Democrat.</p>
   <p>Likewise did the Chicago Democrats recently fight against the election of Lane, one of the most efficient educators, because he is a Republican. But to the credit of the local Democrats it must be admitted that many of them desired his election.</p>
   <p>The School Board has now elected him with an overwhelming majority as superintendent of the public schools in Chicago.</p>
