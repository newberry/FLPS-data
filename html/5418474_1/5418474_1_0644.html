   <p>The course in German in the local public schools constitutes in the greatest part of the so-called optional studies. They are left to the choice of parents of the children, and are not included in the regular or obligatory plan...... It is the duty of parents to notify the superintendent of the school, if they no longer desire to have their children take lessons in German. At the beginning of the last term 29,484 children enrolled for the course in German, and 699 only gave it up again...........</p>
   <p>Among the 161 German teachers engaged during the last term, there are many who can render a great service not only to the Germans and their children, but also to themselves, if they only would recognize the importance of their activity.........</p>

   <p>Some people are still under the impression that the time used in the study of German is deducted from the study of English, but this is not the case. When the mind of these German students is being stimulated by a change, the others are trying to solve some English problems with more or less aversion. These problems can be readily mastered at home or in school.</p>
   <p>The pupils are divided into German and other nationalities according to nationality of the parents. For each division, a special plan is arranged. This plan is in operation for the present at the three high schools, and in those elementary schools, which are attended by a great many German-American children. A comparison of the different nationalities during the last term uncovered the following facts: Of the 29,484 pupils enrolled for German instruction, and divided into 1,172 classes with 161 teachers, <span class="page-break">\3</span>13,014 were of German descent, not less than 7,657 of English - Americans, and 8,813 of Irish, Swedish, Bohemian, and other nationality. Of the total number of students 26,135 were born in the United States, and 3,449 elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The high schools divides the students of German into those who took lessons in the elementary schools, and into those who neglected it and desire to catch up. In the North Side high school, 251 pupils of the average total of 425, or 51 per cent, studied German, on the South Side 38 per cent, and on the West Side,32 per cent.</p>
   <p>The curriculum of the German department in high schools is so arranged that the students after completing a course of four years, not only can speak, read, and write German fluently, but they are also initiated into the beauties of German literature and are made familiar with the essential German characteristics.</p>

   <p>The chief credit for this is due to the careful and proficient compilations of a classical reader by Dr. Zimmermann. This work contains such excellent selections from the best literature of great German authors and poets that it is not only a most interesting and valuable book for children, but also for adults. Most practical and effective is the division of the study material. In the two lower grades the pupils receive instructions in grammar, and pictorial lessons. They get exercises in reading, translate from German into English, reproduce orally, or in writing, what he or she read, saw, or heard, write letters and compositions, etc., so that they are able to finish grammar in the third year and can read with understanding Schiller's dramas, "Virgin of Orleans," and "William Tell." During the fourth year repetitions are made. The fourth part of Fimmermann's reader is studied thoroughly, and partially memorized by brief notes and outlines.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The time allotted for the study of German in all classes of the high schools and in the 5th to the 8th grammar grade, is 30 minutes daily, but only 20 minutes for the two lowest grades......</p>
