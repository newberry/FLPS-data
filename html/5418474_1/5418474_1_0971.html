   <p>Our standpoint in regard to the temperance question is known to our readers. As any person with reason we would welcome the possibility of abolishing drunkenness, but we object to prohibition.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the only remedy against drunkenness is in getting rid of its causes, poor nourishment, wrong education, domestic troubles, and quarrels originating mostly out of financial conditions and so on.</p>
