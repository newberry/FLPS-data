   <p>The school board gave a nice Christmas gift to Chicago's German-speaking population, an unexpected contribution to the festivities; nothing less than the prospect of abolishing German instruction in our public schools.</p>
   <p>It was a most clandestine attack. No advance information leaked out, nothing was said in the press. Current business at the time consisted of estimating expenditures for the school year. Suddenly, like a bolt out of a clear sky, Stone made a motion limiting appropriations for the special branches (German, music, drawing) to only six months, up to July 1, 1880, instead of providing funds for the entire year. The object of the motion was readily understood by the German board members, and they did not fail to expose the trick.</p>
   <p>Yet, Stone deliberately declared that the motion was quite harmless, and that, after July 1, sufficient money would be available from other funds to continue <span class="page-break">2</span>paying the special teachers. In making that statement, he was fully aware that money appropriated for definite purposes would never be allocated for other uses--the board members, the majority of them, would never vote for such a change. His excuse was only an attempt to hoodwink the Germans. He never has denied his dislike of German language instruction; but that he would stoop to such underhanded methods, he never gave an inkling before.</p>
   <p>To whom, besides Stone, are we indebted for this most unwelcome Christmas gift? The obvious answer is: To Carter H. Harrison, "the best mayor Chicago ever had," the man who, regardless of the warnings of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, received a large vote of German simpletons who believed him. [Translator's note - The remark, "the best mayor Chicago ever had," was Harrison's campaign slogan. He said he wanted to be remembered by the people in that manner.] It was Harrison who appointed a majority of anti-Germans to the school board. Of the five Democrats, no less than four (Delaney, Curran, Stiles, and Stensland) were opposed to German instruction.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The following members voted for Stone's motion:</p>
   <p>Stone (Republican, publisher of the News, a busybody and what not),</p>
   <p>Keith (Republican, "dry" and inimical to Germans),</p>
   <p>Delaney (Democrat, Harrison's man),</p>
   <p>Curran (Democrat, Harrison's man),</p>
   <p>Stiles (Democrat, Harrison's man),</p>
   <p>English (Democrat), and</p>
   <p>Frake (Republican, twin brother to Keith, as far as their attitudes are concerned). Altogether, 4 Democrats and 3 Republicans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The following gentlemen were opposed to the motion, hence favored continuation of German instruction in the public schools: Bartlett, Hoyne, Frankenthal, Vocke, and Armstrong, all Republicans.</p>
   <p>Absent: 3 Democrats, Stensland, Brennan, and Richberg. Of these, the first two would have voted for Stone's motion, Richberg would have been opposed.</p>
   <p>If every member had been present at the session, then the vote would have been as follows: 6 Democrats and 3 Republicans opposed to German instruction; 5 Republicans and 1 German in favor of German. Only one Democrat among seven would have favored German, and this lone individual was a German.</p>
   <p>Of the above-enumerated gentlemen two deserve particular condemnation: The Republican, Keith, and Harrison's man, Delaney, because they broke their promises. Both gave assurance, when interviewed by a reporter of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung last spring, that they would not oppose German instruction. Keith made the declaration when the question of continuing German <span class="page-break">5</span>instruction arose in the spring, and Delaney made a similar statement at the time his nomination to the city council was ratified. If both had not deliberately disregarded their pledge, then Stone's motion would have been defeated.</p>
   <p>The situation could be changed only by calling a special session and at least two Democrats would have to be found who would change their mind. That Stone, Keith, or Frake might reverse their decision is not to be expected. But even if Brennan or English would vote differently, then little would be accomplished thereby, because the "best mayor" might repeat in July what he did last year--nominate four anti-Germans to the city council. And why shouldn't the mayor do that? He has proved conclusively since attaining office, that he cares little for the Germans, because they did not suit his Irish horde. His employment register might well bear the inscription, "No Dutch need apply!" [Translator's note: The words "No Dutch need apply" appears in English in the original text. We must remember that, at that time, a German was called "a Dutchman" and no distinction was made between Dutch and Germans.] The Swiss might get a little chunk now and then, provided they do <span class="page-break">6</span>not consider themselves Germans.</p>
   <p>In connection therewith, it should be mentioned that the anti-German faction of the school board received very effective help from a Swiss gentleman. A few days ago Mr. Lieb declared, in a speech, that German instruction in our public schools was a mere humbug, prompted by political expediency. That comment proved most welcome to our anti-German school board members, and one of them referred with great satisfaction to the declaration of a distinguished German, tending thereby to justify the school boards' action. In this instance, the Swiss gentleman was promptly regarded as a German. Vocke then replied tartly, "Lieb is not a distinguished German, he is extinguished!" Of course, this remark did not silence the anti-German element; as a helper in the fight against the Germans, Lieb was considered good enough.</p>
   <p>German language instruction in the public schools of Chicago was introduced by the Republican party and, regardless of occasional attacks from various sources, the Republicans have retained the study in our schools. Now that <span class="page-break">7</span>the city is under a strong Democratic rule, we have a school board of anti-German sentiments, thanks to Mayor Harrison, who appointed the members. This sordid experience should suffice in showing our easygoing Germans what they may expect from the Democrats.</p>
   <p>The next step would be to make an election issue of it, and at every municipal election the candidates should be asked how they regard the question of German instruction, what they intend to do for its continuance; if evasive answers are given, or there is doubt about the integrity of the office seekers, such as Keith and Delaney, they should be defeated.</p>
