   <p>A new "Central-Association" of German Clubs, will throw the gauntlet to its enemies. A mighty association has been created which is to function as a new alley for those who favor the continued instruction of German in our public schools. It found its inception yesterday evening at the Haendel Hall, brought to life by the Delegates of which Mr. Leopold Saltiel was the Chairman, and Karl Alvin its secretary. The next meeting will be on Monday, at 8 P.M. Room 301 of the Schiller Building.</p>
   <p>It was resolved, that each club which was represented by delegates, should contribute equal amounts. At the beginning of the meeting, several delegates asked the question, whether it was actually necessary to form a new association to promote the interests of Chicago-Germans, since the recent Protext-meeting against a friendly alliance between the United States and land-grabbing Great Britain, produced the Confederation of German citizens of Chicago and vicinity which raised vigorous objections at the mayor's office and also at the School board to the plan, which proposed to curtail German instruction in the public schools. The ups and downs of our local Germans are, after all, well taken care of by that club, which is composed of representative citizens. A new "association of delegates which has the identical object in mind, is absolutely superfluous.</p>

   <p>The ladies and gentlemen, which promoted the meeting at the Haendel Hall, were of another opinion, and so, regardless, will form the new Central Association.</p>
