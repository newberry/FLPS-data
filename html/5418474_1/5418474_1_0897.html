   <p>What is a University Extension? A University is concentrating its system of instruction particularly on students, who have graduated from High Schools and subsequently registered with the University for further education. Since 1887, there has been a strong movement to establish university extensions, which have the purpose of giving the benefit of a university education also to persons, who went only through primary schools but have the ambition to study and enlarge their intellectual horizon. The said university extension is carried out by local or travelling lectures, mail and also by libraries.</p>
   <p>Judge Brentano has taken up the task of cooperating with the Universities of Chicago to establish a German University Extension, which will lend its education service especially to the German elements of one population.</p>
   <p>This German University Extension will be organized and conducted by Professor A.T. Small, Dr. O.T. Thatcher and Dr. A. Wirth.</p>
