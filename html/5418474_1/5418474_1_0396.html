   <p>Yesterday, during the meeting of the School Board new rules were put into effect, which are important to Germans. German instruction is now easier obtained than it was during the period when Superintendent Cooley held office. Heretofore it was necessary to have 75 applicants in a school, in order to obtain German instructions, now only 50 are required. If 50 applications are signed, then the German language must be taught. Primarily, we are indebted to Mrs. Ella Flagg Young for this innovation. Commissioner Greifenhagen called school-Superintendent Mrs. Young's attention to the conditions which imposed restrictions on the teaching of German. Recently the Abendpost called attention to the case at the Wicker Park School where a large number of pupils of German parentage were deprived of German instruction, because of such stringent conditions that a change was necessary. This promoted Commissioner Greifenhagen to submit the facts to Superintendent Mrs. Young who also interested Commissioner Stein in the matter; he also favored the new regulation. German may be commenced in the 5th grade and continued thereafter in the Elementary Schools.</p>
