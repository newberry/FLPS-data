   <p>Thanks to prohibition, much knowledge concerning the manufacture of spirituous liquors has been acquired by a great number of people who previously knew absolutely nothing about the art of brewing or distilling. Today there is hardly one person who does not know that fermentation changes sugar to alcohol. Home brew was made with more or less success, in nearly every home; grape juice was frequently changed to wine by fermentation, and many people even learned how to distill alcohol. Yet it is astonishing what great ignorance prevails concerning the alcohol content of spirituous liquors, especially of beer (sic).</p>
   <p>Every day one can hear people say that they drank beer that contained six, eight, or even ten percent of alcohol; even some newspapers print news about that kind of beer. These erroneous opinions about the alcoholic content of beer originated shortly before the repeal of prohibition, when Congress <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>legalized beer that contained no more than 3.2 per cent of alcohol. This made the impression that such a content is very low, which is really not true.</p>
   <p>And then when prohibition had been repealed and the congressional provision with reference to the alcoholic content of beer became invalid, many liquor stores advertised beer containing 10 per cent of alcohol; but if one read the respective statement on the label, one found that it merely declared that the beer contained no more than six per cent of alcohol, not that it actually contained six per cent.</p>
   <p>Confusion increased when a well-known Canadian brewery, the posters of which are seen everywhere, placed its product on the American market. The posters recommended an ale having 12 per cent alcohol. That is what the laymen at least infers, but when he looks more closely, he finds that the poster refers to 12 proof spirits. What this means is explained by George F. Goerls in an article which he published in the trade journal "The American Brewer". Goerls shows that Beer with a weight of 2 per cent alcohol, and a volumne of 2.52 percent <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is equal to 4.40 British and 5.04 American proof spirits. The difference between British and American proof spirits is attributable to the fact that the official definition of the terms is not the same in the two countries.</p>
   <p>Thus it is evident that when Englishmen or Canadians speak of 12 per cent beer, they do not mean beer that has an alcoholic content of 12 per cent, but beer having an alcoholic content of not less than six per cent. And that really is very strong beer. Most beer that is made here and in Germany contains between four and five per cent alcohol according to volume, and so it is essentially not much stronger than the beer that was legalized shortly before the repeal of prohibition.</p>
