   <p>Again our citizens and taxpayers are faced with the question: shall German be taught in our public schools? Those who oppose the teaching of this subject, with their customary energy and persistence, give a number of reasons in an attempt to convince. Anglo-Americans and Germans as well, that such instruction is not desirable. The reasons which are offered, are mostly so logical that, even among the Germans, a large number oppose the language study.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the matter more thoroughly. The first argument is that the Germans have no special right to have their language taught in public schools, in view of the presence of many other nationalities in the community; that we are Americans, and the national language happens to be English; and that it would be just as reasonable to insist on teaching Swedish, French or Bohemian <span class="page-break">2</span>in compliance with the demands of other groups. This reasoning actually is justified! According to our view, it is absolutely wrong for the Germans to insist upon the teaching of that language merely because of the fact that the Germans make up one of the largest groups in the population of the city.</p>
   <p>We do not request inclusion of the study in the curriculum on those grounds as every other national group could claim the same privilege. We have sounder reasons, involving pedagogical advantages. It has been demonstrated, as Cicero once claimed, that there is no better way to learn one's own language than by comparison with another; this fact has been established during centuries of teaching. Just as Latin provides an essential basis for a thorough understanding of the grammatical construction of dead languages, so is German--with its literary background, diversity and delicacy of syntactical principles--the closest equivalent to Latin among living tongues, according to the impartial judgment of teachers. For instance, no one can properly understand the Anglo-Saxon element in the English language without having a knowledge of German. Therefore, in asking that another living language besides English be <span class="page-break">3</span>taught in our public schools, we do not predicate our request upon the fact that we are Germans, but upon the fact that study of another tongue makes English the more readily comprehensible. And the most suitable language for that purpose happens to be German! Thus the fact that German is spoken by such a large number of Chicago people becomes of secondary importance, as does the fact that a knowledge of German is of great commercial and social benefit.</p>
   <p>Another objection raised by the opponents of linguistic studies is the expense involved, and this seems on the surface quite plausible in view of present high taxes. Our adversaries speak freely and casually of such sums as fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars [as the cost of German instruction].... and itemize the figures in such a convincing way that the uninitiated must believe: "Yes, they are right, it is too much!"</p>
   <p>But, if one intends to figure in that manner, using the time involved in German instruction as a factor, then by comparison, English instruction would <span class="page-break">4</span>cost five to six million dollars, not the mere one-half million dollars claimed! such sums are nonsensical!</p>
   <p>Analysis of the actual expenditures, in dollars and cents, shows that the total amount paid for German instruction does not exceed twelve thousand dollars; this is surely a trifle in comparison to the four million dollars expended annually on our city, especially when we consider the benefits which accrue to anyone knowing more than one language.</p>
   <p>Therefore, one should not be influenced by the assertion of our antagonists that the money used for German instruction can better be applied to build new schools! To construct a new school building requires, admittedly, two or three times as much.</p>
   <p>Even the twelve thousand dollars can readily be reduced to two thousand dollars, if the new plan is adopted whereby, in the future, only such teachers will be employed as are able to teach English as well as German. This will eliminate <span class="page-break">5</span>the special instructors we now have. As far as we know, this plan is being tried at the Calumet school. We may give details at some other time.</p>
   <p>A third argument advanced for opposing German instruction is: "As long as thousands of children of school age are not being given any instruction, we must restrict the curriculum and teach only the most important subjects, to assure education for the large numbers not now in school!" That, too, sounds logical! But upon closer scrutiny this assertion is likewise fallacious. As long as compulsory education is not the rule, and the State won't enforce it, we will have thousands of children who prefer to be absent from school.</p>
   <p>A city may build ever so many schools and hire "school ma'ams," but still there will be thousands of youngsters who show a preference for the streets. Shall we, then, because of these truants, curtail instruction for nearly fifty thousand pupils who seek knowledge? Should the students who do attend suffer because of those delinquents who ought to be in a reformatory?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Indeed not! First, let us pass a law which compels all children from six to twelve years--without exception--to attend school; after that, such statements of the anti-Germans as we have mentioned can scarcely be made!</p>
   <p>Another point is mentioned by the advocates of a restricted curriculum: they declare that not much is achieved, that poor results are shown in the German classes; participation is considered small (2,000) in comparison to the total enrollment (48,000) in public schools.</p>
   <p>The first complaint, which is frequently heard, we consider an injustice to the ladies who teach German under the present difficulties. we do not deny that improvements are desirable, but where on earth is that not so? We think that in the English classes many changes for the better could also be inaugurated!</p>
   <p>How wrong to declare that German lessons have produced poor results, when the children are permitted to discontinue and resume the subject at will! To <span class="page-break">7</span>obtain definite proof, examine a child who has attended all four grades without interruption, and it will be found that he has required affair knowledge of the language.</p>
   <p>The writer found many Americans who could converse fairly well in German after taking the course! One cannot justly condemn a course of teaching on the basis of poor results noted in a child who may have attended only two or three classes!</p>
   <p>With respect to the small number of pupils studying German, the figures are misleading. German, unfortunately, was excluded from the primary classes, which have nearly forty thousand pupils, and the language is taught only in the grammar grades, with an enrollment of only about eight thousand five hundred. Thus it is shown that one fourth of the latter enrolled in the German course. and this ratio would be considerably higher, were it not for fact that German has not be introduced into all of our grammar schools, although a demand exists.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>We maintain that at least one third of those who are given an opportunity to study German avail themselves of the offer.</p>
   <p>We see that we have exceeded the space usually alloted by a newspaper for expression of opinions and so will refrain from presenting additional facts. Much more might be said, but this may suffice at this time. Our only concern is to give a true analysis of our opponents' claims to show the falsity of their assertions, and to clarify matters generally.</p>
