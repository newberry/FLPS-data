   <p>All the members of the Special Committee of the City Council for school matters, seem to take a hostile attitude towards the re-opening of German instruction and special studies in the lower grades of the public schools. In yesterday's meeting the committee decided to recommend none of Mayor Harrison's school nominations for ratification, if the nominees do not pledge themselves, to follow the view point pledged for by the Committee.</p>
   <p>Against the Broker Robert Lindblom's nomination not the smallest objection was made. All the City fathers, who, a short time ago were battling him, have all of a sudden become his friends. On the other side it was chiefly Alderman Tripp, who opposed the nomination of Mrs. Sherman. He declared that against Mrs. Sherman personally, he had no objections to make, but that a woman as a member of the School board is not in the right place. The members of the Committee were divided in their opinion. Although the majority of them sided with Alderman Tripp, still the ratification of the nomination is not fully included, because as it is said, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the City Council will receive besides the majority report, also a minority report in which the ratification shall be recommended. etc.</p>
