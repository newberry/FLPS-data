   <p>Since the question of teaching German is coming up soon at the meeting of the Board of Education, it is well to forestall the accusations of some English papers such as the Times, which declares that German teaching benefits only a small portion of the children.</p>
   <p>According to the Board of Education, 38,035 children attended school last year. How many of them were children of German parents it is impossible to determine. About 1,600 of them were born in German speaking countries. There are, according to the Board of Education, 14,292 children on the North Side in ward 16,17 and 18. In the North Side Public schools there is room for only 4,226 children. Thus over 10,000 Children in three strong German wards would remain without schooling. Those children now attend parish and private schools. The Lutherans Methodists, Catholics, all have their own schools. Each child attending these schools has to may a school fee from $8 to $10. A proof that most of the Germans do not benefit from the money they pay for school taxes.</p>
   <p>But the German children are not the only ones to enjoy the benefits of the German teaching to the report from June 30th, 1871, we find that of 4,553 <span class="page-break">\2</span>pupils who had registered for German, 173 were born in Germany, 245 were born in other foreign countries, 1,694 were born here of German parents, 1,406 born here of American parents and 699 born here of Scandinavian parents. So that of the 4,553 pupils registered for German only 1,867 were children of German parents. At the high school out of 130 Students registered for German, only 8 were of German parentage while 105 had American parents.</p>
