   <p>Progress to a remarkable degree was made several years ago in the study of German; although instructions in this language prevailed previously in our high schools and so called grammar schools. The school board made the following regulations: The study of German has to begin in the third grade and must be carried on through all grades.</p>
   <p>This regulation has effected the instructions in German in the higher grades of the elementary schools already, so that the pupils can receive the same instruction for a longer period, and therefore more thoroughly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Wenter, a German member of the school board, supported by two of his German colleagues, Brand and Niehoff, has merited recognition for this above mentioned change. They, have, energetically and successfully carried on the work, which L. Brentano originated.</p>
