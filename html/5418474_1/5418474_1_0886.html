   <p>Professor Wiedinger, the well known educator will open next week a German and English select school at 533 N. Clark St. The new institution will teach several subjects of a higher school. The very able teacher Mrs. Wiedinger will be connected with the new school. The languages used in the teaching of the subjects will be German and English. Mr. Wiedingers' ability as an educator is so well known by the older German generation of the city, that he should not lack students. We consider it our duty to call this new school to the attention of the parents and we wish to recommend it.</p>
