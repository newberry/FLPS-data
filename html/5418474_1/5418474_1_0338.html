   <p>The effect of the war and of the persecution of everything German upon the study of the German language is evident from a report of Acting Superintendent of Schools Peter K. Mortenson. In the elementary schools German has not been taught at all since the beginning of the school year, and in the high schools the number of students studying German has dropped to 1108, decreasing by about fifty per cent. In the following list the enrollment of this year's students of German in the various schools is compared with last year's enrollment.</p>
