   <p>English instruction will be given at the Athenaeum, 50 Dearborn Street, next Monday. The course is available to all Germans who wish to study English--reading, writing, and speaking are taught quickly. The aim is to provide an elementary knowledge of English, so that recent arrivals [from Europe] will find it easier to get a job.</p>
