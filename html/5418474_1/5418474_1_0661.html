   <p>The German residents of Chicago will learn with great satisfaction that, according to the latest decision of the Board of Education, German instruction will start in the 3rd grade of all public schools. Previously the teaching of German began with the 5th grade.</p>
   <p>This has long been the aim of the Superintendent of German instruction. He believed that German instruction could never be entirely successful as long as it was confined to the upper grades.</p>
   <p>The Germans have every reason to feel grateful, especially towards the committee members, Comrade Niekof, Frank Wenter, Radolf Brans, and to the Superintendent of German instruction, Dr. A. Zimmermann, who in conjunction with President Doolittle have been working on this problem for several years.</p>
