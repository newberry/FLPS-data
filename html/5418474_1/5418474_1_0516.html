   <p>The Agitation Committee for the retention of special departments in the public schools held a meeting yesterday in Jung's Hall, at which representatives of forty-eight different societies and lodges took part.</p>
   <p>The object of the meeting was to deliberate on energetic action to be taken against the interference of the nativistic elements into school affairs. Mr. Max Stern, the president of the Committee, was the first speaker, and pointed to the fact that Mayor Harrison proved himself to be a friend of the Germans by appointing Mr. Kean, a well-known sympathizer of the German cause, as a member of the school board. To express their thanks to Mayor Harrison for this act, Mr. Stern, declared the committee, drew up a letter of appreciation to be submitted to the Mayor. Furthermore, Mr. Stern pointed out the necessity of erecting a Turner Hall in the Normal school and requested all those present to sign a letter to the County Board to contribute $1,500 for the erection of a gymnastic hall. After some debating, Mr. Stern's suggestion was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>accepted and the signing of the document began. Mr. Blum proposed the founding of a permanent organization to safeguard the interests of the Germans in the public schools. The proposal met with little favor and it was resolved to refer the whole matter to the Agitation Committee.</p>
   <p>To give all those societies, who were not represented at yesterday's meeting, an opportunity to participate in the movement, the Committee issued the following appeal: To the German Lodges and Societies of the City of Chicago, who were not represented at yesterday's meeting called in the matter of special departments in the public schools, we herewith make the request to direct their president or appointed representative to call on Mr. Max Stern 84-86 Fifth Avenue, to receive his instructions in a very important matter affecting this cause.</p>
   <p>By order of the meeting,</p>
   <p>Max Stern, President</p>
   <p>Louis A. Kohtz, Secretary</p>
