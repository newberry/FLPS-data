   <p>The School Board's committee, whose task it was to pronounce the final decision in the well known German controversy met yesterday and announced that the appropriation for this branch of the educational system had to be reduced to $135,000 The Finance Committee's plan, to shorten the instruction period of the regular school year by one month, has met with defeat. Messrs. Claussenius and Brenan, members of the School Board, were the first to protest against such a plan. Dr. Zimmermann, supervisor of the German department, said that with a grant of only $135,000 the German instruction could not be carried on, beyond eight months of the year. Dr. Zimmermann insisted, that the grant of $14,000 more is necessary, in order to retain the present staff, teaching German in public schools. Dr. Stolz, chairman of the committee declared, that the School Board is concerned only about the instruction of the pupils. The security of the teacher's position, does not enter into this question at all. Dr. Stolz declared himself fully in accord with the plan of the Finance Committee. He was the only person who was in favor of this plan.</p>
