   <p>p. 5 - In response to the invitation from the Chicago Turner Societies, every German society of the city, sent its representatives to last night's meeting at Eicke's Hall. As a result, the hall proved much too small, and the meeting had to be adjourned. The committee for intellectual activities was requested, to make arrangements for a meeting as soon as a larger hall can be found. Mr. L. Saltiel was elected president, and Mr. Charles Alvin secretary of the temporary organization. The purpose of this meeting was to organize a movement among the German population of Chicago, to protest against the curbing of German instruction and gymnastics in public schools.</p>
