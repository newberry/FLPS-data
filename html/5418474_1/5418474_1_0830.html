   <p>The regular meeting of the Board was held on Tuesday evening. The following members were present: Avery, Ballantyne, Bond, Bonfield, Brentano, Briggs, Clark, Dreier, Foster, Guilford, Leavitt, Runyan; Ryder, and Tinkham. we shall confine our report to the minutes on instruction in the German language.</p>
   <p>Inspector Dreier reported that in 1865 the German language was introduced into the regular curriculum of the Washington School. The results were so gratifying that the Board decided on July 12, 1866 to make instruction in German a part of the curriculums in the wells, Franklin, Moseley, and Newberry schools. One hundred and forty of the high school students took the German course, and of these only fifteen were of German parentage. Many of the pupils of the upper class do reading, spelling, writing, and translating, and most of them are making good progress. Those who lose interest after having received instruction for a specified time are <span class="page-break">2</span>transferred to the regular course.</p>
   <p>In the Moseley School, which is attended exclusively by children of American parentage, a hundred and thirty pupils are studying German under Miss McClintock. In the Franklin School, a hundred and fifty pupils are instructed in German by Miss Achort. In the Wells School, Miss Guenther teaches German to a hundred and fifty children. In the Newberry School, Miss Bockme has a hundred and fifty "German" pupils.</p>
   <p>The Board decided that instructors in German are to attend the teachers' institutes and shall constitute a special section under the supervision of the high school teachers. The report was adopted.</p>
