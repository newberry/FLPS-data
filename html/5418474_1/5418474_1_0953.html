   <p>After the present victory in the City Council, our local Drys will feel more conceited and be more obnoxious than ever before.</p>
   <p>All proposals to change the existing ordinance were met with rebuff at yesterday's session of the City Council, with the result that matters stand as heretofore, especially the clause which calls for the closing of saloons from midnight until five o'clock in the morning.</p>
   <p>Saloon-keepers and others wishing to keep the saloons open beyond the midnight hour, will have to gratify their longing clandestinely, as has been the rule up to now.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison's fear of the Drys is the cause of all this fuss.</p>

   <p>After the midnight ordinance's tranquil repose as a dead letter for twenty-seven years, a fact which up to his third year of administration had failed to disturb the Mayor's slumber it suddenly occured to him to demand its strict observance, and simultaneously he submitted a bill of revocation to the City Council.</p>
   <p>He believed the repeal would receive unanimous approval and that this move would prove advantageous at the third mayoral election. But the scheme went awry. He gave the Dry element a foothold whereby they became aware of their power, and in the future they are apt to provide greater difficulties for the tavern owners.</p>
   <p>Alderman Foreman advocated the adoption of the majority report of the Committee on Legal Matters, in which not a word was said about revoking the midnight ordinance, and Alderman Novak (10th Ward) made a motion that the minority findings be accepted. To the latter document, in <span class="page-break">3</span>which a recall of the twelve o'clock closing hour was taken for granted, Alderman Brennan (12th Ward) added the specific amendment that the midnight ordinance should be abolished. The question developed into a two-hour debate, in which Novak (10th Ward), Smulski, Brennan (12th Ward), Brenner, Carey, and Eisfeldt voted for repeal of the ordinance, and aldermen Mavor, Nelson, Foreman, Jackson, Badenoch, and Rector against revocation. When, at long last, a vote decided the issue, it brought the following results: The amendment to the minority report which provides for a peremptory recall of the midnight closing ordinance was defeated by a ratio of 35 to 33.</p>
   <p>Several aldermen who voted for the amendment, i. e., to recall the midnight closing ordinance, voted against the majority report because they considered that its provisions, whereby dissolute women were to be controlled, are unenforceable.</p>
