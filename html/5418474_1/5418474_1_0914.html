   <p>The market crash will be of far greater import than most people realize at present. Primarily, it thoroughly destroys the saga of perennial Republican prosperity; of course not for ever, nor in general. Most of the dyed-in-the-wool Republicans have such defective memories that within a few years they will ascribe the present calamity to good old Grover Cleveland, Woodrew Wilson, and even Al Smith. Any connection between these three Democrats and the financial collapse is, of course, non-existent, but in fables and fairy tales no logical correlation is to be expected. Temporarily, at least, the sufferers will come to the painful realization that the presence of a Republican in the White House constitutes no adequate assurance against bank disasters. There are now several newspapers which do not restrict their accounts of the last failure to the financial section. They even publish editorials concerning the fiasco which befell the nation under a Republican regime, when doughty Teddy Roosevelt <span class="page-break">\2</span>ruled with the heavy cudgel.</p>
   <p>But how will the Anti-Saloon League comport itself now? For years its followers declared with astounding temerity and persistence that prosperity is the inevitable result of prohibition, but just now the announcement appears that the American people's savings accounts have shrunk to the tune of two hundred million dollars, a fifth billion less than formerly. How many billions in paper values and actual cash has been lost on the Stock Exchange is unascertainable. If, under these inopportune circumstances, our capable and convincing high-pressure collectors of the League should make the usual rounds among the ordained members, what can be said, when, hat in hand, they find the old financial arguments are not applicable any more while garnering donations for the blessed, noble work?</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, they must change their tactics. After all, - resorting to that more expressive than esthetic proverb so often used in this land, - you can't tell a man who lost his shirt on the Stock Exchange that the <span class="page-break">\3</span>present dryness is the source of his prosperity; he would consider it as a sarcastic imposition on his misfortune, and his indignation would be aroused to the degree where he is liable to forget all scruples and unceremoniously kick the desiccated collector to kingdom come.</p>
   <p>When dealing with this irate gentry, the "hat-passers" must use other methods than formerly. The little fellows though, the small fry who contribute their nominal share to the League as a sort of church donation, can be treated in the accustomed fashion. A change in policy is not of supermundane importance here.</p>
   <p>It suffices to tell them that the Wall Street debacle is God Almighty's inexorable wrath, because we still have beer-drinking people flaunting the Volstead law with deliberate insolence and obduracy.</p>
