   <p>At the end of yesterday's school board meeting... the following letter sent by Mr. Albin, secretary for the United German Societies was read:</p>
   <p>"To the Esteemed Members of the School Board,</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"This is to inform you that the executive committee of the Central Organization of German Societies has taken steps to safeguard the interests of the German language in the public schools. Chicago's entire German population will protest most energetically against the discontinuance of German instruction.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>C. Alvin,</p>
   <p>Secretary."</p>
   <p>Mr. Davis, a member of the school board considered the letter impolite and proposed to ignore it at the present time. He met with no opposition.</p>
