   <p>The "Union League Club", had its regular quarterly meeting last night and after settlement of some unimportant formal matters, the question of German lessons in the public schools was discussed. The well known Rabbi Dr. Hirsch, and Ex-Governor Haard of Wisconsin, took this opportunity to make some speeches of which the principal point was, that no other language than English, should be taught in the public schools. Dr. Hirsch, thought himself a decendant of German nationality, even stated, that he was not pleasantly surprised by the fact that friends of the German lessons in Chicago still had so much success.</p>
   <p>The teachings of the German language especially in the elementary classes should cease.</p>
