   <p>The German instruction in the public schools, yesterday caused a most unpleasant debate by the school board, Mr. Prussing, probably to refuse the lack of zeal he was reproached with, made a motion to make German obligatory for all those who had started it, and to appoint a superintendent for German instruction. Mr. Prussing knew that the majority of the school board was opposed to such regulations, and on account of that, such a motion only courted disaster. By a hairs breadth the motion of Goggin would have passed, suppressing German instruction altogether. An adjournment motion made by Mr. Richberg, prevented such an unfortunate outcome of Mr. Prussing's motion.</p>
