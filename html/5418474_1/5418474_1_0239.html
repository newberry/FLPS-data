   <p>We certainly have no intention to obscure the splendid condition of Chicago. Chicago, we feel sure, will expand and become in a short time the largest city in the United States. But of this, Chicagoans should not be proud. Even if this gigantic progress comes to pass and Chicago outsoars all other cities, the public administration of Chicago and the political attitude of its citizens will be quite innocent of it.</p>
   <p>Chicago's great development has other causes than the present administration with its miserly saving policy and its corrupt majority in the city council...But the darkest point in the picture of Chicago, the vilest blemish on its escutcheon is the neglect of 25,000 to 30,000 children of school age. This big a city, whose administration cannot boast enough of its growing prosperity and high standard of public order is the cause of the neglect and ruin of over 25,000 of school age, because it is not building enough school houses and not employing enough teachers, because our wealthy and opulent citizens wont provide sufficient funds for schooling.</p>
