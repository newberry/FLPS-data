   <p>The pride of the American is his free public school. He is proud of it, because it is extremely expensive. According to his viewpoint, everything which is expensive, must be good.</p>
   <p>It is certain that the Americans spend more money for schools than does any European nation or community. It also must be admitted that the American public school system is very excellent insofar as it offers the same opportunity of education and preparation to all alike, to the child of the poorest working-man, as well as to the child of the millionaire. But what can be said in regard to the real purpose of the public school? Can it provide an education to suffice for life? As already mentioned, the opportunity is available, but the question is whether this opportunity is taken advantage of or not.</p>
   <p>If we consider the number of pupils graduating from our grammar schools, the desired answer will be clear. Over 141,000 were recorded in our primary and grammar schools for a full course of eight years. At least 10% of these, or about 41,000, should have graduated from the higher grade of grammar schools, making ample allowance for sickness, death, and other causes, but there were only 4284 <span class="page-break">\2</span>of them. According to these figures only 28 or 29 children out of every 100 receive the necessary education, which is considered absolutely essential for life. The other 72 or 73 of every 100 receive only a part of this equipment, and some of them, very little.</p>
   <p>The school records of 1889-90 disclose the fact that during that period 17,926 children passed from the primary schools into the grammar schools; but we find only 15,789 in the second grade, 12,775 in the third and only 9,007 in the fourth which is less than half of the total enrolled. Therefore, it is clear that over 9,000 children left school before they received that knowledge and education, which is thought indispensable for a successful struggle in life. They have been forced into the struggle for bread because of necessity, or their parents desired it, or they disliked learning.</p>
   <p>To make the portrayal of this situation more complete, it must be added that of the 4,284 pupils graduated from grammar schools, only 307 of them or 17 - 18 of every thousand who should have finished grammar school, showed a desire for higher or high school education.</p>
   <p>We have tried before to analyze the reasons why so few children finish school. The custom of taking the child, particularly the boys, out of school and use <span class="page-break">\3</span>him in business and elsewhere, as soon as he seems physically able, has become so prevalent, that quite frequently even unwilling parents submit to it. The average boy in this country thinks it is contemptuous to sit on the school bench after he is fourteen years old, but he finds nothing wrong if he failed to finish grammar and in many cases not even primary school.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably, this lamentable habit or custom contributes its share to the delinquency of the large numbers of children who thus enter life with very defective equipment.</p>
   <p>However, is the school entirely without flaws? Is it not true that the monotonous methods of instruction are also responsible for so many children leaving school so early and who prefer to intrust themselves to the more stern taskmaster, life itself?</p>
