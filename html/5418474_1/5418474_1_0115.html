   <p>[Gymnastics, as taught by a German patriot called "Father Jahn," was introduced into the Chicago Public Schools by the Chicago Germans, likewise, German language instruction. Both subjects proved a bone of contention in the early years, and Altgeld's favorable attitude towards this branch, and his denunciation of the Edwards School (anti-German language) law, gave him the German vote which swept him into the Governor's office. This note has been added to show the "Chicago German angle" of the following article. Transl.]</p>
   <p>On Friday, Dec. 24, 1913, an editorial appoared in the Abendpost under the heading "Military Drill in the Schools." As definite numerals are given which require revision, I beg you to kindly give some attention <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to these lines in your valued publication. Gymnastics was introduced in our public schools thirty years ago, and they consisted of callisthenics performed in the classrooms, in the aisles between the benches. What is known as tactics (marching in different formations. Transl.), and exercises which require equipment, had to be eliminated for lack of sufficient room.</p>
   <p>If I remember correctly, only two of the seventy-two elementary schools had halls at that time. Principals and teachers gave this branch a friendly reception; boys and girls participated gladly. Ten minutes per day (fifty minutes during the week) were scheduled for this new subject with the expectancy, already prevalent at the time, that at least a half hour should be available. Since its inception, gymnastics has expanded considerably. The School Board's German members cuddled and supported it, new schools had "Turn-halls" (Gymnastic assembly halls), and the latter <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>were supplied with the necessary apparatus.....</p>
   <p>The present Tuley High School was the first publicly supported school in the land to have a well-equipped "Turn-Hall" (Gymnasium). Today, among nearly three hundred Chicago schools, one hundred and eighty teach physical culture in their gymnasiums, assembly halls, or vacant classrooms supplied with the proper facilities. The number of instructors, eight at the time of the adoption of this subject, increased to 108. Specifically: forty-eight instructors in the high schools, fifty-eight for the elementary grades and two at the Normal College. At the high schools we find a slight predominance of male teachers, but in the elementary classes their number shrinks considerably: eighteen men versus forty women. This difference is not attributable to a preference for female instructors, but finds its source in the fact that most of our best male students of the gymnastic seminaries have been given definite assurances of positions in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>other cities prior to the completion of the regular teacher's course, and an additional examination in another locality is not required, because the issuance of a diploma from a prominent and recognized institution, suffices to warrant their acceptance as capable physical culture instructors, while in Chicago no teacher can instruct unless he submits to a special examination.</p>
   <p>Aside from the rather severe demands which this institute exacts, the preliminary salary of the callisthenics teacher is anything but satisfactory. A young instructor of gymnastics, who taught for a year in other than Chicago schools, must continue in his chosen profession for an entire decennium ere he receives a maximum stipend of $l,500 per annum.</p>
   <p>A large number of cities facilitate matters considerably for the aspirant, and often give more lucrative remuneration during the early periods of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>acceptance. These, then, are the causes for the present dearth of male instructors for physical culture.</p>
   <p>The former Superintendent of Schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, to whom we are greatly indebted because of her sentiments and positive stand for the furtherance of gymnastics, insisted that half of the callisthenics teaching force should be men, a stipulation which proved unfeasible because of the aforesaid prevailing conditions.</p>
   <p>While our School Board has done much in matters pertaining to school buildings with space for exercising, gymnastic halls, and classrooms with adequate appurtenances for the development of the human body, the time element which is dedicated to this cause has not undergone any changes since the first inception of this subject in our schools.</p>
   <p>Only fifty minutes to one hour per week is reserved for gymnastics in our <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>elementary schools, and, in this respect, we do not show the progressive spirit of other nations. In Germany practically three hours are used for exercising, and in Japan, according to two Japanese teachers who visited Chicago, seven hours per week are specified for callisthenics in the primary classes of the public schools. There is a slight diminution, however, in the higher grades, but it does not drop below three hours during the week; and this is also compulsory in the senior university class.</p>
   <p>Now, in regard to "military drill" in our schools, why,--we have it, of course. It has been with us for years. It is part and parcel of our gymnastical system, but we use no such designation. This drilling is called "Ordnungsuebungen" (verbatim: "Order-exercises," marching formations and allied subjects would explain it, Translator). In the English language we use the term "tactics." The only distinction is in the commanding method, or, let us say, expressions. Thus the "commands," as <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>given in our school tactics, are more suitable than to resort to the military phraseology, and therefore we use the former. Nevertheless, the later also finds some application in our higher institutions of learning.</p>
   <p>These "tactics" are executed with and without "wooden sticks;" in the upper grades, steel rods are substituted. Verily, the drill is here. We refrain, however, from using the adjective "military." and, just as we practice gymnastics here, so it has been on the curriculum of our youths in Germany, and this physical culture has done its fair share in producing capable German soldiers. According to German report, 600,000 or more members of the "turners," (gymnasts) are in the German army, and their achievements on the battlefield may be perused by anyone who reads the German Turnerzeitung (paper on Gymnastics, Transl.), as this publication gives a weekly list of all its members who were awarded the Iron Cross (a highly coveted medal for bravery. Transl.). The most efficient method in <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>preparing for an impending war consists in a systematic development of the human body during our youth, and this requires time and a sufficient number of highly capable teachers.</p>
   <p>Our present Superintendent is an advocate of physical development during childhood. Perhaps he can reach the goal by providing the necessary requirements: more time and a larger teaching personnel.</p>
