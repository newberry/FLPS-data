   <p>Mr. Heinrich Raab, Democratic candidate for the office of Superintendent of Schools, spoke last night in three different Halls, on the anti-German regulations of the new School-Law.</p>
   <p>The first of these three meetings was opened by Mr. Anton Rneck, member of the Executive-Committee of the German-American Control Society. After his introduction, Mr. Raab pointed out clearly, the dangers for the Germans through the efforts of the new school-Law. The noted Republican, Wilhelm Bocke, also voiced his opposition and was warmly applauded by the listeners for his stern and purely German standpoint in disregarding all party lines.</p>
   <p>The other two meetings, presided over by Mr. Raab, at the Kaiser Hall, and the School-house (21st and Hoyne Avenue), also were crowded. Among other noted speakers were Mr. Ph Koehler, and Mr. Fr. A. Hoffman.</p>
