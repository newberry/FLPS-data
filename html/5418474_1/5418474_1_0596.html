   <p>It may be recalled, that during the last session of the school board, the proverbial objection to educational "fads" in our public school system was brought up again and of course, German instruction is inseparably connected with it. Therefore, the South Side Turngemeinde (Gymnastic Association) considered it imperative to invite all local German clubs and lodges to a general meeting which will be held next Tuesday, at their hall. This problem, which creates new obstacles to the teaching of German, is to be thoroughly thrashed out, and delegates will be selected to make the necessary investigation. We refer our readers to the notice of the Turngemeinde in today's paper. It is very commendable that this association takes such energetic action in behalf of this important affair and it is highly desirable that our German clubs and lodges become affiliated with this movement so that a strongly expressed opinion may avert this impending elimination of German instruction in its very incipiency.</p>
