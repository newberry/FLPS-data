   <p>At the beginning of this School-season the School-Board instructed all principals to send an application blank to all parents, whose children attend any of the four upper grades in Public Schools. These applications, filled in and returned were to indicate the number of those who wished to take part in classes for the study of the German Language.</p>
   <p>Many of our readers have paid attention to our appeal which we printed in the "Abendpost", namely, to notify us if these instructions are not carried out. We will not mention the name and address of writers, but all can be certain, that their complaints will not remain unheeded. We have informed the School-board of every report sent in and the matter will be investigated in every single case.</p>
