   <p>Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, the newly appointed female superintendent of the local schools, came yesterday to the offices of the School Board, to make preparations for taking over the management of the schools on the following day. The lessons in German, which heretofore have been treated very partially, will find in Mrs. Young, (so she declared to a reporter of the Abendpost) a sympathetic friend; however, no hope should be raised that it will find greater consideration.</p>
   <p>An increase of the hours of the German lessons, and expansion of same in more classes, cannot be counted upon. Experiments were made several years ago to extend the German lessons to the third and fourth grades, but it has turned out to be too costly. The same still holds good today. She declared however, that she would not support a limitation of German instruction in the school. Of course the last word always rests with the School Board, though the recommendations of the superintendent in most cases will turn <span class="page-break">\2</span>the scale. The German element of Chicago, which according to the statistical reports, is equal to the English one, has nothing to fear from Mrs. Young in regard to German lessons.</p>
