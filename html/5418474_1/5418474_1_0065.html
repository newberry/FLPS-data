   <p>The activities of the German Society of Northwestern University have always had a touch of significance. Yesterday's lecture and theatre evening by American students took also an excellent course, the program being manifold and the attendance good.</p>
   <p>The excellent comedy "One has to get married," by Alexander Wilhelmis, performed by four students, evoked repeatedly genuine storms of merriment, the performance of the actors being thoroughly commendable. William Well excelled in the role of University Professor Jacob Zorn. Equally outstanding were Alvin Seehafer, Marie Keipel, and Helen Dechert. The student quartet was rewarded with great applause.</p>

   <p>The audience, which had come in large numbers, listened to the lecture of Prof. Eduard Leonhardts, who spoke about German folk-songs, saying that through them the German people expressed their sentiments and feelings. He said the folk-song is an inexhaustible source of strength for the people, pointing out the fact that the Germans are closely interwoven with their songs. "With three things," he said, the Germans went out into the world: their strong courage, their great faith, and their songs. With them they either grew or fell. When courage ceased and faith flickered, the Germans turned to folk-songs for new strength. In them there lives a reanimated power which pushes the German people onward.</p>
   <p>The professor with the recital of "A boy saw a little rose," concluded.</p>
