   <p>A meeting of delegates of the German Turn societies was held yesterday, to discuss ways and means of stopping the School Board Committee, from expressing their hostility against German instruction in public schools. The School Board also intends to decrease the appropriation expended for athletics and art in the schools. Present at the meeting, held at 106 East Randolph Street, were delegates of the following turn societies: Aurora, Vorwaerts, Grand Crossing, La Salle, Rautenberg, Almira, South Chicago, Eiche, Kensington, Schweitzer, Lincoln, Chicago Turngemeinde, Westseite Turnverein, Sudseite Turnerschaft, Einigkeit, Sudseite Turngemeinde, Forschritt, Voran, Teutonia, Freiheit, Almira, and the Bezirksvorort. Max Koelling of the Chicago Turngemeinde was chairman and Fritz Czolbe from the Board of Executives, corresponding secretary.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed at last weeks's meeting reported, that it contacted the proper authorities regarding teaching German in schools, but with hardly any success. All the delegates then joined in a lively discussion on that matter, <span class="page-break">\2</span>with the result that a special committee was appointed consisting of Jacob Ingenthron, Leopold Grand, Dr. Hartung, A. H. Heinemann, and Max Koelling. The duty of this committee is to prepare a protest against any eventual limitations of German instruction, gymnastics, singing, drawing, and in the field in kindergarten work. This document shall be submitted to the delegates for ratification at tomorrow's special meeting.</p>
