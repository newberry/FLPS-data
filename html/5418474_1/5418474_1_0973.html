   <p>"In the Nordseite Turner Hall, the oft mentioned convention of the saloonkeepers, took place yesterday, for the purpose of starting an anti-Harper-law movement. Peter Hansborough called the Convention to order and proposed the election of Peter Hand as President and August Timm as Secretary.</p>
   <p>The convention accepted the nomination. A proposal to exclude reporters was rejected. Upon Mr. Hansborough's recommendation, the following were elected Vice Presidents:- Conrad Seipp, Frank O'Neill, E. D. Besley, Peter Schoenhofen, G. H. Geer, Charles Desmehy, John S. Cooke, August Mette, Thomas Hennessy, Louis Sievers and F. Lange.</p>
   <p>While the committee retired to check on the credentials, Mr. Mc Keough the counsel of the English Saloon-keepers Association held a long speech, which was mainly directed against Joe Medill and A. C. Hesing.</p>
   <p>These men called him a shyster lawyer in their newspaper and accused him of dis- <span class="page-break">\2</span>respect of the law. He intended to bring a damage suit against the German paper.</p>
   <p>His past could be favorably compared with those of his accusers. Neither he, nor the saloonkeepers are disregarding the law, but they consider it their duty to fight against a law which has been obtained through misrepresentation. The Harper law is an unjust oppression of a legitimate business. The decision of the Supreme Court does not satisfy him, it fails to answer all questions pertaining to the matter. He would like to know, whether there is a law which says that beer and ale manufacturers only, are using malt. As far as he knows, they use malt also in making all kinds of spirituous liquors.</p>
   <p>He claims the state has no right to interfere in the licensing of the business, which is the sole right of communities. ------</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the Committee which examined the credentials returned and reported that the Chicago Liquor Dealers Association, was entitled to 46 Delegates, the <span class="page-break">\3</span>North Side saloonkeepers to 17, these of the West Side to 15, the South Side to 19 and the Bohemians to 3, a total of 97 Delegates.</p>
   <p>Not represented were the old Chicago Saloon-keepers Association, the Brewers Association and the Wholesale Liquor Dealers Association.</p>
