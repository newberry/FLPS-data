   <p>The question about the retention of teaching of the German language in the public schools could not be decided even at yesterday's meeting of the School Board because the following members: Boldemweck, Halle, Trude, and Duggan, left after finishing routine matters and not enough members remained to pass a resolution.</p>
   <p>Previously it was resolved to send a letter of condolence to the family of Louis Nettlehorst. A copy of the resolutions should be attached to the minutes and another forwarded to the family.</p>
