   <p>If the Schoolboard should accept the recommendations, which have been made by Mr. Thornton's special committee in the matters of the German lessons, the German teachers on the public schools of Chicago may consider themselves inactive in a few years to come. The Committee will recommend that the lessons in the German language shall be given in the future by the regular teachers. The German teachers would have to prove, that they are also able to instruct in other matters and give the German lessons as a secondary subject.</p>
