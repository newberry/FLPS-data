   <p>Even the Evangelical German congregations, are now opposing the petition to the Legislature in Springfield, in regard to the free distribution of Schoolbooks to the pupils of our public Schools. Yesterday evening, a meeting was held by representatives of these parishes, in which- as Secretary Henry Thoms in a lengthy letter to the Abendpost reports, all motives against innovation, were discussed in detail. It was resolved, "from an educational, sanitary social-political, and economic standpoints" to protest against the acceptance of the petition. As members of a committee, to submit this protest in the State's Capitol to the proper authorities the following were elected: Professor H. Brodt, of the Elmhurst Seminary, Pastor John Kircher and Mr. Julius Kircher.</p>
