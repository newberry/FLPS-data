   To the Abendpost 
    Gentlemen:-
   <p>During a meeting of the "Evangelical Pastor Association of Chicago and vicinity" that was held a short time ago the following resolutions were passed, and the Secretary was instructed, to send them to you for publication in your esteemed paper.</p>
   Yours truly,
   L. Schmitt, Secretary
   
   
    <p>"Whilst the Roman-Catholic Archbishop Quigley of Chicago, Illinois held before the Catholic Women League at the Freemasonic Temple of said city, on December 19, 1903, such a speech about the public schools of our country, in which he put them down as tyrannical, unjust and oppressing, so be it, -</p>
   
   <p>"Resolved, that we, as convinced Americans, cannot see such objectionable notations employed against our public schools, and therefore regret them with indignation, further,</p>
   <p>"Though our public schools do not entirely correspond with the religious purposes of Christianity, but since this condition for the most part is caused by the influence of the direction which the Archbishop represents, so be it -</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that herewith we express with gratitude our full confidence towards them for their estimable services in the cultivation and education of the youth, and that we will support them henceforth to our best ability with word and example."</p>
