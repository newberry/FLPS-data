   <p>Mayor Harrison suffered a defeat in yesterday's meeting of the City Council. He tried to force through the school board's nominations, made by him, but met with the sharpest resistance from the City Council. His nominations were rejected by 38 to 25 votes. If the Mayor has considered a notion made by Alderman Ernst, not to vote on the entire list on the whole, his defeat would have well been averted. Then, most probably, all his nominations, with the exception of Mrs. Sherman's would have passed. It is known that most of the Aldermen don't want to have any female members on the Schoolboard. But as all nominations were suggested for a final acceptance, most of the aldermen preferred to defeat the entire list before giving the nomination to a woman.</p>

   <p>It was learned that, the special committee of the City Council for School affairs, when discussing the list of the school board nominations, has gone in a very peculiar way into action. It was demanded of the newly appointed School Board members, that they should promise not to support the re-introduction of German instruction and special education in the lower classes of the public schools and at the same time it was indicated that only under this condition would their nomination be recommended for confirmation by the Special-Committee. As some of the nominees rejected this demand angrily, the committee resolved in its meeting yesterday afternoon, to abstain from making any recommendations for ratification of any nomination at the present time.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison, who evidently was not in accord with the conduct of the Special-Committee tried therefore to obtain the ratification without the recommendation of the Committee. In last night's meeting he pointed out that 2 weeks ago he submitted to the Special Committee the list of the new nominations. As same were not verified as yet, he said, he withdrew this list and presented to the council a new list with the request that they accept it at once, if possible.- But the new list contained the same names as the former.</p>

   <p>Hardly had the Mayor finished speaking, when an enormous tumult started. All the Aldermen were suddenly on their feet, each one trying to be heard. All yelled confusedly but none of them could be understood. The Aldermen Kent, Swift and Martin accused the Mayor, that he infringes on his authority, for he has no right to withdraw any affair from a committee. But Harrison stuck to his opinion and insisted upon a vote over his nominations. The result was that, as before stated, 25 Aldermen voted for and 38 against the ratification.</p>
   <p>Alderman Ryan made a motion, to re-consider the resolution by which the ratification of the nominations was refused, but before it came to a vote over this, a motion for adjournment was brought in and also accepted. The entire meeting lasted hardly one half hour.</p>
   <p>In the meeting held yesterday afternoon by the Special-Committee for School affairs a letter was received from three of the newly appointed members of the School board in which complying with the request of the committee, they stated their attitude to the special subjects and German instruction.</p>

   <p>Mr. Halle refused to make any promises. Here are the contents of his letter, that he has addressed to Alderman Tripp:-</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:-</p>
   <p>I learned from the newspapers, that you take an interest in my nomination as a member of the school board and have further learned that, in order to secure the ratification of my nomination, promises concerning my future attitude are expected. While I thank you for the expression of your interest, I feel compelled to make the statement, that I do not find it in order to make any promises whatsoever. My way of acting in the school board was dictated solely by my convictions concerning a proper educational system, which, rests upon careful observations in this and other countries, and in the belief, that the American people in exercising their own intelligence and in their boundless generosity towards the public schools, do not desire, to restrict the education of their children to the rudiments of the three "R' s". I stand by this, my conviction, and, as the acceptance of an office on the Schoolboard in the best case is but an thankless execution of a duty to the public, it is my wish you would, when considering my nomination, proceed in such a way that my attitude cannot be misunderstood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>But I can hardly believe, that the City Council will make the attempt to prevent a representation of the German-American element of our cosmopolitan city on the School board, or to influence its members over the free unlimited practice of their honest conviction.</p>
   <p>(Signed) G. Halle</p>
   <p>Mr. Thornton declared also, that he does not want to make any promises; rather he would prefer to renounce this post in case the right to follow his own conviction should be taken from him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Keane stated plainly in a few words that he opposes all special educational branches.</p>
   <p>Of the members of the Special-Committee, Alderman Noble particularly worked against the ratification of the nominations. He claimed that they were made by the Mayor to pay off political debts. He tried in every possible way to prevent the recommendation of the nominations, and finally succeeded in bringing about an adjournment of the meeting, before any resolutions could be made.</p>
