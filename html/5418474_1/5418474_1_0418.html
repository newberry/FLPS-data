   <p>How much German instruction in the Public Schools was crippled by the hostile regulations of Mr. Cooley can be seen by the school attendance list that was published by the school board today. The number of the pupils learning German is given as only 19,284 compared with 33,199 of last year, a decrease of 13,915 while the list shows a general increase in the number of pupils. In spite of this increase of school attendance the number of teachers received a reduction of 455, 5385 instead of 5840. At the high schools occurred also a retrogression of 86 students and the pupils of the normal school increased only by 7.</p>
