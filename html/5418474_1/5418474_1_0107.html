   <p>In a recent letter to Mr. Claxton, commissioner of education, President Wilson said that he desired the American schools to maintain their present high standards, regardless of the burdens of war. It is hardly necessary to emphasize the necessity of education for our youth. Upon the training that our boys and girls receive, there largely depend not only their value as future citizens but also their thorough preparation for their chosen vocations. That this is realized more and more can be measured by the number of laws that have been enacted in almost all of the States for the protection of children and for insuring the school attendance of children up to a certain age. In particular, the laws prohibiting the employment of children under fourteen years of age in business and industry are of importance in this respect. Since a large portion of men teachers are now serving in the army and many women teachers are devoting their energies to the Red Cross and other war-time welfare organizations, Mr. Claxton suggests that married women teachers should be admitted again.</p>
   <p>"Their elimination never was really justified," says the report dealing with this matter, "and because of the war it has become absolutely impracticable, Every woman who is an efficient teacher is badly needed, and the fact that she is married should not be an obstacle."</p>
   <p>In order to establish rules for the maintenance of, and to increase the enrollment in, normal schools and teachers' colleges and universities, a convention of representatives of these institutions within the State of Illinois was recently held in Chicago, where a detailed program was decided upon. Among other things, it provides for the supervision of work permits issued to children fourteen to fifteen years of age; for public meetings; and for the use of four-minute orators, who are to call the public's attention to the necessity of supporting all educational enterprises.</p>
   <p>The local City Club has studied this subject closely for some time and says in its latest bulletin "that the situation in our country regarding education is alarming enough to justify, as a war measure, a warning to school officials, school authorities, and citizens of the nation. In comparison with their former achievements the schools of the country are becoming increasingly deficient. Their equipment is not up-to-date, and thousands of teachers are compelled, because of the miserable and absolutely insufficient salaries, to give up their profession. The positions thus made vacant either remain unfilled or are filled by inexperienced teachers, who do more harm than good to the cause of education."</p>
   <p>Following this [statement] are a number of suggestions, which, from a philanthropic standpoint, are laudable. The important ones we should like to mention here: extension of, and a more versatile curriculum for, elementary and high schools, giving all children an equal chance to prepare themselves for their chosen vocations; sufficiently large playgrounds in conjunction with all schools; constant medical and dental supervision of all school children; introduction of a system of all-round physical education; liberal salaries for teachers which are justified by the increased cost of living; and the recognition of the importance of conscientious instruction and teaching. And, finally, the establishment of a Federal department of education is recommended, the head of which should have the status of a regular cabinet officer in Washington.</p>
   <p>England and France have increased their budget for education considerably, in spite of the war, and, undoubtedly, the greatest democratic republic in the world will have sufficient understanding, time, and funds for the same purpose.</p>
