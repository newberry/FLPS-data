   <p>Like the Northwestern University in Evanston, the University of Chicago has also its German Club whose members speak German exclusively at the weekly meetings and special festivities. They apply themselves to the study of German literature, German scientific spirit and German social life. President of the Club is Miss Henrietta Becker who is a teacher in the institution of Mr. Harper and also has the title "Doctor." Yesterday another sociable evening of the Club took place on which Mr. Wilhelm Vocke was a guest of honor and held a lecture about "the German-American citizen."</p>
   <p>The sociable part was preceded by a banquet in the Quadrangle Club.</p>
