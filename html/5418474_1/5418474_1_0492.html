   <p>The number of the pupils who participate in German lessons, diminished considerably as compared with the previous year. By this is meant only the upper classes, as in the lower grades German is not taught any longer. Of the 245 German teachers of last year, only 133 are left in this capacity, 45 of them were engaged for different English branches of study.</p>
