   <p>Heretofore Messrs. Halle, Bluthardt, Goets and Boldenweck have ignored the antagonism towards German instruction in our schools, a propaganda in which our English speaking press has taken the most conspicuous part, but now these members of the school board find it preferable to reply, since the necessity appears to arise. It is not stated, that this crucial moment has arrived but the attacks continue in an increasingly venomous spirit and with greater frequency.</p>
   <p>In order to show the "true" Americans, whose particular pride consists only in being able to learn one language, that there is a school board in existence which is undismayed by the incessant caterwauling of a small native minority, school board member Fritz Goetz now comes courageously forward and brings conclusive evidence, based on facts upon which he justifies his actions. His colleagues, particularly Messrs. Halle and Bluthardt, will be at the school council, prepared to take the initiative, if the dissenters should endeavor to carry the fight before this august body, and will receive the indigenous element in such a befitting manner, that the <span class="page-break">2</span>natives must sue for peace.</p>
   <p>"German in our Public Schools." Hark ye to the defenders! This is the title to his explanation, which we quote below.</p>
   <p>"The attack which the press makes upon special studies in our public schools has no justification whatsoever, according to my opinion. It is sheer nonsense to consider any study course as a 'fad', if it happens to be outside the realm of reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography. As our public schools teach German, the question arises: Why not include Hebrew, French and other languages?</p>
   <p>"I maintain that German, next to English, is the most important commercial language in the world, and in a city which as a million inhabitants of which 350,000 are German, as shown by the last census, that language should be taught. The German-Americans are not unreasonable in expecting recognition of their mother tongue.</p>
   <p>"Lord Brougham once said: 'He who does not understand at least two languages is only half educated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Dr. Kiddle, superintendent of New York's public schools for many years, declared: 'In those schools where the German language is taught in a most meticulous manner we do not note any retrogression in the English branches; to the contrary, one finds that the knowledge of English, specifically grammar and composition, are improved; it enables the scholars to express themselves more eloquently because it gives them a better insight in regard to the true definition of words for their own language and it develops thinking in general.'</p>
   <p>"Dr. W. T. Harris formerly superintendent of the public schools of St. Louis, now Senior Professor at the Concord School of Philosophy, one of our greatest teachers, and Dr. A. I. Rickoff, former superintendent of the Cincinnati and Cleveland schools, report similar results. I can quote verdicts from many such prominent authorities to prove the correctness of my assertions; that it is important for Americans to learn German where this language predominates.</p>
   <p>"Another eminent professional, W. T. Harris, U. S. Commissioner of Education, stated: 'It is desirable beyond doubt, that the immigrant should be educated in the same schools as the native-born population, if he is to exercise political power. With this principle in mind, most of the eastern and western <span class="page-break">4</span>cities that have large German populations, have included this language in the regular curricula of their public schools. A large number of pupils who had heretofore been taught by foreign teachers in private schools went to the public schools and, while learning a little German, they absorbed a large amount of English which is very beneficial to their own future and that of the native element. The influence of the schools affects the children, and eventually reaches the parents and, where formerly only German was spoken in the home, the entire family now speaks English, in order to foster the new generation's predilection. These German children, under the tutelage of the public schools, grow into American citizens and are just as good as the offspring of Anglo-American citizens.</p>
   <p>"It may be recalled, when German tuition was first offered, (I believe it was by the Franklin school), there were many private schools in the northern part of the city. The parents soon broke off their connections with them and matriculated their children in the public schools.</p>
   <p>"Several colleges announce: 'German should certainly be taught, but not in the primary classes.' I am of another opinion. The proper place and time to learn German, is in the lowest primary class; in the first school year.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"It is often said, that parents do not wish their children to learn German. I will show an example to refute this. During the past year, application blanks were sent to the principals of all schools with the request, that they be answered by the parents as to the desirability of teaching German to their children.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Zimmermann gave these forms also to the principal of the Lewis School in Englewood, requesting that she distribute them. The lady replied that the district is purely American, not 25 applicants would appear. Finally she circularized the leaflets, although she objected in the beginning, and what was the result? More than 400 children, most of them of non-German origin, applied for German instruction.</p>
   <p>"Business men know from experience, that if a city has a large German population, then it is of great advantage to be familiar with that language, just as French in New Orleans is well nigh a necessity. For years I have been associated with manufacturing interests in this city and naturally came in contact with many merchants. Innumerable times I have heard them express their regrets in not being able to speak German, and deploring their lack of opportunity, as during their youth foreign language was not taught in the schools."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Mr. Goetz added the words of Mr. John B. Peaslee, former leader of Cincinnati's public schools, an authority of national renown, who gave his experiences anent the German question. Suffice it to say, he was opposed to it, until he made the starting discovery that the students who studied German, were the best scholars of the class. Mr. Peaslee was prejudiced on the German subject, just as many of our teachers and editors appear to be.</p>
   <p>"Chicago is a cosmopolitan city, our country has invited all nationalities to its shore; we should therefore be tolerant. Give the most thorough education to our offspring and the future generations will reap the benefits. To abolish this important subject would be a decided retrogression."</p>
   <p>At a future date, Mr. Goetz will express his views about gymnastics and explain why it is an important branch of our educational system.</p>
