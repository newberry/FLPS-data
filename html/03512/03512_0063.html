   <p>p. 5 – When Marshall Field &amp; Co. published the Rothschild store in 1923, a Welsh name came into prominence at once. The store was name after the newly elected president and general manager, Arthur Davis, who had been with the Marshall Field &amp; Co. for several years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Davis if of Welsh ancestry, his parents having come from Wales ancestry, his parents having come from Wales. He was born near the coal pits of Ohio, and his rise to the presidency of one of Chicago’s biggest department stores may be attributed to the splendid precepts which were family ideals in the little English principality.</p>
   <p>It is of particular interest to the Welsh people of Chicago to know that under the present management the Davis Store has experienced almost phenomenal success. Its growth is one of the romances of Chicago’s history.</p>
