   <p>Mr. President, members of Madoc Lodge and friends: It will not be necessary to make an apology for the short address, because it is right. As members of the Kymry Society, I extend to you our fraternal feelings on your 20th birthday, trusting you may live to enjoy twenty and even more, of success, and give the kind of helping hand to those who need it as in the past, for the record that your society has, is one to be cherished, and extended and we are with you in mind and heart and soul and will assist in its advancement. Trusting the Blessing of God may rest upon you and make you a blessing to the country.</p>
