   <p>NOTE: Eisteddfod is a competitive meeting held to discover the talents of children, and to keep the people interested in things that are worth while. Prizes are given, for solo singing, reciting, impromptu speaking, male and mixed chorus singing, etc., also for writing poetry, essays, etc. The prize <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is cash and the money placed in a bag, the size of a small envelope, with a ribbon attached at two of the top corners making a loop. When the judge has made his decision, he announces the name of the winner, who goes to the platform. The judge then calls on some small girl or some prominent woman to deliver the prize, which is done by placing the loop attached to the bag around the winner’s neck. The winner then makes a bow to the awarder, then to the dignitaries on the platform, then to the audience.</p>
