   <p>The Welshmen of Chicago held a meeting last evening, as they are in the habit of doing every week, the proceedings mostly being of a literary and musical character. Amont the exercises was music by the Cambrian Choral Society, readings and recitations, and an address by Rev. Mr. Hughes. The meetings are becoming very popular among the Welsh population.</p>
