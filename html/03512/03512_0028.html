   <p>p. 4 – Senseless tumult on the Fourth of July has passed the stage of patriotism and hysterical frenzy aroused by many football games, does not consitutte sport. This opinion was handed down by Jenkin Lloyd Jones at the “Eisteddord” in Abraham Lincoln Center last evening.</p>
   <p>His opinion followed a short address, in which he spoke on the fashion in which the Welsh had preserved their national unity, and how just such “Eisteddfords”, or literary and musical entertainments, had contributed to it. He contrasted the effect with modern celebrations. The affair of last evening was under the auspices of the Kymry Society and Lincoln Center, and it is planned to make it a yearly event.</p>
