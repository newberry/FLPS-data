   <p>There are three Welsh churches in Chicago. Hebron Welsh Presbyterian is the oldest, founded at least thirty-five years ago. The other two are the Humboldt Park and South Side Church.</p>
   <p>These congregations were originally Methodist but some ten years ago voted to become Presbyterian as the American Methodists were not Calvinistic.</p>
   <p>The services in these churches are held in Welsh, with an English service generally once a month.</p>
