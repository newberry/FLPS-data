   <p>The article entitled "Challenge" looks more like an ardent appeal from a true son of Poland than a challenge. From the article one can see that Mr. Promyk, a member of the Polish National Alliance, takes an active and serious interest in the very important problem of Polish schools in America. All of our brother countrymen who have the welfare of the Poles in America at heart, should be interested in this vital problem. Let us remember that if we neglect this worthy and noble matter, our enemies, the Irish and Germans, will gain! Our negligence and apathy encourage them to reap benefits for themselves. We quarrel and quibble, while they clap their hands with joy, because when we are disunited and powerless, they can more easily keep us under their yoke, slandering us in the papers as a nation that is restless, quarrelsome, and dissolute.</p>
   <p>That is why my sole dream and sincere hope is that there may be understanding among the various factions, resulting in a union under one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>unconquerable banner, the United Polish National Alliance. Individual work will not be successful, therefore, we must all work together, 3,000,000 Poles, in order to be successful. We should unite sincerely and openly, so far as nationalism and religion are concerned, because otherwise we shall continue to be suspicious of each other, on either nationalist or religious grounds.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Promyk, a representative of the Polish National Alliance, expresses the aims of the Alliance clearly and sincerely, saying: "We members of the Alliance want to proceed toward our goal under the guiding star of our forefathers, that is, the Roman Catholic faith." That is very nice! We feel that we are working in the same field, and that we will harvest and taste the same crops! May God bless our aspirations so that we may turn our hopes into realities.</p>
   <p>History teaches us that our geniuses like Mickiewicz and others, who came under the influence of Towianski [Polish philosopher], themselves fell prey <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to their imaginations. They could have written ten times as much as they did, because at that time they were in their period of greatest strength and inspiration, if they had employed their talents in a purely literary field and left mystic philosophy to others.</p>
   <p>Let us look at the modern cults of Kozlowit or Maryawit. Doesn't this philosophy help the Muscovite plan? The Russian government is protecting Polish provocateurs because the lack of religious unity can ruin, crush, and annihilate us nationally, that is as a Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Frequent disputes arise in our parishes between the priest and the people, and society in general suffers. As a result of these disputes, many parties are formed, that are hostile to faith as well as to the nation. Following the decree of the Pope, the priests who have quarrels, rebellions, or disagreements in their parishes, should resign, for their own good and especially for the good of the people.</p>
   <p>After all we know from experience that such a priest can have no good influence <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>on the rebellious people. They will not support him nor will they go to church, and therefore does he not become a burden on himself and the people? Is he not often the cause of disgrace and scandal? Irish bishops don't hurry to remove such priests because if they don't, they remain the masters of the situation. If the members of the clergy were to live together in union and harmony, doubtless the Irish bishops would have to take our people into donsideration, but unfortunately we ourselves quarrel, are jealous, try to destroy each other, and go to the bishop with tales about each other! And what do the bishops do about it? They say bring us more such tales because they make a good rope for your necks. Often when parishoners go to their bishop with complaints about their priests, he comforts them by saying "I know he is a rascal." This is the opinion of the rector who does not want to transfer and does not want to lose a comfortable living, preferring to be a burden upon himself and the people.</p>
   <p>Why am I so concerned about this single entity, this oneness, this union of the Polish clergy and people? It is because I see in this union progress for us, development, well-being, and the preservation of our <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>language! Otherwise we will perish in the great sea of Americanization. How can we progress on the road toward enlightenment, and how can we preserve our Polish language? We can do it in this way: if we were united under the single banner of the Polish National Alliance,we could send a delegation consisting of one priest and one member of the Alliance to all the parishes, to visit our countrymen. This delegation would truly fulfill a religio-nationalistic mission. The purpose of this mission would be to arouse the apathetic Polish masses. The duty of the priest on this mission would be to preach a religio-nationalistic sermon, to exhort the people to join a United Polish National Alliance; the duty of the member of the Alliance would be to call the people together and address them in a patriotic speech, to encourage the people to unite where they are divided. In this way there would not be a single Polish man or woman who would not be a member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The Polish people have not forgotten their sacred duties toward God and country. Such a delegation, I believe, would be welcomed in every parish <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>both by the local rector and the people. Such a religio-nationalistic mission would have great bearing on the conditions in some of our parishes, where battles rage, blood is shed, and quarrels continue between the rector and the people.</p>
   <p>One year of such noble work would bring greater benefits in every respect, religious, national, social, than twenty-five years of useless blaring of the loudmouths. If we want to turn this dream into a reality we must inspire the Censor of the Polish National Alliance, to offer his hand in the name of the eighty thousand members of the Alliance, to Bishop Paul Rhode. These two men in the name of 3,000,000 Poles, will form one great organization from which the blessings of unity, harmony, love, enlightenment, brotherly help, etc., will come to all the sons of unfortunate Poland.</p>
   <p>Now, feeling that I have presented my plan clearly, I turn to my answer to the article "Challenge". Mr. Promyk states: We members of the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Alliance do not wish to oust religion from the schools, since religion is the elevating element of nations, then why do some people call us atheists, enemies of the Catholic church etc.</p>
   <p>Just as many members of the Alliance, Catholics in name only, attack the church, school, and priests in the name of the Alliance, so many quasipriests have on their lips only such epithets as cow, pig, numbskull, idiot, atheist, etc. No intelligent person should take these rascally names to heart; they are more appropriate to the streets of Warsaw than to the church's pulpit. Next, nicknames such as atheist, numbskull, etc., do not issue from the pastors who know how to respect their little lambs but from the sheepherders or hired men, who do not care for their sheep. People of this type are not the clergy as seeds, but individuals as chaff.</p>
   <p>Mr. Promyk demands the separation of material things from things of the spirit, in other words deed the property of church, schools, rectories <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to us the parishoners. This division under present conditions is absolutely impossible. To demand today such a division or the deeding of the property to the parishoners would be in other words to demand bloodshed, departure from faith, storms etc. We priests must obey the bishops regardless of who they are, Irishmen, Germans, or Poles. We Poles alone without the support of other nations, Germans, Frenchmen, Slavs etc. cannot raise a rebellion against Irish bishops, and even if these were to resign, then we would reap tears rather than sweet fruit. Why? For this reason. The French people and the German people stand squarely behind their priests and as enlightened peoples, knowing clearly the aim of this struggle they would enter it with conviction and would doubtlessly emerge victorious. Our people on the other hand are good, honest, full of faith, but unfortunately lacking in enlightenment and what is most important, conviction, and for this reason were they to be aroused today they might shout "Hosannah, Polish clergy, protector of our hard earned money," and tomorrow they would cry even more strongly; "crucify these parasites, these leeches of the poor people."</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>In this way instead of pouring ourselves into one mold, we would scatter ourselves into hundreds of camps, from which neither the church nor the Polish National Alliance would receive any benefit. There would arise lamentable chaos, bloodshed, court trials etc. as took place in Warsaw after the Japanese war.</p>
   <p>Let us suppose that the church, school, and rectory are deeded to the parishoners, do you my dear Alliance members believe that we would be taking a step on the road of progress, or that we would enjoy peace in the parish? Never! In practically every Parish there are two or more factions, of which one is for the priest, and the other against him. Would not such a division lead to murder?</p>
   <p>Therefore, we can see from this, that the proposed division would bring us no good, and would be the cause of disruption, weakening, demoralization etc. In view of the above facts, dear people, do not fight with the Irish bishops for property, because under the present conditions to <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>want to regain the property means to weaken yourselves, to divide yourselves, and to lower yourselves in the eyes of the Americans, We can be certain at the outset that our enemies will not gain a penny from our property, because they are the guardians of this property, and not the owners.</p>
   <p>We should exert our power and abilities, to educate Polish children in their native tongue, because they will form the pillars of future Poland. If we should lose our national identity, then we ourselves would be handing over our property voluntarily to the Irish and the Germans.</p>
   <p>Our problem today is to work among the masses, stir them, and exhort them to join the Polish National Alliance. When our masses begin to develop, become enlightened, understand the purpose of the struggle for property, then they will fight with conviction and will surely win; because to fight today is like attacking the sun with a broom.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>We are attempting inappropriate and actually harmful work! Let us build schools beside every church, even if these should be connected with bloodshed! Dear compatriots we will not attain the aims set forth by the Polish National Alliance by fighting priests and bishops, but by means of enlightenment, which has its roots in the schools.</p>
