   <p>Every broad-minded person will admit the fact that there is a lack of an intellectual group among Polish-American citizenry. There are individual cases, that is true, but these do not comprise an intellectual class.</p>
   <p>The fire and desire for education among our Polish youth in America is lacking to an extent that it is hardly believable. In America, where the ambition of youth does not stop after securing a degree, our Polish youth can barely muster enough energy to prepare for First Holy Communion [Translator's note: During this period (1890's) a child had to be in the higher grade of the elementary school and at least twelve years of age before he could get his First Holy Communion. This, of course, has reference to the Polish parochial schools].</p>
   <p>In all the twelve free public high schools of the city of Chicago it is doubtful <span class="page-break">2</span>whether there are more than ten Polish teachers. During the past three years only one Polish young man, Mr. Jezierny, and one Polish young lady, Miss Frances Mikitynska, received diplomas in these schools. There also are about ten Polish students at the Jesuit High School, but a part of this number is enrolled in the business course and not the general course.</p>
   <p>On the list of public school teachers in Chicago for 1892-93 only three Polish names were found, namely, Anna Drezmal [also Drzemala], Wanda Ladynska, and Otylia Mikulska. The latter two were teachers of German and had received their training abroad. Miss Mikitynska was appointed a teacher last year. This small number is the entire representation of the Polish people of Chicago, whose number is the largest in America.</p>
   <p>There is a mere handful of Polish students in universities and other institutions of learning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>At the University of Chicago there are at present four students bearing typical Polish names: Lipski, Witkowski, Pienkowski, and Jarzebski, but only the last named is a Pole; Witkowski and Lipski are Jewish. Pienkowski, although of Polish descent, does not know a word of Polish.</p>
   <p>Northwestern University has two Polish students, a young man who is training for a pharmacist and Miss Dowiatowna, who is studying medicine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klosowski is the only Pole attending the University of Illinois at the present time.</p>
   <p>In the other technical and professional institutions of Chicago the following names are found: Messrs. Sawicki and Zurawski, who attend classes at a technical school, and Mr. Kuflewski, who is studying medicine.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Six of the above-mentioned students completed their training in the "Gymnasium" or high school, in Europe and not in America.</p>
   <p>It is very sad indeed to have such a meager representation in our higher institutions of learning, because the Poles number over 50,000 in Chicago.</p>
   <p>These facts are given because I have often become saddened by them and because my greatest desire is to see the Poles take greater advantage of the educational opportunities offered in Chicago. Would to God that this appeal would only urge one Pole to have his children receive the benefits of higher education.</p>
