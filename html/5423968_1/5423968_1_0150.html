   <p>Children between the ages of 6 and 7 should attend school. It is not our business to dictate to the parents to what kind of school their children should go. The choice between the public and parochial schools is entirely up to the parents. Above all we should remember that any school is better than none. If parents, living in a neighborhood where only a public school is handy, but they want their children to attend parochial school or vice versa, they should send their children to the nearest school for the time being until arrangements can be made to change schools or transfer them.</p>
   <p>If neighborhoods populated mostly by Polish do not have a Polish parochial school but have a German or Irish parochial school, the Polish parents should send their children to the nearest public school and teach them the Catholic religion at home.</p>

   <p>As soon as the child enters school, it is not only a student but it has taken the first steps in becoming an American citizen. To receive an education and profit by it is the duty of every intelligent child. The child not only improves himself, but his parents as well.</p>
   <p>To improve and teach a child is not only of good interest to himself but to the community, because the more educated children there are of Polish nationality the more strength, riches and consideration will Poles receive from the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Parents should remember that the child attending school is benefiting from the services of the public. For this the public is paying taxes, to make it possible for every child to receive an education; or the parents can pay a small monthly fee at the parochial school.</p>
   <p>It is important for the parents to tell the child, at the earliest possible opportunity, how important an education and the honorable service he is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>doing for the community. It becomes necessary to explain that, like his father working and fulfilling through his work things necessary for the people, fulfilling wholeheartedly the services of the community, so should the child learn to serve his community and his country through his schooling. It is necessary to impress the child with the idea that the general aim of eloquence is persuasion. It is necessary that the child should endeavor to become a citizen working for the good of the public; he should care about his honor at all times, whether in school, at home or on the streets.</p>
   <p>A child should realize that his bad conduct in school and on the streets makes a bad reflection on his parents, his school and its teachers; they should always bear this in mind. The parents should punish their children for their bad doings, but they must consider that many kind words often do more good than a spanking. The child should rely on the parents for aid in his many undertakings. We should always remember that one studious child will be of more service to the future generation than ten less studious <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>children. The ten less studious children in time to come will be a burden to the community instead of an asset. The parents should make it their business to arrange it so that the child when studying his lessons has absolute quiet, an a place in the house of his own where he can concentrate.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all parents to see that their children are well fed, clothed and in a jovial mood when leaving their home for school. The child's spirit should not be broken nor should he be discouraged regarding his school work.</p>
   <p>The greatest mistake of parents is bribing the children to eat or giving them money to buy what they like for their meals, and, instead of buying something good and nourishing, they buy cakes, candy, and other less nutritious food, the result of which is a doctor bill and loss of time from school.</p>
