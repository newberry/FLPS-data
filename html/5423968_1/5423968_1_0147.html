   <p>The City of New York is known to have spent the sum of $15,000 to enforce a law making the children attend school. We here in the City of Chicago claim to have a smaller expenditure than that. In order to lower expenses, we advise the parents to purchase themselves a whip for ten cents and make use of it if their children run about the streets instead of attending school regularly.</p>
