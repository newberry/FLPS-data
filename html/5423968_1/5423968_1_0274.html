   <p>For some time the rumor has been circulated that Holy Trinity High School's diplomas have no actual value, and that youths graduated from this school cannot be admitted to a university.</p>
   <p>So far the Holy Trinity High School only issues diplomas to students taking up business courses, and as to the value of these diplomas, we refer to our alumni, A. Bartnicki, J. Uczciwek, J. Goderski, W. Sachman, and T. Kluczewski. As an evidence that Holy Trinity High School diplomas are recognized by universities, we quote the letter addressed to us by the president of the University of Notre Dame, one of the most famous institutions of its kind in the United States.</p>
   <p>Notre Dame, Ind., Nov. 4, 1912</p>
   <p>Brother Peter, C.S.C.</p>
   <p>Holy Trinity High School, Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>My dear Brother Peter:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>I am pleased to know that the Holy Trinity High School of Chicago is thoroughly organized and equipped for high school work and that its curriculum covers the usual program of the preparatory course of four years. It gratifies me to assure you that the University of Notre Dame will recognize the credits given by your high school and that we will admit to our freshman year, without examination, all of your graduates who have completed the four years of high school work in your school.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>John Cavanaough, C.S.C.</p>
   <p>President</p>

   <p>Those who are spreading false rumors evidently meant to harm our school.</p>
   <p>Information about tuition or about the validity of our school's diplomas will be gladly given to those who will apply to Brother Peter, C.S.C., director of the Holy Trinity High School, Division and Cleaver Sts., Chicago.</p>
