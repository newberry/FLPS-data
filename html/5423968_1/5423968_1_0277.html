   <p>St. Stanislaus College will open a so-called business college next September. It will be a two-year day and night course. The course will consist of book-keeping, stenography, business geography, typing, commercial law, mathematics, religion, and Polish language. These subjects will be taught by specially engaged teachers. The course will open on September 9, and at the same time an evening course will open for those who are occupied during the day.</p>
   <p>The diploma issued upon graduation entitles the student to entry into various business institutions, industrial plants, banks, business houses, etc. With this diploma it is much easier to find employment, even in city and government administration bureaus. These courses will enable our youth to receive a business training at a nominal cost.</p>
   <p>Reverend W. Zapala, rector of the college, should be congratulated for his practical idea, which will be of benefit to our young people.</p>
