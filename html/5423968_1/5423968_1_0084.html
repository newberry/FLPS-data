   <p>The school is an institution about which we can write and discuss continually. It constitutes a never exhausted subject for pedagogues, psychologists, medics, historians and critics, because it is the main source and foundation of our national life.</p>
   <p>As is the school, so is the nation; or the nation is just like its school - that is - the eyes of all of us are turned towards it and it constitutes a subject of general interest.</p>
   <p>It is not our intention to make a long description of our parochial or public schools, but we wish to call your attention to a certain school problem about which we also should start to think.</p>
   <p>In our numerous settlements we have magnificent school buildings in which, besides the elementary education, trades can also be taught, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as it is in France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and America. Those schools are considered a very important factor in the physical and mental development,and constitute means to livelihood.</p>
   <p>Trade schools develop energy in the highest degree; they educate the aesthetic sense, teach systematic work, the value of time, and inspire ambition.</p>
   <p>Our youth leave school too soon and start working too early in factories, doing the lowest kind of work and receiving very little for their work,with no chance for advancement.</p>
   <p>If our schools in large cities would teach trades, our young men would be able to secure positions as foremen, which is very important today in America. The foremen hire and discharge men in factories; they keep those whom they like and make it easier for them. Many of them, as you know, discriminate against Polish workers. They tease and annoy our workers.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>A young man who has experience in any trade has a better chance and is not obliged to be a slave of any foreman. As a proof, we submit the following case:</p>
   <p>A certain young Polish mechanic, well acquainted with American mechanical technique, applied for a position to the owner of the factory, from whom he secured an order for a position. The foreman of the shop gave him a suspicious look, took the slip of paper from him and sent him to the corner. The young man, very much humiliated, rolled up his sleeves and started to work, disregarding humiliation. After a few days, a foreman,seeing that the young man did not pay much attention to him, told him to go home. A little while later the owner of the shop happened to be in the shop and asked the foreman about the young man. The foreman, without even thinking, replied that the young man was no good and that he had let him go. The owner did not believe the story told him by the foreman. Returning to the office, he was surprised to see the young man who had been discharged by the foreman.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>After a short conference, the owner took the young man back to the factory and instructed the foreman not to discharge that young man any more. You can imagine how the young man felt. However, this condition did not last very long. Today the young man, who was discharged for being no good, is a foreman in that factory and a first hand of the owner. Right now that firm employs many workers of Polish nationality.</p>
   <p>The foregoing story is related here for the purpose of showing that the owners themselves do not discriminate against Polish employees if they distinguish themselves by possessing some ability. At present there is plenty of so-called man power or common laborers, but there is a shortage of so-called skilled labor.</p>
   <p>If our schools would teach all kinds of trades and supply factories with skilled workers, we would undoubtedly profit materially and morally.</p>
   <p>While it is true that such a school is a very expensive proposition, it is also true that in the end it would pay for itself for the parents, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and later on pupils themselves would pay for it.</p>
   <p>Graduates of such schools are not obliged to look for employment, for the manufacturers themselves will look for them and offer them positions. Perhaps, instead of building more colleges it would be advisable to build more trade schools, especially in large cities. Also those parochial schools which have plenty of space and funds should teach trades.</p>
