   <p>On the day before yesterday, September 18, the Polish language was taught, for the first time, at Schurz High School. September 18, 1911, should, for that reason, be regarded as an historic day by the Poles of Chicago, the second largest city in the United States. This whole matter, so vital to the development of Polish youth, and so important to Polish prestige, is now virtually settled. All Poles, regardless of their political or religious affiliations, should rejoice over this achievement. Recognition of the Polish language classes in the public schools, bringing Polish to a position of equality with French and German, has excited much resentment among the Germans; it is, however, a great honor and a great advantage to the Poles.</p>
   <p>We are at a loss, therefore, to account for the attitude of our clerical press. The board of directors of the Polish National Alliance was ridiculed by Dziennik Chicagoski, a publication which represents the clerical press, when the Polish National Alliance fought for the right to teach the Polish language in Chicago public schools. The clerical press referred to the people working for this cause as agents of the American schools. The fact is that our Polish youth will continue to attend American schools until such a time as we develop better Polish schools. The clergy, however, for its own selfish advantage, would like to force Polish children into the parochial schools even if these schools are inferior.</p>
   <p>Much difficulty was experienced in establishing the teaching of the Polish language at Schurz High School. When Polish pupils applied for a course in the Polish language the principal of that school expressed great surprise, declaring that the subject was not listed in the language courses. The students then appealed to the school board, which in turn appealed to the principal; the latter, however, still insisted that he had not been officially notified.</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the Polish National Alliance then sent its committee to Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, the superintendent of Chicago schools. This kind lady, too, was astonished, but with the fact that the superintendent was not familiar with the Polish course. The committee thereupon insisted that Mrs. Ella Flagg Young give them a written order to the principal of Schurz High School that would serve as official notification. "This can be accomplished in a few days," replied Mrs. Young, with an angelic smile.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the principal of Schurz High School was making every effort to persuade the Polish students to invest the balance of their time in another subject. Some undermining influence was evidently working against the Poles; nevertheless, the principal, when finally forced to the wall, agreed to start a Polish class, provided there were no fewer than thirty pupils. New appointments and new interviews followed, until the principal agreed to open a class for the study of the Polish language with twenty pupils, but after the regular school hours, hoping in this way to discourage the Polish youth. But neither the Polish youth nor the school board gave up. Finally, after a long telephone conversation between the office of the president of the Polish National Alliance and the office of the superintendent of the Chicago school board the matter was settled.</p>
   <p>It is a strange coincidence that the first teaching of the Polish language in an American school is in one bearing the German name of Carl Schurz. However, this German was different from others. He was born in Westphalia, a province of Prussia. Upon completing his university education he joined the republican army, commanded by General Mieroslawski. After escaping the death sentence he wandered about through England and Switzerland, and finally reached America. When Lincoln ran for president, young Schurz, who had just a short time before become a naturalized citizen, toured the country making campaign speeches for Lincoln, because he felt that Lincoln was a great man. When Lincoln became president, he appointed Schurz ambassador to Spain, an important position at that time. Two months later, Schurz appeared at the White House with a resignation in his hand. "What do you wish?" asked Lincoln. "The Union is in danger, and I wish to be a soldier", replied Schurz. Lincoln replied, "Go to the barracks for orders." In an hour Schurz was made brigadier general, by President Lincoln.</p>
   
   <p>The generals of Irish and Anglo-Saxon descent did not like the idea that yesterday's immigrant should be wearing the insignia of a general, but in a short time they became reconciled to him. After the battle of Chancellorsville (1863), when the defeated Northern Army was retreating, and the rebels were marching on Washington, Carl Schurz blocked the road and stopped their march to victory.</p>
   <p>Years later, during President Hayes's term, as a former Secretary of the Interior he visited his native country. The death sentence had been forgotten and Prussian officers saluted the great American everywhere. Bismarck invited him for a talk and asked him to return to his native land. "I have become acquainted with the goddess of liberty, and I will not betray her", answered Carl Schurz.</p>
