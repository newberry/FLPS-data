   <p>The members of the Chicago Board of Education report that there has been an increase of fifteen thousand students in the enrollment in higher educational institutions over that of last year. The number of grammar school children has also increased considerably. A marked number of Polish students have enrolled in the secondary schools, although not in the anticipated proportion as might be expected from our people. The increase of Polish pupils in the high schools is greater in every respect than it has been in previous years. This would indicate that our people know the value of education and send their children to the higher institutions of education, that they may develop into people of knowledge so that they may, in the future, occupy higher social positions. The courses in the elementary and secondary institutions, in the parochial as well as in public schools, have already begun. The children, therefore, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>should be sent to them that an enlightened generation may develop. This would elevate our people from the ranks of ordinary manual laborers to that of civic and social leaders. Money should serve for the acquisition of education, and education will in turn bring monetary benefits to those who possess knowledge. In the present era, a person deprived of education is likened to one wandering in a dense forest unable to find a path. Let us educate our children, because through education our people will increase our national wealth, social position, and prestige.</p>
