   <p>Philadelphia, Pa. - Not long ago there was a report made that one of our Polish students, who was taking a higher course in one of the parochial schools, succeeded in signing his name without any assistance. This very important act was verified by our Chicago stupefier, Dziennik Chicagoski, stating that the parochial schools are not as bad as reported.</p>
   <p>On account of that great discovery, a very careful investigation was made in order to determine if there are any more such pearls among our parochial students. The investigation failed to find another one. Evidently it was only an accident.</p>
   <p>Some of the students are able to make straight and curved strokes; others can make the loops, while the advanced classes can make whole letters; some of them even know the whole alphabet, but all of them know how to say prayers.</p>
   <p>Professor Zapala will soon prepare a pedagogical dissertation on the superiority <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of parochial schools over the public institutions, using this incident as an example.</p>
