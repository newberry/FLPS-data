   <p>Soon the doors of all the schools will open (here and there they have already opened) to admit millions of children daily to the thousands of school buildings in this country. Of these young children, the schools will make people of character stronger than steel, who in the future are going to take our places and service the wheels of the tremendous machine of socio-political life.</p>
   <p>Among the millions of young people foreign to us in ancestry, traditions, language, and faith, there will be about a million Polish children in the entire United States who will go to parochial schools or public schools or such institutions of higher education as the Polish National Alliance College at Cambridge Springs.</p>
   <p>One of the most important subjects awaiting the pupils of Polish schools and colleges is the Polish language, because knowledge of it will lead our young people to become acquainted with our history, our accomplishments, and the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>pearls of our literature. Even a slight knowledge of these things will be a shield against loss of national identity and submergence in the boundless sea of Americanism.</p>
   <p>About these children we feel more or less secure. Nevertheless, anxiety should furrow the brows of every father and mother concerning those children who, because of necessity or some other reason, attend American schools. These schools --just as you would expect of the schools in a foreign country--aim at Americanizing the children and inculcating in them the feeling of pride and admiration for this country and the deeds of its sons. Such systematic inculcation causes the children to lose interest in their own language, the history of their nation, and their customs. It washes every child with the same wave, washes away all of the child's characteristic attributes, and makes a typical American out of him.</p>
   <p>Let us just think how many of our children are lost in this way and what a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>tremendous loss our community suffers. It is our duty to counteract this influence and to demand of the municipal authorities, wherever there is a large concentration of Poles and wherever a large group of Polish children attend public schools, that the Polish language be taught as a separate subject. This duty should now rest on the shoulders of the communes of the Polish National Alliance, as the most important groups in each of the Polish colonies. We know that many communes have already included this matter in their programs of action and we hope that they persevere in this good work.</p>
   <p>With the beginning of the school year, we should try in the first place to regain those outposts which we had formerly. We have in Chicago the Carl Schurz High School, for instance, in which the Polish language was taught for a year. Last year this course was discontinued because there were not enough pupils registering for it. We know that many Poles attended this school.</p>
   <p>About one hundred pupils registered this year for the Norwegian language. It <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>is certainly shameful for us not to take advantage similarly of our right to study the Polish language in the public schools. Today, when Poland's cause is on everyone's lips, today, when foreign newspapers are actually making greater efforts for our cause than we are ourselves, we should show that we here in America not only have the word "Poland" on our lips, but that we are trying in every way possible to attest the fact that we are Poles.</p>
   <p>That is why Polish parents should demand that their children register for Polish courses in the public schools and the children themselves should show their willingness and come in large numbers for lessons in the Polish language where-ever such classes are already in existence or will soon be established.</p>
