   <p>In the American universities there are found quite a number of Poles, a fact which is sometimes mentioned in the American newspapers. Lately one has been running across Polish names among the athletes of the universities; and so in Princeton University, at Princeton, N. J., can be found among the baseball players one by the name of Butkiewicz and at the Pennsylvania University, in Philadelphia, can be found a football player by the name of Piekarski.</p>
