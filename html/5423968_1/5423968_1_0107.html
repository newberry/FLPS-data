   <p>Chicago is the third ranking city in the world with the largest Polish population (this includes Chicago and vicinity). In spite of this the outlook of its Poles is very poor. For example, the present school term has just ended. Out of the many public high schools, 1,500 have graduated. From this number a mere 15, - yes, only 15, - Poles have received high school diplomas. In some of the high schools, especially those built in Polish districts for the Polish people, not one Polish student enrolled. Jews, Swedes, Germans, and American-born children were found in abundance on the lists. On the graduating rolls, Bohemian, Russian, and Japanese names are found. The astonishing thing is that not one Polish name finds a place out of every hundred others. What is more surprising is the fact that Chicago has over 300,000 Poles or one-seventh of its entire population. Therefore, every seventh student should be Polish. They should be taking the advantages offered because high schools are the stepping stones to colleges, universities, academies, and technical institutions. Polish youth should prepare itself by gathering laurels in high school and repeating this performance in the higher institutions of learning. Instead, people from other racial groups are filling these places and taking all the honors. Sad but true, merely one Polish student out of a hundred is trying to push his way ahead.</p>
   <p>Hundreds stun their ambitions at hard labor in factories, as their fathers. With great difficulty some manage to accumulate some wealth. Very few ever rise to prominence in America and, accordingly, the Polish masses are shoved about. It is even more sad, for we ourselves are pushing ourselves into a rut and voluntarily falling into it deeper and deeper to such an extent that we are becoming the laughing stock of other races.</p>
   <p>Some will say that the Polish people in Chicago and other cities do not go to high school or college because they do not have the wherewithal. This is a fallacy. The elementary public schools, as well as the public high schools, are open to all free of charge. It is only the colleges and universities that a tuition fee is charged. This fee is nominal. A four-year course can be completed for six hundred dollars. In many one can get it for four hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>In Chicago alone we have several thousand Polish families that can well afford to send their young without jeopardizing their financial position. There are less Germans in Chicago, and yet many of their children are found in high schools and colleges. They readily understand the advantages of education. Their salvation lies in specialized training. As the years increase, their numbers increase in these higher educational centers. They adapt themselves more easily to the outside world, find better positions, gain wealth more rapidly, and become outstanding in the United States.</p>
   <p>Among us the shroud of ignorance is not lifting despite the glaring examples that confront our eyes. We have been caught in the quagmires of darkness and refuse to find a way out, saying that we are well off in our present position.</p>
   <p>People! People! When will the light dawn upon you; when will you awaken, when will you find your way out and search for the road that leads to enlightenment, broadmindedness, and education? When will the light penetrate your brains to that you will see the progress of other people in this country?</p>
