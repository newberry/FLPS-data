   <p>All members of the Chicago Board of Education have received the resolution of the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance, requesting that the teaching of the Polish language be included in the curriculum of the public schools of this city. We can surmise that there will be little opposition in the school board when this matter is discussed at its forthcoming meeting. No one can honestly deny the righteousness of our demands that the Polish language be taught in the public schools, when the German language is being taught to children of German parents.</p>
   <p>We Poles have been treated unjustly: our people pay taxes to have the children of German parents taught the German language and our Polish children are deprived of the privilege of being taught the Polish language.</p>
