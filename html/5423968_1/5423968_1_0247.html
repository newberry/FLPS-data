   <p>A friend of our newspaper has sent to the editor of Dziennik Chicagoski the following letter:</p>
   <p>(Summary)</p>
   <p>A reader asks the editor to write a few words about children from Polish parochial schools who try to sell tickets for various school affairs to the businessmen in the neighborhood. Their attempts as a rule are a dismal failure, for which the teaching sisters are to blame. He offers a few suggestions to teachers in the elementary principles of salesmanship and ends with the question,</p>
   <p>"Am I not right?"</p>
   
   <p>(Translation Continued)</p>
   <p>Yes, you are absolutely right, we say to our correspondent, and in reprinting this letter we should like respectfully to call our Sisters' attention to it and to suggest putting the ideas contained in it to the best possible use. The idea is good, worth putting into practice.</p>
   <p>For unfortunately it is necessary for our schools, most of which are poor, to depend on the help and the small profits that come from time to time from amateur school performances and other public appearances of school children; and what is even worse, it is necessary to use school children to sell tickets, and it seems only common sense that one should go about it properly and efficiently, so that from this altogether unpleasant necessity for the peddling of tickets by school children the greatest possible educational and moral benefit may be derived.</p>
   
   <p>The children, then, should be taught how to sell tickets if it is essential to sell them; they should be taught good manners, which they sadly lack, especially our boys. Children should be instructed that on entering a store they should bow becomingly and politely, greet any one whom they find there, and explain to him, as our correspondent advises, the kind of entertainment given and the purpose of it. This is not too difficult and could easily be done, and from the doing of it a twofold benefit would be derived--benefit for the school, since more tickets would be sold, and benefit for the children themselves, who would acquire better manners.</p>
   <p>We all know only too well that our children and our young people need such practical instruction in good manners and polite behavior and need it urgently, without delay. They appear at a great disadvantage in this respect when compared with children of other nationalities. The worst offenders in this respect are the boys of the parish schools, not only of the grammar schools but of the high schools as well, who think it humiliating to bow to any one on the street and as a rule do not know what to do with their hats when they enter a house, intentionally assuming rude manners and postures in order not to appear different and so expose themselves to the ridicule of their school friends, who have not the slightest notion of polished behavior or of the accepted rules of social conduct.</p>
   <p>It is advisable to exert some effort to teach our young people at least the rudiments of social graces, and our teaching sisters have the best opportunity to do it, since the children under their care and instruction are small, and their character is pliable and easily influenced and trained, whereas later, when they have grown older, they will become more recalcitrant to such influences.</p>
   <p>We recommend these suggestions to the careful consideration of those who should be interested in them.</p>
