   <p>We are living now in terms of schools. The whole Polish - American population is conscious not only of the improvement of the already existing parochial schools, but also of establishing higher schools.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance is collecting funds to establish a higher school in Pennsylvania. The Resurrectionist Fathers are busy on the expansion of the St. Stanislaus College. In Washington a Polish College has been established in connection with the local Catholic university. In Philadelphia, a Catholic priest will build a Polish high school with his own funds. The Polish seminary in Detroit is making more and more improvements each year. In other words, five high - schools are occupying the minds of Poles, and commanding the belief, that in the future Polish society will produce its own group of intelligentsia so necessary in this country, which has been adopted as its second fatherland. It is imperative that this work begin at the foundation; now that our wants are known, we shall satisfy them.</p>
