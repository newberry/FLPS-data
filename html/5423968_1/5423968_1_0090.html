   <p>Additional mention is also made by the Dziennik Zwiazkowy [of the fact] that there are several sons of members of the Polish National Alliance now attending the University of Michigan. These are students receiving financial aid from the Alliance. They make great progress in their studies and leave this university as accomplished people. The educational department of the Polish National Alliance, in disbursing the stipends, favors this university because it is one of the best in the United States. Many Polish students have already completed their courses at this educational institution and are now occupying important civic positions and public offices.</p>
