   <p>Books are great treasures and golden gleanings.</p>
   <p>Wherever they are disseminated, scattered and multiplied, there grows the power of the soul, their strength increases, their talents blossom, their daily and uncommon deeds bring inmense benefits.</p>
   <p>But all books are not alike; and the influence of a silly, romantic book cannot be figured on the same basis as the influence of an educational book; a book that knows how to ennoble the heart and mould your character beneficially.</p>
   <p>The less enlightened the nation, the easier it is for vile people to scatter and implant evil, poor, nonsensical and often baneful books. Hence we encounter not a small number of people in the business of selling books, who are not at all concerned in spreading truth, knowledge and education <span class="page-break">2</span>among the people, but only concerned with silly romantic books and inferior illustrations that may catch readers like flies on sticky fly paper, and are to be cheered heartily for the simple method they employ to amass a fortune.</p>
   <p>Among other nations where knowledge has already made considerable gain fundamentally, there are published good, useful books, moderate in price because there are printed a hundred thousand copies and they are used up in a short time.</p>
   <p>By us Polish editions of a book cannot be so moderate in price because here we print barely two to three thousand copies, and they are very slowly taken up.</p>
   <p>One wishes to read, but borrows them. The other wishes to read but only copies given to him free of charge. Another does not want to read at all, and says that he would rather enjoy himself playing billiards or in a bowling alley.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Only here and there you can find one who buys books and brings them home, and in the home one may hear many different excuses.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, it would be much better for us in every respect, if we would interest ourselves in Polish books and learn to love those books more dearly.</p>
   <p>Our books would become lower in price and more beautiful if more of them were purchased.</p>
   <p>Sorrow fills the heart and shame burns the brain when we look upon the editions of English and German books. What a number of copies they publish annually! What a number they distribute among their own kind! What amount of truth and knowledge they will implant!</p>
   <p>And we - - barely a few pamphlets. And we publish very few new works because there are no buyers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Whiskey, beer, wine, rum and cigars .... for these everyone has money. For books..... it is a pity to spend a few pennies! Undoubtedly, a book is more pleasant and useful than whiskey, wine and rum.</p>
   <p>Let us move with desire and enthusiasm to this and that bookstore. Let us begin to buy interesting and lovely books for our children, our wives, our neighbors, our help, our workers... and we will see in a short while that the "crop" from reading books will not be small, and our books will become more and more beautiful and lower in price.</p>
   <p>A book is oftentimes a guest , pleasanter than the one who bores us, torments us, and in the end, talks about us and laughs at us. A book is better pleasure than the saloon or bowling alley, because after reading a book there remains always one little granule of learning, a little ray of enlightenment, and from this little granule and little ray of enlightenment there can be grown benefits for the nation and the Fatherland. A book <span class="page-break">5</span>is a powerful weapon against hostile purposes..... but a book that is not in the bookstore, but in the hands of many thousands.</p>
   <p>Fellow-countrymen, buy Polish books!</p>
