   <p>Examinations at local and other schools are taking place earnestly and seriously. The children, by invitation, have their parents appear as guests, for this is an important occasion in the school year. For these children the doors to higher grades are opening, and in later years they hope to be prepared for the higher institutions of learning.</p>
   <p>In many Polish schools the examination period is not taken so seriously. It happens that this step to higher education is not given great consideration because many of the children do not have a foresight of the future. And yet this is very imperative in the early years of life, when the child is still in the early grades, in that it brings out the child's ambition and aptitude.</p>
   <p>Examinations show the ambition of the child, aid him to get ahead, create <span class="page-break">2</span>something to look forward to, and promote greater exertions. All this is of benefit to them. It stimulates interest, promotes studies, and enchance their future progress, which in turn helps them reach their goal.</p>
   <p>The end of the current school term will bring to an end the educational activities of thousands of Polish children. What is going to happen to these children? What is their fate? A part of them will find employment in industry, a very small percentage will enroll at higher institutions of learning, and a large number of them will develop into rogues and increase the present ranks. Later they will recruit into higher organized ranks. This is very sad, but true.</p>
   <p>Each closing school term brings heartfelt pangs to the educators because many of these young Polish children, who could take advantage of the higher branches of education, will only waste their blooming years. Instead, they could prove to be fine examples of future citizens. They not only could be <span class="page-break">3</span>a pride to their parents and their community, but to the Polish generation.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, Polish parents do not heed the callings nor the advice of educators on the advantages offered by further education. A majority of Polish parents are paying the price of ignorance. Their adverse attitude towards education is an unpardonable fault, a desperately horrid reality, which cannot be shaken off by persuasion, by definite and concrete examples, or by public denunciation. All this does not alter their views and fails to show them the sin of not looking after their children properly. This is not only a sin of their own, a mark against our poor forefathers, our country, but a sin before God, Who has given us the power to be able to progress for our good and for the good of posterity.</p>
   <p>This narrow-minded outlook of some parents has brought this to light: Out of three million Polish-Americans, with forty years of American existence, and many opportunities of education offered to them and their children, only a mere few hundred (about 350) have attended high educational centers. The <span class="page-break">4</span>neglect is tremendous in spite of the opportunities offered and in spite of the great miseries suffered because of this handicap. We become the laughing stock of others, our abilities are scoffed at, and we are dubbed as the retarders of education by those who, although not completing a university education, were able to train themselves so as to qualify for a better job.</p>
   <p>After each school year, we ought to tabulate our progress in the field of education and help prevent delinquency. We all can see that people of other nationalities take advantage of education and because of their training held better positions. We, therefore, are shoved back and hold the lowest rank, the meaningless job of the unskilled. And this will continue, unless our parents change their narrow-minded attitude and come to recognize the advantage of education. If within their souls does not come the realization that they have put into their child's hand a revolver, that they permitted him to trod upon the pavements of wrongfulness, that in later years the child will be sentenced either to the electric chair, or feel the hangman's noose, <span class="page-break">5</span>then our chances to progress are very slight.</p>
   <p>Awaken, parents! for upon you will await the demand for an explanation before the Almighty Lord for your daughter's or son's actions. Remember that on the upbringing of your children depends their future. Upon you and your children will fall the damnation of the people, and above all the curse of God. It is He that gave you the privilege to have children, for whose training you must some day answer.</p>
   <p>Upon this some will say: "What can I do, the streets make a loafer out of my son. The sting of the rod does not help and admonishment produces worse results." To this, America adds: "The egg is smarter than the chicken," "He that does not knock, does not enter," and, "The way the child makes its bed, that is the way it will sleep."</p>
   <p>We know that the parents are trying to deaden their own knowledge [of the facts] and do not do justice to the world on themselves. Let them look upon <span class="page-break">6</span>the children and the youth of the Germans. Let them visit the German colonies. Will they find there vagrants in the streets? On the contrary, the youth display their bringing up with grace and politeness. It seems as if they have been reared on different soil. The older individuals are pleasing to the eye. They either occupy themselves with something useful or are on their way to do some good. They work for themselves or occupy some prominent position in industry or commerce. Others attend college in order to be trained for some executive position. The German youth is the first to reap the advantages in many fields. Why is it different among our generation? Why does our youth, which is better fitted than the German, or any other, waste itself? Because of this the parents suffer, their poor example slanders their people, and as a whole the entire Polish population is blamed for this condition. The talent given them by God is ruthlessly damaged, thereby lowering their position, to become the mockery of other of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>In spite of everything we are inclined to shout with a mighty voice: People, <span class="page-break">7</span>wake up from your slumber of ignorance, and do not deprive your children of their right to an education, for through it they will be in a better position to gain their livelihood. They will not only be educated, but also be fine examples for themselves, their parents, and the Polish people as a whole. You will have something to be proud of, something to talk about. Before God you will have to answer for their actions for which you were rightfully responsible.</p>
   <p>The Polish press performs what it can to help the younger generation. It calls, begs, implores, and even is ashamed publicly. But all this is to no avail, just like throwing beans against a stone wall. Therefore, we cannot stop and we anticipate that some day we will awaken the dormant brain of Polish parents. Then perhaps we will realize our efforts in part and bring to active life those who can perform miracles if they desire.</p>
   <p>Therefore, through this article, we hope to awaken the reasoning power of Polish parents. This is only one out of the many articles that will appear <span class="page-break">8</span>from day to day. We will endeavor to give certain remedies to solve the prevalent problems and in some way help our younger generation to rise to prominence.</p>
