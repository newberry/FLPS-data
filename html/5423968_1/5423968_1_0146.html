   <p>Mrs. Dr. Wyczotkowska, living here in the city of Chicago, conceived an idea of organizing a school commission with the aim to better the Polish education, especially here in Chicago. She claims the support of all kinds of people.</p>
   <p>The organized commissions aims would be: 1) to inspect the needs of the Polish youth after ending their studies in the elementary school, 2) to awaken the minds of our Polish youth to seek a higher education after finishing an elementary course, 3) to deliberate on means of procuring the necessary funds.</p>
   <p>This project embraces the education of youth, both the male and female.</p>
