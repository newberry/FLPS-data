   <p>At last they are to teach the Polish language in Chicago high schools, thanks to the efforts of the Board of Directors, of the Polish National Alliance. In the beginning, the language of Stowacki, Mickiewicz, Sienkiewicz, and other masters of the Polish tongue is taught only at Carl Schurz high school, in Avondale, where the sufficient number of Polish students as required by the Chicago School Board enrolled. Only a small number of students are taking advantage of the Polish course this year, but we hope that next year the number will increase and several high schools will teach Polish.</p>
   <p>The ice is broken and the Poles have won the fight in our metropolis. Miss Frances Zurawski, a sister of Dr. Zurawski, the chief physician of the Polish National Alliance, has been engaged as the first instructor of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Polish language here. Miss Zurawski is a highly educated person and well qualified for this position. She has been engaged as a regular teacher, receiving corresponding salary, but she will also teach geometry physiology, and the English language. The road is open for the educated Poles to get into our schools and become teachers.</p>
   <p>This indicates that the young Polish men and women, with proper education should prepare themselves to take examinations for teaching positions in public schools, where until now, there have been only a very small percentage of Polish instructors. These postitions are honorable and profitable, and the Poles should seek them.</p>
