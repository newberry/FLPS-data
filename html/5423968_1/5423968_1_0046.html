   <p>Every Pole in the city of Chicago ought to belong to the Society of Educational Assistance. There is no discrimination as to age. Both young and old are welcomed. The aim of this society is to give assistance to those deserving students who are unable to continue their education because of lack of funds. If there is a lack of something among the Polish people in America, it is sufficient high school and college training. Little do they realize that training in secondary schools and universities will not only bring them moral and material gain but recognition among other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Let us all take an active part in this organization by signing up today. In this respect, we will, at least, be able to play a part in assisting our youth to obtain higher educational training.</p>
   <p>Every Polish individual and organization can belong to the Society of Educational Assistance. The entrance fee to this organization is one dollar. This fee <span class="page-break">2</span>also applies to the one dollar annual dues. Those that wish to pay more are requested to do so. The next meeting of this society will be Monday, Dec. 18, at 7:30 P.M. The meeting will be held in the old school building of the Holy Trinity parish.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to become members of this organization but cannot attend the meeting may do so by sending their dollars to the secretary of the society, or by going in person to the headquarters on Thursdays and Saturdays any time before 9:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>No better Christmas gift could be given to some of our Polish youth than a membership in this organization.</p>
   <p>W. Perlowski, president pro tempore; Albert J. Danisch, secretary pro tempore; 1025 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
