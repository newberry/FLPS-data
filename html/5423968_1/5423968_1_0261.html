   <p>At this time I cannot pass over in silence an amusing occurrence which took place at the time that we were building the school. When the foundation was scarcely laid a certain nightly explorer of lengths and widths arrived on the scene and began pacing off, with powerful steps, our very young basement, carefully counting each pace. "One hundred and twenty paces," he cries, "two hundred, three hundred, five hundred. People, in God's name, what are you doing! Is our rector building barracks or what? Who ever heard of constructing such a building for such a small parish?"</p>
   <p>"What have you to say now, brother? Do we have a lot of extra space in our <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>church? Or perhaps the school is too large?" Many people know how to dispense a lot of useless advice but when it comes down to really doing something they cannot be found. But that is enough about this. Where outside of heaven are there no "buts" and "ifs"?</p>
