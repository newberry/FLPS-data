   <p>November 16, 1914, at 10 A. M., Judge Prather, presiding over the county court of Crawford County, at Meadville, Pennsylvania, signed the charter by which the Alliance school became a lawful corporation under the name of the Polish National Alliance College.</p>
   <p>An attempt to incorporate on the strength of the law granting the privilege of issuing college degrees was made by the previous board of directors of the Alliance, but it proved unsuccessful. The board of education, following the advice of Dr. Nathan Schaefer, Superintendent of Public Education for the state of Pennsylvania, decided this time to try to incorporate the school on the basis of the law of 1874. It finally succeeded and was granted permission to obtain a charter.</p>
   <p>The present board of education on coming into office undertook a very difficult task; the mistakes of the outgoing board had antagonized the majority <span class="page-break">2</span>of the Alliance members toward the school board. They must continue to battle with a whole series of obstacles in order to correct these mistakes, push school matters forward in the right direction, and regain the confidence of the disappointed members of the Alliance. One matter to be dealt with was that of the school charter.</p>
   <p>Before the opening of the school in 1912, the previously appointed school board engaged the law firm of Piekarski and Sypniewski of Pittsburgh to obtain the school charter. This firm undertook to obtain a charter for the college which would grant it the right to confer college degrees, on condition that the Alliance school would conform to the law--that is, would engage an adequate faculty, would accept the prescribed curriculum, would assure itself of a steady income, and would secure appropriate students.</p>
   <p>This firm had set the price for obtaining such a charter at three thousand dollars. Nevertheless in May of 1912 at the convention of the school commission <span class="page-break">3</span>protested against entering into an agreement with said law firm asserting that such a charter could be obtained for two hundred dollars, or at most several hundred dollars. On the recommendation of this commission and with the consent of the former administrative board, a contract with Attorney T. Butkiewicz of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was signed on June 27, 1912, by which he undertook to obtain a charter for the school for one thousand dollars. This matter was pending when the school was opened in September of 1912. It was found that there were no students for college courses. On the contrary, those who had enrolled were scarcely prepared to enter the first year high school classes--many were not even adequately prepared for these. Therefore it was necessary to open grammar and high school classes instead of college classes.</p>
   <p>When the Pennsylvania Board of Education sent an investigating committee to the Alliance school, this committee observed at once that there could be no thought of a college here at present and that this school could at this time be only a high school. This committee praised the organizational work of the <span class="page-break">4</span>school and expressed the opinion that it was excellent.</p>
   <p>Since there could be no thought of a college at the moment, because students adequately prepared for college courses had not enrolled, the College and University Board at Harrisburg (capitol of Pennsylvania) announced its opinion, based on the report of this committee, that an application for a college charter should not be submitted until college courses were actually being conducted at the Alliance school.</p>
   <p>The matter of the charter has become important at the present time only in that the law of the state of Pennsylvania does not permit any corporation which has not obtained a charter from the state of Pennsylvania to possess real estate within this state.</p>
   <p>Since the Polish National Alliance has a charter from the state of Illinois, and only a license--that is, permission to conduct its affairs in this state--<span class="page-break">5</span>from the state of Pennsylvania, it was revealed during the purchase of Vanadium [Translator's note: the name of the estate which was purchased for the school] that the title to the estate could temporarily be entered in the name of a trustee until the time when the school corporation obtains a Pennsylvania charter.</p>
   <p>The central board of directors of the Polish National Alliance elected as trustee its former president, Mr. M. B. Steczynski, who is the present administrator of the Alliance school. Mr. Steczynski; on his part, by submitting the declaration usual in such cases, surrendered all his claims to ownership of the school estate in favor of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The present school board at its meeting in April of the present year [1914] altered its contract with Attorney Thomas Butkiewicz in such a way that he was paid five hundred dollars for his previous work, authorized by the former school authorities, and was engaged to take the necessary steps to obtain the <span class="page-break">6</span>ordinary incorporation of the Alliance school at a fee of two hundred dollars, payable on receipt of the charter.</p>
   <p>The incorporation as a college was successfully accomplished and the school property will be transferred within the next few days to the school corporation, under the name of the Polish National Alliance College.</p>
   <p>The charter states that all of the members of the Polish National Alliance are the owners of the school and that the school commission represents them and has the authority to elect the board of trustees. The school commission is to be composed of the entire advisory board and the entire central board of directors of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The board of trustees is to be composed of nine members, of whom one third will be elected after each convention of the Polish National Alliance--that is, after <span class="page-break">7</span>each Alliance convention three will be elected for a term of six years.</p>
   <p>With this system there will be a certain continuity of control over the Alliance school, which is a necessity since all abrupt changes in school boards have a very bad effect on the schools.</p>
   <p>The charter recognizes the present school board as the first board of trustees elected by the present school commission of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
