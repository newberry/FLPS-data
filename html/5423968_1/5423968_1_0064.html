   <p>The spelling book used by the Chicago Public Schools would not be so bad if page 154, where the Kaiser is praised, were torn out of it.</p>
   <p>This page is a thorn in the side of all patriotic Americans. How could it be otherwise? A man who bears the indelible mark of a professional leader of criminals should not be represented in textbooks as a person "clinging to everything that is clean, brave, and good--a person of outstanding, upright character," etc.</p>
   <p>Today a broom is needed to sweep out of the public schools not only this notorious spelling book with its page 154, but also those who have introduced it into the schools and who are trying to keep it there.</p>
   <p>Parenthetically speaking, it will do no harm to mention that in 1914, 140,000 copies of this book were printed and sent to all the schools for the purpose of spreading education. Fallacies and criminal lies appear on 140,000 pages.</p>

   <p>Polish children, if you have one of these spelling books at home, tear off at once the page where the Kaiser is described and send it to the Board of Education, stating that you do not want this moral poison to be fed you in the schools.</p>
   <p>Away with the Kaiser's spelling book!</p>
