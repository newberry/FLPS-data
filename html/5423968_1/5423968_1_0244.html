   <p>In 1894 two houses at North Carpenter Street and Chicago Avenue were reconstructed into classrooms for children, who at that time numbered one thousand and were taught by thirteen teaching sisters. In the years following, in order to accommodate all the children, classrooms had to be constructed in the halls, in the church basement, and even in the church towers and the sacristy.</p>
   <p>Because these improvised classrooms were very inconvenient and unhygienic, the Reverend S. Rogalski, after taking counsel with his assistant priests, submitted to his parishioners a report stressing the necessity and the urgent need of erecting a new and adequate school building. All the parishioners agreed without hesitation to build a new school.</p>
   <p>Plans with estimates of costs for the new structure were made by Mr. Steinbach the architect, well known among Poles; the bricklaying work was done by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the builder and contractor Mr. Ostrowski, who with very few exceptions had build all the Polish churches in Chicago. The carpenter work was contracted for by Mr. Klajda, known to all for his probity and honesty in fulfilling his contracts and doing his work well.</p>
   <p>In order not to burden the parish with too heavy a debt it was decided to build at first only half the structure and later when the need arose, add the other half. This was the reason why the architectural plan was so contrived that half the edifice could be finished as a unit.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1903, after the removal of old buildings, the work was started, and in July of the same year the cornerstone of the new building was blessed. At the tenth anniversary of the founding of the parish, December 27, 1903, the school building was completed and turned over for school use in the expectation that it would be sufficiently large for the next few years. But after two short years it became evident that the new building could not accommodate all the children, and besides, the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>various church societies lacked proper conveniences for their meetings and assemblies. So the parish was compelled to finish the school building, that is, to construct the other half of the edifice.</p>
   <p>In order to collect the necessary funds, it was agreed that each parishioner should contribute ten cents every Sunday for four months as his offering for the school. This plan proved unusually practical, for the whole building was completed without increasing the indebtedness of the parish by so much as one cent.</p>
   <p>The exterior of the school building is imposing, and the interior contains thirty commodious and hygienic classrooms with more than two thousand school children under the guardianship and supervision of thirty teaching sisters. The Chicago Board of Education has granted to this school equal rank with the city public schools.</p>
