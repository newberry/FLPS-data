   <p>The percentage of Polish women who complete courses of study in the higher educational institutions is fearfully small. For every hundred girl students in the high schools, there is an average of barely one Polish girl; there are classes, and even whole schools, without a single Polish girl enrolled. At the University of Chicago, for example, there are only two Polish young women among the students: Miss Esther Kaczorowski, nearing the completion of her studies, and Miss Jean Leszczynski, a freshman. At the Chicago Medical School, Miss Harriet Narbut completed her course this year; at Northwestern, Miss Jablowski. The Narbut family in general deserves particular recognition, because it serves as an admirable example of how, in view of the present difficult struggle for existence, one's children can be educated and prepared for high positions, providing there is a little <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>good will. Having four daughters, they spared no efforts to give each a proper education. The eldest, Miss Alexandra Narbut, has been a teacher in the public schools for several years, and has aided her younger sisters to obtain positions in life similar to hers. Miss Harriet, mentioned above, has just become a doctor of medicine, and of the two youngest, who have just finished high school, Helen will go to normal school and become a teacher, while Sophia, a talented dancer, will enroll in a school of dancing. I take this occasion to express my sincere acknowledgment to Mr. and Mrs. Narbut and Miss Alexandra for such truly cultural tendencies. If every Polish family understood its duties to the younger generation in the same way, we would now be occupying a high position in the city of chicago.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, according to the school records, the number of Polish girls in the high schools of Chicago is at most from ten to fifteen [sic]. And if we take into consideration the fact that we have Polish elementary schools attended by from one to four thousand children, it can well be asked: What is the cause of this indifference of parents to the future of their children <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>when, from such a large number of pupils, barely a few go on to higher schools? After all, it is well known that there is a great need for women doctors and chemists, as well as school teachers, and that there will necessarily be an increase in this need when the war is over.</p>
   <p>It seems to me that the fault lies chiefly with the women editors and journalists who did not know how properly to encourage and educate mothers, so that they would not begrudge money for the education of their daughters. Tuition fees in the Chicago schools are practically nonexistent, with the exception of the universities. Even books are given without charge if one tries to arrange it so. But even so, what do these small costs, as well as the loss of the wage the child would earn, signify in view of the fact that a qualified teacher or chemist earns from seventy-five to a hundred dollars per month in her first year? Let the coming school year find our mothers prepared and enlightened in this respect; let them know that the public schools, or even the high schools, do not give the youth a chance to secure higher or specialized positions. If the future of one's daughter is to be secured, she <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>must be permitted to finish high school and then be sent to business college or normal school, and so on. This is the time to consider the matter thoroughly. I am of the opinion that a committee of women should be formed to take this matter energetically in hand during the vacation months, so that, next term, hundreds instead of tens of girls will be enrolled in the higher institutions of learning. This committee could include Miss Alexandra Narbut, and such other persons as desire to work for a good cause--the future of Polish women. "The future of the [Polish] nation lies in the woman," said Mme. M. Dulebianka.</p>
