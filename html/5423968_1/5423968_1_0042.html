   <p>We investigated attentively the deliberations in Chicago of American pedagogues. We have studied thoroughly their decrees expressed in resolutions, and we became convinced that the pedagogues over here, with few exceptions, belong in a class with people who are thoughtless and who have a very narrow outlook on the world and community life.</p>
   <p>We will not dwell on the individual opinions of the members of the assembly about the pedagodical body from almost every state of the large American Union, because this would take up too much space in our newspaper, and too much time, but we will limit ourselves only to a few fundamental points of the resolution of the assembly.</p>
   <p>Above all, the argument that the federal government ought to expend large sums from its income upon the schools, but should have no control over them, because this is supposed to be contrary to "sound political and educational principles," seems ridiculous and very narrow to us.</p>
   <p>The resolution of this assembly of pedagogues says that the state and not the Union, should constitute the school unit for school assessments and supervision over schools in regard to equalizing the minimum requirements of the school level in the whole state.</p>
   <p>Herein lies the particular reason for the low level of the American schools. Through the breaking away of schools from the control of federal authorities; through the lack of a federal department of education, for all states, rises a chaos in the general American. This education arises because schools are being used universally for low political purposes, and because at the head of schools stand persons with low pedagogical qualifications. There are persons becoming supervisors of schools who are not pedagogues, but ward politicians. In every state, and even in the cities there are different school requirements. The teachers are badly rewarded and very often too low qualifications are demanded from them.</p>
   
   <p>All of this, taken together, lowers the moral level of the entire American nation. It kills youth in the school, the love of beautiful ideals and, with every year, it increases the number of bandits and criminals of all kinds. If the highest control of the American schools would not belong to the ward and state politicians, but to the federal government, there would not be any such scandalous cases as one which happened, for example, in Chicago, where a judge sentenced the whole school board to jail. The governor pardoned it, and another judge abolished the edict of the governor.</p>
   <p>If the federal government had control over the schools, it would institute an equal censorship in all the schools of all the states; it would remove party and ward politics from the schools and bring them up to the level of European schools. To this day, Europe does not recognize American school diplomas, and what is worse, they are not recognized individually even by the American states, because a school diploma from one state has not the proper value in another.</p>
   
   <p>For example, a physician who received his diploma in a college or university in Illinois has to take another examination if he wants to start a professional practice in the state of Michigan.</p>
   <p>The deliberating pedagogues in Chicago, who have broadly dwelt upon the theme of school reform, have given an accurate examination of their thoughtless and narrow outlook on the national education.</p>
