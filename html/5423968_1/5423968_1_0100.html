   <p>In support of the proposed Polish National Alliance school of higher education, one of our weekly newspapers, the Gornik, writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"We are anticipating that the proposed school of higher education will receive the popular support of all Poles and their organizations, because we believe a school of this nature would better prepare our youth for participation in his activities as well as afford a foundation for his social duties.</p>
   <p>"Support, however, outside of the ranks of the Polish National Alliance is lacking. On several occasions it has been clearly stated that this School shall be non-partisan and non-sectarian, free and non-factional, biased by neither politics nor any particular religion. In a School of this kind every <span class="page-break">2</span>effort will be made to broaden the education of our youth in the spirit of the Nation, and enlighten them in the rich and lasting traditions of their fathers.</p>
   <p>"The Falcon Committee's resources now exceed $30,000. The greatest portion of this money was obtained through voluntary donations by the members of the Polish National Alliance."</p>
