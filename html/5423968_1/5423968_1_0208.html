   <p>One of the recent editions of the Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy contained some news relative to the question brought before the Chicago Board of Education. The matter referred to is the introduction of the Polish language in the curriculum of our local public schools. As is well known, the central administration of the Polish National Alliance prepared a proper resolution on this matter and presented it to members of the Board of Education. This important question was placed on the regular agenda of the Board, and on November 23, 1910, it came up for discussion and was discussed for nearly the entire meeting. The delicate but firm tone of the resolution directed to members of the Board of Education by the central administration made an impression because the reasons presented in these resolutions could not be overlooked by keeping quiet about them or slighted by calling them unjust. If, after all, it is permissible to teach the <span class="page-break">\2</span>German language in public schools maintained by taxes of citizens of various nationalities, then the Poles have a right to demand that the Polish language receive equal consideration and be placed on at least an equal basis with the German. This consideration is justly due our people in view of the fact that at the present time there are more than 300,000 Poles residing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This delicate matter concentrated the entire attention of the Board and the Superintendent of Schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young. This indicates that rather serious thought was given the matter. Mrs. Young declared herself in favor of introducing the Polish language in public high schools where at least twenty students could be found who wanted to benefit from the courses of the Polish language. Some members of the Board, however--especially those of German ancestry--were dissatisfied with the contents of the Polish National Alliance's resolution and with Mrs. Young's declaration. They, therefore, have attempted to find various ways and means to prevent the teaching of Polish, while they retained courses in the German language in our public <span class="page-break">\3</span>schools. Seeing that this question could not be settled in such a manner--because our people will not cease to demand rights justly due them--one of the members of the Board, Dr. Guerin, made a motion that no foreign language be taught in public schools. This meant that the German language would also be thrown out, along with Polish and other languages. For the time being, this matter has been placed in the hands of a committee composed of members of the Board, Dr. Guerin, and Attorney Smietanka, as well as Mrs. Ella Flagg Young. The decision of this committee is unknown, but it is almost certain that either the Polish language will be considered and introduced in the public schools or the German language will not have a place there; otherwise one nationality would be favored at the expense of another.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, through its central administration, has taken definite steps which can have great importance to us Polish-Americans in the future. We are perfectly justified in maintaining that, since we pay taxes for education, we cannot allow our language to be abused while other <span class="page-break">\4</span>languages are given consideration.</p>
   <p>The Polish language has already been introduced in the public schools of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and it is taught by Polish teachers at those schools. Why, then, could we not obtain the same rights in Chicago, where the Polish people are especially numerous?</p>
   <p>Dr. Guerin, in opposing the introduction of foreign languages in our local public schools, attempts to justify himself by stating that the German language is inadequately taught in the public elementary schools and has no value for the pupils. Mr. Cameron, another member of the Board, supports the arguments of his colleague, and adds that if the Polish language were taught in the public schools then all other nationalities, even if they numbered only a few pupils, would demand courses in their language and a chaotic condition would be created in the schools.</p>
   <p>We care little whether the German language is taught adequately. Nor are <span class="page-break">\5</span>we greatly interested in the arguments of Mr. Cameron as to whether it is necessary here. People of every nationality have a civic right to use their language in this country, and those who pay taxes for education can demand recognition of their language if they do not want to renounce it completely. Moreover, we do not think that nationalities having only a few pupils here would want to have courses in their language. Neither will the Poles demand that a special teacher be assigned to schools where only a few pupils of our nationality are found. The schools we are interested in are those where Polish children predominate or where they are represented in rather large numbers. The Polish language should be taught by Polish teachers in schools such as these, and it is upon this basis that the Polish National Alliance makes its demands through its leaders. It is not our intention to oppose languages of other nationalities, but we demand respect for our own because there are considerable numbers of our people in Chicago.</p>
