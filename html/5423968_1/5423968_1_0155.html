   <p>A few boys from a public school, located in the 12th ward, came to the parochial school of St. Stanislaus and accosted the boys attending this school. When Rev. Father D. came out to chase them away, they ran a short distance and then turned around and cursed him.</p>
   <p>Father D., hurt at this bad attitude of the boys from a public school, paid a visit to the school principal. The principal, astonished at this news, sent for the boys; when all the guilty boys were in his office he asked them: "Why did you do this, boys?" The boys answered, "For fun; we wanted to tease the boys and start an argument."</p>
   <p>The principal, after hearing their story, could not see the "fun" in such action. He immediately sent the boys home.... suspended until their parents came to school with them.</p>
   <p>The principal thanked Rev. Father D. for taking the time to inform him of his school children's sudden bad behavior. He also said: "I cannot understand why they did it; they are Catholics and attend church every Sunday."</p>
