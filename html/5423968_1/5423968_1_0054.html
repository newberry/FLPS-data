   <p>In a few days the schools will open. Our youth of both sexes, refreshed by the rest during their summer vacation, will fill our institutions of learning and science in order to continue their studies and absorb as much knowledge as possible so necessary for their lives.</p>
   <p>Many parents do not endeavor or care to send their children to high school. Our newcomers have been also infected with "gold fever," or the love for the dollar. Being shortsighted, they do not look into the future of their children; neither do they estimate the harm done to their offspring by sending them to work prematurely. They waste their talents and abilities. They do not realize that hard physical work is injurious to their young bodies, ruining their strength.</p>
   <p>Poles have such a small number of men occupying high positions, although our immigration dates back more than fifty years and our number is quite <span class="page-break">2</span>large. In comparison to the Jewish immigration that is later and smaller than ours in the United States, how does our immigration stand in a higher education? Let us be frank and admit that it is very poor.</p>
   <p>Whoever happened to attend a graduation at a high school or any other institution of higher learning in a large city where the population is mixed or whoever read a graduation list from such locality must have noticed how small and insignificant was the number of Polish graduates from high schools alone, and how much smaller must be the number of graduates from still higher institutions, such as colleges and universities, recruited from Polish immigration.</p>
   <p>Mothers and fathers! Fulfill your great, important and sacred duty giving our Polish generation a higher education. You know how much hardship and humiliation you had to suffer, working hard for the support of your families, with and among other races. Save your children from that.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Learning and knowledge is what your children need; what they will have learned "neither water shall take away nor fire shall burn," is the old saying. The young generation of Polish immigration should get as much education as possible, receiving laurels in the fields of learning, art and science. Its spirit, strengthened by our regained political freedom, should soar to great heights. Our generation should become famous and, due to its work and learning, should receive a proper place in a nation composed of all nationalities.</p>
   <p>We should always remember that through education we gained our freedom, but to keep that freedom and place the Polish nation at the height of glory and power, it is necessary to continue that education and spread it wider and wider, educating and enlightening larger and larger masses. Then we shall gain the proper recognition from other nations now looking down on us.</p>
