   <p>The Poles and their customs are strange to the average American. But deep in the background lurks a story that many an American would eagerly hear. The story is as quaint as folklore, vibrant with national pride, and colorful as the dance of the Poles. These Polish dances, whimsical affairs of gaiety, the pleasant Mazurka, the delightful Oberek and the rythmic Krakowiak, reveal the surging and spontaneous joy that is the heritage of every Pole. And in time of trouble, when the clouds on the horizon appeared black and ominous, when enemies everywhere threatened Poland, they sought the consolation of God, in whom they have implicit faith, and the courage of their leaders, who they believed were Heaven's gift.</p>
   <p>The story of a nation is its culture; this story of a nation practically unknown to the average American, will be presented by the Polish group in the International Students Club tonight at 7 P.M. in the Leon Mandel Hall, at the University of Chicago. A group program has been arranged so that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>American public may have a concise view of Polish culture and tradition. The proceeds of this night will go toward the fund of the Living Memorial or the Kosciuszko foundation.</p>
