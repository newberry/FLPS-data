<p>Life of our colony in Chicago is getting into a new tempo. The cause of
this is that our new Slovenian Hall has been opened. Very soon this hall
will become a real center of our colony, where friends and relatives
will meet. This hall is located on the second floor of our St. Stephano's
church building. Its modern premises offer excellent surroundings for
social meetings. The hall is big enough to accommodate nearly 1,500 persons
and is always filled to the limit whenever some colonial gathering occurs.
In the basement of this building we can find two bowling alleys, where
hundreds of young and old people find enjoyment every evening, but especially 
on Sundays. All seats are occupied by the spectators. The church
treasury found an excellent source of steady income from this enterprise.
Next to the bowling room there is a pool room with a few brand new pool
tables. Our young people find there a good place to amuse themselves
under the guidance of clergyman. The parents do not have to worry about
their children's conduct as long as they are closely watched by our
priests.</p>

<p>Children must have amusement and if they do not have it at home, they
will soon be looking for it in some other places, where we never know
that may happen to them. This very important problem in the way of
protecting our children's morals is solved entirely by the opening of
our hall, vhich provides wholesoma entertainments under the watchful
eyes of the priest and his assistants. We can say that St. Stephan's
Hall is really a blessing for the old and young in our colony.
