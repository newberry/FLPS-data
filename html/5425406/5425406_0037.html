<p>We all know well that without our support the Slovene Catholic schools
cannot exist. We do not need to tell you, people, here that our schools
in Chicago badly need our support, and that it is our duty to extend a
helping hand.</p>
<p>Therefore we invite you all to come next Saturday to a Catholic carnival,
where we will double our joy by entertainment and by enlisting in the
lives of benefactors of our schools.</p>
