      <p>The Central Committee of the Slovenian Republican Organization (Slovenian Republican 
Zveza) sent the following telegram to President Wilson:</p>
      <p>United States President, Woodrow Wilson</p>
      <p>Paris, France.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian Republican Alliance, representing an overwhelming majority of Slovenes 
in America, who faithfully followed your standard and have with untold sacrifice 
supported your principles, appeal to you at the request of hundreds of Slovenian 
societies for protection of the Jugoslav rights at the peace conference.</p>
      <p>To hand over visibly Slovene and Croatian regions to a foreign rule would mean a
painful injustice and great danger for the future. Jugoslavs, who admire your
democratic consistency, believe in you and appeal in this critical hour for justice.
Exceedingly grateful to you for everything you have done for the rights of nations,
and with the fact in mind that million of eyes are cast upon you, we, the Jugoslavs
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
beg you not to forget them in this hour of determination.</p>
      <p>Ethin Kristan, Chairman</p>
      <p>A. J. Terbovec, Secretary</p>
      <p>Monsieur Clemenceau</p>
      <p>President de la Conference</p>
      <p>Du Paix,</p>
      <p>Paris. France.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian Republican Alliance, representing an overwhelming majority of Slovenes 
living in America, who have at all times truly and with great sacrifices
supported the cause of democracy, appeal at the request of hundreds of organizations 
to the peace conference for the consideration of the Jugoslav rights with
justice.</p>
      <p>To yield regions inhabited by a visibly Jugoslav population to a foreign government 
would hew into the Jugoslavs a burning wound and establish great danger for
the future. In the name of democracy, in the name of peace, and in the name of
liberty, brotherhood, and equality, we beg of you, justice.</p>
      <p>Ethin Kristan, Chairman</p>
      <p>A. J. Terbovec, Secretary</p>
