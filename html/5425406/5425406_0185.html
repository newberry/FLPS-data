<p>The Jugoslav Socialist Federation and its official publication, Proletarec, 
the Educational Bureau of the Federation, the American Family
Almanac (Druzinski Koledar), the May Herald and the Home of the
Federation, the Slovene Labor Center.</p>
<p>We cannot escape the fact that the old generation of Slovenes will not
be with us forever, but their work, the institutions they built, are
with us to stay and are today facing a brighter future than ever.</p>
<p>The new generation of American-born Slovenes is gradually stepping
into the work which has up to the present time been carried on by
the old pioneers in the Socialist movement. This change, because of its
very nature, is bound to be slow at first, but as the young comrades
are gradually drawn into the movement and begin to take up the work
<span class="page-break">2</span>
and responsibility connected with it, interest will develop at a faster
tempo than it has up to the present time.</p>
<p>The record back of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation is one of which
we can feel justly proud. The official organ of the Federation, Proletarec, 
has survived all the storms of the last thirty-three years,
many of which were terrific ones, and is today carrying on nobly. The
English section of Proletarec is open to our youth and is gradually
becoming more and more interesting as new contributors are being
added to the list. The rapid tempo with which changes are taking place
today among the working masses gives us hundreds of new topics to
discuss and we should do so through our publication and in that way
make it interesting enough to be able to attract new subscribers from
the ranks of the youth.</p>
<span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>The Educational Bureau of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation has, according 
to its secretary's report for the last year, more units affiliated
with it than ever before in the history of the Bureau.</p>
<p>New material is being constantly added to the bureau's files, more and
more calls for plays, declamations, etc. are being efficiently and
satisfactorily handled from month to month, and the future for the
Educational Bureau looks bright and prosperous. The Bureau, with its
fine and large collection of material, is today in a position whereby
it is able to be of great service to its affiliated units. Fraternal
and cultural organizations throughout the country are beginning to
realize this and new organizations are being added to the membership
list right along. English speaking units affiliated with the Bureau

will soon be furnished with a complete new list, which is now being
<span class="page-break">4</span>

compiled of all the English material in the files of the Bureau.</p>
<p>Our annual publication, the May Herald, dedicated to labor's international holiday, 
May Day, is being improved and enlarged from year to

year, this issue being one of which we are all proud and one which should

enjoy a large circulation.</p>
<p>The American Family Almanac, (Druzinski Koledar), is in its twenty-third

year with the 1937 issue. The contents and general make-up of the

Almanac have been improved with each issue and the circulation records

show that its list of readers is growing constantly. The research work

and gathering and publishing of statistics by its editor, dealing with

Slovenes and their activities in America, have made the Almanac a

valuable reference book much in demand by libraries and people doing

research work throughout the country.</p>
<p>The most recent and probably the best accomplishment of our Federation

<span class="page-break">5</span>

was the purchase, a few years ago, of the building which is now known

as the Slovene Labor Center, or the Center, as it is known among the

Chicago Slovenes. The business office of Proletarec is located in

the building, as is the Proletarec Library and book shop. The Slovene

social Center Club, which has about three hundred members, is also

located at the Center. The building is located in a residential section,

away from the hustle and bustle of the city's traffic and industry, and

is the meeting place of all Jugoslav Socialist Federation members in

Chicago and of the out-of-town visitors. It is the Slovene Labor

Center in the full sense of the word.</p>
<p>Our movement has a home which can be called its own and of which we 

can all feel justly proud.</p>
<p>The biggest and most important problems before the Federation today
<span class="page-break">6</span>

are: First, to increase our membership; this increase will have to come

from the ranks of youth; and second, to build up the circulation of our

official organ, Proletarec. The field in which we will have to do most

of our work is in and among the labor unions.</p>
<p>The most vital movement on the American scene today is the giant stirring 
of the workers in the basic industries. To guide this gigantic

force into really progressive channels among our people is the most

immediate task before the members of our Federation and its sympathizers.</p>
