 
<p>In the year 1916 the Lira Singing Society was organized on the West Fide of
Chicago, in the Slovene community which has its center at Cermak Road and
Lincoln Street, as the Tamburica Society, taking its name from the popular
Jugo-Slav instrument. The organizers were William Prijatel and John Weble.
The club grew so rapidly that in a very short time it had eighty members.
At that time it had a number of sponsoring members, and so it was decided
that it was strong enough to add a singing group to the original instrumental 
group. The name of the club was changed, and it became the Lira Slovenian 
Singing and Tamburica Society.</p>
<p>Its object was to promote Slovene singing and Slovene instrumental music.
The following persons were its officers at the time of its organization:
John Weble, president, Adolph Misja, secretary, and Jack Muha, treasurer.</p>
<p>The singing group was under the direction of Mr. Muha, while Mr. Weble directed 
the tamburica-players. At this time both divisions advanced steadily, 
and the concerts which they gave were successful because the Lira was
then the only Slovene singing and tamburica society in Chicago.</p><span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>Since the World War had taken many of its members, the organization dropped
the tamburica division and continued as a singing society only. At present
the Lira Society has twenty active members, including three who have been
with the organization since the beginning, namely, Mrs. Lollie Nemanich,
Mr. John Weble. and Mr. Frank Kordesh. The Society for the last six years
has been without the financial aid of any sponsoring members and continues
to maintain itself by giving concerts once or twice a year. In its repertoire 
are selections from various operas and operettas, such as Martha, The
Minuet, Il Trovatore, and Madame Butterfly, and also many artistic Slovene
songs which had never before been introduced in Chicago.</p>
<p>The fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Lira Society was celebrated 
on Sunday, April 3, 1932, by a concert in which some other Jugo-Slav
singing societies participated, among them two Slovene organizations, the
Adrija and the Preseren, and one Croatian club, the Croatia. On various
other occasions the Lira has cooperated with other Slavic singing societies.</p>
<p>In the period of its existence the Lira Singing Society has had the following 
directors: Mr. Jack Muha, Mr. Arno M. Hess, Mr. Kindl, Mr. F. Kvederas,
and Mr. Gabriel Chrzanowski. who has been our instructor since 1926.</p>
