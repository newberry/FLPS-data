      <p>November 14th is marked in memory of our people in Chicago as a night
of excellent entertainment. Our society No. 16, D. S. D., gave a 
dramatic play, "Sin," with the well known cast from the Catholic Dramatic 
Club. Despite the very poor employment situation which prevails
among our people, the premises were filled up to the last inch and
tickets were practically all sold.</p>
      <p>After the dramatic performance young and old joined in dancing, which
continued up to the early hours of the morning.</p>
