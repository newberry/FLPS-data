      <p>The Jugoslav Socialist club No. 1 in Chicago has shown its educational
activity during the winter of this year by organizing a few very interesting
lectures, one of which is on the subject, "Socialism". This lecture proved
how little our people knew about Socialism, and how badly they need to be
educated in Social Science.</p>
