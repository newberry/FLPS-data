<p>At the regular meeting of the Central Commitee of the Slovenian Republican Organization 
it has been decided to organize a subscription and collect donations
for a Million Dollar Fund, with which our people can be freed from the Italian
annexation. The figure of a million dollars may sound enormous and alarming, but
after all. It is worth the cause we are fighting for; and if we can judge from
the number of sympathizers, we believe the figure will be easily attained.</p>
<p>The following emblems will be distributed among subscribers:
Five dollars will have an emblem bearing the initials S. R. Z.
From five dollars to ten dollars, a similar emblem witn one star.
From ten to twenty-five dollars, an emblem with two stars.
From twenty-five to fifty dollars, an emblem with three stars.</p>
<p>Artistic Diplomas will also be awarded to those who will subscribe from twenty-
five to fifty dollars.</p>
