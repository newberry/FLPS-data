      <p>In last week's issue, readers of Amerikanski Slovenec can notice a very
important announcement regarding a new citizenship school to be opened
very soon in South Chicago. The organizing committee invites all Slovenian 
women and men in our colony to be present at the meeting, October
18, where plans for opening this school will be discussed. The main
object of this long needed school is to educate people in ways and means
of becoming citizens of this country.</p>
      <p>A great number of articles have been printed dealing with the important
question of becoming citizens. Sincere and sensible advice has been passed
on how to take part in political life in this country, but still the fact
remains that our people are the most ignorant people of this country so
far as politics are concerned. They accept bills, taxes, assessments, 
etc., without questioning their rightfulness or the size of their bills.
They will be more careful if they had their citizenship and political
education.</p>
