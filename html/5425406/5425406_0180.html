<p>The best answer we can offer to Slovenian National Benefit Society with
regard to the accusation that our organization is progressing slowly,
is the recent statistic. Our organization, as it can be found in the last
financial report, has a capital of $1,535,000, which divided on 30,000
widow members that are being cared for by our society, will give 9. sum
of $51.16 to each member, as benefit. Now, the official organ of SNPJ,
in its last report shows that the benefit for a member amounts to only
$42.46.</p>
<p>Another part in SNPJ's Ô¨Ånancial report shows that the organization's
capitalization is valued $42.46 per member, whereas our valuation shows
$51.16 per member.</p>
<p>With this information we are offering to the people of the Slovenian
nation the right my to find out whether there exist any ground for the
above mentioned accusation. It seems to us that the people from SNPJ
lost all sense of right judgment.</p>
