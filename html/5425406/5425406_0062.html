<p>Although it is impossible to forget, we can and should disregard our
diversified folly during the entire lifetime of the modern Socialist
movement throughout the world. By "disregard" I mean that we should
let bygones be bygones except for what we can learn from them, and
throw overboard all grudges we have accumulated against each other
during all these years in factional battles under different realms,
while believing fundamentally, practically in the same principles as
to what must be our future social order, to render equality, justice
and international tranquillity to all mankind.
The main economic question is to change from private ownership of
natural and produced wealth to Socialism, under such regulations
that everyone from twenty to sixty years of age who is able-bodied
and willing to work will have a position with enough earnings to
be able to acquire all the necessities of life, and the government
will take care of the disabled, sick, minors and the old and provide
<span class="page-break">2</span>
them with sufficient income to be able to enjoy life.</p>
<p>The machinery of production and transportation is at present so highly
developed that if properly applied to relieve the physical work of man,
a workday to produce the necessities of life would be only three or
four hours long.</p>
<p>Since nothing is impossible, this will come in due time. But what will
the world do with it if it retains the present social order? Unemployment, 
comparing our present state of things to the future highly
developed mechanism when man's physical endeavor will be spared, even
button pressing will be replaced by telepathy, would increase to at
least ninety per cent of the entire population of the globe. That would
create unbespeakable starvation on one side, and a wild search for
markets by private capitalists on the other.</p>
<p>Consequently, all capitalistic countries would be constantly engaged
<span class="page-break">3</span>
in hostile international strife; war after war would be declared by
masters to conquer new world markets, and all the fighting would be
done by the economically enslaved people that have nothing to fight
for. To escape such tragedy we must take in due time proper steps
to eliminate all causes for international hate by expropriation of

political power and economic wealth, and then establish the new social

order of justice, peace and universal tranquillity. Thinking about

this I distinctly remember what our late comrade, E. V. Debs, in

a fiery speech in Chicago after his release from a federal prison

bluntly and defiantly declared: "I wouldn't go to a capitalistic

war at the point of a bayonet!"</p>
<p>Let that be well remembered by our younger generation. Fratricide

in our schismatic political struggles is the worst curse we can

indulge in in our organizational endeavor to unify mental and physical workers of the world.</p>
<p>Let us discard this in favor of a new and more plausible motto: "With

<span class="page-break">4</span>

malice toward none who believe in our fuudamental principles of socialization and equal distribution of national income." In unifying the

working class we will be inconceivably more successful through fraternal

tolerance than we have been heretofore by our condemnable schismatic

quarreling in factional divisions, trying to impose on each other our

different petty opinions that should not, and in fact do not, change

the basic idea of the whole economic scheme on which the entire new

social order will be built.</p>
<p>Spread this doctrine by press and spoken word throughout the land,

build up our newspapers and local organizations, and we will have

a unified international, fighting, political organization.</p>
<p>Let us dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to support the Socialist

ideals till our battle is won for all humanity. Let us shorten the

distance between now and the dawn of our emancipation by united action.</p>
<span class="page-break">5</span>

<p>Crush private capitalism and establish a new social order; this is

our most pertinent task to accomplish during our lives.</p>
