      <p>Last Sunday our young singing society ‘Adria’ gave a very successful concert 
with dance. On this occasion we noticed that our people got more and 
more interested in that kind of entertainment. Many times we have called
our public to support morally and financially our cultural institutions,
and this call goes especially for the support of the singing society
"Adria," which in the short period of its existence already brought joy
and happiness in the life of our colony.</p>
      <p>Our sincere thanks to all leaders and members
of this organization.</p>
