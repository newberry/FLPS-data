<p>Last Sunday, the 20th of September, should live a long time in our memory.
In that day our South Chicago was the place where the Slovenes' Catholic
conference held its inauguration. Thousands of members and friends of our
Catholic organizations came here and brought other thousands of their
relatives with them to be present and witness this great celebration. Such
or similar occasions, when people of our race gather together, is of great
importanoce to our life in this country. Long time friends, missing for
years or living apart in different places of America, found great joy in
seeing each other. Valuable for their existence informations concerning
working conditions, customs, etc., have been exchanged. New acquaintances
and friendships have been developed. This occasion manifests our strong
desire for unity and has been marked by colorful celebrations which will
be remembered for a long time.</p>
