<p>May the 6th was a memorable day for members of the society "Knights of
St. Florian." On this day this oldest society in America celebrated its
35th anniversary.</p>
<p>Due to the wide influence of this society, the celebration turned to be
a mass meeting of thousands of members, sympathizers and other Slovenians
from Chicago and vicinity. We must admit that the celebration was a brilliant 
affair in our colony.</p>
<p>The banquet, with a selected menu, was beyond our expectation; the artistic
program of the singing society "Sarja"; recital, given by the young members
of this society and interesting speeches dealing with the colorful history
of this society. We are not writing history and therefore, in this article
we will omit details of the Society's activities during the period of 35
years; even if we felt that it would be of great benefit to our new generation 
to learn how to work and create glory for our nationality.</p>
