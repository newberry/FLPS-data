<p>Our colony in Chicago is growing very fast. Reason for this is increasing
industrial activity. Daily we see some new faces.</p>
<p>Since we built a new church hall, every week some new entertainment is
offered to people of our colony. Singing societies, dramatic clubs, etc.,
are giving weekly performances with choices of programs. This hall
proved to be the best place to meet friends and relatives. It can
easily accommodate over 1,500 persons.</p>
<p>The opening of this modern hall is really a convincing fact of how
badly we needed such premises. In the basement of the hall we have
two bowling alleys and every evening you can find hundreds of people
watching the play. The church has a pretty good income from this
enterprise. In the room close to the bowling alleys we find a pool
table, which also serves as a means for additional income to the
church.

Due to the improvement in working conditions we notice great building
and remodeling activities; new beautiful homes built by our people;
old ones are remodeled to such an extent that you hardly can recognize
them; new furniture is bought, and we see that our people are getting
the best from civilized life, to which they hardly have been accustomed
before their arrival in this country.</p>
