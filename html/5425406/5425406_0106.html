      <p>Slovenian Republican Organization in Chicago is setting the stage for a concert
and dance, to be held at 1709-15 S. Ashland Avenue, near 18th Street, Jan. 27.</p>
      <p>The program for entertainuent is varied and interesting, and we hope that our
Slovenian people in Chicago and vicinity, who sympathize with Republican ideals,
will be present. Slovenians must show their solidarity in fight for social and
economic order in this land.</p>
      <p>Interest in the Republican Organization and its future is established by the fact,
that in a very short time after the Republican Organization opened a branch in
Chicago, we had over 800 members, with practically all Slovenian societies participating 
in the work of soliciting members. We are proud to announce the fact
that fifteen Slovenian societies have signed for membership of the Republican organization.</p>
