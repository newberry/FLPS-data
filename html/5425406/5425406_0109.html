      <p>After receipt of the warrant for the arrest of M. Sullivan issued by Judge Horner,
the sheriff's office went on the trail of the former Clerk of the Probate Court in
Chicago.</p>
      <p>The sheriff is anxious to ask M. Sullivan a few questions concerning the disappearance 
of just $60,000 from the fund for orphaned children.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sullivan has been Clerk of this Court for the past seventeen years, and the
shortage was discovered recently, after the accounts had been audited.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sullivan was given a considerable length of time to cover the shortage, but
failed to do so and the warrant was sworn for his imprisonment; but all efforts to
find him have failed and so the $60,000 is gone.</p>
