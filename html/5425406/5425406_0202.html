      <p>The greatest right of every citizen of this democratic country is the
vote. We are sorry to state that the majority of our people do not recognize 
the value of this right and fail to exercise this most important
duty. The result of this failure is political mischief. The public pays
a heavy penalty having the wrong kind or politicians and by lack of
understanding how important it is to vote. A great number of our Slovenians 
used to say, "I do not care for politics." This attitude is entirely
wrong and should be changed by political education.</p>
      <p>People cannot have the right kind of goverment and cannot govern themselves
unless they take part in electing their political leaders, which in this
country oan be accomplished only by a majority vote. Political influence
is so important in the life of every citizen that it is a crime to neglect
the duty of controling this widespread influence. We strongly advice our
people to get away from political lethargy and fully exercise their first
and chief duty as American citizens by voting.</p>
