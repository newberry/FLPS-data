<p>We recommend to Slovenian workers the newspaper Delavska Slovenija (The
Working Slovenia), which is the property of the Jugoslav Cultural Club
of Milwaukee. The address is: Delavska Slovenija, 383 First Avenue,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Subscription $2.50 per year.</p>
<p>Today that is the only Slovenian paper in the hands of Slovenian workers,
which will represent the interests of the workinj class in the spirit of
our times.</p>
<p>We call on Croatian and Serbian workers to recommend said paper to Slovenian 
workers, wherever they meet them. With this paper Slovenians have
filled a gap which existed for a long time, not having a paper for
Slovenian workers.</p>
