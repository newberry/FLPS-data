<p>At last we got good news that our hope came true, our Community House is
almost ready to be open. We all know the great importance of having such
a house. Our children will have airy rooms to play in; we will enjoy
meetings with our friends; and at this house we will attend performances
of our musical, singing and dramatic societies.</p>
<p>It is really a surprising fact that so many of our people cannot realize
the priceless value of such enterprise and are refusing to subscribe to
the Building Fund. We cannot improve our life unless we will readily donate
for the educational organizations.</p>
