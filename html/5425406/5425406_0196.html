      <p>Often we glance back into the early days of childhood, dreaming of
how we used to run about as free as the air. Comparing those never-to-be-forgotten 
days with the present, we say to ourselves, What
a change! For well do we remember the old Slovene settlement at
Twenty-second and Wood streets, when that settlement was in its prime,
when the industries were flourishing in the car shops, the lumber
yards, etc. The noon factory whistles would blow and a mass of 
humanity would dash across Blue Island avenue into their favored
places with a pail called ‘pint.’ Today the noon whistles still
blow, but not nearly as many humans scamper across the street; the
stores of the avenue look deserted.</p>
      <p>What a change in so short a time! Of course, the war came and out
of the war many hardships. Many disabled boys, many new millionaires
and a period of depression. That hit our people hard, no doubt.</p>
      <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
      <p>Yes, new machinery, too, has been invented displacing men. Many
have moved to the west of the city; some to the north, others to
the south. Yet, the flow of Slovenes from other cities and places
in the most part from the mining districts, has refilled the
territory. As one leaves another comes.</p>
      <p>Fifteen to twenty years is a long period of time, too. Within such
a period much can be accomplished. But it is regrettable that the
Slovenes in this vast metropolis have nothing outstanding to which
one might point with pride. They have fostered fraternal societies, 
a church and church hall. Outside of a few small business undertakings, 
we have little to show.</p>
      <p>Our people have not been interested in politics, although they are
becoming more conscious politically each year. Those that did participate 
in politics, for the most part always favored the Democratic
and Republican administrations. Each year taxes would rise, jobs
<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
would be fewer and harder to secure. Living necessities do not balance
with the meager pay envelopes. So we struggle along just barely
making both ends meet. Yet, our Slovene race as a whole is a progressive 
race. However, when you scrutinize their achievements, we
are outspoken. We have no big DOM to which we might point with
pride; no large business establishments; no cooperatives. Perhaps
we did not need them as bad as other large Slovene settlements.
It is because we have too many factions and let jealousy control
our progress. Or is it because we always leave it to the other
fellow to do the work? Whatever it may be, the fact remains that
much more could be accomplished if the slogan of cooperation was

inbedded in the mind and heart of our people.</p>
      <p>Isn't it a fact that jealousy has been responsible for so small

a degree of success? Time and again folks would tell us about our

fraternal life; about the friction caused by mere jealousy - and

the organization of a new order wherein the years following. They

had witnessed the same jealousy segregate subordinate groups. The
<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

same jealousy retards the growth of any group and ours is no exception.</p>
      <p>Chicago has had a Slovene Socialist Club for a long time. During all

these years and especially in the past fifteen years cultural work

has been progressing at very slow rate. But a large percentage of 

what has been done in this field can be attributed to the efforts

of the Socialist club. The club just naturally tackled the work and

knowing the responsibility of such action, it marched along as best

it could under our conditions. Plays of all descriptions have been

produced, lectures on vital questions are held at frequent intervals, 
literature of all kinds is distributed, devotees of music

and song display their wares with the club's choir.</p>
      <p>Young friends, if you are at all active, or wish to become so, there

is no better time than now to join the ranks of active Socialist

workers. There is no need for you to remain outside of our ranks

any longer and pass away the fleeting years in the mere satisfaction

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

of doing only what you must. Think of being able to help others.

You will find more satisfaction in that. Your ability and your

earnestness is wasted unless you give the world the best you

possess. We would like to see you learn more about the economical

conditions which have so much bearing on your environment.</p>
      <p>It is possible to do more in the next fifteen years than in the

last fifteen. We believe so. We believe there are at least three

hundred Slovenes in Chicago who should rightfully be attached to

the Socialist club. It is possible with proper judgment and unity

to do something to which you can point with pride and satisfaction

in years to come.</p>
