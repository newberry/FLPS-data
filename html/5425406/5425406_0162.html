<p>The Jugoslav Socialist Club No. 1 in Chicago has shown its educational activity
during the winter of this year, by organizing a few very interesting lectures, one
of which is on the subject, "Socialism". This lecture proved how little our people
know about Socialism, and how badly they need to be educated in Social Science.</p>
