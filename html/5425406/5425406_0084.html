<p>The armistice between capitalists and workers did not last very long. The
short-lived peace came to an end. Strongly organized capitalism declared
war on the hard working class. which is trying to make an honest living.
This time capitalists found it necessary to put high pressure on the
miners‘ union, and in all probability the capitalists will win again.
The disorganized working class will hardly resist the underground diplomatic
work of capitalists who do the best to employ the brightest brains
in order to smash the workers‘ fully justified resistance and their fight
for honest existence.</p>
<p>In this war a capitalist never overlooks even the dirtiest means to conquer the working class. The capitalist feel perfectly happy when they keep
miners underground, where day is turned into night.</p>
<p>It is time for the workers to realize the priceless value of workers‘ unity
and solid organization, if they want to become winners instead of being

always the losers.</p>
<p>Working conditions in all branches of industrial life, especially in the
mining industry, is getting worse, and almost unbearable. Something has
to be done, and this something, in our honest opinion, is the campaign
for unionization with strong support from the workers. Workers also must
appeal to the government to stop giving support to capitalists.</p>
