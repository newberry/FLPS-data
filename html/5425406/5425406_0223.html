      <p>Following an invitation from the president of K. S. K., Mr. Anton Grdina,
thousands of our people in Chicago came to hear speakers on the 18th of
January, 1926. The general purpose of this call was to send a protest
against the injustice done in Jugoslavia to our people in Slovenia. A committee 
to collect means to help our people in the old country has been
formed from distinguished members of this colony.</p>
      <p>In this noble action our Slovenian women's organizations show great success, 
by organizing all kinds of entertainments and contributing large
sums of money to support the above mentioned action. Last Sunday our
Slovenian Women's Benefit Society held its annual carnival, which is
already pronounced a great success from moral and material standpoints.</p>
      <p>Such attitude toward problems of our needy people deserves high praise
and encouragement. We people of Slovenian extraction, must help each
other if we want to survive the hard times.</p>
