<p>At its last meeting, the Slovenian Socialist Club, in Chicago, drew up
the by-laws and regulations for the Slovenian Socialist Federation in
America, and asked that these by-laws be published in Proletarec for
the purpose of public acceptance. All comments pertaining to any

age, and who recognizes the socialist teachings, will be gladly accepted
as a member of this Federation. All members, active or inactive, of any
socialist lodge in America automatically become members of this Federation and may exercise their rights to vote.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>PURPOSES</p>
<p>Purpose of this Federation is to spread socialist propaganda 
either in writing or in speech, and to spread socialist doctrines in
America and Jugoslavia.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill these purposes, the Federation will organize
lectures, and will print books, leaflets, pamphlets, newspapers, etc.</p>
<p>BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p>
<p>All affairs of the Federation will be supervised by the board of
directors, which will consist of three branches: administration,

controller branch, will be supervised by three members.</p>

<p>ELECTION</p>
<p>In December of each year the Federation will hold an election for a new
board of supervisors. For this election our first secretary will send
a printed ballot to all clubs in America. On distributed ballots,
will be printed the names of candidates. Because each club has its own
election rights it is permitted to elect its own candidate. In such an
instance the name of the candidate printed on the ballot can be scratched
out and the candidate desired by the club may be substituted.</p>
<p>The final decision in the election will depend on the majority of ballots
received by the substituted candidate.</p>
<p>In case of a tie in votes, a new election will be ordered.</p>
<p>All ballots received after the month of December will be valid.</p>
<p>Any changes desired pertaining to the election regulations must be
not later than the month of November.</p><span class="page-break">4</span>
