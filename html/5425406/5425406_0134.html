      <p>We say it is news! Our newly organized Slovenian Catholic Dramatic Club
gave us its first performance, and it was good! For a long time we did
not have such opportunity to enjoy our native plays and hear our songs
sung and we left the premises with a feeling that we spent a few delightful 
hours in our dear old country.</p>
      <p>This performance brought us so close together that even our deadly enemies 
forgot their bad feelings. We felt that we were brothers and belonged
to the same race and nation.</p>
