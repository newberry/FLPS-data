<p>Slovenes, like other Slavic nations, love and admire good music, vocal and instrumental. 
They love to sing on every occasion - at picnics, parties, dances, weddings, 
and christenings. This racial characteristic was the potential reason for
the organization of the Slovan Singing Society twenty-nine years ago (1905) in 
South Chicago. Immigration to the United States was not restricted at that time, 
and thousands of young men and women from the former Austrian provinces of Carniola,
Carinthia, and Lower Styria - all three included in Slovenia - crossed the Atlantic 
in the hope of earning a better living under Uncle Sam than under the Austrian
double eagle. The group settling in South Chicago and the near-by Pullman district
lost no time in organizing their fraternal lodges, for America, unlike Europe,
did not provide government insurance against loss by sickness or injury. They
also united to establish singing clubs in the early nineties.</p>

<p>The Slovan Society was the first Slovene club organized with a single object - the
preservation of Slovene song in Chicago. This purpose is still the only motive
that keeps the society in existence as years with their achievements roll by. At
present the Slovan is the oldest Slovene singing society in the United States; like
other societies and clubs, it has had difficulties throughout its long career.
Financial problems, lack of proper instructors, the World War, emigration and
immigration restrictions were some of the obstacles which at times almost ruined
the organization. At present the Slovan has seventy active members, the majority
of them men. Never before in its history has the Society had so large a membership.</p>
<p>Throughout its twenty-nine years of existence the Slovan Society has regularly
given one or more concerts a year; sometimes as a male chorus, sometimes as a mixed
chorus, and as a male chorus at times including both choruses in its program. In
former years dramatic performances also were presented. The Slovan has at all times
maintained friendly relations with other Slovene singing societies, and on many
occasions it has co-operated with Slovene, Croatian, Servian, and German clubs in
giving concerts. The outstanding events in the Society's history were the gala
concert performances on its twentieth and twenty-fifth anniversaries in 1925 and
1930.</p>

<p>An elaborate singing festival is contermolated for the thirtieth anniversary in
1935. The Slovan is the only Slovene singing society on Chicago's greater South
Side. Its present headquarters are in the Calumet Park field house. In the
course of its existence the Slovan has had seven directors, and Mr. Mirko G. Kuhel,

the present director, has wielded the baton for the last nine and a half years.

Mr. Kuhel came to America fourteen years ago. He has been a student at St.

Stanislaus‘ College in Slovenia; he attended high school here and completed two

years of college-work. He was then appointed to an executive position in one of

the Slovene—American fraternal insurance corporations and since that time had very

little leisure for other activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuhel devotes his spare hours to directing the Slovan chorus because of his

love for Slovene song. Since he received his education on both continents, he is

particularly well adapted to give instruction in Slovene music both to immigrants

and to American-born members of the choir. The Society has co-operated heartily

in the movement to organize the United Slavic choral Societies of Chicago, and

sincerely hopes that a permanent association will be founded.</p>
