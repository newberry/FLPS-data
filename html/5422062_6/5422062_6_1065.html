   <p>P. 4 - The Greeks are accused of talking too much. And indeed they do. That is the reason, I presumethat we say, "The Greeks have a word for it". Logos and man are inseparable from the beginning of creation, but the Greeks over-do it. God bless the non-Greek when they have to listen to those prattling tongues of the Greeks. And what do they say? They don't know, because all of them talk and nobody listens.</p>
   <p>Our roving reporter, who covers the social life of the Greek in Chicago, reports that the Chicago Greeks are not so bad but the next thing to it. Greeks in coffee houses, clubs, barber shops, grocery stores, street cars, churches, restaurants and even when they eat, continually talk and talk about the weather, the stock market, politics, the fault of others (not their own, they haven't any) the life hereafter and the possibility of a Greek as a United States president. But their audience as it happens is composed of Greeks and consequently nobody listens to their talk. In symposiums, meetings and what not you hear the humming prattle of the Greeks. They will explode if they don't talk.</p>
   
   <p>The Greeks being descendants of their ancient progenitors unquestionably inherited the rhetoric art of the ancients. In another article we wrote about the rhetoric art of the ancients and why it was taught. It is said that Zeno, the founder of the "Stoa", demanded a double teaching fee from one of his puplis, who in astonishment asked why the double fee? Zeno said simply because I have to teach you two arts: that is, the first, how to use the Logos and become a rhetorician, which I do teach, and second, I have to teach you how to be silent. Wise old Zeno, knew that rhetorics is a difficult art, especially when it is used to effect and impose silence upon others, but he also knew that the wisdom of silence was much more difficult, because through silence we think, concentrate and deliberate.</p>
   <p>Indeed the patron of the ancient Athenian barber shop was right, when the barber ssked him how he wanted to have his hair trimmed; he said: In silence, by Jove!</p>
   <p>Of course, being an impartial reporter, and a broad-minded one, we cannot very well entirely blame the modern Greeks for talking too much, because as we said above, they inherited their talkative inclination from the ancients, who used rhetorics to defeat logic and truth. Poor Greeks (ancient and modern) they have to be accused or blamed for something or other. Anyway, as long as they are praised for many things, at least they can stand a little accusation and condemnation, and take it on the chin, otherwise they might get high-hatted.</p>
   <p>During my visit to Athens I visited the Greek parliament to see the modern Greek Solons and have the opportunity to listen to their rhetorics. Good God! I was ashamed of my preconceived judgement or fixed idea that all the Greeks talk together and nobody listens. It was not true. Because out of 400 Solons I found one listening and the other 399, of course, rhetorizing. By Jupiter, how we dare to accuse all the Greeks? Here is an instance of an exception.....But how foolish we are to expect an apple tree to produce oranges? The modern Greek is a chip off the old block.</p>
   <p>The Trojan war could have been terminated in two or three months. The famous Achaians who were distinguished for bravery and fighting ability, instead of fighting,prattled and quarreled and their logomachy was great. That grieved poor Athena (Minerva) who ever so often merged from Olympus, admonishing the Greeks and singing the hymn of conciliation.</p>
   
   <p>Did they listen? How could they? They all were prattling, disputing and saying the famous "Eis Logous Elthein" (to have a conference).</p>
   <p>This Logocopia or Logomachy was the cause of the Peloponnesian wars that dragged Greece into a civil bloodshed. The barbarians came, and still come to find the Greek talking, disputing, medizing (imitating the Medes) Macedonizing, Venizelizing or anti-Venizelizing (siding for or against Venizelos) etc. The same thing, if not worse, took place at the Byzantium, when the hordes of the barbarians were breaking down the gates of Byzantium, we, the non-fearing God-like Greeks, were debating as to how the Holy Spirit is delivered, by the Father or the Son?.....</p>
   <p>God almighty forgive me. I am afraid that I repeat history. Our enemies conspiring and concentrating explosive fuel to blow us up, and what do we do? Simply rhetorize! Right here in Chicago we begin to lose ground as businesses are being taken away from us by the chain stores, and we as usual talk and talk.</p>
   <p>What can be done with those Greek talkers? There is one and only one hope of salvation. To know, that the best Logos is the one that is not uttered. The ancients, knowing the talkativeness of the race, used to say," Either say good things, or say nothng." The ancient Egyptians erected golden statues in honor of silence.</p>
   
   <p>Today, we, the moderns, say: "Silence is golden." But the best and wise thing, for these modern Greek orators (goodness, gracious they all are), is to imitate the monks of Tsapiston. They abolished Logos entirely, and communicated with signs.</p>
   <p>The new and modern Greeks will do well if they have a conference and decide to adopt the method of the monks, and undoubtedly they will communicate better than they do now, providing clubs, canes, pistols and other battling instruments of the modern Greek rhetoricians, are taboo.</p>
   <p>Good Lord, I overdid it in accusing the modern Greeks, at least our Chicago Greeks are not like that.</p>
