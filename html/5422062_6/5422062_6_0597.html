   <p>During the general session of the Tegean Society in January, it was decided to raise funds for the purpose of building a memorial to the Tegean heroes, who had fallen during the wars from 1912-1919.....The committee hopes that all Tegeans (natives of a small town in Greece), will contribute to the fund, in order that a worthy memorial can be erected in Greece. These heroic men had shed their blood for the sake of their mother country, and it is only fitting that the memorial should be in keeping with the magnitude of their sacrifice.</p>
   <p>It should bring to the heart of any one who looks upon it, a realization of the suffering and bravery of those men, who died to free their enslaved brothers, and to add to their country's glory.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the drive consists of....G. Giokaris, Christ Stasinopoulos and others.</p>
   <p>Honor Tegea and your country by helping this worthy cause.</p>
