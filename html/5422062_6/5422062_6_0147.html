   <p>p. 5.- Over a year ago, the Tripolitans established an organization which they called "Theodoros Kolokotronis." It has enabled the Tripolitans to associate with one another and do many things for their country.</p>
   <p>Everyone in Arcadia knows the Evangelistria Hospital in Tripoli. It is the only hospital in a very large community and those in need of medical attention travel from afar to get to it. All Tripoli is proud of this hospital.</p>
   <p>Recently a representative came to Chicago and asked for funds to maintain the hospital. The Tripolitan club immediately donated $700.</p>
   <p>We congratulate them for this generous and patriotic gesture and hope they continue the good work.</p>
