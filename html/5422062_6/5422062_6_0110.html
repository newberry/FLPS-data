   <p>p. 7 The following incident took place in a street car in Athens, Greece. The perpetrator of this disgusting incident was a Greek from America. Whether the Greek from America was really stupid but sincere or whether his act was a deliberate display of uncouthness and ignorance the Greek from America should not be excused for such conduct. It got him nowhere and it certainly reflected on the rest of the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>For the benefit of all of us and especially those who visit Greece, or are compelled to publish this unwise and humiliating episode.</p>
   <p>A Greek from America, gold toothed, wearing a heavy gold chain across his vest and two large gold rings on his left hand, boarded a street car. When the conductor, who was collecting fares, approached him the Greek from America took out his bill-fold and with an ostentatious air, extracted a bill of 5,000 drachmar, equivalent to one thousand dollars American money.</p>

   <p>With a swinging motion of his hand he offered the bill to the astonished conductor. The conductor pleasantly but firmly, informed the Greek from America that it was impossible for him to change such a large bill. The Greek feeling, but not acting, like J. P. Morgan, irritably lectured to the poor conductor, and added a word or two against the thoughtlessness of the street car company for not providing the conductors with plenty of money to accomodate the passengers. He turned and asked a nearby passenger who happened to be a doctor, to do him the favor and change the five thousand drachma bill. The doctor shook his head with a smile of contempt.</p>
   <p>The visiting Greek shoved the bill in to the face of a major, who with a scrutinizing eye informed the audacious stranger, that he did not carry that much money to accomodate rich Greeks from America. The third passenger to be humiliated was a Priest, who gravely counseled the Greek that two blocks away there was a bank for his accomodation.</p>

   <p>The Greek from America was determined to make a scene thereby advertising his ignorance and stupidity. He approached two other prosperous looking passengers and arrogantly said, that it would be a pity and an utter disappointment to him if they were unable to change such a small bill. The first of the two, a native Athenian, ignored the utterance with a gesticulation, meaning "beat it". The second one who also happened to be a Greek from America, was watching with disgust the unbecoming conduct of his fellow-Greek-American and decided, that it was about time, to terminate the farce.</p>
   <p>When at last the displayer of the five thousand bill came near, the other shrewd Greek took out his bill-fold, extracting two bills of one hundred thousand drachmas each, which he had exchanged an hour before at the bank in order to give that sum to his sister as a wedding gift, and in a very audible voice said;" I'm very sorry, the smallest bill I have and always carry is one hundred thousand drachmas. Bills like yours, are cigarette money to me.</p>

   <p>I never bother with such "chicken feed." The native Greeks who were watching the gold-toothed Greek-American with amusement, laughed rather loud and sarcastically, indicating their pleasure for his humiliation. As this was not enough ridicule for the audacious Greek, the conductor requested him to alight at the next stop. He got off the street car very much depressed, and when the other Greek-American a few blocks further, got off the car the Reverend Father was heard whispering prayers for the queer Greek-American who dazzled the eyes and minds of the poor native Greeks with such a display of money. The Greek Priest, being a member of the church, could not permit himself to think other then good, but what the rest of the passengers thought about the Greeks of America is not supposed to be printed. Anyway it was a Greek affair, and the general public ought not to know the details.</p>
