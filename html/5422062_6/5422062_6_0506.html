   <p>The Greek committee recently organized to collect contributions to assist the refugees who have suffered at the hands of Turks in the catastrophe in Asia Minor; the Turks has sent by cable five thousand dollars more to the Greek National Herald, to be forwarded to a committee under the supervision of Admiral Kontouriotes.</p>
   <p>They had already sent five thousand dollars ten days ago; therefore the contributions to date have been ten thousand dollars. Americans have already contributed millions of dollars for the relief of our unfortunate brothers; we Greeks are under even greater obligation to offer financial assistance, according to our means to those who through no fault of their own have suffered and written with their blood this latest page of Greek history.</p>
