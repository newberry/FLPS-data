   <p>p. 3- The dance given last week by the Kosmites' St. Anargyros Society was a success, and the net proceeds were $843.83. The object of the dance was to raise money to decorate the church in their native town of Kosmas, Greece. The Kosmites in Chicago have many times in the past shown their willingness to assist financially the town where they first saw the light. Great sums of money have already been forwarded by them to their birthplace for various causes. They are to be congratulated for their generous contributions.</p>
