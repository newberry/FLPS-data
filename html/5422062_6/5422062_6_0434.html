   <p>Last Sunday the much advertised dance of the Kastritan society St. George took place at the Hyde Park Masonic Temple. Three halls were jammed by the society's members and friends, and many Americans, who participated in the affair.</p>
   <p>The dance began at 3 P.M. and continued until 1 A. M. Refreshments, lunches and Greek pastries and candies were served to the delight of all.</p>
   <p>The affair was given for the purpose of raising money to be sent to their native Kastri, to build a new Gymnasium there.</p>
   <p>A big basket was placed in the center of the hall and the dancers, threw dollars in it, and at intervals a young girl, attired in native costume and a stick in her hand, pushed the money down to make room for more.</p>
   
   <p>The affair was crowned with great success and the Gymnasium will be built.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers, who eulogized the activities of the Kastrites, was Constantine Paleologos who used his masterly command of the Greek language and enthused the participants to fill the basket.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that the Greeks of Chicago and those of other places in America, regardless of their permanent establishment here, do not forget mother Greece but always assist with money and American ideas, and strive to better conditions and methods and the standard of living with up-to-date American ways and means.</p>
