   <p>"One can fool all the people some of the time; some of the people all the time; but not all the people all the time." Lincoln.</p>
   <p>There are some audacious politicians and journalists in Greece who, overlooking decency, truth, and facts, tell us, the Greeks of the United States and Canada, that because we immigrated to America and because we did not fight in Greece, we have no right to express our opinion about national affairs in Greece.</p>
   <p>We answer these charges courageously by saying that we have more right to discuss public affairs in Greece than they imagine. Without self-conceit we say, [albeit] reluctantly, that they should not disrupt our national unity, especially under the existing conditions. On the contrary, they should speak of us with all due respect.</p>
   <p>Some years ago we lived through terrible distress in Greece resulting from general misery, heavy taxation, and family obligations. We were heartsick because of the internal corruption and the mismanagement of foreign and national affairs. By wise management of these affairs, Greece could have developed new commercial and agricultural resources. Because of the [existing] conditions, however, we were forced to immigrate to America. The population was thus reduced by 300,000. In this way, it was possible for our people back home to divide all their income among themselves.</p>
   <p>When we came here, we were hungry, penniless, unable to speak English; we had no local or government guidance. Lionhearted, we plunged into work. By our physical stamina we created a business and social status for ourselves in a period of twenty-five years--this is proof that Greeks can accomplish marvels under good teachers and in a healthy environment.</p>
   
   <p>Our Greek leaders in Greece never bothered to inquire about our progress. Nevertheless, we supported and saved those drones in Greece who are clamoring against us so foolishly.</p>
   <p>We will relate our accomplishments and we seek a public discussion with any person of good faith, so that in the interest of truth, the uninformed may learn what is happening.</p>
   <p>On coming here, we immediately shook off the filth, crudity, shiftlessness, ignorance, deceit, cowardice, and wickedness of the Old World. We embraced a new life, fitted to a civilized community and to present-day conditions. We accepted a life of external and internal cleanliness, order, knowledge, education, experience, industry, sincerity, truthfulness, self-respect, and loyalty. We now eat well, we live comfortably, we behave and think like human beings. Our conversations are calm and sincere, not noisy and boisterous, followed by a show of knives and guns, defamations of persons and families as well as misrepresentation of truth and facts. We have now learned a new language, whereas before we did not even know how to write our name as a result of the inefficiency and worthlessness of the responsible parties in Greece. We have chosen a profession or trade. We have won great social and business experience by avoiding deception and employing truth fearlessly. We are submissive slaves no longer, but proud and self-respecting citizens, defending our honor and reputation. Lastly, by our work and sacrifice, we have become Greece's devoted and beloved children.</p>
   <p>We stress the fact that we are incomparably more patriotic and loyal than many [of those living today in Greece], even though we are seven thousand miles removed and in the midst of a foreign culture. We show our loyalty in the fact that we have preserved our faith and language. Further we attempt to transmit them to our children by building churches and schools, by hiring priests and teachers with our own money and sacrifice! We have married Greek girls in order to preserve the Greek family and the customs and mores of our race. Thus we have made thousands of Greek girls happy by asking for no rich dowries as they do in the fatherland, where the engagement is broken when the dowry is one shirt lacking. In addition, we spend liberally for their arrival here and for their well-being. Both here in Chicago, and elsewhere, we have cheerfully relieved many unfortunate fellow countrymen; we have helped friends and relatives to make a good beginning in [the new] life. We have brought recognition to the Greek name and to our national rights by our many sacrifices. We have fought for the interests of Greece through the American press. We have contributed one artillery battery and one destroyer. We have never ceased helping our country and subject Greek territories with generous contributions.</p>
   <p>We have done all this quietly, without any demands or ostentation, in times of peace. In wartime, during the Turco-Balkan War, we sent about thirty-six thousand well-equipped, well-clad soldiers who brought great relief to their brothers, fighting on the Balkan battlefields. For this purpose, we had organized the soldiers in volunteer corps whose heroic qualities increased the morale of the Greek armies.</p>
   
   <p>During the World War we put about sixty-five thousand men on the field, who were sent to fight for a common cause on the battlefields of France--who did not refuse service as did a few loyal officers of the Royal "slave-market." We were among the first to subscribe to the Liberty Loans, thus increasing Greek prestige. We also subscribed heavily to the loans for the Allied Powers, and through them we helped Greece. During the time when the conferences of Sevres and Neuilly were in session, we defended our national rights at massmeetings and in the press, using political, Congressional, and church influence.</p>
   <p>We are now continuing to spend time and money in the interest of the rights and salvation of our devastated country.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of the United States, which includes Chicago of course, and Canada, must be exclusively credited with: 1) the material comfort of great numbers of families in Greece; 2) the relief of thousands in the homeland from hunger and civil war; 3) the escape of the people from the usurer's hands; 4) the payment of delinquent public and municipal taxes; 5) the increase in the deposits of the Greek banks and the subsequent assistance given to commerce and agriculture; 6) the establishment and operation of transatlantic shipping companies resulting in a flow of money into the country; 7) public improvement and beautifying of villages and small cities; 8) the improvement and increasd cultivation of land; 9) the rise in value of these lands by the export of Greek products to America; 10) the education of the youth of villages and towns; 11) the improvement in the conditions of life generally, and the support and relief of thousands of families over a long period of years.</p>
   <p>This is what the Greek laborers of America have done; yes, these uneducated, manual laborers. Now, may we ask what you, our critics and rulers, our revered and modest leaders, have done?</p>
   <p>In your levity and audacity, do you forbid us, your saviors, supporters, and benefactors who have honored you, to "mix in" and express our opinion on government and national affairs? Have you ever done anything for us, or at least for Greece, in return?</p>
   <p>In an administrative capacity you have shown great neglect. In spite of our protests, you have appointed as your official representatives, the most inefficient public servants that the consular and diplomatic service of Greece ever had, with the possible exception of four able ones. You have swindled us financially by the activities of the syndicate, Panhellenic Union, and the action of Protopapadaki, in cutting the value of paper money. You destroyed the country internally; you betrayed us to such an extent that we cannot face the Americans and other foreigners without shame. With continued national disaster and crime, you have paralyzed our minds and harmed our business. Because of you we are being ridiculed by the foreign and American press. We are rewarded with insults, in spite of our diligence and good conduct. After all this, you forbid us to discuss state and national issues.</p>
   <p>What are your rights and accomplishments as citizens, or what are your great national triumphs? Is it your idleness, civil strife, the massacres caused by foolish and unjust wars; is it the catastrophy that has befallen our soldiers and nationals in Asia Minor, Thrace, and elsewhere, or the indescribable waste of public funds, as a result of which the country is in dire need? We know that it is no triumph to make us abandon every desire to return to the homeland. Perhaps you think that you are superior to us in education, experience, character, and renown. You are unexcelled only in shamelessness and selfishness. What are your accomplishments and your various activities? Do you, by any chance, have more wealth than we have here? Produce your private and public accomplishments to convince us.</p>
   <p>We should be greatly pleased since it is our burning wish, provided you return to us our savings, which we entrusted to you and deposited in your banks. We did this to help you progress; stop bothering us with letters of solicitation in the future.</p>
   <p>Keep the bonds which you issued as a result of cutting the value of paper money in half to yourselves, because we do not want bonds issued by assassins and traitors. Instead, we have the judge's gavel and the scales of justice. These, precisely, are the reasons why we have the right and privilege to become interested in state and national affairs, and we demand that we be represented in the State Council for the common benefit, and for the safety of all.</p>
   <p>You, the people of the homeland, should heed us for your own interest; we are sure that you will ask our help in the near future, but then it may be too late.</p>
   <p>But if you do not do these things--if you do not return our savings--if you do not correct the evils [of your system], then we shall definitely abandon you. We cannot follow your path of destruction because we have a goal and purpose in this world which we must attain and fulfil.</p>
