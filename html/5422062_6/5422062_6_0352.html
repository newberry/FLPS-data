   <p>On the 28th of June, of last year, I was traveling in Algeria, Africa and I read in the Newspaper the declaration of the Dictatorship of Pangalos. I was ready to change and alter my itinerary, and leave Greece out travel route, because the word revolution, for me, means civil war and chaos. A fellow traveler from Athens changed my mind by saying to me, "My dear Greek, from America, the revolutions in Greece is nothing else but an army demonstration. Nothing alters the everyday routine of life in Greece. Such Coup d' etat's take place with so much quietness and perfection, that the coffee sippers and wine imbibers in the Plaza of the Constitution are not disturbed, and have not the slightest idea of anything taking place that is out of the way, even though they see, usually, platoons of soldiers marching up and down the Plaza. That is an every day occurance."</p>
   <p>On the 2nd of July, I read, on the bulletin board of the Greek Parliament, the declaration of the Pangalos Dictatorship. The document was brief and to the point.</p>

   <p>Dictator Pangalos is not from what I have heard everywhere in the Greek Metropolis, a tyrant, a dictator, as we define the word, but is a well trained and disciplined soldier of Greece and is always for Greece. His painstaking endeavors to reconcile the various political leaders for the good of the country, were of no avail. Their personal and individual egotism and interest was above that of Greece. For the good of the country, and against the wishes of politico-demagogues, Pangalos declared the Dictatorship. But he is not an oppressor, he merely does not recognize pro and con Venizelists nor pro and con Constantines or Royalists, etc., but be rest assured that he does recognize all of them as Greeks, and Greeks for Greece.</p>
   <p>Those silly Asses who are delighted to speak against the Dictatorship, if they were sincere could turn around and see how most of the Anglo-Saxon nations are governed, they would see that the leaders of these nations are organs of various dictatorships whose main object is to maintain the power of government. The dictatorships in the Anglo-Saxon countries are so thoroughly and perfectly organized that the masses are accustomed to think, live, work and act in groups and are satisfied to be governed by such Oligarchies, whose chief characteristics are audacity, boldness and incapability.</p>

   <p>Those countries never permit anyone to be titled Dictator. As soon as a nation shows signs of stability and self-reliance and refuses to be dictated to by those so-called democratic Anglo-Saxon countries, these countries begin to preach to their hypnotized masses, that such a nation (which dared to have stability and self-reliance) is an apostate of the family of nations and that its people are about to be enslaved under an abdominable Dictatorship. They remind you of wolf howlers who want to be protected from the sheep.</p>
   <p>"Pangalos, the Dictator, is not a politician, but is a General and a great Statesman. His government does not aim to divide Greece, but on the contrary to unite all factions behind one objective and that objective is that all Greeks must serve Greece."</p>
   <p>During my three months sojourn in Greece, things were running so smoothly and beneficially to all, that Pangalos and his Dictatorship will remain until it has served its purpose.</p>
