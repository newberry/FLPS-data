   <p>A Greek does not exist who will say that he does not love the French people, and that he does not hope for their success in this war. If you ask the Greeks why they like the French so much; you will receive hundreds of different reasons.</p>
   <p>One will say he is for France because of Napoleon. Another studied French in school, or read Victor Hugo. Someone will say he likes France because she was one of the great powers who helped Greece regain her freedom. In other words those answers do everything but explain the basic reason for the strong bond between the French and the Greeks.</p>
   <p>France, as a nation, was the first to fight for equality and social justice. The French were the first European race to say that democratic government, for and by the people, should prevail. The French Revolution marked the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>beginning of Europe's fight against tyranny and oppression. The progress of the twentieth century is greatly due to that event. The characteristics of the French are fine, and the French people are among the best in all of Europe.</p>
   <p>The Frenchman's soul is filled with the desire to aid the suffering, to uplift the fine and useful, to have a sincere, thankful spirit, and to live in peaceful harmony with his neighbor. The refined Frenchman is guided by these desires, and so the French democracy thrives. This democracy has always been sympathetic to the Greek race.</p>
   <p>The French government of this age has been like a spike in the eyes of all tyrants. Humanity can take a lesson from France and mold the future people of the world into more brotherly and just individuals. For this reason, we grieve that some Napoleon does not make his appearance and free the world from "Divine Right" monarchs. Such a one would become the saviour of humanity, because he would be fighting for democracy and social equality.</p>
