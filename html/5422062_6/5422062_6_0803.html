   <p>p. 1.- We are always writing that the Greek societies in America should take more interest in national affairs. The Greeks of America haven't realized yet that their first duty is toward their mother country. It is a disgrace in the eyes of all other nationalities to act indifferently in this crisis.</p>
   <p>We should take lessons from the Americans. They form a small club which expands and becomes stronger as time goes on. At the end of the first year there is considerable gain and much is accomplished.</p>
   <p>With the Greeks, it is different. They start out magnificently--a large membership, large treasury, big ideas, much discussion. At the end of the year most of the members have dropped out; treasury is gone; nothing accomplished. How do we expect to get anywhere acting like this?</p>
   
   <p>Matsoukas has the right idea, but the 250 clubs in America refuse to listen to him. They would rather spend $300 buying buttons and flags, than send $100 to save Greece from the clutches of the Turks. Of the 250 clubs only seven did the right thing on Greek Independence Day.</p>
