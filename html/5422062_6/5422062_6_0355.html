   <p>The native sons of Dodecanisos here in Chicago, in a general mass meeting presided by Mr. Zervos, resolved to appeal to the League of Nations, to intercede on behalf of the inhabitants of Dodecanisa, who are oppressed and persecuted under the domineering power of Italy. The inhabitants of those Islands have had the misfortune to be governed by Italy. The conniving, scheming and heartless diplomats of the Big Powers turned Dodecanisos, whose population is nothing but Greek, over to be put under an Italian mandate. Mr. Zervos announced to the press, that he and a committee would visit the legations and embassies of the Big Powers including that of Italy, and lay before them, the true and rightful claims of the Dodecanisos Islands, hoping that the oppression would be stopped.</p>
