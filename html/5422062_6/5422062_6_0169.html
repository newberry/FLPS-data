   <p>This coming Sunday, November 10th, the Eptanisian club Alliloboithia is giving a dance in the Red Room of the LaSalle Hotel.</p>
   <p>The Eptanisian Club, for many years established in Chicago, is among the first to support any national cause. The funds of this dance are to go to the National Hero of Athens. We should all help in this effort.</p>
