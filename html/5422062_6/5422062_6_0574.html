   <p>To the editor of Saloniki:</p>
   <p>The election results in Greece give evidence that the Greek people are completely unbalanced politically. They do not follow logic or justice, but follow blindly the paths of the demagogues and traitors. They do not weigh the consequences of such base politics which can destroy an entire nation, and possibly each individual in it.</p>
   <p>The impression of the election upon the other countries is not very favorable. The mistakes of the past are to be continued. It is time that a stand be taken for the future.</p>
   <p>I feel that a democratic club should be founded, whose purpose would be to educate the Greeks in politics, through lectures; and to point out the benefits to be obtained under a democratic form of government. This club should be ready at the proper time to overthrow the monarchy, and to embrace the Greek political form--the sacred form of democracy.</p>
