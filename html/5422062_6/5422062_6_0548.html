   <p>The National Defense is forming branches all over, and being non-partisan takes in members of both parties. (Venizelists and Royalists).</p>
   <p>In New York, for example, a committee was formed in which members of both parties participated. The committee was composed of the following individuals:: Archbishop Alexander, M. Kourkoulis, A. Kallimachos, G. Nikoaou, P. Tatanis, A. Kalvokouresis, M. Tsamados, J. Panagopoulos, M. Nikas, P. Venetsanakos.</p>
   <p>Such was the cooperation of both sides, that the Liberals (Venizelists) in their generosity conceded their places, in the committee to the Royalists, and so it was a committee of Royalists, as the reader can see by the elected names.</p>
   <p>We may suggest, if we are permitted, to the founders of the organization that such generosities are not allowed, because in that case the committee deviates from its program, which is cooperation of both camps, while now they have made it purely Royalistic.</p>
