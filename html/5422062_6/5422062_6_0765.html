   <p>Because of the continued defamation of Greece and the Greek army by some Chicago newspapers, our political club, the Achaean Society, held a general meeting last Tuesday and resolved that committee be appointed to give publicity to the real truth concerning the alleged actrocities committed by the Greek army against the Bulgarians.</p>
   <p>Dr. N. Papantonopoulos took up the battle single-handed and protested in the Examiner against these calumnies.</p>
   <p>Professor John Leotsacos, who teaches ancient Greek and Latin, has given lectures the subject, but the best way to disabuse people's minds of this error is to employ the press. We hope that the committee appointed by the Achaean Society, will proceed properly and systematically in its defense of the Greek name.</p>
