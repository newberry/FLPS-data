   <p>Though living far away from Mother-Greece, you can not help hearing her voice. She is calling you to duty, reminding you of your origin and your ancestors.</p>
   <p>Friends of Greece, the world over, hear her voice and assist her in her struggle to liberate the rest of her sons who are yet under the Turkish yoke.</p>
   <p>Young Greeks of America have heard the voice and swarmed to the eastern parts of America for passage to go and fight for Greece. Greeks of America must generously respond to our Mother Country's needs.</p>

   <p>Tens of thousands of dollars are not enough , we must give hundreds of thousands, and the Greeks of Chicago must go over the $200,000. mark. The money is here, the willingness is here, what will stop Chicago to subscribe $200,000. or more? Let us begin to give thousands and not hundreds of dollars. It is our duty, let us do it. Let us be swift about it and exemplify ourselves. Come, march to duty.</p>
