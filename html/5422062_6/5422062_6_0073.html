   <p>p. 1- The Greek community of Chicago has once more expressed its sentiments with the liveliness and the high spirits which always prevail when Chicago Greeks have the chance to express themselves. The warm and lively reception given a few days ago to the Greek beauty who had already displayed her charm before the eyes of the entire world and the quick response given by the seven thousand Chicago Greeks who assembled last Monday evening to honor and admire Alice Diplarakou prove the degree of pride and joy felt by the Greeks of Chicago at the visit of this lovely Grecian girl who recently represented Greece in the European beauty contest, and who by her exquisite charm and beauty won the distinctive title of Miss Europe. The reception accorded to Miss Europe by Chicago Greeks also shows what means they employ to express their feelings, and how much they admire beauty and enjoy it.</p>
   
   <p>Miss Diplarakou herself stated that nowhere except in Paris and in New York had she been received by so huge an assemblage of people. And the Greek beauty was impressed not only by the throng which gathered to receive her the other evening but also by the manner in which this large audience expressed its admiration.</p>
   <p>When Miss Diplarakou made her appearance on the stage, the thousands of spectators present were amazed by her beauty and for a few moments gazed in absolute silence, standing agape and marvelling at her beautiful form and her imposing carriage, as if they were for the moment by their adoration and admiration of her beauty paying homage to the goddess of pulchritude. This ardent admiration was followed by such tremendous applause and cheers that the entire length of the huge ballroom literally trembled.</p>
   <p>That Miss Diplarakou was moved by this sincere expression of their sentiments made by the Greeks of Chicago and by their large assemblage on this occasion was very evident, and the tone of her voice as she uttered words of thanks and appreciation to the audience enhanced the charm of her beauty.</p>
   
   <p>After her lovely appearance before the many thousands of her Chicago Greek admirers Miss Alice Diplarakou was escorted to a special box, where she personally received numerous visitors and admirers and herself admired the splendor of the ball given in her honor.</p>
   <p>But it was not only by this united outburst of applause that those present on this occasion expressed their admiration for the young woman who bears the title of the most beautiful girl in Europe. In listening to numerous conversations of which she was the subject we were assured that Miss Diplarakou had created a favorable impression not only on the men but even on the women, who declared that Miss Diplarakou deserves to wear the title of Miss Europe, and they marvelled besides at her beautiful form and at the expression of her eyes, and everywhere one would hear: "She is indeed beautiful! And not only beautiful but intelligent! And so courteous and pleasant when you talk to her!"</p>
   <p>When Miss Diplarakou took leave of the guests, they again manifested their ardent admiration, and all departed with a splendid impression of the entire occasion, the memory of which will linger in the minds of the members of the Greek community of Chicago for a long time to come.</p>
