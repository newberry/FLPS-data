   <p>p. 1.- Minister of Greece, Lambros Koromilas, has shown by his visit that he is intensely interested in the Greeks in America. He is interested in the people, the communities, the churches and the schools, and is going to work hard to help them.</p>
   <p>He has left a good impression on the Greeks in America. He is not promising,--and always forgetting. He never says anything he doesn't mean and he never promises anything he can't do.</p>
   <p>He was over-enthusiastic at the number of Greek newspapers and periodicals in Chicago. He considers the press the easiest means of reaching the many Greeks in Chicago and bringing them together. He asks all journalists to include more material from Greece, so we will not become estranged from our mother country. This is very good advice and should be followed.</p>
