   <p>The Arcadians of Chicago have heard the appeal of the Contribution Committee of Tripoli, which is striving to erect a statue of Theodore Kolokotronis in the public square at Areos, Tripoli. Nick Salopoulos has accepted the responsibility of collections in Chicago, so that the Arcadians living here can do their part in building this statue.</p>
   <p>Dr. Salopoulos has decided that a minimum of one dollar and a maximum of five dollars will be collected. He asks everyone to contribute as close to the maximum as possible because Chicago has set a $1,500 contribution fund as its goal.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the various Arcadian clubs in Chicago have promised to support this purpose but individual contributions are equally necessary. So far the following people have donated:</p>
