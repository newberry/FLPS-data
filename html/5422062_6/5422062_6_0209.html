   <p>Miss Irene A. Papchristophilou, a native of Chicago, who attends the Lyceum in Athens, Greece, impersonated Iphigeneia in that ancient drama, "Iphigenia in Aulis, which was given by the girls of the Lyceum. And the Athenian press, in eulogizing the talent of the Chicago girl, comments as follows:</p>
   <p>The young Chicago girl, Miss Irene, displayed at the performance godlike beauty, grace and idealism. Athenian society stood agog at the appearance of Iphigenia who appeared in the person of a Greek girls, native of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The youthful Greek-Columbian from Chicago, by the statuesque appearance of Iphigenia displayed the deifying heroism and the suffering of the superhuman soul of that sacrificed beauty.</p>
   <p>The Greek community of Chicago can proudly say that Miss Papachristophilou is a product of Grecian Chicago. Miss Irene was born and reared in Chicago and is the niece of Mrs. L. E. Koyionis.</p>
