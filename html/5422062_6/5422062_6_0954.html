   <p>"The ancient Greeks and later the Romans knew shorthand and used it freely. Each Greek word in stenography was represented by a single symbol. In the second century A. D. the Greek orator Flavius Philostratus used the symbolic figures which are the symbols of our modern shorthand. Origen, the religious orator of Alexandria, wrote his manuscripts in shorthand. Chrysostom also used shorthand."</p>
