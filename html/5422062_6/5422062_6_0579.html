   <p>To all who are interested in the glory of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>To all who believe that the Greece of 1920 is better than the Greece of 1909.</p>
   <p>To all who have faith, and see the situation without prejudice and bias, and see that Venizelos is the benefactor of Greece.</p>
   <p>To all those individuals, we extend an invitation to attend the Liberal Meeting tomorrow, Sunday, October 30, at Bowen Hull of Hull House. The purpose of the meeting is to send telegrams to various sections of Greece, urging the election of Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Bring with you as many people as possible in order to achieve success for our aims.</p>
   <p>Organizing Committee.</p>
