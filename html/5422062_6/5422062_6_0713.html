   <p>As it had been announced, the National Venizelist mass-meeting took place last Sunday at the Coliseum. Twelve thousand Chicago Liberals participated.</p>
   <p>Chicago authorities, being familiar with "when Greek meets Greek," took no chances of letting the Greeks use the city as a Greek battle-front, and precautions were taken to avoid any real battles among the two factions of Chicago Greeks, the Venizelists or Liberals and the Constantinites or Royalists. Seventy-five blue-coats were stationed at the scene of operation.</p>
   <p>A committee of 225 was authorized to keep peace and order and to inform the so-called Royalists that this mass-meeting was only for Venizelists and their sympathizers, and that if the Royalists were as they are, of contrary opinion and do not agree with Venizelos's policies, then for the sake of the Greek name in general, for the sake of decency and order, and for the sake of their own necks it would be advisable for them not to attempt to attend the meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This counsel and this warning were announced to the opposite side of the fence many days before the meeting, and emphasis was laid on the fact that force would be employed to make the announcement effective.</p>
   <p>Greeks the world over, Venizelists, anti-Venizelists, or what not, are Greeks and pay no attention to threats and warnings when national affairs are involved. The ancient King of Persia sent word to the Greeks, to Lacedemonians, Athenians, and others, to surrender their arms. Did they heed his threats? Did they surrender the arms? By no means. They sent word to him, "Come and get them."</p>
   <p>Chicago Greeks are chips of the old block. The Royalists, who according to their way of thinking claim the title of Constitutionalists disregarded the Venizelists' warning and threats and decided to come to the enemy's camp and break up the meeting. But unfortunately for them, the enemy happened to be their fellow-Greeks and did not go back on their word. The meaning of that famous "when Greek meets Greek" is well known to us; it is war to the end.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The impartial American press of Chicago next day told the story of the Greek affray with better descriptive power and color than I have at hand (being a Greek and a Venizelist).</p>
   <p>At 1 P. M. sharp the Venizelist phalanxes (fifty deep) began to arrive. A subcommittee of seventy-five, reinforced by policeman, was waiting at the entrance to prevent the admission of Royalists. Seventy-Royalists, headed by three leaders, came and of course attempted to force their way in. As the opposing forces met, the blue-coats were unable to know which was which.</p>
   <p>It was all Greek to them, and consequently the remained inactive. But the committee gently picked up the Royalists from the ground as if they had been so many dolls and set them aside as we put one match-box on top of another, making room for the arriving phalanxes of Venizelists.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The white-glove-handled Royalists, as the policemen called them in referring to the incident when they saw that their attempt to enter the hall had been frustrated, held a council and asked Mr. Alex Matiatos, chairman of the sub-committee, to inform those Royalists who had smuggled themselves in,to come out in order to hold a conference in the open. Seven of them refused to go out, proclaiming their allegiance to Venizelos; fifteen others, who were sitting in a group (knowing that in union there is strength), responded to the call and started out. After a few steps the fifteen, side by side and shoulder to shoulder, began to bombard the crowd with clubs, bottles, chairs, and bricks.</p>
   <p>The policemen on guard outside emphatically denied that there was any battle at all; they heard nothing, but they could not understand why the heads of the evicted Royalists were bleeding. There were no noise, no cries, and no disturbance at all.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Of course those who were near the fracas candidly admitted to me that there was a little rough handling, which was due to the fact that the white gloves of the Venizelists fell off in the operation. Most of those evicted carried concealed weapons, and for that offense alone they were put under arrest.</p>
   <p>By 1:45 P. M. the hall had been cleared of Royalists. But outside their number by this time had increased to one hundred and fifty, and more were arriving, uttering threats to air and clouds, and . ..... That is what I call decency! The policemen's ears were not shocked at all. Everything was in Greek; not one word in English.</p>
   <p>At this time two hundred Cretans in military formation, followed by hundreds of other Greeks, reached the scene of anticipated hostilities. Upon learning of the skirmishes already fought the Cretans, relieving themselves of banners, flags, and other marching paraphernalia, fell upon the poor Royalists like hounds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Royalists in turn took the part of the fleeing fox, for they were not such fools as to stay but took to their heels, and for blocks and blocks hither and yonder, foxes and hounds were active. You know the game.....</p>
   <p>Passers-by, vivilized Americans, were very much amused at the game of fox and hound, and the next day the Chicago press said, "Constantine's army was defeated and entirely annihilated by the Venizelos army." A nice how-do-you-do for all the Greeks! Anyway, it was our affair. Let the world say what it may, we Greeks will remain Greeks.</p>
   <p>By this time the Coliseum was packed, and thousands of people were massed outside. No more Royalists were in sight with the exception of fourteen real honest-to-goodness Greeks who inspite of their political affiliations were borad-minded enough to respect other people's rights and thus commanded respect and remained unmolested, for they had come as observers and not as trouble-makers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>For the sake of courtesy I will not mention their names lest they be declared traitors by the ignorant mob of their associates.</p>
   <p>Two P. M., and the crowd broke into sky-rending hurrahs. They are coming, the emissaries of the National Venizelist Government of Salonica, who are in this country to tell American Greeks what the facts really are, why Greece is discredited and dishonored, and how she suffers under the unconstitutional regime of King Constantine!</p>
   <p>They arrived-Messrs. Kaffantaris and Aravantinos and their attaches Captains Yannicostas, Papalexopoulos, and Zavos. They took the seats reserved for them on the platform, and Mr. Dem. Eutaxias, publisher of Loxias, as master of ceremonies in well-chosen words introduced first Mr. Aravantinos. For three whole minutes the Coliseum shook with clapping of hands and other applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The distinguished Greek, tall, erect, handsome, dignified and imposing, presented with Platonic logic and fluency the facts of the history of the Greek dynasty. Beginning with Otho in the year 1843, he developed step by step his account of all the activities of the Greek Crown up to the present time. In 1909, said he, the horizon of Greece was illumined by the appearance of a new political star, Eleutherios Venizelos. The crowd again broke out in thundering applause. The orator depicted the achievements of Venizelos, who during the two Balkan Wars doubled the territory of Greece. In regard to the present King the orator said that this ruler, surrounded by a German clique,had become a despot, abolishing all constitutional rights and paralyzing the country. The present National Government of Venizelos in Salonica appeals to all fair-minded Greeks in America to support it, and after the crisis is over, let the Greek people decide who are the culprits responsible for their country's woes. The people will then be free to decide whether the King's power and strength shall be founded in the will of the people, or the will of the people shall be damned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Mr. Kaffantaris, a noted linguist, an expert in international law, and an authority on ethnology, spoke along the same lines, denouncing the Germanophile clique surrounding the so-called Greek Crown. The crowd again expressed its approval of the Venizelist-Government with unusual enthusiasm and applause.</p>
   <p>Cards were distributed for signature, pledging support to the cause of Venizelos. 12,400 were returned to the mass-meeting committee. A resolution was adopted, the text of which was cabled to Venizelos in Salonica.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune estimated the crowd to be 7,500; the Herald put it at 5,500; the Germanophile papers of Hearst gave 3,000 as the figure, and the yellow Greek daily of New York reported 300. The publisher of Loxias in spite of his Venizelistic leanings, can vouch for the fact that the attendance was over 12,000.</p>
