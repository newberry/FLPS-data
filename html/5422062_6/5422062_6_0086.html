   <p>p. 1- The visit of the Premier of Greece to the Turkish capital, especially since it is due to the expressed desire of the Turkish Government, must be considered an event of the greatest political importance for the relations of these two irreconcilable enemies, as they have been called for centuries - the Greeks and the Turks.</p>
   <p>Advances for the purpose of reconciliation were made long ago by the Greeks, and the first statesman to make them was Epaminondas Delageorgis. But such political views were premature because territorial questions were involved. The Ottoman Empire was then so large that it was impossible to find a basis of sincere friendship, for under the yoke of its government were the greater part of the Greek people and three fourths of the present territory of Greece.</p>
   <p>Above all, old accounts had to be settled first, Greek provinces under Turkish domination had to be liberated, the boundaries of that great Empire had to be contracted, and its great power crushed, and Greece, on <span class="page-break">\2</span>the other hand, had to be enlarged and made a power of equal strength with Turkey, for Greece could not be taken into consideration, so small was it, as a friend and ally of the powerful Turkey of that time.</p>
   <p>To the majority, the events which are at this moment coming to pass in Angora seem paradoxical and incredible, and the Greek people and their political world do not share the great daring of the man who governs Greece and shapes its political course to-day. For the present inclination of Greece to Turkey and the signing of an agreement of friendship and understanding are due exclusively to the initiative and persistence of Venizelos, who has been laboring for a long time for this purpose, the profound causes of which cannot be understood at this moment.</p>
   <p>Venizelos has worked long to reach this goal, and the Greek people underwent great sacrifices for the attainment of it because the events of the signing of the Greek-Turkish pact and the protests of all the refugee population for losses suffered on account of the signing of this treaty are still fresh in mind, as well as the stormy attacks against it by all the leaders of the political parties.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Against the reaction from all directions the persistent will of Venizelos has prevailed, and the pact was ratified by the Boule because Venizelos had his mind fixed on one sole purpose - to remove all obstacles in his way and go to Angora to sign the agreement of friendship and arbitration between Greece and Turkey.</p>
   <p>And so in this instance, also, Venizelos proved to be a politician of persistence and will-power, one who looks far ahead into the future and discerns what others cannot easily foresee and imagine.</p>
   <p>The visit of the Premier of Greece to Angora must be considered by all as an event of great political significance, and it will undoubtedly become a new milestone in our political career, the results of which, let us hope, will prove to be to the advantage of the Fatherland.</p>
