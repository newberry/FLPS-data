   <p>Last Friday evening a much larger audience was gathered to see the second performance given by the National Greek Troupe. Not only did the Greeks come to see the play, they came to try to revive an interest in the Greek theatres in America.</p>
   <p>When the players saw the huge auditorium packed with spectators, they were inspired to act the best they could. The play lasted over three hours.</p>
   <p>The play, "Kori Tis Kategidas" ( "Daughter of Kategidas") was an enoumous success and will be better in the future. The players are beginning to know the Chicagoans who in turn, are beginning to believe that the plays produced and directed by Mr. Jacobides are worth while seeing.</p>

   <p>The Greek society of Chicago is able to support a theatre of this sort every season, and I am sure it will, as soon as it realizes the necessity of such a thing. To arouse the interest of the people, none but good plays should be presented, those that will be of benefit to Chicagoans.</p>
   <p>In order for Chicago to have regular theatrical performances every season, we must encourage the performers. The National Greek Troupe has done what it could. If we want to keep in close touch with Greece's social affairs, there is no better way then through the stage.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that this success will be repeated again next Sunday at the third and last play, "E Proti Agap," ("The First Love"), to be given at the Civic Theater, Washington Blvd. and Wacker Drive. If this last performance is a success, we can rest assured that our theatricals will return again next year.</p>
