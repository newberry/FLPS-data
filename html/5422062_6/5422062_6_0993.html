   <p>Dear Mr. Lambros,</p>
   <p>My very best thanks for your kind suggestion that the Greeks of Chicago give a dinner for me.</p>
   <p>If I visit Chicago in the immediate future, I will let you know, and I shall be glad to accept the invitation contemplated.</p>
   <p>Yours very Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Henry Morgenthau.</p>
