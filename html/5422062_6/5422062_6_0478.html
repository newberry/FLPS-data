   <p>On last Sunday afternoon the association of Chicago Democratic Liberals called a meeting of its members. The president, Mr. Paul Demos, first thanked the members for the interest which they had shown during the recent election of officers and then asked them to express their opinions on the sentiment prevailing among the Greek consulates in the United States in opposition to the principles of the revolution in Greece.</p>
   <p>"The Greek consulates in America," said Mr. Demos, "whether they pay salaries or not, are occupied by worthless servants of a traitor king, and they are abusing the leaders of the revolution in Greece and trying to undermine their work. The appointment a few days ago of a consul-general, who is still in Greece and of a salaried consul, who lives in the United States, has vexed the Democratic Liberals, because both these officers are known to be devoted servants of King Constantine. At a time when the Greek army is being reorganized from its ruins and is preparing to fight for the leaders of the revolution, the secretary of foreign affairs, Mr. Alexandris, not only retains in office the old friends of King Constantine, but also sends many of the king's sympathizers to the Greek colonies in foreign countries to undermine the work of the revolution."</p>

   <p>After Mr. Demos, Mr. N. Salopoulos, Attorney G. Kyriakopoulos, Messrs. V. Panopovlos, and Halepas made addresses. They were all applauded, and the Liberals decided unanimously: first, that the president of their association should send telegrams to Col. Plastiras of the Greek Army and to Mr. Alexandros Papanastasios expressing the desire of all the Democratic Liberals of Chicago for the return of democracy in our homeland; and second, that a report should be sent to Mr. Plastiras in regard to the activities of law-abiding Greek citizens in foreign countries and their relations with the Greek Consulates.</p>
