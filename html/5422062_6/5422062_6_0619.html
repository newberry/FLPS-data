   <p>It is a far cry from Chicago to that narrow strip of the eastern Balkans known geographically as Thrace and politically, at this time, as the Balkan football of the peace conference. But there are in Chicago today 35,000 resident native Greeks or descendants from Hellenic stock, who are bridging that distance with an anxious appeal that the priceless heritage first established by the Greeks themselves--freedom and self-government--may not be lost forever to their blood brothers in Thrace.</p>
   <p>Shall the 730,000 Greeks in Thrace be placed under the government of Greece, or shall they be compelled to bow to the 112,000 Bulgarians in the same territory, and submit to the rule, not only of an alien, but an enemy race? This is the question put by the Greek leaders here.</p>
