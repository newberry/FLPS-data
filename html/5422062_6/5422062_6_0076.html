   <p>p. 2.- Eight thousand people of all creed and all nationalities came to see Aliki Diplorakou. Eight thousand people packed the Aragon ballroom last Monday evening, hoping to see the most beautiful woman of Europe. To this crowd of people Aliki spoke and smiled in response to their expressions of respect and admiration.</p>
   <p>Last Monday's dance was the greatest event in the annals of the Greeks of Chicago. The people hoped that it would prove to be one of the most memorable days in the life of the youthful Grecian beauty, Aliki Diplarakou.</p>
   <p>Like a graceful sculptured masterpiece of the "Golden Age"; like a cypress which stands out in relief against the skyline, and rises above the common level, Aliki stood. She was dressed in a silver cloth evening gown that appeared more like an Attican Chiton than the product of a contemporary <span class="page-break">2</span>modiste. From the platform, she looked down upon her eight thousand admirers, smiled at the glowing words of eulogy, (somewhat tiresome when overdone) then with great composure and with a strong conviction of the truth of her message, she spoke with an assurance which held her audience spell-bound.</p>
   <p>Truly patriotic, Aliki Diplarakou is a product of the Attic land. She is possessed with an air of aristocratic sophistication that is truly admirable and with a sufficient amount of gusto and good taste to make her distinctive. As the Englishmen would say, "She has charm," and that is an imperative feminine quality.</p>
   <p>Our Aliki, if I may be allowed to use the Americanism, did not need flags; did not need attendants; did not need stagy backgrounds. Neither did she need flowers nor speech-making of the eulogistic type. Superlatives are the attributes of mediocrity - the substitutes for qualities that are absent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>As she began her short, concise, and pointed speech, as she uttered the first words with the distinctiveness of the pure Attic pronunciation, the audience gasped.</p>
   <p>"A Grecian is in our midst," they said, "She is not beautiful in the American sense of the word. She is not the type that is full of "It." Pale face, jet black hair, a body of such symmetry that it might easily have inspired a Praxiteles to outdo his Eros, and would have forced the Athenians, the Spartans and the rest of the Greeks to stop their warfare and Lysistrata to have enlisted her aid, Aliki Diplarakou is beautiful, but in another sense.</p>
   <p>To speak of intellectual beauty would be superfluous. Her beauty is the type that an artist would love to duplicate in marble or on canvas.</p>
   <p>As graceful as the Cariatides in the Erecthium, as inspiring as Titian's Diana, and as fascinating as anything that El Greco has ever given to the art lovers of the ages, Our Aliki afforded the Greeks their first view of <span class="page-break">4</span>a truly beautiful woman. In this land of hardships; in the foreign land of the Americans, where our men struggle daily from six to six, and where our women stay home mumbling pensive tunes of the Mediterranean shores, so as to forget the exile that Kismet has planned for them, the presence of Miss Europe was on electrifying experience.</p>
   <p>She herself became filled with the enthusiasm of her fellow countrymen, mingled with the crowd so as to see her brothers face to face, to speak to them, to encourage them. The crowd became fascinated. It marvelled. It cheered.</p>
   <p>She threw flowers to the people. The rose petals covered the floor of the ballroom. The roses had no thorns. Only exquisite perfume.</p>
   <p>It was an experience!</p>
