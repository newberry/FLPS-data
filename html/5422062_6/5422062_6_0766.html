   <p>Chicago Greeks are entertaining Mr. K. Pezas, Consul Plenipotentiary of the Greek government, who has come to the United States to inspect the Greek consular service in the country.</p>
   <p>At last the voice of Loxias,which for the last six years has been requesting the Greek government to alter the present consular system, has been heeded, and the distinguished diplomat is here for that purpose.</p>
   <p>At the Congress Hotel, when Mr. Pezas stays, many prominent Greeks have visited him and have submitted information, suggestions, and requests. A sumptuous dinner was given in honor of the Greek visitor, at which the flower of the community and many American personages were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pezas will leave for St. Louis on the day after to-morrow.</p>
