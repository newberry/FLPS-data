   <p>Memorial services for those who died in the struggle of Asia Minor for the cause of freedom, were held on Sunday, April 10. At two o'clock large groups of people began to fill the Hod Carriers Hall. They were impressed by the solemnity of the event, and prayed that the struggle in which their brothers were killed had not been in vain. They prayed that the Daphne wreath of patriotism and freedom, that was waved by the leaders of freedom on the battle grounds of Macedonia, Thrace, and Ionia, would not be defiled by crooked Athenian politics.</p>
   <p>After the playing of both the Greek and American national anthems the people stood and cheered for the long life and freedom of their brothers and neighbors in Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Salopoulos (editor of Saloniki) gave a speech, blasting indictments against the murderous tactics of the Athenian government. He was cheered enthusiastically.</p>

   <p>At five o'clock the meeting ended, and everyone hurried to read the latest news report of their country.</p>
