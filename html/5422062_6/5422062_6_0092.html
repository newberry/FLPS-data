   <p>When King George (of Greece) went Messolonghi, for the first time, he was accompanied by his Danish counselor, Count Sponnek.</p>
   <p>Sponnek, having seen the remnants of the fort of Messolonghi which the Turks and the Arabs did not capture, turned to his companion and said with scorn, "Such a weak barrier, I could have captured it with 400 Danes only."</p>
   <p>Standing near the King and Count Sponnek was the old warrior, Nikas, who having overheard what the stranger had said, remarked ironically, "He would have taken it with four hundred Danes......But, in that case, there would have to be Danes like himself, within the fort."</p>
   <p>(Literal)</p>
