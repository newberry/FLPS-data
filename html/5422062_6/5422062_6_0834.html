   <p>p. 2.- The affair given last Saturday by the Athletic Club was a great success. The Hull House was filled by 7 o'clock. Everybody was feeling happy and intensely patriotic. When George Bambakaris finished his speech the applause was overwhelming. He was followed by Rev. Mandilaris, Jane Addams, P. Petropoulos, Emma Newcomb, B. Benetsanakis and others. The evening was well spent.</p>
