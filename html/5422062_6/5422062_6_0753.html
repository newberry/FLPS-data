   <p>p.1.-- Hundreds of Chicago Greek veterans in a meeting last week appealed to the press to expose the truth about the Balkan atrocities. Many of these boys, some of them wounded and wearing their decorations, indignantly denounced the lies and machinations of the Bulgarians and pleaded for an impartial investigation that the truth may be known to the public.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knapp, editor of the Chicago Daily Journal, writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"When the Carnegie commission was appointed to investigate the Balkan atrocities, experienced observers predicted that it would whitewash the Bulgarians and throw mud on other Balkan peoples. This prophecy was based on the fact that several members of the commission were known to be strongly pro-Bulgarian and anti-Greek. This was particularly true of Prof. Milyoukoff, whose hatred of Hellenism was notorious, and whose perfect acquaintance with eastern languages made him easily the most influential member of the commission.</p>
   <p>"The report just issued by the commission shows that the prediction was justified.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The investigation could not indeed give so complete a whitewash to Bulgaria as they wished. Bulgarian butcheries were too widely known and too well attested to admit of denial. But the commission did the next worst thing; it glozed over the fiendish massacres committed by Bulgarians at Serres and at Ooxato; it maundered about the 'provocation' which the Bulgars had for their outrages; and then it accepted and published as true almost every slanderous charge against the Greeks which the enemies of that people could write or print.</p>
   <p>"The report would be more widely believed if it were less clearly one-sided; but in no case could it deceive those who have followed the Balkan Wars step by step. The flight of Turkish peasants for protection from Bulgarian to Greek territory is enough to prove which army was gentler and more humane with non-combatants; and the evidence of Austrian consuls and British army officers agrees exactly with this unconscious testimony of Moslem villagers.</p>
   <p>"No doubt wild deeds were done by all the Balkan combatants. War is always horrible, and in Macedonia it was made tenfold more hellish by the accumulated <span class="page-break">3</span>race-hatreds and religious jealousies of centuries. But all the evidence goes to show that the Greeks were the most humane, and the Bulgars the most savage, of the Balkan nations; and it must not be forgotten that the initial outrages were committed by Bulgarians. If Greek troops gave rein to their fury after going through the ruins of Serres and Demirhissar, they did only what our own soldiers have done in Indian wars after finding the tortured bodies of their messmates."</p>

   <p>To further corroborate the statements of our Chicago warriors who fought in the neighborhood of Gevgeli and Zaitsar. I herewith print what Herr Maximilian Harden, editor of the Berlin Zukunft, has written:</p>
   <p>"Abhorred Bulgarians! We had the opportunity of seeing and studying you at close range. You are savages, strong only in evil determination and persistence. You are not inspired by any ethical principle. You have no religious feeling. Your religion does not unite you by a spiritual tie but only by the bond of race.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"You still have the savage instincts of the hordes of which you are descended. You are still standing on the lowest level of mental and moral development. You are primitively uncivilized. Your soldiers, whether in victory or in defeat, abandon themselves to murder, pillage, and rapine, like the hordes of Attila and like the wild crowd of the Mongols under Genghis Khan.</p>
   <p>"We have indisputable proof of your atrocities. You may pretend that King Constantine and King Peter, in denouncing you as murderers and vandals, are influenced by the leaders of their armies, but we have the testimony of a legion of disinterested foreign eye-witnesses, among them French, English, Austrian, and German journalists, foreign officials and residents like those of Serres and Cavalla, foreign doctors such as those engaged by the Serbian Government, foreign clergymen, and photographers of foreign nations, one German, one Norwegian, and two French.</p>
   <p>"Dismemberment, torture, maiming, strangling of prisoners, decapitation, crucifixion, disemboweling and blinding of non-combatants - there is the catalogue of your ascertained crimes. The depositions of a multitude of foreign eye-witnesses present a report that makes us shudder.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"In the village of Zaitsar thirty-two mutilated bodies were found, corpses of women on whom the Bulgarian soldiers had satiated their bestial and brutal passions; even children under ten have suffered shame. Old men and old women were disgracefully abused by the soldiers of Ferdinand. The brutal instincts of the Bulgarians did not flinch before a paralytic woman ninety years old. Women, even young mothers, were driven to the camp with kicks and blows to serve the lusts of the Bulgarian beasts. And after the orgies of lewdness the victims were slaughtered.</p>
   <p>"Abhorred Bulgarians! You have destroyed cities and villages, burned and devastated whole districts; you have butchered to your hearts' content. Is not that enough? Now you try to poison public opinion with monstrous lies, inventions of your officials and dignitaries, including two members of your Government, Genadief and Touchef.</p>
   <p>"The Bishop of Sofia, the President of the Synod, the Speaker of Parliament and the President of the University had the audacity to send me a cable telling me about the "unparalleled vandalism" of the Greeks, who had seen fit to humiliate the Bulgarian garrison at Salonica instead of being grateful <span class="page-break">6</span>to it for its assistance in the capture of that city.</p>
   <p>"You cannot deceive those who know you. You, who seized Gevgeli by sudden and treacherous attack in order to cut off the Greeks from the Serbians - you have the effrontery to assert that Salonica was captured with your assistance. Why, it is a matter of historic record that Hassan Tahsin Pasha surrendered to the Greeks on the 8th of November, and it was fully three days later when a small detachment of your cavalry reached that city. The conduct of the Greeks has been eminently humane.</p>
   <p>"But tell me, who are your progenitors? Your ancestors were Huns, Avars, Turks, and Slovines. You need a very long process of elimination in order to be rid of your primal instincts. Remember your great man Stambouloff, who only a week after his resignation had to face sixteen charges of violating women.</p>
   <p>"Now then, you cannot deceive those who know you. Before you can make good your claim to membership in the Sisterhood of Nations, you will have to cease to be liars, thieves, and base and infamous ravishers. You will have to call upon the civilized world to uproot from your natures all that <span class="page-break">7</span>is Mongolian and to plant in you the seed of humanity and decency. Then and then only will you be fit to be admitted to the family of civilized nations."</p>
   <p>Below we print extracts from the New York Times and the London Daily Telegraph and statements by Captain Reid, the famous Canadian officer.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago and elsewhere will do well to organize and bring before the public the real perpetrators of the Balkan atrocities.</p>
