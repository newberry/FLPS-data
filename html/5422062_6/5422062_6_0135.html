   <p>It is human nature to leave things undone till the last minute. There are many Greeks who wanted to send money to Greece for Easter and have let the days drift by without doing anything about it.</p>
   <p>Those who forgot to send an Easter check by mail can do so by telegraph. This service is given you by the Atlas Exchange National Bank, represented by P. Malakate. This will give you a chance to send your money in time to have your people buy lambs, Yaourti and fresh eggs for Easter.</p>
