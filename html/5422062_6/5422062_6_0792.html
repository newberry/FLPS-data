   <p>The Greek community in Chicago bears the honor of being the first one in the United States, to hear the speech of Mr. K. Papamichalopoulos, former Prime Minister of Greece.</p>
   <p>Inspite of the sub-zero weather 4,000 Greeks jammed the West Side Auditorium to hear this eminent statesman who is here as a visitor to study the political systems of this great Republic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Papamichalopoulos told his audience that Mother-Greece now begins to shine again under the leadership of Eleutherios Venizelos, who as a true patriot united all the factions into one group to forge a New Greece. He also brought out the necessity for the Greeks in America to be united in one group under the Panhellenic Union, thus as a strong body they will be useful to their Adopted Country as well as to Mother-Greece.</p>
