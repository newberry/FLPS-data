   <p>Everlasting Stain on History of Country, Chicago Publisher Declares</p>
   <p>Execution of the former ministers of Greece is an act of frenzy and hatred which will be an everlasting stigma on the history of Greece in the opinion of P. S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star, 130 North Wells Street.</p>
   <p>"Exile and imprisonment would have been fitting punishment for the men who guided Greece in her hour of defeat," Mr. Lambros declares, "but capital punishment is monstrous and sure to work lasting injury to the nation.</p>

   <p>King Constantine," he adds, "is far guiltier than the ministers, but the European respect for crowned heads saved the late ruler.</p>
   <p>"Greeks all over the world are shocked," said Mr. Lambros. "Men are executed by military authority for treason, for levying war against their own country, or for supporting the enemies of their country. In my opinion no direct accusation of treason could be brought against the executed ministers. Their crime grew out of the division that existed and still exists within the Greek nation--the struggle between Royalists and Venizelists.</p>
   <p>Betrayed by Former Allies.</p>
   <p>"The executed ministers are the same executives who directed the triumphant war against Turkey in Asia Minor in the spring of 1921, when the Greeks reached the gates of Angora.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"The defeat of the Greeks in Asia Minor was occasioned by France's alliance with the Turks and by the apathy of Great Britain to Greece,--in short, to the betrayal of Greece by her former allies. Rifles and cannons used by the Greeks and the Allies against the Turks were given to the Turks to be used against the Greeks.</p>
   <p>"One may admit the share of the ministers in the demoralization, but who could control the army when the soldiers were throwing away their guns and retreating in disorder?</p>
   <p>Terrorism in Greece</p>
   <p>"Aristides, Themistocles, and Demosthenes, though accused of treason, were not executed in Greece in ancient times but were exiled instead.</p>

   <p>History speaks well of them and contradicts the accusations made against them. When Socrates was sentenced to death, he said to the court: 'Now it is time for me to depart and for you to live here, but as to who will live the happier life hereafter is unknown to us and known to God.'</p>
   <p>"In spite of the stern warning of the representatives of England and the United States to the revolutionary Government that this Government would forfeit its place among civilized nations, the Government ordered the firing squad to execute the former ministers; the end came, and terrorism now prevails in Greece.</p>
   <p>"History will decide whether the executed ministers should have paid the penalty with imprisonment, exile, or capital punishment."</p>
