   <p>Chicago - There arrived in Chicago today one Miltiades Rezos, Greek financial magnate and business man. He is backed by letters of credit from the National Bank of Greece for $20,000,000, according to reports, with additional credit of a cool hundred million - all of which will probably be spent here in buying package foodstuffs and machinery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rezos did not intend to go farther West than New York, but the Chicago Association of Commerce got busy and sent Paul Demos, president of the Greek Community of Chicago, to the Seaboard to welcome him.</p>
