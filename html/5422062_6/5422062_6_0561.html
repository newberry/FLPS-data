   <p>When Mr. Venizelos, having failed in the elections of November 1, 1920, both personally and as a party leader, was about to depart from Greece, he spoke to the Greek people as leader of the Liberal party, leaving with them the following farewell address and political bequest:</p>
   <p>"Now that I am relieved of all authority and am abandoning the political scene, I wish to address the Greek people and the Liberal party.</p>
   <p>"I address the Greek people, assuring them that I bear no bitterness for <span class="page-break">\2</span>the vote of Sunday. I realize that no other people would tolerate a state of continual mobilization for two years after the armistice and after the virtual termination of the war, as did the Greek people, who were on a continual war footing. I address myself to my friends and request them never to subordinate the vital interests of the country [to other interests] and, consequently, never to indulge in any action before examining what reaction it may have on the common interest and general good. May my political followers remember the principles which have inspired the Liberal party in its foreign policy since its inception and in its domestic policy especially during the interval of 1910 - 1915.</p>
   <p>"I am convinced that they will also submit to the people's verdict without any bitterness."</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Mr. Simos, a former minister in the Venizelos cabinet, <span class="page-break">\3</span>wrote from Nice, France, where he is residing with Mr. Venizelos, to the Athenian press, saying:</p>
   <p>"It is now time that the political friends and enemies of Mr. Venizelos should understand that his work of the last decade belongs to history. There is no hope that he can save and preserve this work of his or safeguard Greece from the impending catastrophe. The only thing he can do is to retire to a corner of France and live in seclusion. I am in position to assert that King Constantine gravely erred when he proclaimed that he would recall Mr. Venizelos. King Constantine will never see Mr. Venizelos during his reign or during his lifetime. The Liberal party will remain the sacred symbol of Mr. Venizelos' name, and it will continue functioning in accordance with its program, but not with the active guidance of its great leader."</p>
   <p>And the Liberal party now asks him, its leader, in the name of its <span class="page-break">\4</span>political principles and its mission to the country and nation--"Quo Vadis?"</p>
   <p>Yes, Mr. President, where are you leaving a party which was created by the coup d'etat of August 15, 1909--a party which distinguished itself for such a long time and which contributed to your making, to your attainment of the premiership of Greece, through which office you achieved the expansion of Greece, and brought eternal glory to Greek arms?</p>
   <p>Should you forsake such a glorified party because the election coup of November 1 has momentarily halted its progress? At that time--in the election of November 1--the entire Greek people was not properly counseled nor were the elections properly held. Only a part of the people voted, and no proper attention was given to the election procedure, so that the people's true verdict could be made clear. The result of the elections <span class="page-break">\5</span>would then have been much different. But, in any case, the destiny of the entire mass of Greek people should not depend on the verdict and decisions of the inhabitants of Old Greece, because there are more Greeks outside the confines of the Greek nation [than within]. These Greeks are in every respect superior to them [Greeks within Greece], for they do not judge hastily and dispose of their votes indiscriminately; they are not eager to occupy public office; they do not wait to be supported by the national treasury, thus satisfying their base personal passions and desires. Rather they consider policies which primarily pertain to and promote the interest of the country. We emphasize that eighty per cent of the Greek emigrants are liberals in conviction. Almost all the significant contributions to, and developments within, Greece are due to the loyalty and hard work of the Greek who lives in foreign lands. For instance, the rescue of our homeland from financial catastrophe, the wealth deposited in Greek banks, the marvelous expansion of our merchant marine, the prosperity and public works in our home towns and villages, are all their accomplishments. It must also be understood that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>support and material sustenance of forty per cent of the Greek population depends on the continual monthly remittances coming from the Greeks in Canada and the United States. Thousands of dollars have been sent to provide dowries for young women and to meet debts. This is the attitude of eighty per cent of the Greeks of America, who are devout liberals, toward the homeland. No one can accuse the Liberal party of lack of loyalty, energy, and ideals. Are you, Mr. Venizelos, its leader, now going to resign from its ranks? Be assured that such an act will be followed by great disasters.</p>
   <p>You know, Mr. Venizelos, that every great movement, every religion, looks up to its principles and convictions by which its supreme being is adored. This religion expects its founder to suffer and undergo many trials, if the cause is to be triumphant. Similarly,a party with principles, a party devoted to the service and demands of its supreme being, which in this case is the country, demands and expects the greatest <span class="page-break">\7</span>sacrifices on the part of its leader and founder if it is to attain its ideals and fulfill its purposes.</p>
   <p>The supremacy and glory of Christianity are attributed to its founder, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who suffered and was crucified for its principles and ideals. Without these trials and sufferings on the part of its Leader,the great and imposing institution of Christianity would not exist today.</p>
   <p>You cannot deny that His task was greater than that which confronts a statesman. He sought to eradicate a religion deeply rooted in the hearts of men for centuries, and supplant it with a much different and opposed religious conception. This notwithstanding, He succeeded in establishing His dogma by His patience and superhuman sacrifices. You, on the other hand, as leader of a party, must overthrow a mob of political parasites <span class="page-break">\8</span>devoid of any principle. You must fight a political clique which has been protected and supported by a portion of the people afflicted with prejudice, emotional confusion, and unbridled passions.</p>
   <p>He built on shifty, unsure, idolatrous foundations, whereas you had the ground prepared by the Military League. In this way, you were enabled to reap the fruits of your efforts after the Balkan wars and later in the European war. And so the Liberal party must carry on its work for the benefit of the country; its past work in the foreign and domestic field is not yet completed.</p>
   <p>Great indeed was Peter's disillusionment when he left Rome, a city plagued with sin and corruption. But did not Christ appear to him, saying "Quo Vadis?" that is, "Where are you going?" Did he not then return; and, throwing himself courageously into the Missionary struggle for Christ,save <span class="page-break">\9</span>Rome?</p>
   <p>The Liberal party, in which you occupy the position not of a Peter but of a Christ, asks you, "Where are you leaving me? Who will lead me?" Yes, Mr. President, the party is a religion and, as such, is subject to attack by demons, which, however, can be destroyed by its courage and its convictions. It will not be frightened into dissolution.</p>
   <p>There are other peoples, such as the Poles, who continued fighting, as we did, after the armistice. Mr. Venizelos, then, cannot rightfully say that no people could tolerate a continuation of the war in Asia Minor. The results of the elections of November 1, 1920 were due not to the exhaustion of the people's patience but largely to the sinister and undermining activities of members within our party, during your absence from Greece. They were due to unjustified tolerance of opposition royalist <span class="page-break">\10</span>officials within our ranks, who abused our confidence and deserted us at the first opportunity. Also responsible were agents working in foreign lands, spreading their poisonous anti-nationalist propaganda. That was the time when character and ability were ignored, giving way to unprincipled, filthy politicians. Some party members remain as unshakeable granite pillars of the party; others, however, have betrayed us as they loll blissfully, like poisonous snakes, in the laps of the Royalist party. You, Mr. Venizelos, being the leader of the party, are accused of this pitiful state of affairs. There are many party members who remain loyal and true to party principles. You are now urging them to sacrifice the interests of the party to the interests of the country; you are conjuring them never to take any action before they ascertain what effect it will have on the common interest. These exhortations are opposed to your actions, because you are abandoning the entire party and thus condemning it to destruction. By destroying the party you are destroying the country in which you have shown such great interest and which now needs you most <span class="page-break">\11</span>urgently. Or, are you unaware of the fact that a leaderless party, especially for our people, cannot last long? Consequently, it will be unable to execute and fulfill your advice and admonitions.</p>
   <p>Therefore, again your party asks, "Where are you, our leader, going? Are you abandoning us in this condition?"</p>
   <p>This is the party's true verdict to which you must conform, just as you exhort your friends to accept the verdict of the people.</p>
