   <p>P. 3 - Native sons of Paleochorion, Kynourias, last Monday held a picnic with the object of raising money to build a new church in their native town.</p>
   <p>The frolic included dances, songs, music, and eatables of all kinds. Seven hundred and fifty dollars was raised at the picnic, which will be added to the $3,000 already gained in previous affairs, and the money will be sent to the local authorities of Paleochorion to begin the erection of the new church.</p>
