   <p>p. 1.- Late last Wednesday we received a request to print this letter in our newspaper.</p>
   <p>National Organization</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>We have let the Eastern question slide by without doing a thing, but we can no longer neglect it. We must do the following things:</p>
   <p>(1) Let the world know the true situation by speeches and other publicity.</p>
   <p>(2) Prepare the Greeks of the United States for battle in case they are needed.</p>
   <p>(3) Raise funds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>(4) Arouse public interest through the American newspapers.</p>
   <p>We must have a meeting immediately to elect leaders for this movement. The meeting will take place at Haran Hall, Halsted and Harrison, on Friday, Aug. 12, 1909 at 8 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Aug. 10, 1909.</p>
   <p>Loxias thinks this is a very good movement on the part of a few Greeks. We hope it will be successful. The meeting was held yesterday evening, but the results have not yet been learned. We only hope that all will work for the help of our country and not bicker and quarrel as we are wont to do, when "Greek meets Greek."</p>
