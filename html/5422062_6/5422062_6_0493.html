   <p>Constantinople, January 29, 1923.--Because the Greeks of Pontus have been expelled from their country by the Turks, thousands of refugees are constantly arriving here in lamentable condition, suffering with hunger, nakedness, and disease. We are helpless because of lack of funds. The refugees are in great danger of starvation, since they lack even a crust of bread. We are eager to receive as soon as possible philanthropic contributions through the Greek National Herald, and we urge our compatriots in America to make a supreme effort to extend to us financial assistance.</p>
   <p>The Lord will give you all good things in return for the contributions which you offer to this noble work of saving the women, the children, and the aged in distress. Blessings and the gratitude of the Mother Church to all.</p>
   <p>Patriarch Meletios.</p>
