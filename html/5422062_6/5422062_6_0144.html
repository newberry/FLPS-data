   <p>The fear of the theater-goers of our community, that there will be no performance this season, is groundless. We are going to have the chance of seeing the best theater performance ever presented in our city. After thirty years of theatricals the Greeks have finally achieved a successful playwright and director, G. Jacobides.</p>
   <p>His plays were performed before thousands of people at the Lyric Theater in New York. We know this success will equalled in Chicago. Only three performances will be shown and for this purpose the Auditorium at Congress and Wabash has been rented.</p>
   <p>The premiere will be given next Saturday evening titled "The Three Loves."</p>
   <p>Much has been said and written about the player,so we know beforehand what to expect. Next Saturday night the Greeks are going to be very proud of their theatrical performances.</p>
