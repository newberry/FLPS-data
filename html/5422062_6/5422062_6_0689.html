   <p>The Greek Consulate General of Chicago, having now become a salaried agency of the Greek Government by executive decree 764 of August 26, 1917, invites all Greek citizens in Chicago to register with the Greek Consulate General, by virtue of article 117, paragraph 4, of consular law XNS (as amended by law AIIOE). These citizens should register, as they will not be able to invoke the protection of the consular authorities, nor can they file any application if they are not registered in the books of the consulate. If any Greek citizen resides within the territorial jurisdiction of the consulate and fails to register, he may be fined up to fifty drachmas.</p>
   <p>Registration of Greek citizens takes place daily, from 10:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M., in the consulate, located at 143 North Dearborn Street.</p>
   <p>The Consul General,</p>
   <p>S. K. Pezas.</p>
