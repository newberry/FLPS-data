   <p>G. S. Frangoudis is touring the United States to collect funds for the establishment of a school of political science in Athens, Greece. This school will be the only one of its kind in Greece, as well as in the entire Balkan peninsula.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frangoudis is now in Chicago for the same purpose. Several of our more progressive Greeks have contributed generously and the sum already collected is a little over $6,000. The amount needed altogether is $20,000, and undoubtedly, the sum will be oversubscribed.</p>
   <p>This school will fill a great gap in the Grecian capital, inasmuch as it will introduce things still unknown in Greece. A school of this nature will contribute greatly in the great reformation which is bound to sweep Greek political thought in the future.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to the contributors for helping to establish this school and also those who will continue to aid in maintaining the institution.</p>
