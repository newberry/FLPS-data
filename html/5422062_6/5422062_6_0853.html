   <p>p. 2.- The highest Greek representatives of Hellenism in America, Lambros Koromilas, minister of Greece to Washington, has finally arrived in our fair city. We are proud and happy to have such a distinguished man in our midst.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koromilas is held in high esteem by all the Greeks in the world for the part he played in the Macedonian problem. His visit to America holds a great significance for us. It shows that Hellenism has progressed to such an extent that it is considered necessary to send a minister as representative of our country in Washington. Mr. Koromilas' visit will bring together the Greeks of Chicago into such a strong bond as will not be easily broken by outside influences.</p>
