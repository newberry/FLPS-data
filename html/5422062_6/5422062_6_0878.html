   <p>p. 5.--In response to the appeal of Mother Greece to the Greeks of America for contributions for national defense, the ecclesiastical council of the Chicago Greek community held an executive meeting last week and resolved that the Greek Orthodox Church in America must lead the way in collecting funds for Greece.</p>
   <p>They further resolved that on every Sunday before the collection plate goes around, every minister of a Greek Orthodox church shall make a brief announcement reminding the people of their duty to Greece in her necessity. And whatever is placed in the collection plates when they are passed around the first time shall be devoted to the purpose of national defense.</p>
   <p>The Star congratulates the ecclesiastical body on its iniative, which will undoubtedly be imitated by other communities in the country.</p>
