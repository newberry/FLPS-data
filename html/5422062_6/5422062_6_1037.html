   <p>Editor of National Paper Addresses Meeting of 75 Foreign Groups.</p>
   <p>Expounding the reasons for his devotion to America, his adopted country, Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, to-day addressed delegates to international demonstration of seventy-five foreign groups in the Red Room of the Hotel La Salle. Professing his incapacity for fiery oratory, despite his nativity in the land of Demosthenes, Mr. Lambros proceeded to demonstrate his faith in the American flag and his idea of what it symbolizes.</p>
   <p>"It is a great inspiration to see people from all parts of the world gathered under one roof," asserted Mr. Lambros, "and whether we wear the uniform or not, whether we come from Italy or from France, we are all one as Americans, striving to set for our country and ourselves a standard that will crown Americans with glory and honor. Regardless of our nationalities or our creed, we all feel that our true patriotism must be expressed in words and in deeds, for in union there is strength."</p>
   <p>Paying tribute to the hospitality of the United States to the immigrant, Mr. Lambros demanded that foreigners be questioned on the subject of their Americanism.</p>
   <p>"We may give but one answer," he declared, "and that is that we believe that it is our duty to love our country, to support the national government, to obey the laws and to respect the flag and defend it against the enemies of American democracy.</p>
   <p>"It is our duty to exalt the ideals and the sacred traditions of Lincoln and Washington and to strive to make America greater and better than we have found it. Upon our arrival in New York, gazing at the Statue of Liberty, we were inspired by this symbol of freedom of action, freedom in person, freedom of thought and of the press, and freedom of government."</p>
