   <p>Without being considered on extravagant optimist, it is possible, with some reserve, to say that Greece is entering upon a situation which promises much for the future. For twenty odd years Greece has proceeded in an irregular way so that it was thought that she would never find the right road again. Those were truly stormy years when nations and races went through dark periods. Nations just an individuals and have their every-day problems. Just as the life of the individual isn't always turbulent so it is with the the nation. It happens, though, just as with the individual, so the nation sometime finds itself in a psychological situation, arising from certain calamities which tend to make it bend under its burden.</p>
   <p>The more simple people believe that a diplomatic failure, a political defeat, are due only to the inadequacy of the governing body. The scientific truth is that the conditions and situations which are created, especially in irregular occurrences, have deeper reasons, and in order for a nation to come out of such a crisis, it must eclipse at least most of the reasons that are as associated with the creation of this condition.</p>

   <p>Luckily, for Greece, the dawn of a new day is coming. Judging from past experiences one can truthfully state that the nation continually forgets its problems as they are solved and places into execution the external law of nature--the law of self-preservation. The highest position in which the Greek nation finds itself, compared with the many other nations that profited by the war, is a splendid example of how the children of the Greek soil, for all their troubles, continue to be inspired by the supreme will of their forefathers.</p>
   <p>Whatever takes place in Greece today is dependent on peace and goodwill. The universal treaties found in this crisis exclude any dangerous disturbance to our peace. With the installation of new faces in politics,with the tenacity of our youth to their traditions, with zeal and faith, which zeal and faith, which shows in polite competition among our advancing nation, the dream of our forefathers is being fulfilled.</p>
