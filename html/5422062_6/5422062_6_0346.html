   <p>p. 10 The government of Greece decided to send to America a special commission, to lay plans with the Greek Ambassador, to solicit contributions from the Greeks for our national air defense. Similar commissions visited other countries inhabited by Greeks.</p>
   <p>The people of Greece, being aware of the importance of air defense, willingly responded to the government's urgings for contributions to build aeroplanes for defense of the country. The result was, that already 24 aeroplanes are added to the Greek national air fleet.</p>
   <p>Countries, cities, states, banks, societies, and industries responded with generous contributions. Noted amongst the cities which gave was the Cavalla, which contributed enough for 10 aeroplanes.</p>
   <p>Governors of various states assured the central government, that the people of their commonwealth would contribute considerable amounts of money for the national defense.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Government, in order to avoid unnecessary expenditures, and for strict economy, recalled retired high officers of the Army and Navy to take active part in supervising the huge enterprise of the soliciting of contributions. Thirty-three high officers were called for that purpose, thus eliminating graft, waste, and additional compensation. The supervising officers are held responsible to the Army and Navy Tribunal. That means Martial responsibility.</p>
   <p>A former palace was converted into offices, for transecting the work of contributions, thus eliminating rent.</p>
   <p>The enthusiastic response of the people, the determination of the government, and the faithful services of the officers, top the whole affair. Success is assured. It is estimated, from reports, that one thousand aeroplanes will be built soon. Many European Companies already have bid for the job.</p>
   <p>Greeks of America, get ready when your turn comes to contribute for Greece.</p>
