   <p>p. 2- Because many Greeks either through negligence or through ignorance mail letters and parcels without sufficient postage, which causes the receiver to pay double the amount, the Chicago Post Office has requested us to publish the following information.</p>
   <p>If addressed to a foreign country (Mexico, Canada, and Cuba excepted), letters weighing half an ounce require 5 cents postage; postal cards, 2 cents each; double postal cards, 4 cents; newspapers and other printed matter, 1 cent for 2 ounces; commercial packages not exceeding 10 ounces, 5 cents; commercial packages over 10 ounces, 1 cent for every 2 ounces; registered letters, 8 cents.</p>
   <p>The work of the Post Office will be accelerated if those who send letters or packages will write on the back their names and addresses so that in case of non-delivery to the person addressed, the letter or package may be returned to the sender.</p>
