   <p>Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere in America are raising funds to be sent to Greece to substantially increase the navy of the nation.</p>
   <p>What an example of patriotism! Greeks the world over in spite of time, space, handicaps, or hardships, will always love and assist Mother-Greece, thus perpeterating their immortal traditions.</p>
   <p>Rich men in ancient Athens used to equip warships for the public navy. The law required this service of the, but it was the custom to go far beyond the legal demand. Captains of industry in those days gave their country ships just as now similar individuals give libraries and hospitals.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of to day are putting their private savings into battleships so cheerfully as their ancestors did into Triremes.</p>
   <p>Patritotism of this practical yet fervid sort is a tremendous asset for any nation. It helps to explain the rise of Hellas and the glory attained by it.</p>
