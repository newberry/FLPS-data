   <p>Last Sunday at about three o'clock, a great mass meeting of over one thousand of our most prominent Greek citizens took place at the Germania Hall, 816 West Harrison Street. Decisive measures were taken to cope with the disasters which are afflicting our fatherland. Measures were also taken to condemn those who provoked this national disaster--the defeat of the entire Greek army in Asia Minor by the Kemalist Turks, and the horrible massacre of over 100,000 defenseless Greeks.</p>
   <p>Great groups of patriotic countrymen of both sexes, with pain and anguish shown on their faces, occupied every seat in the great hall on Harrison Street. The entire council of the Greek Liberal Political Organization, many members of the professions, industry, business, and labor classes were present at this truly patriotic gathering. Many stood up in the entrance and on the stairs so that they too, could voice their protests against the instigators of the catastrophe.</p>

   <p>At about three o'clock the main speaker of the occasion, the Honorable Mr. Vasileios Palaeologos Mammonas, former Greek Consul General at Switzerland, arrived, accompanied by his brother , Constantine Palaeologos Mammonas, and by the American guests, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who were received with great applause by the Chairman, Paul Demos, and Secretary Alexander Stauros. They occupied prominent positions on the platform, and then the meeting proceeded with its business. Besides these, there were seated on the platform: Dr. Salopoulos, Dr. Theodore, Attorney Kyriacopoulos, past vice-president of the club, the treasurer, Mr. Kitriniaris, and the Reverend Hadzidimitriou.</p>
   <p>At 3:10, in a brief introductory speech, Mr. Demos, revealing anguish and sorrow, explained the purpose of this meeting. He suggested that any royalist in the audience would do well to leave, for no one could guarantee what might happen to him. Fortunately, however, no one left. He then introduced our distinguished countryman and attorney, Mr. Kyriacopoulos, who bitterly attacked and assailed the nation's traitors and destroyers in a violent and fiery oratorical tirade. The words of the speaker were approved in <span class="page-break">3</span>the oaths and declamations of the audience against those who were to blame. Afterwards, in an excellent eulogy, Mr. Demos introduced Mr. Mammonas, whom the audience received with great enthusiasm and applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mammonas was greatly moved apparently by this demonstration, and by the national disaster. At the beginning, he thanked the audience for their warm reception and also thanked God for being given the privilege to visit and come in contact with the Greek community in Chicago, of which he had heard and read so much. He then began to review the history of the Greek people from the fall of Constantinople to the present day. By superb comparisons, arguments, and analogies he painted a picture of the various great national and political periods of our nation. In conclusion, he made a beautiful and most eloquent comparison of the Venizelist and Royalist administrations.</p>
   <p>He demonstrated and proved by official documents how great was the glory and grandeur of the nation during the Venizelist administration, and how <span class="page-break">4</span>destructive and humiliating the national scene became during the administration of King Constantine. The emotions and devotion of the audience were aroused to such a high pitch that when, after speaking for an hour and ten minutes, he asked to cut his speech short, the audience shouted, "No! no! we shall listen to you until morning."</p>
   <p>Finally, in completing his speech he said, "Many have been the times when our great but unfortunate country has experienced days and hours of indescribable peril and disaster, but its leader,, as [for example] Constantine Palaeologos, has fallen first in its defense; whereas today's leader destroys [our country], and indulges in orgies, while the tolerant and long-suffering people are shamefully misled."</p>
   <p>After the close of Mr. Mammonas' speech, a declaration supporting Mr. Venizelos, was read and voted upon. A collection was also taken up netting a huge amount of money.</p>
