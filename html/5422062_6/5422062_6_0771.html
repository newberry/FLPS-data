   <p>There is one aspect of the Balkan War which is as thrilling as anything which the world has known in many ages. The most glorious of all the nations of antiquity, she who lit the torch of knowledge and civilization on the continent of Europe, is striving to rise again from her knees and to stand in honor among her children.</p>
   <p>Whatever may be the motives of the other allies who in the most astonishing war in modern times have cowed and humbled the infamous Turk, Greece, at any rate, is fighting for an idea, and that fact should make her cause sacred in the eyes of mankind.</p>
   <p>When nations go to war for trade, for commerce, for material advantage, their deeds and the consequences of their deeds are on their own heads. They cannot awaken enthusiasm for their cause in other lands. But when, like Greece, they fight for unity, independence, and spiritual life, the sympathies of our common humanity are on their side.</p>
   <p>Unless Friend Intervenes, Greece Will Not Get Just Rights</p>
   <p>And yet in the approaching settlement of the results of this surprising war there is danger that unless some strong and resolute friend intervenes in her behalf, gallant little Greece will fail to obtain her just rights and will be crowded back into her diminutive peninsula with her dream of expansion into a new and broader national life destroyed, perhaps forever.</p>
   
   <p>If the great nations of Europe should now permit this outrage and suffer the aspirations of Greece to be stifled in the conflict of rival interests, their conduct would be as revolting as would be that of a family of strong, vigorous children who allowed their poor, weak, overburdened mother to be trodden under foot without lifting a hand to save her!</p>
   <p>For Greece is truly the mother of Europe. Its nations have all been her sons, of whom Rome was the eldest.</p>
   <p>The life-blood of a nation is its civilization, and first among the Aryan peoples in Europe the Greeks turned to the things of the mind, producing philosophy, science, social order, and a political constitution, the things which taken together constitute civilization.</p>
   <p>"The grandeur which was Rome" was founded upon "the glory which was Greece." Rome adorned her cities with the masterpieces of Greek art and purified and strengthened her intellect by following the footsteps of Greek thinkers.</p>
   
   <p>When Cicero visited Athens, he marched as an acolyte in the sacred procession to Eleusis and regarded that day as the proudest day of his life.</p>
   <p>When Europe was plunged into the gloom of the Dark Ages, the first gleam of returning light came from the rediscovery of what Greece had thought and done. The life-blood of the mother then flowed strong in the veins of her awakening sons. They felt and accepted its stimulus, but for all that, they left her to perish and even trampled her under their feet in selfish indifference.</p>
   <p>She inspired the Saracens with her spirit of intellectual freedom and thus enabled them to keep the light of knowledge burning in Spain when it had been extinguished over all the rest of the continent.</p>
   <p>"Among the Greeks," wrote Hegel, "we feel ourselves immediately at home, for there we are in the realm of the spirit."</p>
   <p>America herself owes the very thought and the very name of democracy to Greece.</p>
   
   <p>That name comes from the Greek words demos (people) and kratein (reign). Greece taught the world that the people are their own governors.</p>
   <p>We cannot excuse ourselves by saying that the Greeks of to-day are degenerate and are not the true descendants of the men of Marathon and of the contemporaries of Pericles, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. It is true that there has been an intermixture of other blood in Greece, mainly Slavic and Albanian (the ancient Illyrian), but the old blood, the old names, the old spirit are not extinguished. They strike you with startling effect when you visit that glorious land. I myself have read, with the feeling of one awaking from a dream, over the door of a shop in modern Corinth, "Solon and Company, Fine Wines."</p>
   <p>The scholar who has studied Greek in college sees everywhere on signs, in newspapers, and on the walls of railway stations, the classic letters that before had seemed to him to belong only to Homer. He finds the people on the street and in the market conversing in the old tongue that Socrates employed. He sees the children in the schools reading the "Iliad" and the speeches of Demosthenes as he, when a schoolboy, read "Paradise Lost"and the orations of Daniel Webster.</p>
   <p>That Greek Spirit Is Not Dead Proved by Present Pride</p>
   <p>The best proofs that the spirit of Greece is not dead are the pride of her people in her great past, the sacrifices which they are now making to carry out their ideal of national unity, and the gratitude which every Greek, in any part of the world to which he may have wandered or have been driven, instantly expresses for the least word of sympathetic interest in the aspirations of his country.</p>
   <p>Let Greece have Crete. Let her have Macedonia. Let the blight of Turkish oppression' be removed from all who speak her tongue and feel a pride in her achievements, and then, perhaps, that mysterious breath of the spirit, which makes nations great when it touches them, will once more blow over the old land and prepare it to teach the world new lessons in the true glory of manhood.</p>
