   <p>Chicago Greeks are not in favor of a Grecian republic at this time, according to views expressed last night. The consensus of opinion is that love of the king is inborn in their race. Interviews follow.</p>
   <p>P. Armyriotis, Greek Consul: I am much in favor of a Greek monarchy. The Greeks at this time have not the experience to maintain a republic. Thrace should never be given up for any price.</p>
   <p>Peter S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star: I agree with Venizelos that Greece is not yet ready for a republic. We have as examples Russia and Ireland. Greece will be a democracy with Venizelos the actual ruler. Thrace is the <span class="page-break">\2</span>native land of Themistoeles. Not a Greek living would countenance giving up Thrace.</p>
   <p>Nick Kokinis, president of the Greek Community of Chicago: I have never considered the possibility of Greece as a republic. I feel,and I think that eighty-five per cent of the Greeks here agree with me, that the king is very dear to the Greek people. His troubles were caused by Venizelos.</p>
   <p>James Michalaros, editor of the Chicago Greek Daily: By all means a republic. That is the policy of this newspaper and of ninety-five per cent of the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>Anthanasius A. Pantelis, lawyer, 155 North Clark Street: There is no question in my mind but that a republic would be better. The people of Greece are competent to govern themselves.</p>
   <p>The Hellenic Liberal League of Chicago sent a cablegram to the president of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the revolutionary government in Greece last night urging that bloodshed be avoided and saying that the royalist government must go.</p>
