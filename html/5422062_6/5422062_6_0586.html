   <p>The Brotherhood of the Palechoriton of Chicago was organized fifteen years ago. Its purpose is to build a good road from Palechori (a town in Greece) To Elonis. This road will cost about 600,000 drachmas.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. C. Damascus has been President, the Brotherhood has been making great progress. Mr. Damascus is well-known in the business world, and he is a representative of the J. Hungerford Smith Co. In Denver, and Kansas City, and at a picnic here in Chicago, Mr. Damascus collected large sums of money from the Palechorites in those centers, for the aforementioned purpose.</p>
   <p>The treasury now contains $15,000. Mr. Damascus is worthy of congratulations for his zealous efforts.</p>
