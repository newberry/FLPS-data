   <p>Last Sunday at 2:30 p. m. an audience assembled in thelarge room of the Ashland Auditorium and was addressed by the new consul general, Mr. Yasilios Mamonas.</p>
   <p>Upon his arrival here in Chicago to assume his consular responsiblities Mr. Mammonas demonstrated that his main wish is that people of Greek origin, not only in Chicago but throughout the United States, may imitate by harmony, love, and unity a life of national activity which shall dispel the various grave dangers which threaten us and promote our racial welfare.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He therefore recently invited to the Greek consulate the presidents of the three sections of our community, Messrs. D. Stamos, G. Karambelas, and N. Kokkines, and also the Reverend Fathers K. Hatzidemetrios, A. Mandilares, and D. Vaenikos because he believed, and rightly, that these persons represent the Chicago Greek colony. Mr. Mammonas addressed these gentlemen as follows:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen, forgetting the past, we must unite as brothers to save our great and sacred country, which, at this present moment is facing one of the greatest crises in its history. No Greek lacks patriotic feeling; we must be an example for other Greek-Americans, and I am sure that all the Greeks in our various colonies will come to our aid, for we know and admire the chivalrous nature of the Greek."</p>
   <p>The three presidents assumed the task of finding a room for a meeting and of inserting in the newspapers something in regard to this conference. The happy advent of unity and concord was hailed with joy, and all averred that a new era was being inaugurated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>For this was the first time since the Greeks here have been divided by the political feud in Greece that reconciliation and harmony had been proposed. The newspapers were notified, the announcement was published, and invitations and printed programs were distributed. At 2:30 p. m. in spite of the intolerable cold and various obstacles arising from the epidemic of influenza, the members of our Greek colony began to pour in from all parts of the city. The orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Bazon, played several numbers. The room was decorated with flags.</p>
   <p>Precisely at 3 p. m. the arrival of the consul general with his staff was announced. The orchestra immediately struck up the national march, and with long-continued applause the gathering welcomed the consul general, who mounted the platform with other dignitaries. When quiet had been restored the orchestra played the American and the Greek national anthems. Thereafter the president of the West Side Greek community, Mr. Kokkines, introduced the only speaker of the day, Consul General Yasilios Mammonas.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Mr. Mammonas's speech in outline follows:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and gentlemen: I have the good fortune to find myself among you, whom I love and appreciate as fellow-Greeks and children of one great Mother.</p>
   <p>"I used to follow your progress when I was far away from this land, and I consider myself now very fortunate to be able to meet my fellow-countrymen in the United States. Your work is great and admirable in this large and prosperous country, and every one is astonished that you have advanced so far, socially and commercially, with nothing to aid you, but your own native capacity.</p>
   <p>"I hope that you will allow me, as an individual and as a representative of our beloved country, to express my opinion as to how we can better and more successfully pursue our careers as individuals as merchants and as scions of the great nation of Greece, of which the past history is so glorious, but which as present is passing through critical times.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"The first things which we Greeks require are love, concord, and unity, for through these we can present a powerful front against whatever dangers threaten us and achieve our national and individual desires. In order to attain love, concord, and unity, it is incumbent upon each one of you to respect the political and individual opinions of one another. Political parties which are sane and peaceable are necessary and profitable for any country because in times of peace, by debate and competition, they bring out the true answers to questions, but when the country is experiencing external difficulties or wars, internal political strife is abated, and the nation presents a united front, and by this unity dangers are averted and purposes are accomplished.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I say that what we need is spiritual progress equal to our material progress and analogous to it, for as civilized people we can by advancing spiritually retain whatever we have acquired, improve our condition, and satisfy the claims of society, of ethics, of our mother country, and of foreign relations. For this spiritual advancement we need churches and schools which by cooperative effort will not only improve our own generation but will also preserve our racial integrity on the face of mother earth.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"Our churches and schools must be reared not by mendicant solicitation but by voluntary contributions. We need decent clubs in which we can meet and receive American people, with whom we can cultivate and develop acquaintances that will be of great benefit.</p>
   <p>"Our great country's hopes rely upon you. Greece is constantly eager to learn through her representatives of your commercial and social progress, and she feels proud of your achievements. Let us continue our good work for our descendants and endeavor to make them better men, of type superior to ours."</p>
   <p>After taking both the American and the Greek flags in his hands, Mr. Mammonas continued:</p>
   <p>"Let them both be blessed by God, glorified, beloved, and united for the happiness of all their children of this great nation of America, in which you have found welcome and a chance to make your careers, and to the interests of which you are as much devoted as to those of your native land, and reinforced also by the good wishes, the admiration, the unflagging interest, and the protection of our blue <span class="page-break">\7</span>and white flag, which is now engaged in incessant struggles to regain that ancient glory and power which our land possessed when it was the home of civilization and the cradle of Christianity, let us show that we are worthy children of two glorious and hallowed countries.</p>
   <p>"Hurrah for our nation!"</p>
   <p>After the speech the audience expressed its enthusiasm with cheers and hand-clapping. Every one in attendance congratulated the consul general, and all went home full of enthusiasm.</p>
