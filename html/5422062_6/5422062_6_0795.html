   <p>Here is another instance verifying our contention that the Greeks of Chicago always lead in affairs concerning our Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>A committee of prominent Chicago Greeks was formed to quicken the fund campaign for the girls' Orphanage in Tripolis, Greece. An Appeal is sent out to all Greek Communities in the United States, to send in their contributions to the following address which is the center of all activities for the fund campaign.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demetra Papalexandris</p>
   <p>% Greek-American Bank</p>
   <p>Cor. Halsted &amp; Blue Island Ave.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>The committee is composed of the following members: Hon. N. Salopoulos, Consul General of Greece, Rev. L. Pegeas, Rev. A. Mandilaris, Rev. H. Panagopoulos, and Messrs. A. Geokaris, John Refakis, Thomas Chamalis and Andrew J. Vlachos.</p>
