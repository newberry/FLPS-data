   <p>The family of Christos Damascus wishes to thank the readers of the Saloniki for their expressions of sympathy upon the tragic death of their beloved Christos. He worked very hard as editor of the Saloniki in order to help the progress of the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We, his bereaved family, are proud of his efforts, and if he has helped his people, he has not died in vain. His death was attributed to a long illness caused by overwork and worry.</p>
