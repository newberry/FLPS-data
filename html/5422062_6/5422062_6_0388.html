   <p>We have observed that some of our fellow countrymen in Chicago squander their wealth and spend their money extravagantly for useless things. We therefore consider it proper to remind our readers at Christmas time of the advice of our venerable sage Adamantios Koraes, and we reprint his comments on riches:</p>
   <p>"My dear friends, the wealth which destiny bestows on some of us may result in slavery of the soul. Abundance of riches and great treasure are blessings only to those who possess noble souls and know the true use of wealth.</p>
   <p>"The real use of wealth today is to heal the wounds of your country--to provide medicine and to pay the doctor's fees. The medicine [which it requires] is scientific knowledge, and the doctors are learned professional men.</p>
   <p>"What profit do you derive of your wealth if you do not know how to use it in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>rearing and educating your children? What is the use of leaving a fortune to heirs whose ignorance will make your riches an instrument of evil instead of the means of accomplishing good? What can you expect of wealth if it is not accompanied by virtue?</p>
   <p>"Do you think that gold alone can efface the shame of being the ignorant son of an illiterate father or of being a barbarian in a land enslaved? The money which you spend in charity may be wasted; the best way to help the poor is to eradicate the causes of their poverty instead of feeding them. Poverty is in most cases the result of voluntary idleness or of common disaster. Excessive idleness and poverty exist where there are no industry and no science, and parasites rule the people."</p>
   <p>Thus the great Greek scholar wrote about wealth a hundred years ago. We present his remarks to our readers for consideration.</p>
