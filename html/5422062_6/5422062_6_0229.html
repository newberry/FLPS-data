   <p>The Athenian Operetta Company, after its triumphal appearance last Sunday and the prompt support tendered to it by the Greeks of Chicago, has made the courageous decision to continue its performances at the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The continuation of the program in the largest theater of Chicago by the Greek troupe is a large gesture which we have no doubt that the Greek people of Chicago will properly appreciate.</p>
   <p>The mere mention of this fact is enough to prove that the Greek element in this great city is on the highest material and cultural level. The Athenian Operetta troupe deserves congratulations for this demonstration to Americans. It honors the Greek colony of Chicago as a whole, which will hasten to tender its support to the Greek theater. This theater will convey to us a vivid picture of our national life and activity and take us back mentally to our native land.</p>
