   <p>p. 3- The only people who understand foreign languages, especially English, are the country folk of Greece. The mail-carriers of Chicago can verify this statement and God knows what they think and say when they deliver some of the letters sent from Greece to Greeks in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Here is how they are addressed:</p>
   <p>Mr. So and So.</p>
   <p>Cafe and Restaurant, Open all Night,</p>
   <p>Fresh Meats and Pastry, Splendid Service,</p>
   <p>45 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly these unsophisticated country folk, who copy what they write from business cards sent to them by relatives here, think that those queer Americans have no appreciation of laconism, since they use so many words for a simple address.</p>
