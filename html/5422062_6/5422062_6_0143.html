Over one thousand Greeks gathered there to say good bye to 120 Greeks who were leaving for Greece on the Ahepa excursion. The Chicago Greeks in New York, with others from all over the country, will board a special chartered boat leaving for Greece on a good will visit.</p>
   <p>About 50 per cent of the departing Chicago Greeks expect to marry there and bring their brides to America. Out of the 120 there is only one, who is engaged and expects to marry on his return. He said that he is making the trip for recreation only.</p>
