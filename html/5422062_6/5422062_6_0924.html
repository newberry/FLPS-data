   <p>P.3--Because of lack of funds the municipal authorities in our native town, Gerakion, are unable to construct certain very much needed public works, in particular a new and larger church to accommodate the worshippers, our former fellow-townsmen. Therefore the Chicago Gerakiton Society was formed six months ago with the specific purpose of raising money by contributions or by other means to assist our native country in obtaining the things which it needs.</p>
   <p>The very first thing that we intend to accomplish is the rebuilding of Koimisis Tis Theotokou Church in Gerakion. Therefore the Gerakites Fraternity of Chicago appeals to all native sons of Gerakion in the United States to send in their contributions so that the erection of the church may begin at once. Depending upon the patriotic sentiments of our fellow-Gerakites in the United States, I beg to remain</p>
