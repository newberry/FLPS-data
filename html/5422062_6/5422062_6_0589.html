   <p>Yesterday's telegraph from Paris brought us the news of the attempted assassination of Venizelos by two of his compatriots. He was shot in the shoulder and in the thigh. He was taken immediately to a hospital where his wounds were examined.</p>
   <p>Saloniki note: Greeks! The man who has placed our flag in Constantinople, in Smyrna, in Thrace, in Macedonia, in Ipiros, and in the Islands has nearly been murdered by the scum of our generation under the leadership of Kopronimus in Switzerland. With both your hands and your feet you should Moudzosete (a gesture using the open hand; a typical Greek expression of disgust) these traitors to Greece. Cursed be they and their sympathizers.</p>

   <p>We beseech the Divine Healer and Holy God of Greece to spare the life of the "Liberator of Our Generation," Eleutherios Venizelos.</p>
