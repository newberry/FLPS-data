   <p>Again we are writing about the vital question of the license fee or the personal tax levy on the Greek residents of America which is scheduled to be imposed very soon. We call the attention of our fellow countrymen to our clear arguments so that in the future they will not be misled by anti-nationalists, who for purely selfish purposes are putting obstacles in our way. At this time, we do not intend to discuss the motives of those who would frustrate all our efforts. We shall not take their judgments and opinions into consideration, because above all, there is a higher ideal; that is, the desire to serve our country. The Greek government has appealed to our people and has asked them to comply with the law requesting the regular financial support of those Greeks who are living in foreign countries.</p>
   <p>What Greek, who is conscious of his place of birth and who truly loves his country, will refuse to contribute a per capita tax of two, five, or ten dollars per year?</p>
   <p>What Greek, who is vitally concerned with the national interests, would be so callous as not to utter a cry of protest and contempt against those who would work against our plan?</p>
   <p>Even if we give a casual glance at the voluntary contributions or to our many concerted drives during the last ten years we shall see that we have not been able to collect even the comparatively small sum of $200,000. Besides, those who have contributed to the various funds from time to time have been the same men. It is easy to see that those who open new drives for any purpose always hope to get more money from a small group of generous and wealthy fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>It is thus shown that our haphazard drives for contributions have not been very effective. Then,too, they have been restricted to a certain number of Greeks. Finally, a few self-seeking false patriots have infiltrated into the ranks of good, upstanding,and patriotic collectors of national funds for the evident purpose of taking advantage of the good will and confidence of our people.</p>
   <p>The sacred name of our country has been used as a pretext to patriotism. We do not wish to enumerate the many abuses that have taken place. Many of them, however, have been discovered and even large scale drives have been organized for private purposes.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, therefore, the Greek government has felt the need to organize systematic drives by asking every Greek to pay a tax which will be imposed by law. It is not hard to see what great benefits can be derived for our homeland and for the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>In the first place the amount is insignificant, for we know that all three classes of our people can contribute much more if they are approached in the right way. There is no doubt whatever that every one of us, with only a few exceptions, would be proud to have our names on the official record of the local consulates. This will prove that we respect the laws of our homeland and that we have never ceased thinking of it.</p>
   <p>According to the most accurate estimates four hundred thousand Greeks in America could contribute one million dollars annually or ten million dollars (fifty million drachmas) over a period of ten years. Do not be surprised at these sums; they are not exaggerated figures nor are we day dreaming. They are the result of careful figuring; it is only up to us to work hard and help the consuls enforce the laws.</p>
   <p>Now let us compare these amounts with the two hundred thousand dollars which we have gathered over a period of ten years. We shall readily see that the payment of a per capita tax is the only effective, the most dignified way of becoming financially independent. This measure will secure a definite income for our homeland and we shall dispense with small, ineffective, and local drives.</p>
   
   <p>So, for these reasons and in the name of our country, we recommend that our countrymen pay the tax to our homeland and support our consulates so that this sacred cause may contribute to the welfare of all.</p>
   <p>Of course, we do not intend to discourage those of our good people who wish to give small affairs for voluntary contributions. They can do both at the same time; that is pay the tax and try to raise additional funds by other methods. But, by all means, let us not let our country down. It needs our support for its reconstruction and for very urgent military preparations.</p>
   <p>Note: In this article we do not wish to interfere with the national defense drive for funds which is conducted by our soldier patriot, Mr. Spiro Matsoukas. We wish to emphasize that our proposed tax plan will and must not interfere with the marvelous work of Mr. Matsoukas. He has come here to arouse the sentiments and inspire the Greeks with love for eternal Hellas. He is another Regas Fereos who goes around rallying the people to the cause of liberty and the vindication of our national rights.</p>
