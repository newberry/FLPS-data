   <p>P. 4- On last Tuesday the Chicago Kosmites, under the auspices of their Society, the Agiol Anargykoi, Composed of natives of Kosma, Kynovrias, Greece, held a benefit picnic to raise funds for the erection of a new high-school building in their native town.</p>
   <p>Other fellow- Greeks of ours participated in the affair of the Kosmites, and a crowd of more than 1800 enjoyed themselves at Peterson Park, where barbecued lambs, wine, and a great variety of appetizers were served.</p>
   <p>The frolic was a great success both in entertainment and in raising funds, and this success is attributed to the systematic efforts of Mr. Demetries Cheronis, president of the Society. The exact amount of money collected for their purpose has not been made public, but from all indications it will reach three or four thousand dollars.</p>

   <p>What noble activities these affairs are! Greeks do not forget the needs of their beloved Greece. The native town of the Kosmites was in need of a new school - building, and Mother Greece could not afford to build it; so her faithful sons in Chicago with smiles on their faces undertook to raise the funds. The new building will soon be erected, and coming generation will know that it was built by their progenitors living in Chicago. Illinois in the United States of America. This will indeed be a monument in Greece to Greek-Americans'.</p>
