   <p>Because Miss Ellen M. Stone, a Presbyterian missionary, was not allowed by the Greek and Servian armies to enter a belligerent Greek province to do missionary work, she 1st loose a storm of accusation and insults against Greeks and Servians and stated that the Greeks are worse than the Turks.</p>
   <p>This so-called Christian young lady must be misinformed if not uneducated. Impartial foreign observers have already discovered and informed the world at large that the Greeks are more human than we thought they were. Mr. Koutsogianis has sent the following correction to the press</p>
   <p>Editor Chicago Daily Journal:</p>
   <p>Refering to the article by Miss Ellen M. Stone, a Presbytarian missionary, in the Chicago Daily Journal, I beg to state that she is in error in her statements in regard to Greek and Servian countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It should seem that her reason for saying that the Greeks are worse than the Turks is that she is not permitted to enter a Greek province to do missionary work.</p>
   <p>In regard to that I wish to say that the nation of Greece is the foundation stone of Christianity, and that its people do not permit outsiders to teach them any other doctrine than that which was originally founded on the Greek Bible. Greece to-day is superior to any other country in continental Europe in civilization and in Christianity. Moreover, my people in this country are peaceable, religious, and law-abiding citizens, and very prosperous in business and otherwise.William Koutsogianis</p>
