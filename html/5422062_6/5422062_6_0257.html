   <p>The progressive spirit of the Greek, guided and enriched by the dominant spirit of America, made its invasion in Greece, and a Greek Young Men's Christian Association will soon be erected. Greeks and friends of Greece raised $1,000,000 for its erection.</p>
   <p>The edefice which will shelter young Greeks, will be built up exclusively of pure white marble, of Mount Pentelis, and its plans already are drawn up by American architects. The site for the institution is donated by the Greek Government, and its worth is $250,000.</p>
   <p>The Young Greek Christian Association will teach drama, gymnastics, football, tennis, religious education, commerce, geography, languages, etc., that is to say, it will not repeat what is taught in colleges and in the universities but will supplement teaching along practical lines, useful in every stage of life.</p>
