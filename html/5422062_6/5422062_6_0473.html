   <p>(Special Dispatch to Saloniki From the American Relief Committee of the Far East)</p>
   <p>New York, March 19, 1923.</p>
   <p>Three thousand refugees, after concentrating at Mersina in Asia Minor, have been ordered by the Turkish authorities either to leave the port within a day on boats which are not there or to return inland.</p>
   <p>To return inland means that the majority of these refugees will die on the journey.</p>
   <p>The Greek Government at Athens declares that it cannot provide the funds needed to transport these Greek Refugees of Asia Minor from Mersina to Greece and requests the American Relief Committee to take the responsibility of supplying them with food on their journey.</p>
   
   <p>The condition of ten thousand more refugees concentrated at Halepion and Alexandretta in Asia Minor is also tragic, although the Greek Government has promised them transportation to Greece before May 1st.</p>
