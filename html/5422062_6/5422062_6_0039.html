   <p>Dear Mr. Pantelis:</p>
   <p>Your letter of March 23 was duly received, but I have not had the opportunity to reply to the same because of the many official duties confronting me at this time.</p>
   <p>I appreciate the kindness of His Excellency, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Greece, in forwarding to Hellenic Post No. 343, American Legion, Department of Illinois, the flag of the Republic of Greece with directions that it be presented through me to the people of the State of Illinois, and would like to comply with your request in designating a date when this presentation might be made.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>However, as every minute of my time is taken up with the activities of the General Assembly, it seems almost impossible for me to fix a day when I can attend your gathering; hence, I believe the best plan would be for you to arrange a date that would be convenient to the members of your organization, and then if possible for me to steal away for that evening, I will do so. If I am unable to come, I will then send one to represent me.</p>
   <p>Assuring you again of my very great appreciation for the kindness of yourself and the members of your organization in this matter, I am,</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Louis L. Emmerson,</p>
   <p>Governor.</p>
