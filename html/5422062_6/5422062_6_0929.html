   <p>p. 3.-Since I shall soon leave for Greece, I request those who have any business transactions to conduct with me to communicate with me at the following address: John Condis, 190 East Madison street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>That is a sensible and clean way to do business. Undoubtedly Mr. Condis, being in business, has more to pay than to receive; nevertheless he wishes to settle all his accounts before he departs for his native Kastri. Congratulations to such a fellow Greek, and we wish that we all would publish such announcements in both the Greek and the American newspapers for the benefit of all concerned.</p>
