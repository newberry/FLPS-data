   <p>At a meeting of the Greek cabinet it was decided to create salaried consular positions in the United States. It is well known that until now Chicago's Greek consular officials have received no salary from the Greek government.</p>
   <p>The consular question is a very delicate one, since it has given many Greek lawyers and others the opportunity to transact official business and to draw up all sorts of documents and contracts for our people who want to finish their business with the consulate.</p>
   <p>Many of us have been complaining about the competency of our consuls. We in Chicago should consider ourselves fortunate in having as the Greek consul a sympathetic, educated, sociable, and patriotic man like Dr. Nicholas Salopoulos.</p>
   <p>It is our weakness to have our leaders and officials changed, dismissed, or transferred for no reason whatever. Let us not be fickle and unreasonable. We should support men of ability. Let those who know judge them.</p>
