   <p>p. 3- After living in the United States a quarter of a century, for the last twenty-three years in Chicago, S. N. Loumos, an old-timer and a very active member of our Greek community, left last week for Chrysafa, Sparta, Greece, his native town.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loumos was one of those first social workers who put their shoulders to the wheel and established the first Greek church in Chicago. He was also one of the foremost figures in organizing the Lycurgus Society, the first Greek society established here. He has a golden heart and a really Spartan character. He is an uncle of P. S. Lambros, the publisher of the Star. More than fifty friends and relatives waited at the station to bid him bon voyage.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loumos goes back to Greece with knowledge and ideas acquired in America, and he will undoubtedly utilize them to the advantage of his native Chrysafa.</p>
