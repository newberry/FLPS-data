   <p>The Gegeates of Chicago, who are distinguished for their generous contributions for every Natiohal, Religious, and Educational purpose, in a great meeting last Sunday, raised the sum of $944.75, for the erection of a new and better church for the population of their native town, similar to the Greeks churches we have in this country.</p>
   <p>This serves to show the Greek spirit of progressiveness, is always on the go, and is not limited itself only to the welfare of the Greeks of Chicago, but extends its scope to the Old World, following closely the generosity of the American Spirit,</p>
