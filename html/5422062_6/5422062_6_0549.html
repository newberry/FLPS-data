   <p>The "National Defense" is not a partisan organization, nor is it concerned with partisan objectives. On the contrary, its aim is to submerge the partisanship sentiment for the sake of a national one.</p>
   <p>If the liberals wish to add to and participate in the activities of the "National Defense" they have the right and obligation to do so. But if they mean to turn it into a chattel of their own they are mistaken and, worse than all, their views are destructive to the purpose of the organization.</p>
   <p>The reasons that cause these remarks are some telegrams sent from Chicago as to the formation of sections and committees. Our surprise was even greater when we came across a telegram from the North Side, which was signed by Const. Ch. Demitriou and whereby the formation of a section was announced, composed of liberals.</p>

   <p>If the "National Defense" in America is to take that course it is no use proclaiming that it has nothing to do with partisanship.</p>
   <p>We all remember the mass gathering in Chicago of March 30th, where our compatriots of the whole community, regardless of party beliefs, rushed to hear the speakers and went ahead, having organized the "National Defense" two months before. The Greek Daily by a series of articles dwelt on the purpose of the organization, and by means of bulletins, invited our compatriots to join. Our compatriots rushed by the hundreds to become members of the "National Defense."</p>
