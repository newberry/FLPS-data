   <p>The Greeks of Chicago sent congratulations to the great liberator of Greece, Venizelos, and proclaimed him to be the savior of the Greek people.</p>
   <p>Thirty-five thousand Greeks of Chicago united to celebrate the liberation of Smyrna and the Dodecanese, and their reunion with the mother country. Smyrna is well-known, and is supposed to be the birthplace of Homer and Herodotus, the Father of History.</p>
   <p>Since the Italo-Turkish War of 1910-1911, the Dodecanese had been under Italian rule. They were given back to Greece only last week.</p>
   <p>The telegram to Venizelos says: "To E. Venizelos, Paris, France. The American Association of the Greek Churches of Chicago sends its congratulations to the Liberator of the Greek people; it asks the Almighty that you may live long for the sake of Greece."</p>
