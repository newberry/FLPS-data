   <p>We are indeed pleased to notice that the nation-wide Greek drives for funds to help the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate at Constantinople, the center of the Greek church, the Spiros Matsoukas fund for the purchase of artillery to be sent to Greece, the drive for the Greek warship which we intend to send to Greece as a gift, and the drive of the nation-wide Phoenix Society of the Cretans, are progressing steadily and in a most satisfactory manner.</p>
   <p>Our esteemed colleague, Atlantis, the national Greek daily of New York City, reports that its staff, reporters, and thousands of subscribers throughout the country were instrumental in and took the initiative to collect more than forty thousand dollars for the aforementioned sacred and patriotic purposes. Hence, it is proved that the Greeks as a whole are generous and keenly aware of their patriotic duties as genuine sons and daughters of glorious and beloved Hellas. The Greek Star takes this opportunity to congratulate the Atlantis, distinguished and most powerful journalistic organ of the Greeks of America, for its initiative and high purposes in conducting a vast campaign for the needs of our homeland.</p>
   <p>We, the Greeks of Chicago, cannot boast about such a remarkable accomplishment. To others belong the laurels and praises this time. We now ask--why has Chicago failed to measure up to expectations? To find the proper answer to this vital question we must deal with the conditions and the state of affairs within our community and among our leaders. We notice with deep regret that no evidence of sustained patriotism has been shown anywhere among the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The two most influential and most powerful organizations in Chicago, the Greek Community of Chicago and the Panhellenic League which claim to have great influence over the Greek people of Chicago have failed to respond to the urgent appeals of our homeland for its many needs. Was it not the duty of such organizations to start extensive drives for the collection of funds in the Middle Western States or at least in the state of Illinois? Evidently, the leaders and officials of these two organizations are in a "blessed state of hibernation". Because of their indifference and inertia our national interests, that is, the vital interests of our homeland, have been dangerously injured. At least, they have not contributed much to the cause of our homeland because they have made no serious effort to organize a drive and collect funds from our people who would only too willingly give to any praiseworthy cause.</p>
   <p>It seems that our leaders have lost their courage and do not dare work for national and patriotic purposes. But since they are merely loafers and cowardly good-for-nothings why are they standing in the way, hindering all the others who are able and willing to work?</p>
   <p>It is obviously because of such rotten elements within our Community that the once famed Greek Community of Chicago is paralyzed and is gradually falling apart. Some say that this Community is one of the poorest and worst administered Greek communities in America, considering its size and record.</p>
   <p>This is the state of affairs in our own society at this moment; in the meantime the masses of our people are deeply disappointed in our leaders. Nothing else remains but to wait and see which of the two shall prevail; the concern for our national needs or the callous indifference and lethargy of our "official titleholders".</p>
   <p>Let us hope and pray that in the name of our country we wake up and show that we are worthy of our destiny and our future as a free and great people.</p>
