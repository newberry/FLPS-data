   <p>The representatives of the American Commercial Commission at the international Commercial Conference in Switzerland, have issued the following statement through Mr. Oliver Sand, president of the First National Bank of Richmond, Virginia:</p>
   <p>"The political and economic condition of the Near East resembles a volcano, the flame of which daily consumes innumerable souls. The only assistance accorded to the refugees comes from the American Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>"The American people have the right to speak out loudly for the sake of humanity. The present condition is cruel and inhuman, civilization must not allow it to continue.</p>
   <p>"The desire of America is to see the cessation of the disputes and the intrigues now being carried on by certain nations and to find an equitable solution to the problems of the Near East.</p>
   <p>"A monthly five- dollar donation is sufficient to keep a refugee child alive.</p>
