   <p>The Chicago Greek consul general hereby notifies Greek citizens who are under his jurisdiction that by a legislative order of December 29, 1922, the duties on stamped paper are increased 50%. This order takes effect February 14, 1923.</p>
   <p>The additional tax of 10% which is to be collected from the public for the forced loan will also be collected hereafter in accordance with the increased tax-schedule of the new legislative order.</p>
   <p>We shall therefore make it our practice from now on to collect for consular services 50% more than the amount heretofore charged.</p>
