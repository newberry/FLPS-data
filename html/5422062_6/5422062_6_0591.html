   <p>The Tegean Society in Athens, Greece, has written a letter to all Tegean organizations in America, asking for financial help. It is desired that a Memorial monument be built to honor the Tegean heroes who gave their lives on the battlefields for freedom. In this [proposed] marble monument, a fire will be kept continuously burning, symbolic of the undying patriotism of the Tegeans (natives of the town Tegea).</p>
   <p>The Athenian society asks Tegeans in America to help them build this memorial, which will be a tribute to heroism and patriotism, by sending donations.</p>
   <p>Editor's note [sic]--Within a few days, businessmen of Tegean descent <span class="page-break">2</span>will be visited by a person asking for contributions. Will they please co-operate!</p>
