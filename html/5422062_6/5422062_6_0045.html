   <p>For the information of our readers, regarding the origin of choosing queens of beauty as is done here and abroad, we were obliged to delve into history, and bring out the data of beauty contests in by-gone days.</p>
   <p>History tells us that beauty contests were supreme in the Byzantine Empire. The Queen of Beauty, who was chosen from the four corners of the great empire, was also chosen to become Queen of the realm, that is to say to marry the Emperor.</p>
   <p>Here, besides other historical events, we narrate how Miss Paflagonia was chosen. The dowager Empress of the Byzantium, Irene, wanting to find a Queen for her son Constantine, sent imperial messengers to every part of the empire to choose and bring forth the beauties of the realm, that Constantine might select his queen.</p>

   <p>Her orders to the various representatives were to be strictly followed, that is to say, in the color of the hair, the size of the foot, the size of the whole anatomy, as ordered by the Emperor.</p>
   <p>Time, territory and expenses were not to be considered as obstacles to the representatives of the Dowager. Such a mission of her Majesty's connoisseurs of beauty was neither irksome or fatiguing.</p>
   <p>The seekers of beauty traveled far and wide and by chance, or device, visited the home of a beauty who recently, in a local contest had been chosen Miss Paflagonia. Their visit was very successful. The beauty possessed all the requirements of the future Empress of the Grecian empire.</p>
   <p>Miss Paflagonia, although poorly dressed, was escorted by the imperial officers to the capital, Constantinople.</p>

   <p>To her dismay, when she arrived in the palace, she was joined by a bevy of beauties brought in from other parts of the realm. Some of them, shining like stars, were bedecked with gems; some were ladies with fortunes; some were the daughters of Generals; some, the flowers of aristocracy, and the future Empress, although extremely beautiful, and very wise, was not looked on as a serious competitor to any one present. She was poor and demure.</p>
   <p>Miss Paflagonia, whose name was Mary, being sensible and not believing herself likely to be chosen a winner, made the following proposition to the contestants; "Let us give our promise, that the one who will be chosen as Empress,shall take care of the rest of us". But the daughter of a General, with contempt, replied. "I'm certain, that I shall be selected as Queen and Empress. I am the richest, the most aristocratic, and the most beautiful, The rest of you, although having pretty faces, lack aristocratic ancestory, and when lacking dowry, also you might as well retreat now."</p>

   <p>The impudence of the aristocratic beauty was soon punished. When the nomineer were parading before the Dowager, his son, the Emperor, and the Prime Minister, who were the three Judges, the Mother Empress, addressed the General's daughter as follows. "You are very sympathetic, but not suitable as wife of the Emperor.</p>
   <p>The poor, beautiful and wise Mary was chosen by Constantine as wife and Empress.</p>
   <p>Another event worth telling was in the year of 421 B.C. Theodosius, the Emperor, married "Miss Athenae", the daughter of a university professor, named, Athenais. The chosen beauty who also was Empress of Byzantium, this time was a blonde with wonderfully wide-awake eyes, the faultless nose of an ancient Greek maiden, melodious voice, and the lines of her (royal) body would have made Aphrodite look like an anateur.</p>
   <p>Miss Athenae, being a pagan, was baptised and named Eudokia. A few weeks later she married Theodosius and became queen.</p>
