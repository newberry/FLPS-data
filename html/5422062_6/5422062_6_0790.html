   <p>Greece, our mother-country, is at this moment mobilizing her sons to fight the hated barbarian oppressor and all the reserves of the army are urged to hurry home and take up their arms for her defense.</p>
   <p>Five thousand of our fellow-Greeks met Friday night and made arrangements to leave for Greece. Three hundred will depart to-morrow and thousands of others, sworn to the sacred flag that symbolizes the immortal Greek courage, will go as soon as the executive committee is able to arrange transportation.</p>
   <p>They have sworn to go back, win more wreaths of laurel, as the heroes of old and once more write another golden page in the history of mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>At this critical moment my trust is that every able-bodied man will make his earliest preparations and report for duty.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Salopoulos</p>
   <p>Consul of Greece.</p>
