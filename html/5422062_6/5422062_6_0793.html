   <p>Dr. Constantine N. Papamichalopoulos, for twenty-two years a member of the Chamber of Deputies in Greece, is here in Chicago on a tour of the country to study the conditions of life among Greek immigrants.</p>
   <p>The distinguished statesman and former Minister of Public Instruction in Greece with a serene simplicity said to a crowd who gathered to honor him.</p>
   <p>From our childhood we are taught love and respect for this country, which, without assuming the role of Greece's protector, as some European Powers have done, has never missed an opportunity to honor and benefit Greece. America's sympathetic manifestations towards Greece began in 1827, and a year later the first mass meeting in support of the Greek cause was held in the city hall of New York City. During the war of Crete against Turkey 1866-68 thousands of dollar's of provisions, medicines and clothes were sent to the committee in Svra which had charge of the women and children that had fled as refugees from Crete. Greece will always remember the friendliness of the United States.</p>
   <p>Dr. Papamichalopoulos said that he is greatly impressed by the development in citizenship the Greeks of America have reached.</p>
