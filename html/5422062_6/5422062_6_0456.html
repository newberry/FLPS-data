   <p>"The Near East Relief will pursue its labors in the future exactly as it has done in the past; it will take care of the already existing orphanages, in which most of the orphans from Asia Minor are located, and at the same time it will receive whatever orphans may be found in refugees' lodgings. I have witnessed with my own eyes how necessary it is to help these orphans."</p>
