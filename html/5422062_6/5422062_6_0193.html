   <p>The Greek progressiveness is manifested everywhere and in everything. Chicago Tegeatae, who have never ceased to love their native town and Greece, responded to the call for contributions.</p>
   <p>In their native Tegea a school was established to teach young girls how to become good mothers and good and useful housewives. This institution needs funds for its upkeep and perpetuation. The following Chicago Tegeatae contributed $50. each as a starting fund to be sent to Tegea. They are:</p>
   <p>Spyros Notopoulus, Nicholas Theodoropoulus, Basil Manetas, Photios Gickaris, Charalambos Georgaklis, Christ G. Svolos, Demetrios G. Svolos, John Ganas, Christ Nicolopoulos and George Gatsis.</p>
   <p>They are to be congratulated for their initiative in starting the contributions. Other Tegeatae will follow the example of the above mentioned contributors, and the necessary money will be raised.</p>
