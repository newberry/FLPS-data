   <p>Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>I have yours of the second instant, with enclosures.</p>
   <p>I very greatly appreciate the complimentary write-up in your paper, and I shall read your Joke Book with very great interest. One of the most pleasant experiences I have had in years was the banquet referred to, and I was especially glad to be able to thus make your acquaintance.</p>
   <p>I shall hereafter have an especially warm feeling for all Americans of Greek blood and ancestry.</p>
   <p>With kindest regards, I remain</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Irving L. Lerroot</p>
