   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"For the past nineteen years I have made my home in this country. All my possessions, my family, and my loyalty are in the United States of America. I am of Greek birth, and next to my adopted home, I have a feeling of sympathy for my homeland. I remember the great struggle in which both countries fought a common enemy, only a few years ago.</p>
   <p>"Every citizen must know of the horrible slaughter that is going on in Smyrna at this time. One hundred and fifty thousand civilians have been killed; houses, cities, and churches have been ransacked and burned; <span class="page-break">\2</span>35,000 Christian girls and women have been killed or kidnapped by the Turkish army. I do not wish to be understood as urging military action on the part of European or Christian nations, but I do wish to inquire if the awful slaughter cannot be stopped. I am convinced that I should ask, why do not the Christian nations act--warn--or protest against the Turks?</p>
   <p>"Greece, as a nation, holds a place in history that is known to all. By her being, by her battles at Marathon, her victories and defeats, and her historic cultural tradition, Greece has gained distinction and esteem amongst the nations of the world. Time and again Greece has saved Europe from barbarous Asiatic rule.</p>
   <p>"All must agree that the advance of the Turkish armies, or the increase of the Turkish domain means only the retreat of Christianity, the retrogression of civilization, and the increase of murder and spoliation. Turkish history has never been a record of progress for her people, or for the civilized world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Daily accounts in the newspaper record events which should cause Christian nations to protest and demand a cessation of this horrible slaughter. Without regard for the rights of either humanity or world opinion, the Turks are committing freely unspeakable crimes.</p>
   <p>"Cannot the Christian nations, without actually entering this war, stop wholesale murder of innocent women and children, and take some action to relieve thousands who are starving?"</p>
   <p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
   <p>Aristotle Theodoracoupoulos</p>
   <p>Chicago Heights, Sept. 19, 1922.</p>
