   <p>It is four months now since the new consul general came to Chicago to function as a diplomat of Greece in a friendly country, the United States of America. The United States is more than a friendly country to Greece. Every man, woman, and child of the Greek nation and race knows what America is to us. Paradoxically, the new Greek consul does not know what America is and means to us Greeks.</p>
   <p>This newspaper since its establishment eleven years ago, and its publisher, D. S. Eutaxias, for the last twenty years, have never failed, when occasion has arisen, to express the gratitude of Greece and the Greek people to the United States. And we have also never failed to <span class="page-break">2</span>caution and expose a fellow-Greek who happened either through ignorance or through some other cause to ignore or disregard our obligation and duty to the country that feeds us and gives us life.</p>
   <p>True to this principle, we have carefully followed the movements and scrutinized the actions of our new consul in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He is either ignorant of his diplomatic duty or no friend of the United States.</p>
   <p>The above assertion is not prompted by fancy, malice, or superficial judgment but by facts which we have painstakingly recorded step by step since his arrival.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>If a diplomat is not a friend of the United States, especially in the present crisis, what is he then? A neutral or an enemy! Here are the facts.</p>
   <p>Since his arrival the consul has been surrounded, socially and officially, by notorious Royalists of this city who were and are unfriendly to the Greek and American cause. They are the paid tools of Constantine's German propaganda. What did they, and what do they advocate? Peace at any cost. Why? Naturally they want Germany to win. These are the associates of our consul.</p>
   <p>Do we not say, Tell me who are your friends, and I will tell you what you are?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Socially the Greek consul may have the right to recognize these so-called pacifists or neutrals (who are wolves in sheep's clothing), but officially he has no right to use the Greek consulate of Chicago as a place for the enemies of America and of Greece to meet and conspire in. Up to this time the consul's movements and actions have been pro-Constantine and pro-Kaiser.</p>
   <p>With great sorrow we admit that in our consul general's recent and only speech not one single word about America was uttered; not a single word urging the populous Greek community of Chicago to enlist in the American Army. There was no mention of those who already have enlisted and are serving under the flag of our country; not a word of the Greek Government's proclamation authorizing Greek subjects residing in America to enlist in the United States Army. Where is the praise for those patriotic Greeks <span class="page-break">5</span>who responded to the call of the country and volunteered their services, leaving their business and their families and offering to shed their blood for the glory of the Stars and Stripes? Where are the mass-meetings of Greeks which should have been urged by the Greek diplomat to promote sales of Liberty bonds?</p>
   <p>Not a single gesture has he made toward the American cause. Is he a friend of the United States? No. A friend would show his friendliness, either by the acts above mentioned or in some other way. Is he a neutral? No, by Jupiter! No! A neutral would not permit his consular office to be the center of conspiracies made by the enemies of the country.</p>
   <p>What is he then? For the sake of decency the words of my answer will be sugared, since I do not like to rock the boat too hard in the present crisis lest the consul be proclaimed a martyr by his kind. The sugar-coated answer is, "Ignorant of his diplomatic duty."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It would be wise for this undiplomatic Greek diplomat to pack up and go before his utter humiliation comes. His recall, which undoubtedly is on the way, will be appreciated by Greeks and by the friends of Greeks. The Greek government will be his judge, and the Greek community of Chicago will bear witness to his pro-German activities.</p>
   <p>And in order to go through the proper diplomatic procedure and effect his recall as quickly as possible, we petition the Greek embassy in Washington to dispatch an examiner here and put the consul general in his proper place. The consulate is Greek and not the plotting-place of Germans and pro-Germans.</p>
   <p>In our next issue we shall publish the embassy's answer regarding the Greek consul of Chicago.</p>
