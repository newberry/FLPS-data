   <p>p. 1.- Last Friday our Greek Ambassador to Washington, Lambros Koromilas, arrived in our city. He spoke to our countrymen last Saturday and Sunday at Randolph Hall, at the West Side Church, the South Side Church and Hull House.</p>
   <p>This patriotic man came to tell us goodbye as he is leaving for Berlin to accept a higher position. He wanted to speak to the Greeks of Chicago for a last time before leaving, repeating to us the duty we owe our mother country. His speeches covered many subjects dear to the hearts of the Greeks, who have strayed from home. His words will be remembered by many for many years after his departure. We wish Mr. Koromilas the best of luck wherever he goes and can only say that we are sad to see him leave.</p>
