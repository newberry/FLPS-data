   <p>For a long time here in Chicago as well as in other parts of this country a mysterious underground force has been working silently and smoothly among the Greeks, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to mold their minds to worship and love their King Constantine, the Kaiser's brother-in-law, who has done his damndest to discredit, dishonor, and destroy Greece for the sake of his war-lord, the Kaiser.</p>
   <p>That force was and still is German propaganda to keep Greece from going to war on the side of the Allies, as Venizelos has advocated; and this policy of Venizelos's has caused him to be repeatedly dismissed from the office of prime minister by the Germanophile King Constantine.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America were and are pro-Venizelists; that is they believe that the policies of Venizelos are for Greece, not against Greece as are the policies of the King.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>So this mysterious force is put in operation to change the attitude of the people and to create opposition to Venizelos and favorable sentiment toward the King, the tool of Germany. This propaganda has been directed and conducted by Solon Vlastos, a friend of the King's and publisher of Atlantis, a Greek daily of New York, and he is now exposed by Chicago Loxias. Our articles," Behold the Man," are printed in this issue, in Greek and in English, so that not only Greeks but also our American fellow-citizens may be informed of the true character of this man Solon Vlastos, who has sometimes posed among them as a descendant of the Byzantine Emperors and at other times has masqueraded as the Duke of Euxine.</p>
   <p>Loxias takes this step with considerable reluctance, but there are two imperative reasons which compel us to do so; by thus showing the true character of this modern Rochambeau we shall put Americans and their families, who do not know him, on guard against him, and at the same time we shall vindicate the honor and prestige of the Greek nation, which he has done his best to drag into the mire.

   <p>On Feb. 18 twelve thousand Greeks (see picture on page 2) in a great rally at the Coliseum endorsed and supported the policies of Venizelos, who desires to lead Greece to war against Germany and her allies, and in a wild demonstration they denounced the policies of the King. This New York daily, directed by this Monster-Duke of Euxine, in articles blazoned with big headlines, described the picture of the mass-meeting as a hoax, saying that the participants in the demonstration who appear in the picture are not Greeks but Hungarians and men of other races with a very, very few Greeks among them; and these latter are then anathematized by Atlantis for daring to agree with the destructive policies of Venizelos, who according to Atlantis is against Greece and against the King. Our fellow-Greeks in other parts of America may, after reading Atlantis's articles, entertain a doubt, but Chicago Greeks, who attended this great mass-meeting, know beyond any doubt that not only did 12,000 take actual part in the demonstration, but thousands of others are body and soul behind the Venizelist policies.</p>

   <p>The days of underground conspiracies and camouflage are over. Mr. Duke Vlastos, the Greeks of Chicago and the rest of America are aware of your treasonable tactics, and as soon as this country joins the Allies you and your kind will undoubtedly yell your heads off with your contemptible and hypocritical hurrahs. Shame on you, Monster! You are ready to betray any country for the sake of money. You have no country; money is your country and your soul. You cannot any longer deceive your fellow-Americans and your fellow-Greeks; they know your forgeries by this time.</p>
   <p>"Behold the Man" is Loxias's exposure of the Duke of Euxine. Read it and send it to your friends, Greek and American.</p>
