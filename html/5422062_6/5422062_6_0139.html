   <p>Last Thursday at the Auditorium the players individually and collectively gave us samples of the "national" stage and of their art in the operetta "The Storm's Daughter". It was a substantial success.</p>
   <p>We hope that Chicago also will give a sample of its hospitality on Sunday next at the Civic Theater to a troupe worthy of attention and support. The play is "The First Love".</p>
