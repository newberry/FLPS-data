   <p>p. 1 - The success of the forthcoming dance for the benefit of the national navy of Greece is in doubt, and from all indications it is likely to be a failure and have a blot on one page of the annals of the Chicago Greek community.</p>
   <p>The cause of this is not lack of patriotism nor lack of leaders to marshal the Greeks of Chicago in offering tribute to the mighty Queen of the world, Mother-Greece, whom they stand ready and willing to defend with their lives; it is rather lack of harmony among these leaders. Who shall be the generalissimo? This destructive rivalry among Spartans, Arcadians, Islanders, Athenians, and Greeks from Turkey still has a strong grip upon us. And if we do not free ourselves from this monster of petty ambition, all the enthusiasm, the self-denial, and the self-sacrifice of Greeks for Mother-Greece will gradually be extinguished.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek community of Chicago is composed of our compatriots from various parts of Greece; and every inch of Greece is just as sacred as Athens, Sparta, or Arcadia, and every fellow-Greek of ours, whether from Turkey, Egypt, or China, is in soul and in tradition just as truly a Greek as the Greek who was born in Greece. The Lacedemonian, the Arcadian, the Athenian, and the Islander cannot be anything but Greek, a brother Greek of ours and a son of Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>The forthcoming dance for the Greek navy is an affair not local but national. All the forces and all the leaders of the community must participate in order to accomplish the desired results. All societies and all organizations with all their leaders must bend the knee before the common cause of our beloved Greece.</p>
   
   <p>Since we are genuine sons of Greece living in our adopted country, let us prove to those around us that we are worthy of the name which is spoken with reverence and admiration by the best of the civilized world. Let us show our city by our conduct, our unity, and our harmony that we are good, progressive citizens. Dissension in our ranks will produce unpleasant results which will be detrimental to us all and to our old Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>If the forthcoming dance is a national affair for the benefit of Greece, and its success depends upon full cooperation of all Greeks, the leaders of the Greek community will do well to forget their local rivalry and their titles and put their heads together; otherwise the burden of responsibility for any sort of failure will fall squarely upon their several shoulders.</p>
   <p>The Star does not hesitate, in spite of present difficulties, to predict that the dance to raise funds for the Greek navy will be crowned with tremendous success. Greeks, despite their many shortcomings, never retreat but always march forward. This present crisis over leadership will be blown away by the mighty blast of Greek patriotism and love for Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>Honor, praise, and fame are allotted to those who forget themselves and repress their feelings of personal gain or loss when the god of patriotism and duty appears before them; Themistocles in similar circumstances said to Eurybiadas, "Slap me, but listen to me!" If the several leaders of the Greek community are worthy of their leadership and of the titles which they possess, they will bear in mind this immortal phrase addressed by an Athenian to a Spartan.</p>
   <p>Nothing is humiliating to great leaders who are determined to serve their beloved country.</p>
   
   <p>The moral conveyed by this immortal saying may well be applied to the present predicament of the Greek community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Let us see who will be the new Themistocles among the leaders of our community.</p>
