   <p>p. 1.- A telegram from the Greek Ambassador to Washington, Harry Simopoulos, has just been received by the Greek Professional Club of Chicago saying, due to unforeseen circumstances, it is impossible for him to attend the banquet given in his honor on June 6. The patriarchial legate, His Holiness Mitropolitis Korinthais, will not attend either, due to unexpected business.</p>
   <p>This announcement necessarily makes the Greek Professional Club postpone the affair indefinitely and has disappointed many of our countrymen who intended to be present.</p>
   <p>The organization is planning another banquet in place of this to satisfy the thousands of Greeks who were to be present at tomorrow's affair.</p>
