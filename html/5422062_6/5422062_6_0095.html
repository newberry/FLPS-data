   <p>p. 5.- When we called the General Consulate office yesterday, who should answer the phone but Menelaos Tsopis, who yesterday returned from Greece. His three-month vacation being over, Mr. Tsopis immediately returned to his desk and resumed his work. His trip included Greece, Paris, Vienna, Budapest, and other European cities.</p>
