   <p>p. 1- You have expressed the unanimous sentiment of all liberal Greeks in repudiating the King, with whom, since the tragic events of December, the nation has once and for all severed every tie.</p>
   <p>I congratulate you on your resolution to devote all your strength to the noble task undertaken by the United States.</p>
   <p>After your distinguished President's stirring and inspiring declaration defining America's aims in the war, the Star Spangled Banner has become the symbol of humanity's purest ideals. Devotion to such a cause is henceforth the duty and the privilege of every free man.</p>
   
   <p>I am convinced that the Greeks of the United States, imbued with this conception, will succeed in winning the active and highly valued sympathy of the great American nation.</p>
   <p>Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the Royalists of Chicago will feel uneasy when they read the above in the daily papers. It is never too late, fellow-Greeks, to change your minds. The future will reveal the fallacy of your present attitude. Venizelos is not against Greece but for Greece. You may dislike the individual, but he is a patriot and a fighter for your Greece and mine.</p>
