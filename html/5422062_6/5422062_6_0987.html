   <p>The Imperial House of Paleologus is best known to the Greeks, as well as to the rest of the civilized world, through its greatest son, Constantine Paleologus, who fell fighting the Turks on the walls of Constantinople in 1452.</p>
   <p>The self-sacrifice of this national hero has not only immortalized the name Paleologus but has endeared it to the hearts of the Hellenic race scattered the world over. Several other glorious families, such as the Commenoi, the Angeloi, and the Lascareis, reigned over the Byzantine Empire in the last five centuries of its existence.</p>
   <p>The services rendered to the Greek race and to the rest of mankind by these powerful houses are inestimable, but none of them has left a name so inspiring as that of the Paleologi. This fact is due to the patriotism and self-sacrifice of the last martyr-emperor, who was destined not to save but to immortalize the name of the Empire of Byzantium.</p>

   <p>Simultaneously with the fall of Constantinople came the downfall of the Imperial House of the Paleologi, but this glorious name did not disappear from the face of the earth. On the contrary, both before and after the fall of Constantinople several members of it either were married to reigning families or migrated to foreign lands, especially to France, Italy, and Russia, where their descendants have survived even to this date. They serve with distinction their respective countries and occupy enviable positions in their communities. They take great pride in their glorious name and claim to be the bluest-blooded princes in the world.</p>
   <p>This claim is not entirely unwarranted in view of the fact that they can trace their line, that is to say, the line of the Greco-Roman emperors, as much as 1,500 years back. It will be interesting to state that the House of Paleologus survives in some of the most powerful reigning houses of Europe as well as in many of the outstanding families in various countries.</p>

   <p>It is related to the House of the Bourbons in France; to the former Russian dynasty, for Ivan III married Princess Sophia Paleologus, who became the first Empress of Russia; and to the House of Savoy, in Italy, for Andronicus III Paleologus married the Countess Anna of Savoy. It is also said to be related to the present King of Italy, for Theodore II Paleologus married Argentine, Marchioness of Montferrat. Finally, it is related to other noble houses of Austria and Hungary.</p>
   <p>Nor is the House of Paleologus absent from modern Grecian history. The house of Mammonas, members of which ruled for many years over the Moreas, with Monenvasia as their capital, is a direct descendant of the Paleologi. For Prince Manuel, son of the Emperor Andronicus III Paleologus, married Princess Irene, daughter of Gregory IV Mammonas and sister of Grand Duke Paul Mammonas. The family of Paleologus-Mammonas, besides its titles of Prince and Grand Duke, bears the title of Count of Velos and Voevondeus, which Joannes Cornelius, Doge of Venice, conferred upon them on March 30, 1722, and upon all their descendants in perpetuity.</p>

   <p>Traces of this noble family still survive in Greece, and its scions are devoted to the service of their country and of their race. The present charge d'affaires of Greece at Washington, D. C., Basilius A. Paleologus-Mammonas, and his brother, Constantine Paleologus-Mammonas, general manager of the foreign exchange department of the Central Trust Company of Illinois in Chicago, are descendants of the House of the Paleologi.</p>
   <p>Constantine Paleologus-Mammonas, who bears the title of Prince of Byzantium, is the recognized head and legitimate heir of the Paleologus-Mammonas family. He was born in the famous city of Corinth (Castle of Mammonas) and received the rudiments of his education in that city. He then entered the University of Athens, where he studied political science. He received the degree of doctor of laws from that institution and soon afterwards became a member of the Bar Association of Corinth. Later he traveled and studies in various countries of Europe and finally came to the United States.</p>

   <p>Since his arrival in this country he has given several lectures with illustrations before mixed audiences. Many a Greek, French, English, and American newspaper has published articles about his lectures. Societies and mayors have congratulated him and admired his democratic tendencies and his services in the promotion of his country's affairs. He has also written for Greek newspapers under the pseudonym Mentor. Constantine Paleologus-Mammonas, commonly known as Prince of Byzantium, is an ardent patriot. He is fanatically devoted to the Grand Idea of the Greek race over which his ancestors ruled for nearly two hundred years.</p>
   <p>Though a nobleman, he is very democratic, dresses carefully, and is interesting to talk to. He is very popular and is keenly interested in the welfare of the community in which he lives.</p>
   <p>He was chairman of the convention of Greek Liberals which assembled in Chicago in 1922, has been president of the Hellenic Liberal-Democratic League of Chicago, and is a member of several other clubs and societies.</p>

   <p>For ten years Constantine Paleologus-Mammonas has been head of the foreign exchange department of the Central Trust Company in Chicago, of which General Charles G. Dawes, Republican nominee for the office of Vice-President of the United States, is president. Under his administration the foreign exchange department of his institution has made great progress.</p>
   <p>He is a personal friend of General Dawes, in whose candidacy he is keenly interested. Should the Republicans succeed in the election of November next, it may safely be assumed that through the influence of General Dawes and other national statesmen the Paleologus-Mammonas brothers will render great services to their country, of which they are official representatives in the United States of America, thus continuing the Paleologus-Mammonas family's tradition of service to their country.</p>
