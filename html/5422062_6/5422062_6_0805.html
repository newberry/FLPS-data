   <p>p. 1.- We have written many articles about Greek societies and organizations in America, but they have all come back to us like an echo in an empty room. In the entire United States there are about 250 Greek clubs. Each of these clubs has over $300 in its treasury.</p>
   <p>We all know why Spiro Matsoukas has invited these clubs to attend the celebration of Greek Independence Day in Boston. With the delegates, each club is requested to send $100. Mr. Matsoukas wishes to raise immediately a sum of $30,000 by appealing to the patriotic spirit of the Greeks in America. He is trying to show that all these Hellenic organizations in America must work for the good the mother country instead of trying to outdo one another in selfish gains.</p>

   <p>We must not wait for the Turk to recapture Greece before we remember our duty to our country. It is not an impossible thing we are asking. There are 250 societies in America under one name and one flag. By cooperating with one another they can accomplish much for the good of their native land.</p>
