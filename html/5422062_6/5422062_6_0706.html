   <p>At two o'clock on Sunday, February 18, the great Greek Conference was held in the Coliseum Annex. The people of Chicago had never before had the opportunity of witnessing such an unusual gathering.</p>
   <p>About two weeks ago, the board of councilors of the Liberal Society of Chicago decided to invite all the representatives sent by Greece to the United States, to come to Chicago, where they could enlighten the Chicago Greeks as to the true situation, policies, and plans of Greece.</p>
   <p>No sooner was it decided than the conference became a fact. An announcement was drawn up which read as follows:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Gentlemen: The Liberal Society of Chicago--which is recognized by the National Government in Thessaloniki under Mr. E. Venizelos--feeling the extreme necessity for understanding at this time, planned this great conference which is to take place on February 18 in the Coliseum Annex; and at which will be heard the representatives from Greece, Mr. Kafantaris, and Mr. Aravantinos.</p>
   <p>"The Venizelists from every nook of Chicago and the neighboring states are therefore invited to attend, and hear directly from the mouths of these speakers the actual truth concerning the condition of their fatherland. Its critical condition is evident to all, and it is the duty of all Venizelists to attend. Arouse yourselves! in order that the strength of the Venizelists of Chicago shall <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>command respect; and that serious consideration will be given to the cause for which we fight."</p>
   <p>This notice makes it evident that the conference would be open only to Liberals; that it was intended only for those who took a public stand for Venizelos; and that it would fare badly for anyone with antagonistic ideas found in the meeting. This exclusion of those having opposing beliefs, is perfectly legal, since the Annex was rented in the name of a Venizelist organization. The invitations bore three reasons for the holding of this conference. They were:</p>
   <p>First: In order to allow a discussion of Greek politics without the usual fighting and argument which hinder intelligent thought, and cause more trouble than anything else.</p>
   <p>Second: In order that the truly great strength of the Venizelists of Chicago <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>can be proven; and that it be shown, once and for all, which side of the fence our leading citizens are on.</p>
   <p>Third: In order that a clear differentiation be made between the two parties; and that a program be laid out for the Liberals of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The people came to the meeting in such multitudes that only a short time elapsed after the opening of the doors before it was announced that there was no more room, and that admission would have to cease. Although the Annex is made to accommodate over 3,500 people, it was packed to the point of suffocation; and there were still over five hundred people standing outside hoping to get in. In the thirty years existence of the Greek community in Chicago, such a condition had never before occurred.</p>
   <p>The meeting was quiet and dignified until, sadly enough, an overpatriotic and thoughtless individual arose and cried: "The followers of the traitorous <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>King are hereby requested to leave this auditorium." No sooner was this said than pandemonium broke loose. Whistling, cat-calls, boos, and angry shouts, filled the hall. No political benefit was gained by such a thoughtless act; it only gave the few people that would be forced to leave, a good opportunity to call the police, and thereby blacken our name in the American press. They would say that we were inciting a riot; and would have cause to write articles about our characters and our unruly meetings. And the cause of this disturbance was due to certain individuals who do not understand their obligation to society or their own race. They do not understand the relationship between one civilized man and another. They caused shame and humiliation to be felt by most of the people in the audience, who were friendly, quiet, dignified, and self-respecting individuals. Those persons who wish to impose their crude, coarse way of doing things upon the rest of the community, had better find other ways to pass their time. Although we might agree with their opinions, we will have no association with them so long as they choose such ways to express themselves.</p>

   <p>Each person has, according to the laws of this country, the right to formulate his own opinions and to do as he pleases, provided he keeps within the law and respects the rights and privileges of others.</p>
   <p>After quiet was again restored the toastmaster of the evening, Mr. Eftaxias, editor of the Loxias, welcomed the assemblage and then introduced Mr. Panos Aravantinos, who gave a summary of the past history of Greece, in which he analyzed the present political situation and its effect upon conditions in the country. The speech was received with much enthusiasm by the rapt audience. Mr. Kafantaris was then introduced by the toastmaster, and he explained Greece's position in the war, and its effects on Greece. He said that the only saviour of Greece was Venizelos and that he should be staunchly supported.....He too was given a great ovation at the close of his inspiring speech. A vote was then taken, and thousands in the audience voted in favor of keeping Venizelos in power in Greece. Notice of this action was sent to President Wilson, to the Government in Thessaloniki, and to the newspapers of America and Greece.</p>

   <p>After the meeting the guests of honor and the Greek representatives went to the Blackstone Hotel to attend a dinner given in their behalf.</p>
