   <p>The second picnic of Tsipianiton took place last Sunday at the Desplaines River and was a brilliant success.</p>
   <p>Although the Association was organized only a year ago, it has much to show in accomplishment. It was launched for the purpose of promoting works of public benefit in the members' native country, Tsipiana of Mantineia, and already its first important project is about to be undertaken, namely, the conveyance of water-supplies into Tsipiana, something that will satisfy a serious want for the inhabitants of this district and give new life to the community. The idea could not but find all Tsipianites willing to promote it, and within this brief span of time they have accumulated in their treasury about $6,000, which they will soon increase to $10,000, the sum required for the project.</p>
   <p>..... The amount raised by the picnic was $2,500, which will be disposed of for the above purpose.</p>
