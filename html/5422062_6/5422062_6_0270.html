   <p>The St. George League of Lycurgus, comprising more than fifty members, functions quietly and unobstrusively among us. Its aim is to promote friendship and economic security among its members and to help the place of their birth, the land of Lycurgus the law-maker.</p>
   <p>The members of the League served a supper in honor of Mr. and Mrs.Kosmas when they passed through Chicago enroute to San Francisco, where Mr. Kosmas's business is located. Mr. Kosmas and his wife, who is of America descent, were returning from a visit to Greece, and on passing through this city they were gracious enough to pause and show the four thousand feet of film which they has taken recording the natural beauty of the moving life in Greek cities and villages. After twenty years of business activity in San Francisco they have spent this vacation in Greece. They visited Athens, and from Athens they travelled with the families of the four Makris brothers <span class="page-break">2</span>to Kalavreta, where they stayed a short time. From Kalavreta they went to the birthplace of Mr. Kosmas, the sunny mountainous land of Lycurgus. They saw the frontier which separates Achaia from Arcadia and Corinth. They saw Helmos with its immortal waters by which, according to Greek Mythology, the gods of Olympus swore their most sacred oaths, oaths even Zeus, the sovereign of gods and men could not violate.</p>
   <p>For three months Mr. Kosmas stayed there with the families of the four Makris brothers and his highly esteemed wife, who in addition to the charm of a lovely figure possesses a very kind, noble soul. Together they disseminated life and happiness in a place famous in the past for its amusements, the country town of Leucosia. They took part in all the celebrations and the social activities and also enjoyed a romantic hunt at Lake Feneou among the mountains of Helmos, where they found the scenery surpassingly beautiful, and they fished in the Ladonos river.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kosmas, who is enterprising by nature, fortunately had the delightful inspiration of taking moving pictures of his travels. These pictures he displayed last Sunday, in a hall specially rented for the occasion, to his fellow-country-men, including the members of the St. George League of Lycurgus. So we saw <span class="page-break">3</span>before our eyes San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, New York, the Atlantic Ocean in all its magnificence and in all its moods, turbulent and calm, Patras, the shore of Elias as far as Olympus, Athens from the heights of the Holy Rock, the Acropolis and the hill of Lycabettus, the railway between Diakoytos and Kalavryton, and finally the land of Lycurgus with its festivities, hts dances, its eternal fustanella, its weddings, the spots familiar to the Chicago members of the League of Lycurgus, and even their relatives who still reside there. So these Greeks of Chicago had an unexpected glimpse, after so many years absence, of the place where they first saw the light of day. The exhibition of the film lasted two hours and a half.</p>
   <p>The Chicago members of the League, like the San Francisco members, toil without ostentation. They have in their treasury about ten thousand dollars which they have accumulated to help their birthplace in Greece. I sincerely and heartily congratulate them.</p>
   <p>The president of the Chicago Chapter, Mr. Papathanasiou, Mighly praised Mr. Kosmas <span class="page-break">4</span>for his kindness, and the other members joined him in lively expressions of approval. Mr. Kosmas was made honorary president of the Chicago chapter of the League.</p>
