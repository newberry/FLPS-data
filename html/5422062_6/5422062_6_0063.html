   <p>In recent telegraphic communications from Athens we are informed that Mr. Michalacopoulos will not be able to pay a visit to the Greeks in America, in spite of his earnest desire to come here to study conditions and devise ways and means for the "development of closer economic and commercial relations between the Greeks in America and the mother country." Mr. Michalacopoulos has also remarked that his "proposed visit is in general a governmental matter which he has had no time to discuss with Mr. Venizelos."</p>
   <p>We agree with Mr. Michalacopoulos' remark and believe like him that the business of "devising means for closer economic and commercial relations between the Greeks in America and the mother country" is not only a matter which should be taken up by the Greek Government but is also a matter entirely outside the jurisdiction of Mr. Michalacopoulos and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which he is the head. Let us rejoice over the news that Mr. Michalacopoulos has classified this matter as a governmental affair and has postponed indefinitely his proposed visit to the United States. We should further be thankful that this problem does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for it would have met the same fate as our church problem, which the Ministry tinkered with for more than ten years, and which never would have been solved if the Greek parishes of Chicago had not sent representatives to the Government of Greece to present their case. Let us add further that the perplexing church problem would still be unsolved in spite of the delegation dispatched to Greece if our representatives had not had the good fortune to find that Mr. Michalacopoulos was absent on a visit to Egypt when they arrived at Athens last February. Because Mr. Michalacopoulos was absent, Mr. Venizelos personally undertook the business of solving our problem and solved it.</p>
   <p>What have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Michalacopoulos accomplished up to this time in matters which are within their jurisdiction, especially those matters which involve Hellenism in America? Mr. Michalacopoulos has not succeeded in establishing an efficient consular service, one that performs the duties assigned to it, but he continues to maintain in Chicago, the seat of the largest Greek community in America, a consul general who for more than six years has absolutely failed to perform the duties of his office, and against whom many charges have been made and brought to Mr. Michalacopoulos' attention. In fact the consul has even been denounced on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies of the Greek General Assembly.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Michalacopoulos and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which he is head, utterly fail to solve the problems which fall within their jurisdiction, how can they solve those which are beyond their control and should be studied by the proper authorities?</p>
   <p>The foreign and diplomatic affairs of the Greeks in America are no problems of Greece. The vital problems which Hellenism must solve are the church problem and the school problem, and these matters are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Church and Education and should be assigned to that Ministry, which could lighten the burden of the Greeks in America by assisting in solving these problems.</p>
   
   <p>What right has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meddle with matters of which it has no knowledge, and no authority to regulate?</p>
   <p>Mr. Michalacopoulos' visit to Egypt last year to study matters pertaining to the Greeks resident in Egypt had a legitimate purpose, for there are questions which must be settled between the governments of Greece and Egypt by treaties or agreements. Fortunately, however, no problem exists, involving the Government of the United States and the Government of Greece, which warrants a visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United States. All questions which arise between these two governments are well taken care of, thanks to the ability of Mr. Simopoulos, the Greek Ambassador in Washington. It is evident therefore, that no reason exists why Mr. Michalacopoulos should assume the burden of making a visit to this country, since his long absence from the duties of his office would create "great embarrassment", as he himself has stated.</p>
   <p>It is time for the Greek nation to realize that the Greeks in America have always been a huge factor in Greece's economic life. At present numerous economic and commercial matters which involve the Greeks in America and the Greek Government require immediate attention. These questions should be taken up by the proper persons and authorities and not by diplomats and superficial thinkers; nothing can be accomplished by the brief visit of a person who is incompetent to solve problems of this nature!</p>
   <p>It should be brought to the attention of the Greek Government that the Greeks in America can contribute much toward the solution of numerous economic problems confronting the Greek nation. Let us cite an example. There are in Greece various industries which would welcome and could use to great advantage the capital of the Greeks in America if these American Greeks were properly informed and were assured of the safety of such investments.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that many Greeks who live in America visit Greece and take with them their entire capital, intending to make some investment or to establish themselves there, but these people soon return to the United States and bring their money back with them. Why? Because they have not received proper attention in Greece nor sufficient assurance that their investments there would be safe.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably numerous industries and projects exist in Greece which could be developed and could make good use of the American dollars owned by the Greeks in America. When Greece is in obvious need of foreign capital, and this capital voluntarily comes to it and is then allowed to get away, it is evident indeed that the Greek nation is grievously at fault, and that the problem requires immediate attention and serious study.</p>
   <p>But this matter is not under the jurisdiction of Mr. Michalacopoulos and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; it is a matter of national Finance and Commerce. We say this because the capital of the Greeks in America should be considered as part of the wealth of the nation, and the invention of ways and means to encourage the flow of this wealth into Greece is not the task of the diplomatic service.</p>
   <p>Of course we regret that we shall not be fortunate enough to have His Excellency Mr. Michalacopoulos, the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs, pay us his long- planned and often-deferred visit.</p>
   <p>We still have hopes that the Greek Government will make an effort to select the proper authority to study the economic problems of the Greeks in America, especially those which concern the nation of Greece.</p>
