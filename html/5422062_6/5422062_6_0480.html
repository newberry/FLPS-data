   <p>p. 5-On January 21, 1923, the Selasia Association, through the good offices of the executive committee and patriotic members, gave a dance at the White City Auditorium. A large crowd attended the dance, and the net proceeds were $620 after expenses had been deducted. This sum was sent to Athens for the benefit of the refugees.</p>
   <p>Our hearty congratulations to our good friends, who are always willing to help a worthy cause!</p>
