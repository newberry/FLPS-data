   <p>The office of Saloniki is flooded with telegrams sent by Chicago Ahepans telling us how the Greek people and authorities received the Greek-American excursionists.</p>
   <p>The American Minister to Greece officially received the Ahepans and delivered the following address.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Magor and members of the Ahepa, I am happy to join with my Athenian friends in welcoming this large and fine appearing delegation of American citizens of Greek origin. I have not the slightest doubt that its members will enjoy themselves thoroughly in the mother-land, and that they will return refreshed and benefited by their experience here.</p>

   <p>"I did have a good deal of doubt, however, until some hours ago, as to the meaning of that mysterious word Ahepa under which you come. I assumed, of course, that the name Ahepa was an old-fashioned Greek word, and I hastened to the dictionary to discover its significance. Naturally, I obtained no enlightment either in the ancient or the modern Greek, and then I ascertained that the word, is one of those ultra-modern, terrible words, composed of the initial letters of a series of respectable English words, all of which being translated means that this organization stands, first, for the dispatch of the simple and obvious duties of good citizenship; second, for an interest in political movements, but without bitterness or unfairness; third, that it stands for the general education of the masses, and, finally, that it believes in the cultivation of beauty in art and literature and in our everyday lives.</p>
   <p>"When I mastered this much of your program I said to myself, 'How truly Greek it all is,' a program that might have been devised by the Greeks of ancient days, who themselves were believers in the practice of the duties of citizenship, who were always interested in public affairs, and education, and who achieved more for beauty than humanity has succeeded in achieving at any time since.</p>

   <p>In fact, as I thought over the matter, it occurred to me that, if eligible, I might not mind joining the organization myself and perhaps the worthy Athenian Journalists who have been having much graver doubts than my own with respect to the nature of Ahepa, might, upon reflection, feel inclined to join me in applying for membership.</p>
   <p>"You have now reached the house of your ancestors and as you go through the beautiful countryside, as you look around and see the vestiges of the past, as you remark with what energy, tenacity and success the people of your own blood and your own generation have struggled and are still struggling against post-war problems of tremendous difficulty, you will recall with pride and satisfaction the fact that they are of your own race, and you will say that the qualities which were characteristic of this country many centuries ago are the qualities of the men and women of our own time.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Now we who are of the older stock of the United States would not wish you to feel otherwise. Indeed, we could not wholly respect you if you lacked in your appreciation of what has been accomplished on this soil. We believe that there is no necessary inconsistency between cherishing such thoughts as that, and the uncompromising and undivided loyalty which we expect from our citizens of recent date.</p>
   <p>"We have had abundant proof that loyalty is given to our institutions and without grudging. We do not forget that during the great war upwards of 50,000 young Greeks in whose veins there flows the blood of Attica and Peloponnesus and all the other parts of Greece, gave the best that was in them to the army of the United States.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"It lies within the power of this country by the exercise of a broad and enlightened policy, and I do not doubt that it will do so, to retain the friendship and the affections of the 500,000 persons, more or less, who have come from Greece to the United States.</p>
   <p>"I welcome the presence of this, the first large organized body of its kind, to this country as a happy omen, indicating still closer and if possible better, and always more practically useful relations between Greece and the United States."</p>
