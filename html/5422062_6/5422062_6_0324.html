   <p>p. 1. For the information of those who are not familiar with the prevalent laws of Greece, and for the sake of making a comparison of what rights the citizens have, here and abroad, this is written.</p>
   <p>General Theodore Pangalos, President and Dictator of the Greek Republic, put in effect a drastic law, to take care of the strikers. The leaders of the strike, and those strikers who become a public nuisance are sent to exile on an island of the Aegean Sea. They are precluded and prohibited to communicate with the working masses living in isolation and quietness, and given the opportunity to capitulate.</p>
   <p>When the Dictator feels that they have had enough of the treatment of quietness, he liberates them, after they have promised not to disturb the peace of the land any more.</p>
