   <p>P.2--The legislative order of October 29, 1923, commands that soldiers of the reserve classes of 1918 and later, unenlisted or deserters, shall present themselves to the local authorities and to the nearest military post or to the authorized consulate within the period of time allowed by the above order. The proper authorities shall make a list of those who have presented themselves, which shall be sent to the Army Department, and those whose names are on the list shall remain free citizens until a later order is issued. This list must be in our hands within a month from the date of this notification in the case of those who live within the boundaries of Greece and within two months there from in the case of those who live in foreign countries.</p>
   <p>Therefore the requirements of the above order shall be fulfilled by the reserve soldiers of the classes of 1919, 1920, and 1921 and also by those who have never served in the army and by those who have not completed their term of military service, who must present themselves for re-enlistment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In pursuance to the above order I am making this last appeal, summoning all to perform their supreme duty to our country, and I consider that for those who belong to the newest classes of 1919 to 1923 no excuse is valid. I declare for the last time that from December 1, 1922, I shall inexorably apply the severe penalty imposed by the law. After the lapse of this term those who have not enlisted in their classes for service shall be shot to death, and their families shall be exiled to Africa. (Article 1 of the legislative order of November 20, 1922.) For the duration of the present war deserters will be punished with sentence of death; if the act of desertion is considered to have mitigating circumstances, the penalty is life imprisonment. Those who shall be enlisted by the latest date set by this notification are not subject to the above-stated law but to the laws prior thereto in effect; that is, in the case of those who live within the boundaries of Greece, they shall not be thereto subject if they shall have been enlisted by the fifteenth day of December, 1922, and in the case of those who live in foreign countries they shall not be thereto subject if they shall have been enlisted by January 15, 1923. The prosecution of those who shall appear within the time stated will be suspended for the time during which they are serving in their classes in the army and so fulfilling their military obligations.</p>
