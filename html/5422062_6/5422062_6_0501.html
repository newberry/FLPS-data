   <p>The Selasia Society, which has now been active for twelve years, will give its annual dance on Sunday, January 21, at the West Side Auditorium, Taylor Street and Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>We hope that all members of the Greek colony of Chicago will honor this dance by their presence, thereby assisting a sacred and useful purpose, namely, the relief of the refugees from Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of this organization is sparing no pains to make this affair a success. Your ticket entitles you to participate in the lottery, of which the prizes are as follows:</p>
   <p>First prize, a seventy-five-dollar watch; second prize, a fifty-dollar woman's wrist-watch; and third prize, a silver tray with other pieces of silverware to match.</p>
   <p>Peter G. Maniates, president Kleomenes A. Orfanos, secretary.</p>
