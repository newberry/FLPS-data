   <p>Eleutherios Venizelos, former premier of Greece, accompanied by his wife, came to Chicago yesterday. A mighty throng of Greeks at the La Salle Street Station cheered wildly as he stepped from the train with his bride.</p>
   <p>His admirers massed so tightly in an effort to shake and kiss his hand that an exit from the front of the station was impossible. To escape, the ex-premier was obliged to leave through a rear door, after being escorted to a freight elevator by a squad of policeman.</p>
   <p>After Venizelos was safely intrenched in his suite at the Blackstone Hotel, a crowd of 20,000 admirers gathered outside, waving their hats and shouting: "Venizelos, our hero! Long live Venizelos, our saint!"</p>
   <p>No political interviews were granted by the ex-premier.</p>
   <p>Venizelos plans to leave with his wife for California Thursday, where they will spend the winter. A return trip to Chicago will be made in the spring, when the ex-premier will be the guest of Mayor Thompson and the Association of Commerce.</p>

   <p>Today a tour of Chicago will be made by automobile.</p>
   <p>"I am overcome at the greeting of my countrymen in Chicago", Venizelos said. "I dared not pass through the lines at the station for fear my wife would be injured. This reception was too much. I thought such receptions were confined to European countries."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Venizelos was almost overcome by the enthusiasm with which her husband was greeted.</p>
   <p>This morning a committee of fifteen leading citizens will call on Venizelos to welcome him to Chicago. A book containing hundreds of letters and telegrams sent to Venizelos in care of the Greek Star will be presented.</p>
