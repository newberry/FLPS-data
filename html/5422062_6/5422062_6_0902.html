   <p>Your sons in Chicago and all over the world look upon you today, O Mother-Greece, with the same pride and devotion, with the same love and reverence as always.</p>
   <p>Upon you, O Mother and Queen of all, the eyes of the whole world today again are focused. O Mother of divine wisdom and enlightenment - O immortal beloved Greece!</p>
   <p>The divine light with which your celestial feet were shod has left indelible traces of your steps upon this terrestrial globe where for centuries upon centuries you have held the attention of the world as the cynosure of mankind, the axis upon which humanity revolves, and the cornerstone on which everything good is built.</p>
   
   <p>Today many and divers people from every corner of the earth come to you to admire the loveliness of your divine horizon, the beauty of your monuments, and the wisdom of your doctrine. Yes! They come to participate in your Olympic games, the games of your immortal sons of ancient times, which you have now revived, and to pay homage to you and show their reverence for you, the mother of civilization. They come to seek the mystery of your grandeur, the key to your charm.</p>
   <p>For centuries your oracles have been silent, your temples have been destroyed, your treasures have been plundered, and you, O Mother of freedom, were for centuries enchained in slavery.</p>
   <p>In spite of your misfortunes, in spite of your bleeding wounds and the loss of your territories, the aura of your greatness still surrounds you, and you still reveal to the world that you and you only are the immortal mother of everlasting good, the mother of perfect beauty and truth, the mother of inspiration and idealism. The world will continue to be regenerated by you while its eyes are turned upon your inspiring idealism, but the world will sink into darkness and waver in uncertainty and doubt when it turns its eyes away.</p>
   <p>The destroyers of your temples and your monuments, those who enslaved you, and the barbarians of yesterday who all were fed and nourished on your immortal blood and baptized in your spirit, today are in your famous stadium competing for the simple but coveted wreath of your olive.</p>
   <p>Once more before your stadium and before your noble scepter the banners of the world are bowing to you, and once more you are proclaimed Queen of the world!</p>
   
   <p>You, immortal Greece, have revived the Olympic games. It was your privilege to do so. You are the source of good, the inextinguishable light and inexhaustible fountain of wisdom, beauty, and truth!</p>
   <p>You have not sent forth heralds to proclaim a truce, as in ancient times the sacred heralds of Zeus did, yet the world, setting its differences aside for the renewal of your Olympic games, rejoices and admires at this moment what Pindar calls "the cheerful beam of lofty peace."</p>
   <p>For us your sons, beloved and immortal Greece, exiles from your unredeemed territory who now live in the United States, your glorious daughter of democracy, there can never be peace until Macedonia, Thrace, Epirus, and Asia Minor are liberated and once more united with our beloved Mother-Greece.</p>
   
   <p>While we enjoy the blessings of American liberty and justice, our hearts ache for our unredeemed brothers and sisters. While the air of your stadium reverberates with the joyful music of the bands of all nations, the moans of our suffering and slaughtered kinsmen still sound in our ears.</p>
   <p>You, O sun-clad Goddess of the universe, have taught us with divine inspiration that to have peace and live in peace while liberty, the most precious possession of humanity, is in jeopardy, is the lowest and the worst thing that men can do. True to our traditions and our ideals, your sons scattered through the world will never be at peace nor have peace until our brother-Greeks are liberated.</p>
   <p>We, your loving and devoted sons living in Chicago and elsewhere in this great country, send you this message, lest the music played in your stadium by the bands of all nations should be accepted as the symbol of peace.</p>
