   <p>P. 4- All the Greek societies of metropolitan Chicago have unanimously resolved to hold a Panhellenic mass-meeting in Hull House at 2 p.m. on Sunday, September 16th, with the specific object of protesting against the Bulgarian atrocities perpetrated upon the Greek civilian population of Anatolian, Roumelia and Bulgaria. The protest is to be sent to all civilized nations, emphazing the necessity of intervention against the unheard of brutalities of these frightful orgies of Bulgarian beasts.</p>
   <p>All our fellow- Greeks are urged to attend this general meeting and to hear the speakers tell how our brothers and sisters are butchered, our churches are pillaged, and Greek properity is confiscated by the bestial hordes of the decendants of Krovmos.</p>

   <p>Hellenism all over the world must do likewise and hold mass-meetings of protest to the civilized world against the barbarisms.</p>
   <p>The day is near when the Greek nation will serve notice on Bulgaria not with pen but with its victorious arms. Then and there these brutalized creatures will realize the superiority and sharpness of the Greek swerd.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers at the meeting will be Messrs. Soter Gerorg Ades and Pantelis Shoris.</p>
