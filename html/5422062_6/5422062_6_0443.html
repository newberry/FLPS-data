   <p>The Greek Democratic Association of Chicago invites all Greeks of Chicago to openly express their democratic feeling.</p>
   <p>The time has come when the great, splendid and imposing Greek Colony of Chicago should come to life once more, to remind Hellenism in America, that this is the proper moment, so that our voice may be heard as far as Greece. The period of idle talk, hesitation and consideration is past.</p>
   <p>The desire of the Greeks of Chicago will be expressed at their great meeting which is being sponsored by the Greek Democratic Association of Chicago which will take place Sunday November 25, 1923 at the Hull House at 3. p. m. corner of Halsted and Polk Streets.</p>
   <p>Those who are waging the democratic fight in Greece need our moral support.</p>

   <p>Each telegram sent from here to the defenders of the Democratic Ideology will be an approval of the battle that they have been fighting with so much self-denial.</p>
   <p>It is not sufficient to follow the struggle of the Greek people for political emancipation with simple sentimentality. Our predispositions, our desires and our souls, if possible, must reach Greece, so as to demand the immediate installation of Democracy.</p>
   <p>The invitation of the Democratic Association includes all the Greeks of Chicago, who are interested in seeing Democracy in Greece.</p>
   <p>Greek and American speakers will interpret the unanimous desire of the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
