   <p>Greek ladies of Chicago and the surroundings, are informed through the publication, if and when they decide to go to Greece for a visit, that they must comply with a newly enforced Police Ordinance. Short skirts are tabooed. The length of the skirts must be twelve inches above the sole of the shoe. That is for all young and old ladies above the age of twelve. What a pity! That Chief of Police of that Great Greek Metropolis, Athens, must have crime under control, otherwise he and his unions wouldn't have time to go around with a tape line and stoop down to measure the lengths of skirts.</p>
   <p>Oh! Athens, the first land of civilization and freedom, where the Ancient Greek Maidens were encouraged to wear as little as possible in order to develop health and beauty, why do you now tolerate such nonsense. Of course, the head of that Police Department took such drastic measures, in order to safeguard the nervous system of the male population, on the advice and recommendation of the doctors of the Police Department.</p>
   <p>The learned and wise doctors said, "the aspect of shapely legs scandalized the nerves and therefore is injurious to the nervous system. Poor young girls, do not loose hope, the wise doctors may decide on something contrary tomorrow."</p>
