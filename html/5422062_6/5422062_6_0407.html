   <p>p.-1-.......As we regard the lamentable condition of our Greek communities and note how politics has crippled the activities of the churches, and how the officials elected by the various organizations are acting toward the Greek public which they represent and toward the Greek Orthodox Church, we cannot refrain from commenting on the situation.</p>
   <p>We cannot help reminding Greeks in general and the Greek youth of this country in particular of the evils arising from the abuse of politics, especially in the Greek communities, which are identical with the Greek Church. We deplore this quarreling among ourselves and our present ecclesiastical strife and dissension, the worst which has existed in centuries.</p>
   <p>We are sorry to see that politics in the Greek communities of this country has become as corrupt as in the old country in the last few years, so as to endanger the whole structure of the newly-established Greek Orthodox Church in America.</p>
   
   <p>We abserve that here as in the old country any one who becomes a politician adopts a very low and vulgar vocation. The business of politics has been developed slowly and has evolved into the most degraded of all forms of activity. It has gradually ceased to be a business at all and is now considered a questionable occupation like gambling, burglary or white slavery. Its practitioners have learned to resort to trickery and cheating, since their work in general is the worst type of exploitation.</p>
   <p>It was not uncommon a few years ago for a representative of the people to become a comedian and deliver jests from the tribune of the Assembly, and this sort of thing has now become a regular habit among the deputies.</p>
   <p>It has become a kind of sport among the people to make jests at the expense of their representatives.</p>
   <p>What a disgrace for a minister to engage daily in public fracases and to continue to hold office without compunction! It has become a national habit and seems quite natural for the deputies to insult the ministers, even without any excuse, and it is an established tradition that the ministers of the same party and the same administration shall ridicule one another.</p>
   
   <p>Personal hatred has become the rule in politics. The politician's only ambition is to ride in a minister's automobile.</p>
   <p>Behold this spectacle of your political life, you new Greeks! Do you like these conditions of division, hatred, and dissension? That is why we have come to the inevitable conclusion that the representative form of government is bankrupt.</p>
   <p>Freedom of speech has at times transformed the Assembly into mad-house like that in Corfu, and it is commonly said of any one who is eligible for the championship indecency that he must have been prime minister or be on the way to that office.</p>
   <p>By all that is holy, what a standard of conduct! And yet what difference is their between these conditions and the conditions now existing in the administration of the affairs of our Greek communities?</p>
   <p>Discipline is something entirely unknown. How has this come about? Nobody knows. Probably it began when those who were on top crawled down, or rather when those at the bottom began to climb up with such frenzy that the social elevators went crazy and did not know down from up.</p>
   
   <p>The politician in order to grab power became an anarchist, and when he succeeded, he turned conservative. Those who fell from power became anarchists again. The mob instinctively took immense delight in anarchy and overturned every one on top in order to keep up a continual see-saw without hope of any end.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile they are convinced that everything is all right, and whenever the county has a new government, they expect numerous improvements. How foolish! The offices of the prime minister and the other ministers are so unstable and precarious that nothing is to be expected. An administration in order to accomplish anything must first familiarize itself with the condition of the nation's affairs. But in Greece the administrations are always moving in and out. Portfolios exchange hands, and, chairs exchange occupants in crazy see-saw fashion, and ministers go in and out like Charlie Chaplin in his film-comedies.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, they never know who will be the next minister. All are candidates for the office of minister and ready to take over its duties any moment, just as among us everbody wants to rule the community and handle the affairs of the public.</p>
   
   <p>In every branch of human enterprise there is a certain number of specialists. In politics? All Greeks are specialists in politics and destined to rule their community or their country, and so all are watchfully waiting with frock-coat in closet, freshly pressed, to be called to the palace and take the oath of minister!</p>
   <p>So there is no room in politics for individuals with dreams, with ambitious, with plans, with ideals, simply because no distinction is made between them and the others. Minister, like the presidents of our communities are not chosen among the most capable; the most capable could not even be elected deputies. It is always the clever ones who are elected.</p>
   <p>The clever ones are nominated for all coalition groups, and in every election the voters find their names on the ticket. These clever ones are so numerous!</p>
   <p>The result is all these shameful debates, insults, and fracases and the frequent disturbances in the Assembly.</p>
   <p>To be a politician clearly means to be a liar, a hypocrite, a cheat, a clown, a sycophant, a plotter, a vulgar fellow, and a gangster. That is why the Greek public likes to poke fun at its representatives.</p>
   
   <p>That is why Greeks find more amusement in the sessions of their Senate than in Punch - and - Judy performances. Now do you like such conditions and such aspirations? Do you like the repetition and the continuation of these spectacles at the expense of our national and personal reputation and honor?</p>
