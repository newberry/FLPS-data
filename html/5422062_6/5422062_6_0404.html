   <p>p. 2 -To all those who contemplate a trip to Greece we recommend the perusal of this notice and suggest that it is to their interest to procure their tickets in Chicago and to make all arrangements for the journey here instead of planning to make them in New York.</p>
   <p>We feel obliged to notify our countrymen of the danger of dealing with any of those numerous exploiters who advertise in newspapers that in New York you can buy tickets at lower rates and get better cabins. Complaints of fraud have recently been made on account of misrepresentations on the part of these exploiters.</p>
   <p>The undersigned are all authorized steamship agencies and will issue tickets and arrange all the details of journey so that passengers may board their liners in New York without any worries connected with their baggage, since the agencies have responsible representatives in New York to care for their patrons.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The price of tickets is the same in Chicago as in New York; they cannot be bought at reduced rates there, as some agents in New York persist in advertising, likewise promising to secure better cabins to attract victims.</p>
   <p>The sooner the passenger deposits the money for his cabin, the better his cabin will be.</p>
   <p>No privilege is accorded to those who buy tickets in New York.</p>
   <p>Secure your tickets from the authorized ageneses undersigned, who issue tickets to Greece and not receipts to be exchanged in New York.</p>
   <p>Do not be satisfied with temporary receipts, which are unreliable, as the complaints above mentioned have proved, and adverse to your interests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Permission to reenter the United States cannot be secured, as some advertisements state, on a day's notice.</p>
   <p>The law requires that such permission shall be issued and indorsed by the proper department of the United States government in Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Pay no attention therefore to this advertised misinformation.</p>
