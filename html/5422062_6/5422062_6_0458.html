   <p>We are deeply grieved on account of the new and dreadful wound which has been inflicted on the body of Greece by the cruel force of the Italian Government. At a time when Greece, afflicted with many misfortunes, is still preoccupied with the terrible problem of its two million refugees, relicts of a disaster for which the great nations of Europe are not free of responsibility, Italy instead of sympathizing with Greece is taking advantage of its weakness to promote imperialistic schemes, making an arrogant display of force against a much distressed people, threatening it with economic destruction and the repetition of the tragedy which has befallen the Greek refugees.</p>
   <p>Such conduct discourages those who desire the reign of justice and peace on earth, and it increases the number of those who ask whether the sacrifice of Christ has not been in vain, since even after the horrible lesson of the late war we observe this trend downward.</p>

   <p>In the name of the Holy Scriptures, the teachings of which have been cruelly disregarded in the perpetration of these acts of injustice, we address our ardent supplications to your Christian feelings and request that you will raise your voices in protest and intervene to prevent further cruelties which would result in the absolute collapse of our civilization and the abandonment of all Christian ideals.</p>
