   <p>The Greeks of Chicago were deeply moved by the death of Andrew Chronis, prosperous and prominent partner of John Raklios. Mr. Chronis was killed when a train struck his automobile last Saturday.</p>
   <p>The solemn and impressive funeral rites were held in the St. Andrew Church. The deceased was one of the founders of the Church--in fact, it was named in his honor. The ceremonial was conducted by Bishop Callistos and four other Greek priests. Expressive Byzantine music filled the church, and brought tears to the eyes of the congregation. The eulogy was spoken by the Bishop, and funeral orations were delivered by Dr. C. Theodore and George Spannon.</p>
   <p>Andrew Chronis came to America thirty-six years ago. For many years he had one of the finest flower shops in Chicago. Ten years ago, he became a partner in the Raklios Company. His death has been a severe loss to <span class="page-break">\2</span>his business associates, and to the Greek community, of which he was one of the foremost members. We extend our sympathies to his bereaved family.</p>
