   <p>P. 1- The constant repetition of telegraphic reports from Greece seems to prove the authenticity of various rumors that Mr. Michalacopoulos is about to visit the United States. His proposed visit, however, is for his own enjoyment and satisfaction and is not for business purposes.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Michalacopoulos were to visit this country as a private individual we would not be justified in cdmmenting upon the purpose of his visit, but on the contrary, feel gratified to learn of the arrival of a citizen as eminent as Mr. Michalacopoulos who, incidentally, is a political party leader.</p>
   <p>But the point in question, is the fact that Mr. Michalacopoulos intends to visit this country in the capacity of Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs, and we believe that we are therefore justified in inquiring what perplexing diplomatic problems exist between the United States and Greece to warrant the arrival of the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs in this country for the solution of them.</p>
   <p>A Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs cannot simply undertake to visit the United States; he must have a sound basic reason for doing so.</p>
   <p>Since present relations between the United States and Greece are in excellent condition, thanks to the Greek ambassador in Washington, Mr. Simoupolows, there are no questions or problems pending to justify the visit of the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs to America, so far as rendering service to the Greek nation is concerned.</p>
   <p>The proposed trip of Mr. Michalacopoulos to America is simply to satisfy his own personal desires and at the same time to let him receive all the honor and the respect due to the dignity of a minister. This ministerial visit will be made at a great expense and the cost will be felt both by the Greek nation and by the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>Therefore, as long as there exists no reason whatsoever to prompt the visit of Mr. Michalacopoulos to the United States in the capacity of Minister of Foreign Affairs, the only interpretation of his visit is that he desires to come into contact with the Greeks in America and to study them.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why we consider the proposed visit of Mr. Michalacopoulos to America as a topic worthy of journalistic comment and investigation; we wish to find out to what extend his visit will benefit Greece and the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>We believe that Mr. Michalacopoulos, because of his position as Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs and his personal idiosyncracies is the official least competent to make a visit of this nature. We frankly express our opinion that his proposed trip will be useless, and we should much prefer the visit of another minister; of some one capable of studying conditions and of making deductions which will prove of benefit both to the Greek nation and to Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>In the ensuing article we shall comment at length upon matters to which the Greek Government should turn its attention before deciding to send one of its officials to the United States.</p>
