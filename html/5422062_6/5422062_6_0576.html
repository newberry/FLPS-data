   <p>The Liberal Society held a very impressive meeting last Sunday in Hull House. Despite the fact that plans were made for the meeting only four days in advance, it was attended by a large and enthusiastic audience. Many people were turned away at the last moment.</p>
   <p>The hall was decorated solely with American and Greek flags. In the middle of the platform was hung a large map of Greater Greece, and below it was a picture of Venizelos, which was garlanded by a wreath of unwithering flowers donated by the Ipiros Club. They were flowers from the verdant mountains of Ipiros.</p>
   <p>During the intermissions, the audience was entertained by Greek and American music under the leadership of Mr. N. Varzos.</p>

   <p>Mr. V. Salopoulos, president of the Liberals, opened the meeting and explained its purpose. He said that every vote for Constantine would be a vote for the traitors, murderers, and enemies of Greece.</p>
   <p>The first speaker he introduced was Mr. K. Karofilas, a journalist, who related many anecdotes about Mr. Venizelos, which were greatly appreciated by the audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul Demos, a young lawyer, Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos, Mr. [Spiros] Kotakis, and Mr. Halepas, editor of The New Life, made speeches. The speeches were heard with great enthusiasm and the audience ended the meeting by giving cheers for Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. N. Demopoulus suggested that the persons present send telegrams to their friends and relations in Greece, urging them to vote for Venizelos.</p>
