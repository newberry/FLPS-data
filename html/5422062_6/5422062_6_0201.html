   <p>Last Friday at the Bismarck Hotel a unique festival of Greek letters was given in honor of Miss Iphigeneia Pappas, a Greek Poetess, who is visiting our city.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greek poets, headed by Mr. Demetrios Michalaros, noted Greek-American poet, planned the festival, which was rather unique for the Greek community of Chicago. Mr. Andrew Vlachos, eminent attorney, acted as master of ceremonies, and in very complimentary language presented the guest of honor, who recited some of her inspired poems in beautiful Greek.</p>
   <p>Other Chicago Greek poets who pleased the gathering with their poems were Mr. Takis George, George Koutoumanos, and Mr. Mechalaros. This festival of Greek letters was the first of its kind given in Chicago by Greek poets.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Pappas, at the closing of the festival, recited in English one of her famous poems, entitled "America the Beautiful."</p>
