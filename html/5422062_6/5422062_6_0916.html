   <p>P.3--With delight and pride we publish the account of this noble deed of the Pan-Hellenic Society of Chicago, and we hope that our other societies will follow its example. The Pan-Hellenic at its last meeting voted unanimously to contribute $500 for the national defense of Greece. The money was sent immediately to the central contribution committee in Athens with the promise that other remittances will follow.</p>
   <p>This act of the Pan-Hellenic Society is indeed praiseworthy. But this is not the Society's first gesture of this kind, for often in the past it has come forward to do the works of patriotism and philanthroph and has thus led other societies to do their share. Congratulations and many of them to this true-blue Hellenic organization!</p>
