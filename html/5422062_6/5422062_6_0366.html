   <p>In a meeting of the "Philiatfes" the president of the community announced the contents of an appeal to the natives of "Philiatra" by the Mayor of their native town.</p>
   <p>"Due to the fact that our town "Philiatra" is honored by the visits of our many former citizens, who are now in America, I deemed it imperative to ask you, the older men, to appropriate enough money for street improvements, for elimination of any ugly sight, and for beautifying the town of your childhood, as much as possible, to resemble an American town. When our visiting sons come here, they will find, not only comfort and hospitality, but also a pleasing environment, similar to that to which they are now accustomed. I, hereby, move for a resolution to be adopted and forwarded to our former citizens, now living in every part of the Great United States of America, to assist us in our enterprise. We will be grateful for suggestions and ideas concerning the new world in which they live, so that we here may best use the money sent to serve the purpose and the desires of the senders."</p>

   <p>Our former mother country calls us for assistance, and the success of the enterprise does not entirely depend upon the local civil authorities and the people of the town, but upon every individual of the town now abroad. Come, now, Sons of Philiatra, take the initiative, and set an example for others to follow; come and let us Americanize our former town.</p>
   <p>This Newspaper sincerely congratulates the Mayor of Philiatra and wishes and hope that other mayors in Greece will follow his example. The newspaper, Saloniki, also congratulates the Community of Philiatra, of the city of Chicago, for their idealism, and willingness to remember their home town back in the Mother Country.</p>
