   <p>A royal decree has been published in Greece concerning Greek citizens of military age living in the United States, Great Britain, and France. On the basis of this law, Greek citizens residing in the United States, Great Britain, and France, who belong to classes which have been called or are about to be called to serve under the flag, must serve either in the Greek army, or in the army of the country in which they have established their residence. They are thus given the privilege of choosing between the two countries. Greek citizens residing in Chicago are hereby duly notified to decide in which army they wish to enlist.</p>
   <p>It is their duty and it is our duty to serve America if we wish to remain in America.</p>
