   <p>We have been notified by the Y.M.C.A. that the collection for the erection of its buildings in Athens has been started by contributions from Mr. John Raklios of $5,000 and from Messrs. Tom Chamales and G. Prassas, $3,000 each, as well as other liberal amounts - $20,000 in all.</p>
   <p>If the promptness of these few fellow-countrymen of ours, who responded to the call with $20,000 is taken into consideration, it can easily be imagined what sum the fund would have amounted to for the purpose referred to above, if the mission under the Most Rev. Father Gennadios had handled the matter with prudence instead of allowing itself to become the tool of one camp, which is always trying to indentify itself with the generosity of the Greeks of Chicago and to represent it as the result of its own efforts.</p>
   <p>We only regret that every noble cause becomes the object of political exploitation in which one side is apt to display its fictitious power with the money and the loss of the others.</p>
