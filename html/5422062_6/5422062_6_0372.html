   <p>p. 7.- The spirit of mother Greece is ever-present among her scattered sons. Time and space, however, does not alter the ever-burdening devotion of these sons for their Greece.</p>
   <p>Chicago Vresthenites, natives of Vresthena, Sparta, Greece, in a meeting last week raised $3,450 through contributions which latter are still continuing to come in. These contributions are sent to Vesthena to apply to a fund for the construction of an automobile road connecting their town with Sparta. The road will be constructed mostly with American dollars and automobiles. American automobiles will be used for travel along these roads.</p>
   <p>What a change? How much did the American Greeks contribute to that? The answer is clear. The Greeks of America, with their American dollars and American ideas, coupled with their love for mother Greece, will mould the destiny of future Greece.</p>
