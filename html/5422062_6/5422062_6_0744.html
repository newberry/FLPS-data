   <p>p. 2. -- Attorney Andrew Vlachos at the invitation of the University Club of Chicago delivered a lecture on January 22 on the subject of the Balkan Wars, the present world tragedy, and Greek history. It was the first time that a Greek had delivered a speech in this exclusive club.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos brought out the evidence of intrigues carried on against Balkan states and with convincing arguments revealed the rapacious designs of Russia and Italy, the former having an eye on Constantinople and the latter on the Dodecanese. The audience was very much impressed by the Greek lawyer's address and applauded him very enthusiastically.</p>
