   <p>We are announcing to the Greek public that we are giving a dance, Sunday, November 10, in the Red Room of the Hotel La Salle. Proceeds will go towards the National Hero fund in Athens. We are urging other organizations to refrain from holding any affair on that date to assure us a successful evening.</p>
