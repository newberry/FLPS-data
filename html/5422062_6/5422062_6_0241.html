   <p>The excursion of Ahepa to Greece is an event of great importance for the Greek populace of America because it is the first time that a large group, as a group, has undertaken such a visit to Greece.</p>
   <p>This excursion is not only pleasant and enjoyable for those who make the trip, but it is a patriotic act at the same time, and its consequences will be great as much for the Greeks of America as for Greece.</p>
   <p>Such events are worthy of discussion and study because their consequences will be of great importance for the relations of the Greeks of America with their native land, for the excursionists will become the fervid heralds of Greece, bringing back good impressions from their journey. It is necessary that special endeavor be made in Greece to treat with hospitality those who go there from America, that each one of them may form the best impressions on his journey and transmit them to the Greeks here.</p>

   <p>We dwelt at length previously on the question of binding closer the relations of the Greeks of America with Greece and of finding means to accomplish this purpose. One of these means is frequent communication of the Greeks of America with Greece, and just because of this we consider the excursion of Ahepa of great importance, something towards which the Greek government and its representatives in America must turn their attention.</p>
   <p>And most important of all is the economic viewpoint, because besides the money that the excursionists will spend during their stay in Greece, they will become the cause of many others going there and even investing their money in various enterprises in Greece.</p>
   <p>It is a matter greatly to Greece's interest to study the question of the reception of foreigners and especially of her own children abroad.</p>
   <p>We are not considering the matter from a sentimental point of view but from that of pure economics, and we urge them to study it because, unfortunately, they have not given consideration to it as yet.</p>

   <p>Every Greek going to Greece means importation of gold, for which neither merchandise is sent abroad, nor loans are contracted. It is a spontaneous inflow of gold into Greece which may rise to millions of dollars annually.</p>
   <p>..... If Greece had competent representatives in America, she would have a whole system especially adapted to attract the Greeks of America and their capital.</p>
   <p>But why stop to consider the way of attracting the Greeks of America to Greece after the representatives of Greece have alienated American Greeks and have ceased all intercommunication with them.....</p>
   <p>And is it not indeed surprising that the Greeks of America still remember Greece when official Greece has forgotten them and severed even the bonds of the Church?</p>
