   <p>p. 5.- The Greek people of Chicago made a very poor showing at the first performance of the National Greek Troupe at the Auditorium Theatre last Saturday. Thousands of people were at parties, shows, or other amusements when they should have been at this limited showing. Those that did come were well satisfied.</p>
   <p>If ever an organization needs support, it is this one. We Greeks have lacked interest in theatricals when they should be our greatest pleasure. Only two more performances are to be given and the Greeks must go to them. We hope there will be a greater attendance at next Thursday's performance.</p>
