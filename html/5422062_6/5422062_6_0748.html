   <p>That progressive and energetic Greek of our community, Mr. Vasilios Kontaxopoulos, wholesale tobacconist, heading a committee of prominent Greeks has undertaken a journalistic battle and called the Chicago Tribune's attention to the fact that as a rule the Tribune, is inaccurate when it deals with Greek news or the reputation of Greeks:</p>
   <p>Editor of the Chicago Tribune:</p>
   <p>In regard to your note of comment on McCormick's letter in yesterday's Tribune, in which you stated that the Greek elections resulted in the defeat of the Venizelus Ministry, I wish to advise you that no elections have been held in Greece.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The King has ended the session of the Vouli (parliament). This body will take up its work again in October, and should the King be antagonistic to any action which it may take or to any measure which it may favor, he has the power to dissolve the "Vouli" and ask for new elections.</p>
   <p>I hope that you will make the necessary corrections in order not to give a false impression of the attitude to the Greek people toward the policy of Mr. Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Basil A. Condax.</p>
