   <p>p. 2- Thousands of Chicago Greeks gathered last week at the Turner Hall to demonstrate their affection for Eleutherios Venizelos of Greece and their confidence in him and disapproval of King Constantine in general.</p>
   <p>Fiery oratory was poured forth by many speakers, and long telegrams and reports from Greece were read to the gathering. The people became wildly enthusiastic when an authentic report from Greece showed the confidence of the Greek people in Venizelos. The report said that demonstrations by the people and by the solid body of recently demobilized soldiers revealed their affection for Venizelos. The report continued that King Constantine had no right to overturn the constitutional government, dismiss the lawful premier, and seize despotic power; that he had no right to dishonor his minister's pledges to the Entente and his own solemn treaty with Servia nor to join hands with his country's deadliest enemy, Bulgaria.</p>
