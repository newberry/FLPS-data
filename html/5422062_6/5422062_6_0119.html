   <p>p. 3.- Prominent Arcadians of Chicago and the suburbs, last Friday, gathered to discuss plans for a general Pan-Arcadian meeting with the object of raising money through contributions, to be sent to Tripolis, to erect Colokotronis' statue. Marshal Colokotronis, of historic prominence, was the scion of a great family, Colokotronaeon, whose every member, 120 in all, shed their blood for the independence of Greece.</p>
   <p>Word had come from Tripolis that the statue would be erected as soon as the American Arcadians send their contributions.</p>
   <p>The meeting was organized and called to order by N. Salopoulos, who, in a speech, brought out the services and sacrifices of Colokotronis, and urged all the Arcadians to contribute towards the statue.</p>
