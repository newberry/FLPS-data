Mr. Bogdanos has established a branch of his institution in New York with a $1,500,000. capital, complying with all the banking rules and regulations of the state of New York.</p>
   <p>This new branch of the National Bank of Greece, and the already existing branch of the Bank of Athens, act as clearing houses for the commercial needs of the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bogdanos, while in Chicago examined the possibility of a branch for Chicago, but refrained from to committing himself. He left Chicago very enthusiastic over the progress of the Greeks here.</p>
