   <p>Just as the child recognizes the mother who has weaned it and thus is thereafter obligated to the parent, so does every civilized people and even a few semibarbarous peoples recognize their common mother, the land of their birth. There is no doubt that the children have diverse important obligations to their mother who has suffered and toiled for them. To a greater degree, however, higher and nobler obligations must be accepted for the land of ones birth, for there is no greater ideal than genuine filial devotion to one's country. Even as a mother, it rears and cares for its children, always according to its means and abilities. The state and the national government assume the responsibility for educating the young in public educational institutions and upon completion of their formal education trains them in civic and military matters, that they may become useful and productive citizens.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We want to say, here, that family organization and management is on a small scale and roughly comparable to the methods and pattern of the national government or state. Education within the family, for example, parallels and to some extent precedes the education which is offered in public educational institutions. So, we notice that the family supplements the work of the state in many important ways. There never has been a sound national structure where the national character has not been firmly molded by the family as the first firm foundation.</p>
   <p>But, specifically, where should the young be trained physically and mentally and exactly where is their character to be formed? It is a repetition, we know, but we emphasize that the country's sacred temples, the churches, and above all the traditional, patriarchal family organization are its small and large educational institutions. So, in state, church, and the family institution, we find the foundries where the state's citizens are educated and trained; where national character is molded; and where individuals willing to sacrifice their wealth, their lives, and their souls for the sacred ideals and cherished <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>dreams of the fatherland are created.</p>
   <p>In these sacred national tabernacles and in the various educational institutions, resides the great national Greek spirit which is a most precious treasure for those men who derive strength, pride, and inspiration whenever they are called upon to fulfill the national historic destiny of a reborn Greece.</p>
   <p>Greek citizens and patriots who have been reared with the blessings of their fatherland and who have been inspired by its spirit, possess the means to contribute to the glory and greatness of their country. Today, we, the Greek-American immigrants who are so for away from home have a common mother, that is our glorious and beloved Hellas. As far as we know, there is no Greek in Chicago who is not devoted to Mother Hellas, body and soul. We are demonstrating here the ways and means whereby the future of our country may be enhanced and insured. On every given occasion we always contribute in proportion to our material means towards the needs of the homeland. While it is true that we have never denied our help and support to our country, it is equally <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>true that we have never acted in a spirit of concord and harmony to demonstrate our loyalty and devotion to it. Especially here in Chicago has there been no important concerted action, no wholehearted co-operation amongst us when we were called upon to support some great national cause. We can show only individual accomplishments. We can claim rightfully that we have submitted to numerous sacrifices in money, sweat, and blood which are indeed proof of "patriotic spirit and a high sense of personal honor," but we have never agreed to unite, to act together, to work harmoniously for the promotion of our common cause. This never happens because our vanities, hatreds, personal rancors, blind ambitions, and passions for position and power are chronic diseases with our people which have seriously and tragically interfered with the progress and welfare of our nation as well as of our Chicago community.</p>
   <p>It seems that these diseases must be eradicated by death.</p>
   <p>To the Greek people of America, there now has been tossed the idea of ordering, financing, and building a Greek battleship in the United States, as a gift to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Mother Hellas. This is indeed a most praiseworthy and daring act of patriotism and genuine devotion. Those who conceived the idea and who are working for its fulfillment must be highly commended for their noble sentiments. However, the question arises: Will the great and sacred objective materialize?</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago know the state of our affairs. Because of conditions in the Greek communities particularly, and the economic crisis with attendant unemployment generally prevailing in America at this time, it seems that the project has been hastily and prematurely conceived. However, I think that under certain conditions it is not difficult to accomplish the task of building a Greek man-of-war. And this is the way in which it can be done: First, get rid of envy and hatred. Let there be peace. Get rid of our violent Greek stubbornness and poisonous enmity. A general spirit of love must prevail. Lovers of true patriotism must unite. Perfect harmony must prevail and must be established among all classes of our nationals in America.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>How can this be accomplished? Is it impossible? In the final analysis we think that it is not as hard a job as many of us are inclined to think it is. Those of us who are leading the campaign for the great cause must seek the sympathy and support of those who have, until now, been opposed to many causes which are beneficial to Hellas, because they did not think of the ideas first and because they were not offered a position of leadership and responsibility.</p>
   <p>The prominent Greek leaders of New York City especially, and the old vanguard of the Panhellenic League particularly, must be appeased and won over. Let them join with each other, not as friends, but at least as patriots, thus contributing to the full realization of our sacred cause. From New York City itself, next to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston, must come the warmth of concord if our cause is to succeed. As our elders and first immigrants let them set the example. The work which they will do toward unifying and reconciling the Greeks of New York City will do much to influence the internal affairs and the welfare of all the Greek communities throughout the United States. For <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>this effort the invaluable support of New York's metropolitan Greek press is urgently needed. These two important factors--the Greek element of New York and its powerful press--will be the two great pillars of Hellenic strength in this country.</p>
   <p>Now, then,with the individual co-operation of our people and in a spirit of self-sacrifice for our homeland, the Greeks of New York will have a direct effect on our own great community here in Chicago. There is no doubt that all other Greek communities will follow in their footsteps and emulate their good example. All of us would like to see Mr. Vlastos [Translator's Note: Great pioneer Greek newspaper publisher in New York] and Mr. Botasis [Translator's Note: Distinguished Greek diplomat and acting Greek consul-general in New York] work in harmony and for common purposes. The great Rallis family [Translator's Note: A prominent family of politicians and businessmen] as well as the many other outstanding leaders of New York will set the pace for the Greek press, the clergy, the consulor staffs, teachers, professionals, businessmen, and laborers. Then, united under their inspired leadership, we will work <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>constructively for the high purposes which we shall set before us.</p>
   <p>The newly appointed Greek Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency, Mr. Lambros Kobomizas, will receive with great joy the news that the Greeks in America are working harmoniously and enthusiastically together. His word and his benevolent influence will do much to spur our people to work together. So, old enemies will meet in New York City; Themistocles will meet Aristides [Translator's Note: Two great Athenians who forgot their personal hatreds and animosities in a critical moment before the Battle of Salamis which was waged against the Persians and which saved Athens and Greece from slavery and subjugation], and after a short while with the help of God we expect to send a battleship as a gift to the waters of famed Salamis under the shadow of the ancient temples of Athens. The ship will greet the spirits of the great heroes of Greece; it will cause us to recall the heroic naval exploits of Kanaris, Miaoulis, Bouboulina, etc. [Translator's Note: These were great admirals during the Greek War of Liberation, 1821-1829.]</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>It was these heroes of modern Greece who made the Greek world shine with their great acts of heroism, reckless bravery, and self-sacrifice.</p>
   <p>The ship which we, the long-absent children of Greece, will send to those distant shores will greet the great historic monuments which have been put up in commemoration of those who gave their lives that Greece might remain free. It will greet both our liberated and unredeemed brothers in the Fatherland. It will give the latter courage and strength to overthrow the tyrant and effect the future resurrection of our country.</p>
   <p>If we so succeed in co-operating with each other, great sums of money will be collected. Let every patriot imagine the thrills of joy that will course through his body. Let every genuine Greek in America imagine the great honor that will be attached to our name by offering this important naval unit to our country.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>We, who live among many foreign communities in Chicago and in America generally, separated by thousands of miles from our land of birth, are not forgetting the most urgent needs of our Fatherland in spite of the fact that most of us have been thrown into the hard struggle for existence in a new type of world. Today, more than ever before, we are remembering our country with the deepest sense of obligation to it; especially, because Greece's naval power and superiority will decide its destiny and national aspirations.</p>
   <p>So, may Almighty God keep our leaders here in America united so that the noble work which we have undertaken may be completed. May the wishes of our fellow-countrymen be fulfilled; and may the Holy Church of Christ grant us her divine grace during the progress of our work. May the hopes and aspirations of those of our brothers who are under foreign domination help us destroy the tyranny, barbarism, and oppression. We will thus be worthy of the confidence which our brothers and our beloved Fatherland have in us.</p>
