   <p>Dr. Nicholas D. Cheronis returned from his Grecian trip last week. He departed for Greece with his wife and daughter last September and since then has been visiting the mountains and valleys in all parts of Greece.</p>
   <p>We hope Dr. Cheronis will tell of his trip in one of those interesting lectures we are always glad to hear.</p>
