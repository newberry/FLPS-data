   <p>After many conferences and consultations, the Greek women and girls descended from Tripolitans have finally established a club which they have named, Philanthropic Society of Tripolitan Women and Girls.</p>
   <p>The main reason for this club was a letter sent from the priest of Metamorseos, Andrew Panagiotopoulos and Angeline Tsigos, which stated that there was imperative need for money to repair the church.</p>
   <p>The initiative for this action was furnished by the following women: Helen Giannopoulos, Sophia Nicholopoulos, Marika Malliros, and Basiliki Bousios. At the first meeting of June 27, quite a few women appeared, who, upon hearing the contents of the letter, donated the following sums:</p>
   <p>Helen S. Giannopoulos, $10; Marika H. Malliris, $10; Katina A. Deligiannis, $10, Marika I. Askounis, $10; Basiliki N. Marachos, $10; Marika, I. Papanastasiou, $10; Sophia K. Nikolopoulos, $10; Helen P. Nikolopoulos, $5; Marika D. Koubelis, $5; Angeline T. Antonopoulou, $5; Sitsa I. Agriostathis, <span class="page-break">2</span>$3; Marika D. Papantoniou, $3; Georgia N. Marcus, $3; Basiliki K. Dousias, $3; Pitsa D. Bouloukou, $3; Catherine Bouloukou, $2; Georgia Bouloukou, $2; Paraskevoula Barkouli, $2; Erasmia G. Habilomatis, $2; Marigo G. Lazaropoulos, $2; Antonia B. Basilopoulou, $3; Helen P. Ladas, $3. Total $116.00.</p>
   <p>At such an opportune moment, the Tripolitan women and girls set the foundations for this organization. They chose a temporary chairman, Helen Giannopoulos and secretary, Katina Bouloukou. They set the date of the next meeting, July 11.</p>
   <p>There were many women and girls at this meeting. After Miss Bouloukos read the minutes of the previous meeting, the president and a few other women spoke a few words, the name of the organization was chosen, new members were enrolled and the election of offices took place. The results were: Helen Giannopoulos, president; Sofia K. Nikolopoulos, vice-president; Marika Malliris, treasurer; Basiliki Dousias, secretary. The Board of Trustees consists of Marika Askounis, Christina Anoriopoulos, Pitsa Bouloukos, Erasmia Hamilomatis, Marika Koubelis, Basiliki Theodoropoulos, Marika Galanopoulos, Helen Ladas, and Helen Panagakis.</p>
