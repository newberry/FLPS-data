   <p>The Greeks of the United States who are associated with American businessmen, are duty bound to make use of one of their rights. It is no secret that thousands of Greek dollars have been given to American businessmen, and that large fortunes have been acquired through the dollars of the Greek people.</p>
   <p>Therefore, today, when the American capitalists see that an effort is being made to keep the Greeks of Thrace in slavery, it is the duty of these individuals who have become rich through the aid of the Greeks to raise their voices in protest. They must influence their Congressmen to vote for the freedom of Thrace.</p>
   <p>....This would be possible if this were not such a materialistic age; as; it is difficult for people to fight for a cause from which they cannot benefit <span class="page-break">\2</span>materially. Therefore the responsibility must be placed upon the Greek businessmen. There are over five thousand Greek business establishments, such as restaurants, barber shops, candy stores, etc. in Chicago. Naturally, all of these businesses have contact with American concerns. These Greek merchants must therefore appeal to these Americans who have influence on the lawmaking bodies, that they intervene for the Greek cause. This should be done by all the Greeks in America, and not only by those in Chicago, in order to get favorable results. It is a struggle not only for the businessmen, but also for the pastors, professors, newspaper editors, and all who know influential American people. Since we have the misfortune of being unorganized, and therefore unable to fight as a unit, let us work as individuals and fight bravely for our enslaved brothers in Thrace.</p>
   <p>Let us fight, as do the Bulgarians who--although they did not send one soldier to France, and did not give five cents to the Liberty Loan--still found Americans to help them in their selfish desires.</p>
