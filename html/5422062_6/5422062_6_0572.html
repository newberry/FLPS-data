   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Please publish the following: Because of the innumerable congratulatory telegrams sent to me by the Greeks of America on the occasion of my name-day anniversary, I regret that I am not able to answer each one personally. I express my sincere thanks, however, through the Saloniki, wishing them all the greatest blessings in the New Year.</p>
