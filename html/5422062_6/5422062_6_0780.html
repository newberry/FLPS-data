   <p>The Chicago lodges of Panhellenic Union of America received copies of the telegram sent by the Greek Minister of Finance, Alexander Diomedes, authorizing the president of this organization to float a one million dollar loan for the Greek government, among the Greeks in America. This national loan of Greece will be payable in ten years without interest.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Greek in Chicago to subscribe to the national loan, thus assisting mother-Greece to fight for the liberation of our brother-Greeks in Thrace Macedonia, and the islands.</p>
   <p>The Greek government bonds are redeemable in ten years. It is not a donation, buy more bonds than you can afford, make Chicago the leader of the cities in America in bond buying.</p>
