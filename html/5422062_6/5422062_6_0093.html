   <p>Last Sunday, immediately following Holy Mass in Holy Trinity Church, a splendid dinner was served in honor of the Most Rev. Metropolitan Bishop of Korinthia, Mr. Damaskinos, in the house of Mr. Palevo, President of the Association of Greek Communities of Chicago. Many eminent members of our community were present. (The names follow--Translator).</p>
   <p>The Most Reverend Damaskinos blessed the dinner and, with a few words, traced the high achievement of the Greek families, which, regardless of how far away they are from the fatherland, preserve their ancestral tradition.</p>
   <p>After the dinner the little son of Mr. Nickolatsea, Elias, recited, very cleverly, two poems that provoked strong emotions, and the hearty congratulations of the Most Rev. Damaskinos.</p>
