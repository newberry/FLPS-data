   <p>P.3--Not once or twice but repeatedly the Greeks of Chicago have sent and do send money to Greece for public works and other improvements.</p>
   <p>It is surprising to know that American ideas and methods are in evidence everywhere in Greece, and in years to come Greek towns and villages will be of American type.</p>
   <p>The fraternity of the Chrysafites of Chicago, having determined that it is their duty to assist their native town, Chrysafa, have sent another sum of $1,500 to be added to the fund which provides for the waterworks now being constructed on the American plan. The Chrysafites are to be congratulated not only for their readiness to help but also for their preference for American methods, which have been proved to be practical and are the best known.</p>
