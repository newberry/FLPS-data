   <p>p.8-The Transfiguration Society was founded on June 11, 1911 by Epirotes born in Tsiatista or descended from natives of that village in northern Epirus. The purpose of the organization was to buy the village from the heirs of Ali Pasha, who owned it, to take care of its members, and to assist in the education of the children of their native place.</p>
   <p>The Society paid the sum of $15,000 for the village. All this money was donated by the members.</p>
   <p>When the purchase had been completed, and the village had become the property of its inhabitants, the proud Tsatistiani merrily celebrated the redemption of their native town from the descendants of a bloodthirsty alien.</p>
   <p>The board of trustees and the committee for the purchase express their thanks and appreciation to Pantelis Vellas, Valilios Vellas, Ioannes Manelis, Constantinos Manolis, Athanasios Koloniaris, Constantinos Koretsos, and Christos Karfias for their services during the negotiations for the purchase.</p>
