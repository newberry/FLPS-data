   <p>With delight and pride the Greeks of America will hear that the Greeks of Chicago have founded a patriotic society under the name of Military Association.</p>
   <p>The object of this newly-organized society is to assist financially the National Defense Society of Athens, Greece. The membership fee is fifty cents per month. The accumulated money from fees and from benefit dances and similar activities of the society will be sent semi-annually to Athens without deducting any expenses for the operation of the society. The expenses of the society will be taken care of by contributions of the executive board. So every dollar collected will be sent for the national defense of Mother-Greece.</p>

Lectures, mainly patriotic but also on social, commercial, and professional subjects will be delivered in the society's hall by prominent Greeks of Chicago and elsewhere, who will be invited for that purpose.</p>
