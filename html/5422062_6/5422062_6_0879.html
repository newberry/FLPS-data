   <p>P. 1- A hundred and twenty-five natives of Verzova, Mantineia, Greece, who have settled in Chicago and have founded a fraternity of their own, are in the spotlight so often, because of their fraternal and patriotic activities that their name has become known all over Chicago's Greek community and spells Progress with big letters. In recent weeks they have raised among themselves a separate contribution of more than $700 besides their general contributions in the Panhellenic gathering for that purpose and have sent it to the Metropolitan of Athens for the victims of Bulgarian atrocities.</p>
   <p>Now they come the fore again with another contribution of $2100 to be sent to their native Verzova to swell the fund which is being raised to build the new St. Gerge's Church there.</p>
   <p>The Star feels that it is its duty publicly to commend this progressive patriotic group, and it sincerely congratulates them. They are known as industrious, productive, law-abiding citizens, patriotic and generous.</p>
