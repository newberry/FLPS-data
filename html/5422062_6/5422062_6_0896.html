   <p>Soterios Georgeadis and S. Lambardakis, president and treasurer respectively of their district of the national defense campaign, have sent through the Chicago Greek consulate $389.90 to the central committee in Athens, Greece.</p>
   <p>These gentlemen are to be congratulated for the money which they have raised in their district and for choosing the Greek consul's office through which to remit it to Greece. That is the proper and official channel to use in sending money for such a purpose.</p>
   <p>Let us all adopt this method and not act independently of the consulate.</p>
   <p>While we are on the subject, let us remind all our fellow-Greeks in Chicago to contribute heavily for the needs of Mother Greece. This is a campaign for funds for the national defense of Greece. Rich and poor, small and great, all are children of that immortal country, and all should contribute generously.</p>
