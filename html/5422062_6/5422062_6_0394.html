   <p>p. 2. The Greek colony of Chicago is happy to have had as its guest for a week Mr. Thales Koutoupis, formerly a minister in the Greek cabinet and a representative of Lacedaemon in the fourth national Assembly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koutoupis as a journalist and a politician has always supported liberty and justice and has often been persecuted for his courage in expressing his opinions.</p>
   <p>On last Sunday he spoke at the invitation of the Liberal Club urging his listeners to participate in the reconstruction of Greece by investing their money in enterprises there. In this way they will help the fatherland to develop its natural wealth, and will also make a good profit on their investment.</p>
   
   <p>After the lecture a committee was appointed by the Liberal Democratic Club to arrange for a banquet in honor of Mr. Koutoupes. This will be given on Sunday at the Sherman Hotel. All those who wish to be present may apply to the Liberal Club.</p>
