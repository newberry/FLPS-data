   <p>p. 1-Upon numerous occasions we have revealed in our columns the sad state of the Greek consulate in Chicago, brought about by the scandalous activities of our consul general Mr. George Depasta, in the affairs of our Church and by the absolute indifference which he has displayed to those national and social affairs of ours which properly fall under his jurisdiction, and for attending to which he is highly paid by the Greek Government.</p>
   <p>Our accusations against Mr. Depasta, voiced through our columns, were stated very clearly and the contributing causes of a condition which necessitated our constructive criticism were thoroughly explained. We have no personal prejudices against Mr. Depasta; on the contrary, we owe him respect for the courtesy and the refinement which he has displayed. But matters of personal consideration should be set aside when we are seeking to unearth the truth.</p>
   
   <p>It is well known that Mr. Depasta's reputation has sunk so far that it would be impossible to recover it from the very low stage to which it has fallen and our suggestion to him is to ask to be transferred from his present office before the entire Greek community of Chicago requests the Government of Greece to remove him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Depasta should have fully understood that it was not his business to intermeddle in the affairs of our Church. His defense of one faction of the Church and his display of antagonism to another have been responsible for his losing the respect, honor, and loyalty formerly accorded to officials of his capacity by the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>His intervention in our Church affairs has been conducted in so scandalous a manner that he has even resorted to illegal means to achieve his purposes.</p>
   
   <p>He has gone so far as to refuse to issue passports to the wives of Greek citizens whose marriages had been performed by priests who recognized the authority of the Holy Synod of Greece and not that of Bishop Philaretos!</p>
   <p>Not only that, but he has most impiously and sacrilegiously compelled such couples to undergo a second matrimonial ceremony conducted by a priest who is a member of the Rhodostolic Church and does not recognize the Holy Synod of Greece! In doing this he has violated the orders of his own Government, which instructed him to recognize marriages performed by any priest, regardless of which faction of the Church he might adhere to. Our consul is keeping this written decree concealed, and in spite of our repeated demands he refuses to show it to the public.</p>
   <p>Mr. Depasta pays no heed to reiterated admonitions forbidding him to interfere in our ecclesiastical affairs and continues his intermeddling, employing the most scandalous tactics.</p>
   
   <p>After failing to persuade the North Side parish to recognize the authority of Philaretos, he has begun new negotiations with the West Side parish. He has gone so far as to apply the term "expatriots" to those Greeks who recognize the Holy Synod of Greece and not the Rhodostolic Church of Mr. Philaretos.</p>
   <p>The other day we published an article recounting the recent activities of Mr. Depasta in his interference with the affairs of our Church, and we shall continue our revelations at greater length and set before the public some startling facts which prove that this gentleman has erred so grievously that his removal from the office of consul general of Greece in our city is an imperative necessity.</p>
