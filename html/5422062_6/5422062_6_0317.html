   <p>p. 1- With the formation of Mr. Eutaxias's Government in Greece we have no doubt that this problem of the division of American Hellenism will be solved in such a way as to close the gap opened between us in the past by party fanaticism.</p>
   <p>It is time for the ecclesiastical division into Venizelist (Republican) and Vasilican (Royalist) churches to cease because it not only menaces the very foundation of Greek communities in America but also reflects upon the good name of Greeks among other races. Whereas in Greece, with the passing of this particular period of politics, partisan agitations have ceased, we continue to call our churches Venizelist (Republican) and Vasilican (Royalist). And since these differences were intruded among us from Greece under the Venizelist regime, it is the duty of the new Government under Eutaxias to eliminate this great evil and to restore peace and unity among the Greeks of America.</p>

   <p>In this church problem of ours Mr. Eutaxias is the only one of our politicians well acquainted with all the details, and he has expressed himself on this subject, saying that it is very unfortunate that the Greek people in their communities here have separated from the Church of Greece. After this statement of his we have not the least doubt that with the help of the Eutaxias Government things will be set on their regular course again, - a course from which some years ago party bigotry diverted them.</p>
