   <p>p. 2- At the last meeting of our Society, St. George of the Dolianites, the sum of $507 was collected for the purpose of building a new and larger church in our native Doliana.</p>
   <p>This mother lodge of Chicago appeals to all native sons of Doliana in America to contribute according to their financial standing so that the erection of the church may begin as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>All contributions should be sent either to Chicago or to Demetrios Kachrimanes, general treasurer of our society in Athens, Greece. The local treasurers in Chicago authorized to accept contributions are Messrs K. Kournetas and Elias Doulos. No contributions are too small for acceptance.</p>
