   <p>The Greek easily gets angry, and this attributed, according to Greek Mythology to the Demi God composition of his entity. In other words, the Greek if half God and half Human. So according to Mythology the Gods were in a better creative mood, when angry, and in a forceful way brought out the secrets of the Cosmos for the enlistment of the Greeks, who were their sons. That is why the Greek of today maintains that anger is a pathos, neither a good nor an evil, neither a virtue, nor a sin, but a gift from heaven to the mortals, bring out the Divine potentialities hidden in the human self, and causing humans to accomplish deeds which, otherwise, would remain unknown. However this divine gift is utilized not for the purpose it was given, but for a purpose which eventually tends to lower us to the state of the animals.</p>
