   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>This letter is on authority of His Royal Highness, Prince Paul of Greece, who requested me to express his appreciation for the many courtesies extended him from time to time by your worthy publication and the splendid manner in which you have written of him through your columns.</p>
   <p>In the meantime I wish to commend most highly on the work of your representative, Mr. Meyer Zolotareff whose writing has been so beautifully prepared in articles regarding the Prince.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>I particularly refer to Mr. Zolotareff's article of the 27th instant on the first section two of your paper, entitled "Prince Unites Greeks Here," which has been enthusiastically received by our fellow countrymen in Chicago, and the news of which has been well announced.</p>
   <p>Four hundred copies of the entire issue of yesterday's edition were ordered by my office and will be sent to public officials and royal families of Europe.</p>
   <p>Wishing you continued success, I am,</p>
   <p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros.</p>
