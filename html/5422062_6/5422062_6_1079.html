   <p>The Chicago Chronicle, when a couple of young, robust Greeks had exercised their muscles by pounding each other's heads lest the muscles become atrophied, wrote a humorous story about them and added the following paragraph:</p>
   <p>"The idea of an anticipated fight which is commonly implied in the expression 'when Greek meets Greek' depends on a misinterpretation. The above adage originated in the English Parliament in the year 1779 when Richard Lee, British Minister of War, invoking the union of all the political factions of the country against an anticipated war from without, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>used this figurative expression: 'When Greeks are united with Greeks, then expect war!"</p>
   <p>Thus the accepted meaning of to-day is quite wrong. Anyway, right or wrong , the Greek must be the subject of whatever stories are manufactured to amuse readers. And of course "the Greeks have a word" with which to curse mudslingers, and in fact, "it is all Greek to them."</p>
