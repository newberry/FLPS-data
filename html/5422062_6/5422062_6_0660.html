   <p>The Greek community of Chicago had the honor of being host to His Excellency, the Ambassador of Greece to the United States at Washington, D. C., Mr. George Rousos, on Friday evening.</p>
   <p>Upon arrival here he went to the Blackstone Hotel, where many hundreds came to greet and pay their respects to him. It is needless to say that the Greek people reserve special honor and esteem for the nation's highest public officials.</p>
   <p>The ambassador received all those who sought to see and speak to him with the greatest simplicity and courtesy. Many prominent leaders of our Chicago community interviewed him on national and international issues resulting from the war.</p>
   <p>In his person the long absent Greek people saw the incarnation of their <span class="page-break">\2</span>homeland's sentiments, character, and ideas. He spoke very kindly to all, in an informal manner, regarding the reputation the Greek people have established for themselves in business and industry. He said he had been informed that Chicago has more Greeks than even New York, and that our city will become the great Greek business, educational, and cultural center of America.</p>
   <p>On the next day, Saturday, at 2:00 P.M., he spoke at Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue. A huge audience composed mostly of Chicago Greeks filled the spacious and beautiful hall to overflowing.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with the playing of military marches, and the American and Greek national anthems, which stirred everyone very deeply. The music was rendered by the U. S. Navy Band.</p>
   <p>The arrival of Ambassador Roufos was greeted with the thunderous applause of an enthusiastic crowd.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Mr. Peter Lambros, who acted as chairman and master of ceremonies, made a beautiful and stirring introduction after calling on the Reverend Xadzidimitriou to pray for the success of the meeting, and for the health, happiness, and welfare of the American and Greek nations. He invoked the Lord's blessings on the common cause of the Allied and American peoples and armies, and for the restoration of peace, justice, honor, and the reign of God in all human relations.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Lambros' impressive introduction, Mr. Paul Demos, secretary of the Greek committee for the Liberty Loan campaign, spoke briefly. He appealed to all Chicago Greek-Americans to show their patriotism and loyalty by making a success of the Liberty Loan drive. He reported on the progress of the sale of Liberty Loan bonds among the Greek people; informing the audience that more than $500,000 had been subscribed. There was not a Greek who refused or hesitated to buy a bond, he said. The audience received this news with frenzied enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Afterwards the Honorable Mr. Felix J. Streyckmans, director of the Foreign <span class="page-break">\4</span>language division of the Liberty Loan general committee, spoke eloquently and convincingly about the sacredness of our cause in fighting a ruthless, oppressive, and barbarous military and despotic alliance. He reminded us of the rape of peaceful, innocent Belgium, whose gallant resistance to the enemy gave France the opportunity to stem the Teutonic war machine at the Marne. The speaker commended and praised the patriotism and willingness of the 100,000 Greek people of Chicago in doing their part in the war in which America is now engaged successfully and victoriously. He said that he was proud to be among Greeks, for time and again they have given actual proof of their devotion and loyalty to everything, that America stands for. Mr. Streyckmans' speech was received with great enthusiasm by the thousands in the auditorium.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Professor Paul Shorey of the classics department of the University of Chicago, whose distinction, fame, extensive knowledge and ancient Greek scholarship are well known in America. He reviewed the glorious, historic past of the Greek nation, dwelling particularly on <span class="page-break">\5</span>Periclean Greece, which, he said, gave birth to, cultivated, and applied the principle of political democracy. He mentioned the artistic, political, and intellectual contributions of the immortal Greek genius to the civilization of the world--which civilization and glorious heritage Germany, Kaiserism, and unprincipled military autocracy seeks to destroy. Professor Shorey said that we, as true Greeks and bearers of a glorious name and civilization, should be the foremost defenders of democracy, justice, and the principles of human civilization. Professor Shorey received tremendous applause for his speech, which was full of wisdom and inspiration.</p>
   <p>We also had the unique honor of listening to a distinguished Chicago and Illinois political figure, the Honorable Edward J. Brundage, Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, who compared the blessings derived from a democratic form of government with the abomination of absolutism, despotism, and cold, brutal military autocracy.</p>
   <p>He reminded us that the "glory that was Greece" was the product of democratic <span class="page-break">\6</span>government, and political prudence and wisdom; not that of force, violence, and disregard for the dignity, honor, and rights of other peoples and nations. He said that the United States is intimately related to Greece; for in America the Grecian ideals of a powerful, benevolent, civilized, and reasonable rule by the people for the advancement of civilization in every expression of life, are faithfully and constantly promoted and fostered.</p>
   <p>After the Honorable Brundage's brilliant and enthusiastic speech, the Greek national anthem was sung by the distinguished Greek tenor, Mr. De Parry.</p>
   <p>The singing of the stirring anthem was heard by the standing audience with raptures of warm patriotism and great emotion.</p>
   <p>Finally, the huge crowd went wild with joy and enthusiasm when the impatiently awaited and most distinguished guest, the Greek ambassador, Mr. George Roufos, arose to bring to the Greek children of Chicago the greetings of their sweet mother, Hellas. In a measured captivating voice His Excellency said:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"I need not, nor do I seek to hear what your sentiments for your great homeland are, because I feel your throbbing hearts which are full of devotion and loyalty to Greece. I have not come here to inspire you with enthusiasm or patriotism, for you have both; but I came here to become more closely acquainted with you. I am sorry that I was unable to visit you earlier. Important state diplomatic affairs, however, demand of every diplomatic representative that he remain at his post, especially, during critical war times.</p>
   <p>"I am most happy because by my visit here I have the pleasure of becoming evermore impressed with the greatness of your Chicago community. If your community is not the largest, it is, at least, the second greatest Greek community in America, where the Greeks have established prosperous businesses and fine homes. This is most pleasing to our great homeland, which follows its scattered children with a wakeful eye and maternal interest.</p>
   <p>"You all know that besides individual interests, there are national interests <span class="page-break">\8</span>for which we should show greater concern. I do not doubt that this is the case with you.</p>
   <p>"You all know that our country--as well as the country in which you are living, together with other allies--is in a state of war against other nations. These other nations, driven by a spirit of forced domination, seek to strangle liberty, and to subject all civilized nations, in which the spirit of democracy rules, to conditions of slavery. For this reason it is incumbent upon us to sacrifice our all for the sake of preserving the liberty which our honored forefathers have bequeathed to us.</p>
   <p>"So, I urge you to enlist joyously in the ranks of the American army when you are favored by the call to arms. Respond willingly to any demand that the country may make on you. Deprive yourselves even of your daily bread in order to purchase the Liberty Loan bonds. The Greek government has instructed me to inform you that those enlisting in the American army are exempted from any military obligations to Greece, as the American army is <span class="page-break">\9</span>an ally of Greece.</p>
   <p>"You must realize that victory for the Allies depends on America, and only through this victory is the independence even of Greece guaranteed. I announce to you with great pleasure that such guarantees establishing the rights of Greece have been offered by the French Government. Great Britain has made the same declarations.</p>
   <p>"The greatest guarantees and most important statements have been made by the great President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, who said: 'we are eagerly watching the soldiers of liberty who are struggling heroically to stem the barbaric tide. We should not fear these great noises--they shall be crushed.</p>
   <p>'Our troops are composed of various nationalities. Each has its own aspirations. We must know these aspirations in order to appreciate the nations and, consequently, the armed forces which each one of these nations is supplying. The British soldier is <span class="page-break">\10</span>fighting for the preservation of the power and prestige of the British Empire. France is fighting for the liberation of her beloved provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, which were taken from her against her will. The Italian and Greek soldiers are fighting for the liberation of their brothers from hated slavery. These separate motivating forces are very significant and have great influence over each nationality. The American soldier is fighting with the determination to save democracy, the destruction of which is a threat to the very existence of democracy and America'.</p>
   <p>"Everyone fighting for the great cause, is equally fighting for his special and beloved national aspiration and ideal.</p>
   <p>"The policy of destruction must cease; the constructive efforts of peaceful peoples and civilization must be resumed. Our attention and anxiety must be directed to one end: how to win the war. Only then will we win, when the patriotic sentiment of the people is kept high so that it will support the <span class="page-break">\11</span>strength of its endurance.</p>
   <p>"The German Government and the German people are equally responsible for the war, because they are inspired by the spirit of world domination; and each of their allies must share the same responsibility.</p>
   <p>"Consequently, we have to prevail even if it requires the sacrificing of our all. In the hope that you will all willingly do your duty, I ask you to shout: Long live the United States of America! Long live Greece!"</p>
   <p>The crowd burst in thunderous applause and shouts of enthusiasm and joy.</p>
   <p>Then, the ambassador spoke briefly in English, expressing about the same thoughts and sentiments. Thus, at about 5:00 P.M., this great and magnificent patriotic gathering came to a close, leaving the most enthusiastic and patriotic impressions.</p>
   <p>In the evening, a dinner was given in the grand ball room of the magnificent <span class="page-break">\12</span>La Salle Hotel by the National Security League. Mr. John W. Thomas, Assistant Cashier of the Central Trust Company of Illinois, was master of ceremonies. About six hundred guests were present, including a number of prominent Americans. At exactly 7:00 P.M. all guests took their places at the tables. After the playing and singing of the American National Anthem, which was followed by enthusiastic applause, Mr. Thomas started the dinner program. The Reverend Archmandrite Leon Pygeas invoked Divine guidance and inspiration is solving important national problems, and for the success of our arms in the present titanic struggle.</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the banquet Mr. Thomas gave a beautiful toast in the name of the National Security League, eulogizing the sacrifices, contributions and great historic past of the Greek race. He said that Hellenism's patriotism, national interests, just demands, industry, and general progress have endeared the Greek element in America to the American people. He stated that the Greeks occupy an exceptional position in the business world of America. His remarks were received with tremendous applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>Then Mr. Peter Lambros made a few remarks before introducing Mr. George W. Dixon. Mr. Dixon spoke very eloquently about the war, and about social, moral, and patriotic matters.</p>
   <p>Afterwards Mr. George Kyriacopoulos was called upon. He spoke in English urging patriotism, and exhorting us to measure up to our duty in the present critical circumstances by fulfilling our many obligations to struggling America. Then Mr. Rufus G. Dawes, a multimillionaire and on the board of directors of many large public utilities, and brother of the well-known Charles G. Dawes, president of the great Central Trust Company of Illinois and administrator of public finance and supplies of the American expeditionary forces in Europe, spoke enthusiastically and forcefully. He said that ancient Greece was the mother of civilization and the workshop of humanity's greatest intellectual, artistic, and political institutions. He compared the Greek civilization to the Roman civilization, saying that the Romans sought to conquer the world with the sword and their legions, while the Greeks sought to conquer the world through culture and the immortal feats of civilization and enlightenment. The same parallel may be <span class="page-break">\14</span>drawn in regard to the violent militarism and imperialism of Germany and the civilized efforts of America and other European nations. He said the United States has opened its doors and welcomed the European immigrants with joy and enthusiasm; taking them under the protection of a kind, tolerant, generous, peaceful, freedom-loving, progressive, and democratic government. He further stated that these immigrants should take advantage of this kind and whole-hearted reception by becoming assimilated with the Americans, who are very friendly disposed toward them. In this way these alien peoples can enjoy all the blessings of equality and justice, that a democratic government offers all the inhabitants of this land. Mr. Dawes proved by this fine speech that he not only is a cultured gentleman, but that he is also inspired by philhellenic sentiments.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stamatios Perzas, former consul general of Greece in Chicago, spoke next. He said that American democracy is a continuation of the Greek democratic ideals of Periclean Greece. Then he said: "How good and hospitable is the nature of the American! What benedictions are showered upon the Greek people and all other nationalities that have immigrated to this promised land!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\15</span>
   <p>Mr. Perzas then spoke in Greek, recommending that we forge stronger ties with the native stock, the American people, from whom we have so much to learn. There are many, he said, who have misunderstood the people who have made any efforts to adopt the American way of life; and that he is sorry for those who know the American way, but still misunderstand it. He said that he despises those who, though they do not know the American way, misrepresent and misinterpret it. He said that he is leaving Chicago shortly, but that he will always follow the progress of the Greek community of Chicago, which he has loved so tenderly.</p>
   <p>Finally, His Excellency the Greek Ambassador, Mr. George Roufos, was introduced, whereupon the guests stood up and applauded endlessly. The ambassador said: "I repeat to you, fellow countrymen and dear friends, that I am very happy to be amongst you, whom I consider my brothers. My happiness mounts when I think that you, coming here as immigrants, have progressed, and have succeeded in creating businesses and fine homes and families, even though you did not have knowledge of the English language nor any appreciable intellectual or professional preparation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\16</span>
   <p>"It is imperative that you come in contact with the American element from whom you will benefit tremendously in every respect. You should become organized, for it is through organization and united effort that you will succeed and progress in any undertaking.</p>
   <p>"Your fatherland expects so much from you, but it also expects that you love, honor, and appreciate this land in which you are the recipients of abundant blessings. It expects you to prove your love for and interest in America by subscribing to the Third Liberty Loan. In this way you are helping your adopted country in time of serious emergency; while indirectly you are also aiding the allied fatherland.</p>
   <p>"This is neither the proper place nor the time to discuss local or nationalistic questions as our entire attention must be focused on great national needs of immediate importance. By ministering to these exigencies we are preserving and guarding our liberty and independence. In this great struggle both America and Greece must win. But if Greece is to emerge victorious, <span class="page-break">\17</span>she must be assisted by this great and powerful nation--America.</p>
   <p>"Our own beloved fatherland, under the able, efficient, vigorous, and intelligent leadership of Venizelos, will be led to the road of victory, prosperity, peace, and happiness; but we must comprehend, however, that Mr. Venizelos has absolute need of the favorable disposition of the great powers, Great Britain, France, and Italy. He has especially need of the friendship and sympathy of this country's great President, Mr. Woodrow Wilson, to whom we should give every possible satisfaction and support."</p>
   <p>On hearing the names of President Wilson and Venizelos, the guests stood up and cheered.</p>
   <p>Thus, this national celebration and truly patriotic demonstration, stirred by the enthusiasm of the Chicago Greeks, the presence of Ambassador Roufos, and the energy and inspiration of the National Security League which sponsored the meeting in behalf of the drive for the Third Liberty Loan drive, came to an end.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\18</span>
   <p>On the following Monday the ambassador received many visitors from our community, and on Tuesday at 10:00 P.M. he departed for his post at Washington, D. C. to continue his great work for the good and glory of our fatherland.</p>
   <p>Happy journey, your Excellency, and may God strengthen you and help you in your tasks.</p>
