   <p>p. 1- Because the Greeks in America do not approve of the anti-Hellenic policy of King Constantine and have displayed their opinion to the world by the demonstrations which they have held everywhere in this country, the diplomatic agents of the King's propaganda recently sent thirteen hundred demobilized Greek soldiers to America, ticket and expenses paid by the treasury of the Crown, to tell us what a wonderful King we have, how much he is beloved and idolized by the Greeks over there, how Venizelos is hated by the people as a real destroyer of Greece, and other sugar-coated stories for the benefit of this Germanophile King and his Queen, the Kaiser's sister.</p>
   <p>King Constantine, as a man and as a King, has every right in the world to think kindly of his Germanic war-lord, but he has no right as a constitutional King to work and act against the interests of the Greek people. This is treason.</p>

   <p>In childhood, as undoubtedly you remember, we were taught of the return of Odysseus. Homer tells us lively stories about this shrewd and wily hero. So this returning group of Greeks, like new Odysseuses, tell us beautiful stories of Constantine, whose stables they guarded in Athens, far away from the firing-line and the battle-front.</p>
   <p>Whenever you meet any of these thirteen hundred returning pseudo-apostles of the Greek people, ask them to show you their military service-books of discharge, and then you will see that these bad eggs never saw a battle-front, but every one of them was a guard in the royal stables, guarding the royal horses of the royal family. While their brother-Greeks were fighting in the midst of fire and hell, these poor weaklings were kept in stables, to be trained for the purpose for which they are now sent here.</p>
   <p>Now be on your guard when you meet or hear these pseudo-apostles; ask them to show you their discharge-books. They will not do so because they know their weakness....</p>
   <p>Beware of these thirteen hundred returning apostles.</p>
