   <p>p. 1.- The theatrical activities in the Greek community of Chicago, this year, are very lively if we judge by the number of companies advertising their programs.</p>
   <p>The artist, Marios Rotz<span class="gap">[gap]</span>iron started the season by the unforgettable presentation, "The Little Teacher" of Nickodemi, at the Auditorium for the benefit of the Greek school, Socrates. Its success from an artistic and material point of view will leave a record in the annals of Chicago's Greek community.</p>
   <p>Then comes the troupe of Mrs. Lolota with a series of presentations that still continue at the 8th Street Theater. Now the "Athenian troupe" has arrived from Athens, and will start a series of performances a week from next Sunday at Adelphi Theater in the loop.</p>
   <p>This theatrical company contains within its folds selected Thespians of the Greek Theater, among them being distinguished P. Svoronos, an artist of pan-Nellenic fame and Ch. Georgiadis, leader in drama and composer in Greece.</p>
