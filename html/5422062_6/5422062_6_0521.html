   <p>When the indescribable, horrifying disasters of Asia Minor took place, the changes in Athens, and the affairs in Thrace--the entire patriotic Greek population of Chicago and America, regardless of conviction, disheartened and suffering deep anguish, sought in every way possible to indicate by threat, protest, and demonstration, that it was ready to make every personal or material sacrifice for the sake of the national honor and interests.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we can say that from New York to the Pacific coast every compassionate and loyal Greek used every means--the press, American public opinion, the clergy, professional and businessmen, and the people at large, to solicit interest in our national affairs. Consequently we can say that the United States, of itself, and through the intercession and work of the Greek people of America, has openly declared itself against the policies of France and Italy, the atrocious massacres by the Turks in Asia Minor, and the reestablishment of Kemal [Pasha] and the Turks in Europe. President Harding of the United States, this great humanitarian, has <span class="page-break">\2</span>offered his support through the Red Cross and the American Relief Foundation of the Near East.</p>
   <p>Our pleas for assistance are not confined to the people of the United States only. In the name of our American citizenship and Greek descent, we ask the French people and government if they have forgotten that thousands of Greeks fought in the American armies against Germany. France was saved. Now, did we fight to strengthen France in order that she in turn could support the savage Turks in massacring our brothers? By these contemptible actions, France is dishonored, for she has violated two sacred contracts--the one with America, who undertook to fight in the name of Liberty, Justice, and Civilization on the battlefields of France, asking no terms and with no prospect of gain--secondly, France has violated a sacred obligation to Greece, who first broke through the Eastern Front during the World War.</p>
   <p>This is the procedure of the Chicago Greeks, who are foremost in any national movement: Through Saloniki, their organ, and its editor, Dr. Nicholas Salopoulos, the Greek people of Chicago sent the following telegram to Messrs. Govain, editor of the Journal des Debats, and Deputy Tardieu of Paris: Monsieur Govain, "Journal des <span class="page-break">\3</span>Debats," Paris.</p>
   <p>Monsieur Tardieu, Deputy,</p>
   <p>Paris.</p>
   <p>"Sixty-five thousand American soldiers, of Greek descent, fought in France for Liberty, Justice, and Humanity, and not for Turkish Tyranny and Savagery. The secret and open support of France toward the reestablishment of the Turks in Europe will be the blackest page in the world's history and the most criminal betrayal of France's Allies and of civilization."</p>

   <p>Editor of Saloniki, Chicago.</p>
   <p>On the very same day Mr. Constantine Palaiologos and Dr. Papatheodore dispatched the following telegram to the Premier of France, Mr. Poincare, to the French Senate, and to Mr. Tardieu in the Chamber of Deputies, to the French daily, Journal des Debats, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and to Chicago Tribune, Paris office:</p>
   <p>"We the 400,000 Greeks of America, and through us the entire civilized world, desire to remind you that 60,000 Greek-Americans fought side by side with their American and French brothers-in-arms on the battlefields of France, heeding the Allies' frantic call to save and preserve Justice, Liberty, and Civilization. Many of these men sacrificed their lives for France. Did they know that they were saving and supporting French arms in order that France could violate the spirit of the purpose and ideals of the Allies, and subject their brothers in Asia Minor and Thrace to the slaughter and outrages of the savage Turk, our common enemy during the Great War? This is a disgrace, a stigma to civilization, and a most peculiar sort of gratitude [to be recorded in] the annals of history."</p>

   <p>Another telegram was sent to the Foreign Minister at Athens, and through him to the Athenian press.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks of the United States desire to request, and advise the Greek government, the Revolutionary Committee, and the Greek people to persist in believing that their just cause, the honor, and interests of Hellenism in Thrace or elsewhere are above all other considerations. The Greeks of America are willing to sacrefice their lives and possessions in defence of these interests. We prefer an honorable death to a dishonorable life. The American newspapers, and the American public opinion are on our side."</p>
