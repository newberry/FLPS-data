   <p>Eighty-five Chicago Greeks left yesterday for New York where they will unite with other Ahepans from all over the United States for an excursion to Greece.</p>
   <p>From authentic sources we are informed that 1,800 Ahepans will participate in the good-will excursion. Feverish preparations are made in Athens and Piraeus to receive the Greek-American visitors.</p>
   <p>To our Chicago fellow-citizens Saloniki wishes bon voyage, and safe return.</p>
