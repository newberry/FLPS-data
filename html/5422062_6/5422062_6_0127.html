   <p>p. 1.- Athens, the capital of Greece, fetes the visiting Greek-Americans and the distinguished Americans, who on a good will expedition visited Greece. Thousands of members of Ahepa and of Gapa and notables of the United States, were cordially received by the Athenian people.</p>
   <p>An Athenian festivity of importance was held at the Stadium, by the Lyceum of girls, in honor of the visiting Greek-Americans. One hundred thousand people overflowed the beautiful snow-white Stadium. One hundred thousand more filled the surrounding area.</p>
   <p>The celebration was honored by the presence of Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Venizelos, with his entire cabinet, high officers of the Army, congressmen, eminent men of letters, and the flower of Athenian society. The spectacle was magnificent. The Grecian capital presented a panorama of ancient grandeur.</p>
   
   <p>The visitors and the throngs were thrilled and fascinated by a group of giants attired in immaculate Greek kilts, who in full panoply presented a reproduction of renowned fighters, reminiscent of the Greek revolution of 1821. The reverberation of the cheers of two hundred thousands or more voices thundered through the whole city. Bravo to the Lyceum for putting up such a festivity which pleased, not only the participants, but also pleased the Greeks of America in general, revealing the friendly and cordial sentiment of mother Greece towards the Greek-American element.</p>
   <p>In spite of such a crowd-deluge, perfect order was preserved everywhere, and not a single incident marred the harmony of the festival. The civic authorities, wishing harmony and order for the festal honoring of the Americans, had established military precautions in every nook of the capital. The perfect of care taken of the anticipated multitudes was a military achievement. The authorities of law and order, with unparalleled devotion to their imperative duty, left nothing to chance. So all in all, the Ahepans, the Gapans, and the notable Americans were treated like kings.</p>
   
   <p>In the evening a magnificent banquet was given in honor of the visitors, sponsored by the National Bank of Greece, at the Actaion. The Hon. W. H. King, United States Senator from Utah, one of the excursionists, expressed his amazement at the cordial reception, and as a true Philhellenist and true statesman was deeply interested in the manner of rehabilitation of the refugees, their progress, and welfare, and above all, he was interested in the brotherly love of the native Greeks towards the unfortunate refugees. The American statesman inquired into all the phases of this enormous undertaking.</p>
   <p>In Eleusis and within the domains of the Temple of Demetra, the renowned dramatist, Vasso Kanellos, and his American-born wife, Tanagra, with fifty artists performed the chorus-drama of "Demetra and Persephone" with great success. The excursionists and thousands of Athenians, with great delight witnessed the performance which was given in honor of the visiting thousands of Greek-Americans.</p>
   
   <p>It is a pleasure and a spiritual stimulant to us here in America to know that mother-Greece opened her loving arms and embraced the visiting Greek-Americans. Undoubtedly the Greeks of America will reciprocate when the occasion arises, and return in full the Greek hospitality.</p>
