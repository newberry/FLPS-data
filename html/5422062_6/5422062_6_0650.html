   <p>Since yesterday, Mr. Polybius P. Lekos, general representative of the Greek Government and the Greek semiofficial press, which consists of the newspapers, Patris (Nation), Estia (Hearth), and Romios (Grecian), is staying at the Blackstone Hotel.</p>
   <p>These government newspapers have always been characterized by a pro-Ally sentiment. During the tragic scenes of November, 1917, they became the objects of violent attacks from the then Royalist Greek Government. Their presses and offices were completely destroyed. At that time the rival and stupid Royalist party of Greece not only resorted to cruel violence against the friends and members of Premier Venizelos' Liberal party, but sent many of the opposition's publishers and editors of the above papers to prison to serve long terms. Fortunately, by the intervention of the Allied Powers in Athens, they were saved from a worse fate.</p>
   
   <p>The first two newspapers voice the opinions and sentiments of the official Greek Government. They are also official mouthpieces of the Greek Liberal party, under the leadership of our internationally famous and able Greek statesman, Mr. Eleutherios Venizelos, the present premier of Greece. The last-named paper is Mr. George Souris' well-known satirical newspaper.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nicholas Politis, the Greek Foreign Secretary, by official decree, (the text of which is translated from the Greek into English), approved and endorsed by His Excellency, Mr. Garrett Droppers, the United States Minister to Greece, authorized Mr. Polybius Lekos to visit the United States in order to study and report on the commercial and economic status of the Greek people in America. He has instructions to report on the economic, financial, and diplomatic developments in America which are of particular interest to Greece.</p>
   <p>Mr. Politis stated in his letter that by these reports the Greek Foreign Office would be fully informed of the commercial conditions and needs of the United States. Until now the Greek Government had no commercial attaches in the most important American business and industrial centers. It is hoped that these reports and preliminary work will help the Greek Government to negotiate a new commercial treaty in the near future with the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lekos, as commercial and diplomatic representative of the Greek Government, has toured through several states, such as California, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. Now he is in our great state of Illinois, where he expects to be received by the Governor, the Mayor of Chicago, and other high state and city officials.</p>
   <p>More than two thousand of the most prominent Greek businessmen in Chicago came together in a Loop hotel to meet and hear Mr. Lekos speak the purpose of his mission in America, and to profit from his advice and proposals in regard to business, finance, and international trade relations. Mr. Lekos has already made a very practical suggestion, i. e., the establishment of a Greek-American Commercial Stock Company which will promote and develop import and export trade between the United States and Greece, as well as with the other neighboring Balkan nations. He also submitted reports and memorandums to many Greek and American business and financial leaders of Chicago, who approved the plan and promised to give the proposal further consideration. He stated that the Greek businessmen, the importers and exporters of Chicago, have a great deal to gain, and that they will receive great commercial and industrial benefits from the establishment of such a great company.</p>
   <p>The prime minister of Greece, Mr. E. Venizelos, the vice-president, Mr. Emmanuel Repoulis, the secretary of the Ministry of National Economy, the president of the Greek Chamber of Deputies, many ministers and bankers, the American Minister to Greece, the Greek consul general in Chicago, and the Greek-American Chamber of Commerce supplied Mr. Lekos with letters and documents in which they express their sympathy and support of the venture which is about to be undertaken.</p>
   <p>We are happy to know that many officials, including Mr. William Redfield, United States Secretary of Commerce, the United States' State and Treasury Departments, the Vice-President, Mr. Thomas Marshall, the governors of many states, many presidents of banks, [industrial] companies, and chambers of commerce, informed Mr. Lekos that they are in favor of his plans, which may eventually lead to very desirable trade pacts and agreements. They stated that every possible support would be offered.</p>
   <p>Because Mr. Lekos is connected with Greece's most prominent newspapers, Patris, Estia, and Romios, about two thousand of our Chicago Greeks expressed their desire to subscribe to these journals. This is very encouraging because it is actual proof of the respect in which Mr. Lekos is held, due to his diplomatic ability and his patriotic services to Greece.</p>
