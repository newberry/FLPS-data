   <p>We received the following telegram Monday morning:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"Oct. 17, 1927.</p>
   <p>"Vatra</p>
   <p>"Boston</p>
   <p>"Despite all the opposition the branch has been organized.</p>
   <p>"Kristo A. Liponi."</p>
   <p>(Christ A. Lepon).</p>
   <p>The federation Vatra now has a branch in Chicago. Kamber Machurishti, together <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with Mr. Liponi and others who had the progress of Vatra at heart, undertook the necessary propaganda work as early as last year. But because of the opposition they encountered, the branch was not organized until yesterday.</p>
