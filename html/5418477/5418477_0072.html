   <p>As you all know, as soon as I came to Chicago last year for personal reasons, always wishing to see the progress of our famous society, Vatra, which has saved and liberated Albania from the foreign yoke, I did not cease working day and night for the reorganizations of the branch in Chicago. But my dream did not materialize while I was here. However, I enjoyed coming in contact with those Albanians, who valued the work of the Federation, Vatra, and who later took the initiative in calling a meeting and organizing the Branch 30. These patriots are to be congratulated for their patriotic deed.</p>
