   <p>American businessmen are usually quite shrewd in seeing the opportunity to make excellent investments in foreign countries. Thus far, however, there has been little interest manifested in Albania as a field in which American capital might be invested with assurance of good returns. This is doubtless due to the fact that men of means know little of the opportunities for development in the Balkans, particularly that newest of the republics, Albania.</p>
   <p>There is probably no country in the world in which the possibilities for commercial and industrial development are greater than in Albania. When we consider that the present government is not yet four years old, and that for hundreds of years the Turkish government has prevented any industrial or <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>commercial development whatsoever in Albania, the possibilities are clearly apparent. Every enterprise which will eventually be introduced into the country is now in the crudest stages of formation. Capital is needed in every department of the emerging civilization.</p>
   <p>Albania needs railroads, truck roads, bridges, agricultural implements, modern vehicles, factories, the development of her water power, development of her mines and oil wells, improvement of harbors, and all other natural resources. The country is teeming with potential industries. Tobacco is grown, but not upon the large scale of which the country is capable. The wool industry offers one of the greatest possibilities for development, in as much as the mountains are covered with sheep and goats, and yet there is not a woolen mill in the country. Albania abounds in many varieties of fur-bearing animals, yet the fur industry is undeveloped. Tons of fine fruit rot in the orchards of Albania every year because the canning industry is unknown. Many parts of southern Albania are covered with olive orchards, and yet there are no factories for making oil, or for canning and preserving.</p>

   <p>We could go on indefinitely, almost, with the great opportunities to establish various sorts of businesses in Albania, having a two-fold result: first, large and easy incomes on the investment; second, a distinct service to the people of Albania.</p>
   <p>At the present time, there are many people in Albania out of employment, or at least not engaged in continuous and remunerative employment.</p>
   <p>American capital introduced into the country should bring about industrial development, give the people much needed employment, and assist in the general production of wealth. The leaders of Albania are very desirous that the American capitalists be stimulated to make investments in their country. They would much prefer American capital to that of any other country.</p>
   <p>From what I learned from representatives in the Parliament, the government would welcome American business men to the country, and would show them every courtesy in investigating the various fields for industrial development.</p>
