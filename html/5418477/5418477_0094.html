   <p>The members of Branch 30, Chicago, and the Albanians who desire to become members of the Albanian federation Vatra (The Hearth), are herewith notified to be present at the meeting which will be held Sunday, February 26 in Room 218, German Hall, 814 West Harrison Street, near Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Many matters of importance to every patriotic Albanian will be discussed at this meeting. The Albanians of Chicago and vicinity should be proud of membership in a society like Vatra, and those who, for personal reasons, have not yet had the chance to join the society should not hesitate to become members of Vatra, since by doing so they will benefit themselves, their family, and their beloved fatherland.</p>
