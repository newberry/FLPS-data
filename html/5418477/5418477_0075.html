   <p>The Dielli has recently reported the addition of two new branches to the federation Vatra.</p>
   <p>Branch 30, Chicago, was one of the older branches of the federation, but was disrupted for a long time by a few ambitious, anti-social men. However, the good patriots of Chicago, despite the opposition they encountered, recently reorganized the branch. We are confident that the new officers--Liponi, Meshgorani, Prifti, and others--are intelligent, energetic, and patriotic, and that through their efforts the Chicago branch will flourish. The Albanians of Chicago now have the opportunity to become members of Vatra and thus help their native land.</p>
