   <p>Two major programs, both national in character, will entertain Fair visitors today. They are the presentations of the Albanian and the Czechoslovakian groups.</p>
   <p>The arrival of the Albanian minister, Faik Konitza, who will make the principal address today, was one of the major events of yesterday's Fair. Reception of the diplomat was unusual, for it was an occasion when minister met minister. The Albanian diplomat is the first minister from his country to the United States. He was greeted on behalf of the Fair by U. Grant-Smith, chief of protocol, who was the first American minister to Albania, serving from 1922 to 1925.</p>
   <p>Reception Military Spectacle</p>
   <p>Yesterday's reception was a military spectacle with soldiers, sailors and marines from Camp Roosevelt passing in review. A fifteen gun salute was fired in honor of the official party. Accompanying the Albanian minister were Brig. Gen. William E. Horton, U. S. A.; Prof. Nale Drizari, instructor of Albanian languages at Columbia University; Christ A. Lepon, chairman of the Albanian-American club of Chicago, and others.</p>
   <p>The official Albanian program will be held this afternoon in the Court of States. Preceding the ceremonies there will be a parade of Albanians in native costumes through the Avenue of Flags.</p>
