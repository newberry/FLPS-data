   <p>The Chicago International Exposition opened its doors for 1934 on Saturday, May 26. Over half a million people attended the opening-day ceremonies. Included in this enormous crowd were officials of the State of Illinois, the City of Chicago, the Army, the Police Department, and many other organizations. Twenty-three foreign nations participated in the cermonies, among them Albania, whose delegation led the foreign countries in the parade.</p>
   <p>For this representation of Albania, we praise and thank our indefatigable patriot, Christ A. Lepon, who, through hard work and with the assistance of friends, made the required preparations and arrangements within two days, thus securing representation for the Albanian nation. Mr. Lepon is the only patriot who strives to promote nationalistic activities in our colony, and he should be praised at this time, since he has brought honor not only to our colony, but to all Albanians in the United States, and to the Albanian nation as well.</p>

   <p>Our nation was represented at this great event by the following young men and women, who were dressed in colorful national costumes: Messrs. Kristo Kolche, Pandi Xeka, Alqiviadhi Treslo, Koci Karakosta, Naqo Iskali; Mrs. Marigo Tromara, Mrs. Theofana Stefani, Mrs. Evanthi Prifti; and Misses Viki Thomas, Julia Peters, and Mary Anton.</p>
   <p>The flag of Skanderbeg, with its two-headed eagle, was carried by the zealous patriot Kristo Kolche, accompanied by Viki Thomas; and since all the nations were arranged in the parade in alphabetical order, our flag waved ahead of all the others. The Albanian delegation, and the colorful costumes of Toskeria (South Albania) and Gegeria (North Albania), made the finest of impressions on the spectators. The young men and women who represented our nation at this spectacular event, and who had made every effort to secure the costumes, should be highly praised, not least of all for their endurance in a parade which lasted more than two hours.</p>
   <p>After the parade we visited many of the interesting exhibits. Many officials, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and others, too, looked with amazement and admiration upon the beautiful costumes of the Albanians, and made inquiries about their origin.</p>
   <p>The Exposition will, in the near future, specify a day for us, to be known as Albanian Day. The Albanians must do everything possible on such occasions to honor themselves, their community, and their nation.</p>
