   <p>p. 2.- We notice in the paper, Dielli (The Sun), that, recently, two new branches were added to the Federation, Vatra. Branch thirty of Chicago is one of the old branches of the Federation, but was corrupted for some time by a few ambitious opponents to its social progress. However, the good patriots of Chicago regardless of the opposition organized the new branch in Chicago. We are confident the officials of that Branch, Liponi (Lepon), Meshgorani, Prifti and other members of the committee, are intelligent, energetic, and patriotic and that through their efforts the branch in that colony will progress. The Albanians of Chicago have the opportunity now to become members of the Federation and help their country.</p>
