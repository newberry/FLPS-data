   <p>The Trentini of Chicago, now that they have returned to the fold of the mother country, have thought of forming a club in order better to show their appreciation for their redemption from the enemies' yoke. The organization was christened "Trentino Club di Chicago." The following are its officers: S. Brugna, president; Joseph Bruner, vice-president; Marco Valentini, secretary; Sebastiano Lozzo, cashier; Ernest Prandini, Joseph Brugna, and Emil Mora, councilors.</p>
   <p>At its meeting last Thursday, the club accepted offerings from the members, for the people of the redeemed territories and added money collected to the subscription fund which we initiated. The Trentini deserve to be lauded and congratulated.</p>
