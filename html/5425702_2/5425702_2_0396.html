   <p>Throughout these United States, in many of the larger cities and in few of the smaller is found a memorial erection in honor of Christopher Columbus.</p>
   <p>No greater tribute can be paid to this world famous hero than a simple memorial to which people may gather about so as to keep alive the story, the fame, and glory of the son of the Genoese wool comber, who disregarded all advice and dared the journey in search of a shorter route to the Indies.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, the World's Fair less than a year away, the Italians could do nothing finer than to contribute a memorial in honor of Columbus to be erected within the Fair grounds. Through the suggestions and tireless efforts of our Italian Consul, Chev. Uff. Dr. G. Castruccio, a monument <span class="page-break">2</span>is now under way to procure a fund to build such a memorial. All Italian clubs, societies and fraternal organizations have pledged a quota to be raised among their members. It is a worthy cause and even in the days of great distress we are sure and certain that every Italian will respond.</p>
   <p>We leave the members of our organization free to contribute as they see fit. Those who cannot dispose of any large sums are asked to contribute as few cents as possible.</p>
   <p>We are certain that this project will add honor to the Italians of Illinois and hope that as always the Order Sons of Italy in America, of the state of Illinois will rank the foremost in contributions.</p>
