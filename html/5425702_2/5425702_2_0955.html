   <p>A great patriotic evening for the benefit of the Italian Red Cross, took place last Wednesday night April 12, at the Dante Theatre, 815 West Taylor Street.</p>
   <p>It exceeded every expectation for attendance and for patriotic ardour. Every seat in the theatre was occupied.</p>
   <p>The most distinguished men of the colony, with the Italian Consul, Conte Bolegnesi, as head, participated in this great manifestation of Italian patriotism.</p>
   <p>The national hymn best liked was a war song, composed by Professor Di Leo with lyrics by F. Bellandi.</p>
