   <p>An elaborate dance to commemorate the battle of Vittorio Veneto, the march on Rome, and the birthday of His Majesty the King will be given at the armory at Michigan Avenue and Sixteenth Street on the night of November 10 by the National Veterans' Association and the Fascio Georgio Moriani under the auspices of the consul general, G. Castruccie.</p>
   <p>We are confident that the Italian community, as in the past, will approve of so patriotic an undertaking and will once more affirm their appreciation of these events which form the most glorious pages of modern Italian history.</p>
