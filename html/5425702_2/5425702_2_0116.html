   <p>"Big Tim" Murphy, "Dago Mike" Carozzo, and Vincenzo Cusmano's friends have promised to collect an immense sum of money in order to save their friends from the hangman with an adequate defense fund.</p>
   <p>Labor unions, political friends, and personal friends' contributions will not only provide for an adequate defense with the best of Chicago's lawyers, Stephen Malato, Clarence Darrow, and Austrian, but will also help to collect material appertaining to the trial; which probably will be in April. On the other hand, the lawyer for the state is preparing the prosecution with his best assistants, led by Mr. O'Brien - known by the nickname of "Ropes" O'Brien because he was able to send so many criminals to the gallows.</p>
   <p>Despite their declaration of innocence, the State Attorney is sure that he can prove every charge of which they are accused. Not only has he the depositions of Vincenzo Vinci, Antonio Cifaldo, and Raffaele Buglio, but also important evidence. There was a rumor that Charles Epstein was asked to participate in the defense but he declined, saying he would not give his services on a case of that sort for any amount.</p>
