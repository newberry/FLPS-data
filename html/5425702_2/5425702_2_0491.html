   <p>Welcome! Delegates from the Atlantic to the Pacific! The second convention of the Italian Federated Societies of the United States will be held next Tuesday, October 9th, in Gazzolo Hall, at 2 PM, where more than fifty societies will be represented.</p>
   <p>The President of the Federation, Carlo Bonino of Hurley, Wisc., will preside, with his Secretary, Guiseppe Brighenti of Pence, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>We trust that our Italian Societies will co-operate with the Federation, in order that we may gain strength and fraternity.</p>
   <p>The Italia is the official organ of the said Society, and Mr. Oscar Durante is the Honorary President.</p>
   <p>We strongly believe in the idea of the General Federation, and prophesy that all the Italian Societies of the United States will soon amalgamate with the Federation, as exchange of ideas from the East to West will lead to victory.</p>
   <p>Come Delegates, one and all, to our Queen of the Lakes, and we will assure you a hearty welcome</p>
