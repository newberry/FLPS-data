   <p>If the proletariat of the world has registered beautiful auroras on May first, it has registered, also, some very dark auroras, stained by blood on the same day.</p>
   <p>I think it is necessary to recall some of those tragic days, because those experiences can be used to overcome the difficult obstacles which are placed in our path of ascension by the barbarous bourgeoisie. The most atrocious May first recorded in history, was that of 1886, when the movement for an eight-hour day was instituted.</p>
   <p>That period was filled with strikes, shut-out riots, demonstrations, massacres, prosecutions, trials, and judgments which affected every nation: an abomination of bourgeois justice which acted as a stimulus for international solidarity.</p>
   
   <p>Never has there been such a spontaneous, unanimous revolutionary wave as spread throughout the world that year. Everywhere, the workers organized themselves, and held meetings of protest. It was a period of great tension. The capitalist rule appeared ready to fall into ruin. The governments, in great terror, enforced exceptional edicts and rules, sending policemen and soldiers against the working masses to disperse and massacre them.</p>
   <p>Here in America, they believed that May 1st,1886, was only a minor disturbance. But even here, the agitation for the eight-hour day was fomenting.</p>
   <p>The working hours of that period were terribly long - 14, 16, and 18 hours - shortening the lives of the workers. By instituting the eight-hour day, industry might have absorbed the 4,000,000 unemployed, who in that year migrated from one state to another.</p>
   <p>The capitalists were enraged, and they hired an army of mercenaries, led by the famous Pinkertons, to face the masses of workers. Everywhere, riots took place, but the most serious episode was that which happened in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>At the meeting of the proletarians of Chicago, more than 400 policemen and 300 Pinkerton [agents] intervened. The collision was inevitable. Beatings, fights, brutalities,and mass arrests were the result.</p>
   <p>On the following days, the riots and conflicts were repeated and, at the meeting held at Haymarket Square, the policemen fired more than 250 shots at the crowd. Immediately after, a bomb exploded. To this day, no one knows who threw it. Sixty-six policemen were wounded, and six killed; four leaders of the working class were hanged, in spite of their innocence. Since then, all governments are afraid of revolution or some social catastrophe on May 1st, so they keep policemen and soldiers in readiness to subdue any attempt to revolt by the proletarian class.</p>
   <p>But in spite of all the crimes perpetrated by the bourgeois governments, our ideal has grown [sufficiently] to frighten them and to shake the base of the barbarous and ancient bourgeois social system.</p>
   
   <p>Now, if all the past violences have not succeeded in destroying our ideal, which strengthens the workers of the world into one mass, they will be less successful in the present reactionary wave.</p>
   <p>Fascism may have its hour; world reaction may have its temporary advantage, but Socialism will outline each and every one of its enemies, and in the end will definitely triumph.</p>
