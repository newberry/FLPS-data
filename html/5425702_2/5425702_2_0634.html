   <p>Prof. Luigi Carnovale, who has always distinguished himself in the vindication of the genius of our race, has obtained the recognition of Tonti, who was formerly considered a Frenchman. Through the efforts of Mr. Carnovale, Tonti recovered his Italian nationality and his name was engraved in a stone-tablet commemorating the members of Father Marquette's and La Salle's missions. The manager of the Chicago Plan Commission sent the following letter to Mr. Carnovale, regarding the vindication of Tonti's nationality and its recognition:</p>

   <p>Mr. L. Carnovale,</p>
   <p>1517 N. Michigan Avenue,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>With reference to previous correspondence relative to your suggestion that the space at Wabash Avenue and the Chicago River be named Tonti Square, or Tonti Circle, I am glad to say that Tonti is being given appropriate recognition.</p>
   <p>His name is mentioned with the others, and in the same manner that the other explorers' names are mentioned, on the tablet already erected on one of the Michigan Avenue bridge abutments.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In addition, there are to be four beautiful sculptural groups upon the Michigan Avenue bridge houses. The appropriate inscription which will accompany the group entitled, "The Discoverers", is as follows:</p>
   <p>Joliet, Father Marquette, La Salle and Tonti will live in American history as fearless explorers who made their way through the Great Lakes and across this watershed to the Mississippi in the late 17th Century, thus typifying that spirit of brave adventure which has always been firmly planted in the character of the Middle West.</p>
   <p>May I say further, that, the naming of streets, parks and circles, do not come within our jurisdiction.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Eugene S. Taylor, manager.</p>
