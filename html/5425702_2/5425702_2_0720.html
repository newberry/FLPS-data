   <p>A few days ago sixteen parochial students of Chicago returned to this city from a tour of Italy. They were part of a group of 261, which won a trip to Italy; a prize given by the Order Sons of Italy to the parochial students who showed the most progress in the study of the Italian language and history in the Italian parochials of America.</p>
   <p>The itinerary comprised all the largest cities of Italy, with ten days in some, as the climax. During their stay, they were entertained by officials at various functions.</p>
   <p>The tour recently completed was the first of this kind sponsored by the Order and its success is an assurance that it may become a permanent feature.</p>
