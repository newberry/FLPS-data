   <p>Today, Saturday, at 2 P. M., will take place the auction of one carload of apples donated by the benevolent Unione Siciliana for the benefit of the people of Trento, Fiume, and Trieste.</p>
   <p>We are hopeful that the Italians will participate so that a large sum of money will be raised.</p>
   <p>The first box of apples will be given away to the highest bidder by the great singer Amelita Galli Curci. Other boxes will be put on sale by Lina Cavalieri, Rosa Raisa, Riccardo Stracciari and Giacomo Rimini, all well-known lyric artists endeared to our public.</p>
   <p>The auction will take place at 313 N. Dearborn St. The Royal Italian Consul, Giulio Bolognesi, will be present.</p>
