   <p>The Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce has made a warm appeal to its members for donations in behalf of the Italian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>While the Italian soldiers give their lives in the battle field for the idea of a greater Italy, it is the duty of those Italians abroad to show their patriotism by giving pecuniary donations which is the only means to help our fatherland and relieve the war's hardships of those soldiers.</p>
   <p>Donations may be sent to the treasurer of local delegation, Dr. Cav. Anthony Lagorio, 812 Dearborn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
