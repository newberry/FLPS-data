   <p>The Grand Venerable of the Grand Lodge of Illinois of the Order Sons of Italy in America, Chevalier G. Spatuzza, sent the Editor of the Daily News the following telegram strongly protesting against an insulting article published by the paper, May 10, and written by Westbrook Pegler:</p>
   <p>"The Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois, Order Sons of Italy in America, in the name of its 3,000 members, American citizens proud of their ancestry, strongly denounces the article which appeared in your newspaper, May 10, entitled - 'Il Duce Sees Red at British Jibes.' Pegler in his article not only abuses the freedom of the press but shows a lack of understanding of its noble mission. The statements in his article contained an insult to a great people whose past has been an important one which was so annoying to perfidious Albion.</p>

   <p>"Whether you like it or not, Mr. Pegler, the truth is this: Since the coalition of fifty-two nations could not stop the triumphal march of Italy to Ethiopia, neither can all your lies, or somebody else's lies, harm Italy.</p>
   <p>"Lies, Mr. Pegler, have the power to reveal the baseness of the soul of a newspaperman and the base conception which he has of the profession which he prostitutes for a few cents."</p>
