   <p>The views of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Chicago on the question of official recognition by the Italian Government of Italian Chambers of Commerce in Foreign Countries, have been clearly stated in the reply of the Chicago Chamber to the report of the Paris Chamber regarding the proposed recognition, and to that reply we add this memorandum.</p>
   <p>The Italian Government's decree of October 13, 1918 issued after our reply to the above mentioned report, confirms our opinion that as far as the Italian Chambers of Commerce in America are concerned, and particularly our local organization, any legislative measure that attempts to regulate their functions is not applicable and cannot be approved by us at any cost.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The decision which we have made was based partly, but not entirely, on Article 5 of the Decree, which states that anyone who has lost his Italian citizenship is not entitled to take part in Chamber affairs with any authority whatever. Considering that out of 122 active members, all but two have requested and obtained their American citizenship papers, it is not difficult to understand how that article above might suffice to justify our decision. Nor can we be prevailed upon to change that decision because of the modification offered by the Minister of Commerce, which states that, at least, two-thirds of the active members be Italian by birth or origin.</p>
   <p>We believe that any measure that tends to regulate the nationality of our membership might complicate the work of this Chamber, which we hope and desire to see strongly seconded and strengthened by banks, commercial institutions, and others, managed by persons other than Italian, and we take this stand knowing that the element of Italian origin in this Chamber will always predominate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Article 7 states that Royal diplomatic and consular agents and commercial attaches must be permitted to share in the sessions of the Executive Council. The present Italian Consul for Chicago, Count Bolognesi, has been present at our meetings many times by request, and his views were heard with the dutiful deference owed to one whom we esteem as one of the Honorary Presidents of this organization and for the authority which he represents. But between an invitation which we tender freely, and an obligation imposed by governmental decree runs a vast difference. Our relations with the present Consul are very pleasant and in case of a change in personnel, relations might not be so pleasant with a new incumbent.</p>
   <p>Article 8 requests that the Secretary of the Chamber be acceptable to the Minister of Commerce and that he be an Italian citizen, conditions which we cannot consider favorably, and which would be difficult to carry out.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But without going further into the decree or the articles which to us seem unsatisfactory, the fact on which this Chamber bases its opposition, is the principle of a double jurisdiction proposed by the Paris Chamber of Commerce in the report previously mentioned. This principle is absolutely inadmissible as applied to the Chambers of Commerce in America.</p>
   <p>It would mean that Italians in foreign countries, in which they reside would also be subject to Italian Legislation.</p>
   <p>As we have previously stated the majority of our members have acquired naturalization papers. In stating this fact, we do not feel compelled to make excuses or give reasons for it. Anyone who has not lived in this country might find it difficult to understand them and besides these reasons have been thoroughly explained in two letters, one written by the New York Italian Chamber of Commerce to the Minister of Commerce, and the other written by Chicago Chamber to Geneva.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>If American citizenship gives the foreigner certain advantages, it also entails definite responsibilities, which he cannot ignore. The first of these is to renounce allegiance to foreign potentates. To fail in that promise would be to fail in maintaining the franchise of the vote, so generously given by our adopted country. The Chicago Chamber is an organization operating under the laws of Illinois, and to preserve complete autonomy and independence it must continue to do so. For us to be neglectful of our duty to this country by operating under the laws of Italy, as well as the laws of Illinois, would harm the position of this Chamber and of the many Italian communities throughout America.</p>
   <p>One of the results of the rebellion of the American mind against the insidious German propaganda that filtered into this country, was to make it overwhelmingly jealous of the freedom of this nation from foreign interference of any kind.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>To that sentiment can be attributed the severe laws that have been proposed by many and which in some states have already been adopted. Restrictions on immigration, newspaper printed in foreign languages, teaching of foreign languages in the schools and their use in public assemblies are some of the rigid and unjust measures advocated which we, not collectively, but as individual American citizens propose to fight. Under these circumstances it is easy to understand what impression would be formed of an organization which operated according to laws issued by a foreign government, and the antipathy which would be inspired not only against the members of such an organization, but also those of the same race.</p>
   <p>We wish to say, however, that in changing our nationality we have not discarded that affection which we proudly feel for Italy. We can point with pride to the accomplishments of this Chamber, not only in the field of commerce, but also in promoting the sale of Italian bonds in this country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Our Chamber joined the American Red Cross as a patron member because of the good that that organization has done for Italy, and a Red Cross Committee composed of members chosen from the Executive Council has solicited considerable sums from members of this Chamber and Italians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A number of our members have fought the insidious Jugo-Slavian propaganda against Italian rights on Fiume in the columns of American newspapers, and we for the same reason with funds solicited among our members, have published pamphlets, convoked meetings, formed committees and entertained missions from Italy. We have promoted a petition among all the Italian societies in America and with its one hundred and sixty thousand (160,000) signatures, have had it presented to President Wilson by two delegates, members of this Chamber. It protested against the absurd claims of Jugo-Slavia on the Adriatic. In a word, although a majority of the members have become naturalized, true Italianism, ever trying to be useful to Italy and to render more cordial the relations between these two countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>However, it is certain, that without the financial support of the Italian Government the existence of the Italian Chambers of Commerce in America would be doubtful and precarious.</p>
   <p>That problem, however, is easily solved. It is only necessary for the Italian Government, realizing the exceptional position of the Chambers of Commerce in America, to give official recognition and, at the same time, allow them to operate under the laws of the state in which they are incorporated. As long as the Italian Government gives this subsidy it has a right to an accounting and we are ready to give it whenever it is requested. An accounting of the income and expenses appears in every issue of our Bulletin, and in the yearly reports of our President and of the various commissions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Thus the Italian Government can judge from year to year whether the subsidy is wisely spent.</p>
   <p>This is the program which we intend to develop and for which we beg the favorable consideration and support of the sister Chambers of Commerce.</p>
