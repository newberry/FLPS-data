   <p>Yesterday's hearing of the trial of twelve of our co-nationals, accused of Black-hand activities, took an unexpected turn. Judge Mack, because of lack of evidence against five of the defendants, was forced to declare them not guilty. The five who were released are: The Zaniello brothers, Rubino brothers, and Michele La Penna. The jury will be called to decide the fate of Frank Russo, Vito Petruzzo and the others.</p>
