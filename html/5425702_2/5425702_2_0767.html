   <p>Attorney Mario Lauro, always ready to refute the lies which the English language press and especially the Chicago Tribune publish to defame Italy, has sent to the Tribune a letter of protest for the news published July 27 regarding the rebellion of Crown Prince Umberto against his father, King Victor Emanuel III.</p>
   <p>We approve of Mr. Lauro's action, and we hope that the press will put a stop to this unremitting campaign of slanderous falsehoods against Italy.</p>
