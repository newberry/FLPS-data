   <p>The delegation of the Italian Red Cross has completed its report of the funds collected and spent from the beginning of the Red Cross Drive to the 29th of February.</p>
   <p>The delegation takes this opportunity to express its thanks to all who cooperated in assuring the success of the drive.</p>
   <p>The report follows:</p>
   <p>When the Italian Government declared war on Austria in May, an enthusiastic cry arose in Italy, whose echo was heard in the distant colonies. The colony here in Chicago did not want to be second to anyone, so it accepted the invitation of the Italian Consul, Count Bolognesi; and the two delegates of the Red Cross, Dr. Colini, and Dr. Lagoria, appointed a committee which immediately began its work, and succeeded in collecting the sum of $21,384.93.</p>
   <p>Collection during the first meeting of the committee, May 27, 1915 $1798.50</p>
   <p>Italian Red Cross Expedition to Rome 1659.00</p>
