   <p>With this tournament the Order of Sons of Italy, through its Youth Organization, initiates a program of athletic activities with the end in view of extending necessary and required aid to all worthy Italian and American youths in the Midwest area."</p>
   <p>If the youth of today are the citizens of tomorrow, as our grand venerable has repeatedly asserted, no worthier movement could have been thought of by our Order than that to give the youths of Italian descent an opportunity to make themselves known in a field that is so much cultivated in this country. Through this medium, the Order fondly hopes to awaken in our boys and girls the consciousness that opportunities in life do not materialize by simply wishing for them but that they are due, principally, to well organized and well directed efforts. This principle applies to the athletic field, just as <span class="page-break">3</span>well as to the social, commercial, professional and political fields and success in any one of these manifestations spells "Organization."</p>
