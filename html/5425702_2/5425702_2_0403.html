   <p>"The people of the United States are preparing to solemnize in 1932 the two hundredth anniversary of the American Revolution and George Washington, and, acting upon a resolution which was voted upon and approved by the American Senate, a committee has been formed for the purpose of planning the celebration. One feature of this celebration will be the contributions of foreigners and foreign peoples to the celebration of the American Revolution.</p>
   <p>"Undoubtedly you can see the importance of the celebration of 1932 and what an opportunity is given us to unite the names of Italians with those who were most active in this country's fight for freedom.</p>
   <p>"I bid you, therefore, to join me with every means at your disposal in bringing to light the names of the simple pioneers of civilization in America that <span class="page-break">2</span>they may be recorded and worthily illustrated and glorified together with those of Italian explorers, missionaries, and fighters for American freedom.</p>
   <p>"I am confident that you will give this matter the time which is required for an undertaing of this sort. Forward all data to me promptly."</p>
   <p>We send this appeal to our members and friends: their cooperation, even though modest, will be highly appreciated.</p>
