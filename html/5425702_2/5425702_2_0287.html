   <p>At the meeting of the Executive Council on March 12, 1920, the vice-president, Canini, presented the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted and will be transmitted to the Representatives and Senators of the Western and Southwestern states.</p>
   <p>"We cordially recommend to all Italian naturalized citizens of the United States to exert similar pressure on the representatives in Congress.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>March 15, 1920</p>
   <p>Sir:</p>
   <p>Whereas, one-hundred and seventy-three of the one hundred and seventy-five members of the Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce are residents of the United Statesm and citizens thereof, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, they are deeply concerned with the welfare of this country, with which their own interests and future are indissolubly connected, and</p>
   
   <p>Whereas, certain bills have recently been introduced in the Congress of the United States to suspend immigration, or to restrict it on a percentage basis, or to subject immigrant aliens, and aliens visiting this country to irksome, unnecessary and vexatious regulations, notably the bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Dillingham (S2788); and the bills introduced in the House by Rep. Lufkin (H. R. 611) and by Rep. Albert Johnson (H. R. 563 and H. R. 8572), and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the bills aforesaid are based upon theories which this association holds to be socially and economically unsound, and contrary to the spirit of the free institutions under which the United States of America has attained its present greatness and power, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the bills aforesaid to restrict immigration on a percentage basis, are openly and designedly intended to encourage immigration from Germany, and other countries, and to decrease it from certain other countries, chiefly from Italy, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the operation of such bills, if enacted into law, would be not only to exclude from the United States an element which, through proper educational methods, could easily become a most valuable part of this nation, but also to extend the privilege of American citizenship to thousands of men who have borne arms against the United States, while denying it to thousands of others who have fought and bled under a flag associated with the flag of the United States in the great struggle for liberty, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the first paragraph of Section III of the Act of February 5, 1917, contains ample provisions for the exclusion of undesirables from the United States, therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we respectfully ask our representatives in Congress to oppose, and to vote against the bills aforesaid, and any other bill of like intent and purport which may now be before Congress, or which may be introduced in the future, and</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we endorse the law proposed to the Senate by Senator Kenyon, October 22, 1919, (S3315) appropriating $6,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921, to cooperate with the several states in the education of illiterates, or other persons unable to understand, read, or write the English language, and respectfully ask our representatives in Congress to support this bill and to vote for it.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce,</p>
   <p>F. Bragno, President.</p>
