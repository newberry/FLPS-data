   <p>We are sure everyone has heard of the appeal made to the Italians living in foreign countries for the raising of funds to help Italy in paying the war debts.</p>
   <p>The appeal was well received by our brothers of Italy, who, although burdened by many taxes, have already given their contributions. The Italians living in America who have not suffered the privations and inconveniences caused by the war, but instead were working and prospering, must, once again, answer to this appeal for the financial reconstruction of our Italy.</p>
   <p>The Italian war debt is a huge sum for a nation which is lacking in natural resources and spent all it had in the name of justice and democracy without gain.</p>
   <p>Everyone should understand the seriousness of this appeal; the modest workingman, the humble and patriotic laborer, all the sons of Italy living over seas who never have forgotten the mother country and who always have been generous and patriotic in helping her on all occasions, will accomplish <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their duty in responding generously to this appeal. It is not necessary to give a large amount at once. Everyone can give according to his income.</p>
   <p>The supreme officers, in appealing to you brothers of this organization, beg you to give your offering through your respective lodges. Answer this appeal! Give what you can and do not hesitate in helping your mother country. Her honor is our honor.</p>
