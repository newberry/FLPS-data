   <p>Day after day, week after week, more and more crimes are being committed, the perpetrators of which are invariably Italians. Today, not many crimes are committed to avenge the honor of wives, sisters or children as in the past; most of them are for money. Almost every crime committed involves the name of the "Black Hand," which is demanding money from innocent people who work for a living, and if this shady organization does not get it, it either bombs their homes or kills them.</p>
   <p>Naturally, these frequent crimes give a bad impression of the Italian colony to other nationalities, who are all trying to contribute their best towards the bettering of their social standing. Italians! We must do something to prevent these crimes. We must cooperate with the police by giving them in full all details of the crime when it occurs. We must form more societies, on the order of the "White Hands" society, whose chief purpose is to help better the social standing of Italians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The police are as much to blame as the criminals, because, when a murder is committed, after some questioning, there is hardly ever any effective trials, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and the Federal forces are few.</p>
   <p>Thirty-four have been assassinated in the past two years, and not one of these murders has been solved by the police. This lack of capacity shown by the police, gives criminals the courage to strike again. The police must cooperate with us to clear up this situation.</p>
   <p>We will give you a few illustrations of crimes committed in the past week: Mr. Antonio Bardiano, 1155 Wabansia Ave., a few days ago came to Chicago from Arkansas, where he had accumulated a large amount of money. While walking in the vicinity of Bloomingdale Rd. and Wood St., he was stopped by an automobile with three men inside, who after robbing him of all his money, shot him, leaving him in a critical condition. Luckily, he lived long enough to give the police a description of the men who shot him. He named J. Cornello, A. Del Cononico, M. Zicca, and, as is usual, the police have not been able to find the three men.</p>
   <p>Not ten hours after the death of A. Bardiano, another Italian was found dead on Yates Ave. between 90th and 91st Sts. This victim was found <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>strangled by a rope, as well as stabbed. The rope was tied so tight it cut into his neck.</p>
   <p>Another victim, D. Cocci, 45 years old, residing in S. Chicago, who works nights at the Federal Furnace Co. was also shot and robbed. The police arrested N. Fugina as a suspect but released him later for lack of evidence.</p>
   <p>ANOTHER VICTIM OF THE "BLACK HAND."</p>
   <p>The home of Mr. F. Balzano, 459 N. Carpenter St. was shattered by a bomb which took the life of one of his beloved children. The "Black Hand" gang went to the extreme of even threatening Judge Landis of the United States Court. The judge suspected G. G. Alongi, an ex-convict, for sending this threatening letter. Early next morning his office was bombed resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. Another - W. P. Dannenberg, Special Federal Investigator, was also threatened by the "Black Hand."</p>
   <p>The Secret Service men have been called in to help solve this, the most disgraceful situation that the Italians of Chicago have ever been in.</p>
