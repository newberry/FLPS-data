   <p>p. 2 -.....The Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, has sent us a circular letter in which it warns the numerous Italians who are apt to become victims of an army of confidence-game men. Their game consists of selling shares of mining companies, real estate, and a thousand other fraudulent enterprises.</p>
   <p>Italians should therefore never buy shares or real estate unless they have obtained information before-hand from a reliable lawyer or have written for advice and information to the Italian Chamber of Commerce, 1613 Masonic Temple, Chicago, Illinois. There is no charge for this service.</p>
