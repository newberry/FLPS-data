   <p>On September 26, the Italian Chamber of Commerce held its monthly luncheon at the Montence Restaurant. At the end of the luncheon, President Bragno, opened the meeting with a discussion of the proposed law for the suppression of the wine industry which will affect Italy and California. He stated that California has a capital of 150 million dollars invested in the wine industry, the biggest part being held by Italians who enjoy a good reputation for enterprise and honesty.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, he appealed to the Italian merchants in Chicago to draw up a protest to be sent to the Government in Washington making an exception to wine in the proposed prohibition law on the grounds that it is not an alcoholic beverage and is not detrimental to one's health.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Scales then spoke on the same subject, opposing the law which will strike at the individual liberty of citizens. Other speakers were Messrs. A. Russo, Pecci de Nictolis, V. Muggio, and J. Canini, all of whom were enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>A commission of the following individuals was formed - Messrs. F. Cuneo, Cuneo Bros., A. Russo, F. Bragno, F. Lavezzoni, E. Martini and L. Caravetta.</p>
   <p>This commission was appointed for the purpose of presenting effectively the protest of Chicago Italians to Washington.</p>
