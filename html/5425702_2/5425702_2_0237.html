   <p>Something seems to have provoked the Italians of the Jackson Park District to obtain their citizenship papers. This is indeed very fine because it is generally easier to find a job when one is a citizen. The number of citizenship papers received among the Italians is great. We urge all the Italians who wish to make their homes and raise their families in the United States to become citizens of this country as soon as possible, and the sooner the better.</p>
