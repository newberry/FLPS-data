   <p>The Italian Colonial Committee for the Toscana and Emilia provinces hit by the earthquake has been divided into smaller committees. Among these is the Clerical Committee of which the president is Rev. Dr. Ciufoletti. He is also vice-president of the Colonial Committee. The priests of Chicago have promised their valuable cooperation for the Italian areas in distress.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, September 26, special collections were made at the following churches: Church of St. Maria Addolorata on Grand avenue, 2,390 lire; Church of Angelo Custode at Forquer street, 2,500 lire; and the Church of St. Michele Archangelo, 24th place, 1,075 lire. These collections also comprise the personal offerings of priests of the churches mentioned. The total, amounting to 5,965 lire was sent to the Rev. Grand Officer, P. Chenuil, General Superior of the Missionaries for Italian Immigrants.</p>
   <p>The desire of the clergy and of the people is that money collected be sent directly to the Archbishop of Pisa because the largest number of towns were damaged in his diocese. The committee fully approved stating that societies, or a single person, has the right to suggest where, to whom, and for what purpose their offerings will be used. One need only specify when one sends in offerings to the Central Committee of the Colony.</p>
