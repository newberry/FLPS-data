   <p>At their last meeting, the Legione Garibaldi dismissed their president and secretary, because of disorderly conduct, and nominated the following temporary officers: Mr. D. Bacci, president; C. Zangrando, secretary.</p>
   <p>This Society does not allow any of the officers or members to disgrace the society, nor to be jealous of one another. Anyone guilty of such offenses will be dismissed from the Society. What Mr. Luigi Boarini said in the Chicago Tribune about the people of Southern Italy was very strange and untrue. This we hope will be a lesson to the rest of the Colony not to say unkind and untrue things about your compatriots.</p>
