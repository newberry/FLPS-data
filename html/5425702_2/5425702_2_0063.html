   <p>The notorious Gloriana gang received a staggering blow, in Judge Pam's court, when seven of its members each received a sentence of twenty years in the penitentiary. Those sentenced are: Carlo Gloriana, leader of the gang; Francesco Giardinella; Michael O'Malley; Vittorio Rizzo; Carlo Petella; Giuseppe Calli; and Carlo Moretti.</p>
   <p>The lawyers, Mr. Rocco De Stefano and Mr. Charles Williams, have moved to appeal, but Judge Pam doubts whether the decision can be changed.</p>
