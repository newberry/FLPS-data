   <p>The Italian Agriculture Bank located at 913 Blue Island, has made this Easter a very unhappy one for the unfortunate ones who entrusted their savings to it. Francesco Alberti Gugliemi, administrator and owner of the bank, has been missing since the 31st of March; however, the empty vault was not discovered until last Saturday, April 6th.</p>
   <p>When the bad news spread, a crowd of defrauded Italians gathered menacingly in front of the bank, but upon their arrival found an empty bank with only a squad of detectives, and a few mounted police stationed before the bank to prevent any violent actions. It was inferred that Gugliemi had escaped with no less than ten thousand dollars. Even though he started the banking business only a short while ago, he was able and successful in gaining the confidence and trust of the Italians, who without hesitation placed their savings in his hands.</p>
   <p>Gugliemi left Chicago quietly in the afternoon of the 31st of March evidently to have enough time to escape before the embezzlement was discovered. He told Giovanni Oliviere, his employee, that he was compelled to leave the city for a few days, and ordered his to attend carefully to the business during his absence. With the discovery of the empty vault, an interesting incident of Gugliemi was also discovered. In the afternoon of the 31st of March in the Grand Central Station a man was observed to walk excitedly toward the waiting room, and after suddenly <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>searching through his pockets, ran into J. P. Crowly's saloon on Fifth Ave. and Harrison. From the descriptions of the individual, it was quite certain to be Gugliemi. He had already been in the saloon for a few drinks, and perhaps in the exitement of what he was about to do, forgot his portfolio. Missing it at the station, he suspected that he had left it at the saloon, and hurried over with a police agent, then after peering through the door, he ran for the station. From thence all traces of him were lost.</p>
   <p>Many believe that he is aboard ship bound for Italy, while others believe that he is seeking refuge in Canada. Judge Lairdes has appointed the Central Trust Company as receivers.</p>
   <p>Only sixty-five cents were found in the vault.</p>
