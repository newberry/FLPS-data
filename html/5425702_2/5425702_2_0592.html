   <p>The religious festival of Melrose Park this year, had a shameful result. Everyone knows under what coercion the Society was estabilished in this town, and the annual festival always has created disputes and ill feeling.</p>
   <p>The religious fanaticism, the ignorance and the superstition created by the church, which the Italians have demonstrated is a disgrace to our name. The sponsors, priest, and racketeers, have always promoted festivals with which the real religious spirit has nothing to do. It is more than a disgrace for the Italians, especially if we consider that our colony has not a charitable society for the welfare of the needy of our race. This year the festival has created, as usual, litigation between the priest, the congregation, and the society. When are we going to put a stop to this outrageous system?</p>
