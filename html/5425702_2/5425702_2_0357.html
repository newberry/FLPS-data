   <p>In reading articles and correspondence which are published from time to time in certain Italian language newspapers, we note a tendency to keep alive that spirit of provincialism, which in the past has divided and scattered our community.</p>
   <p>In Italy, where everybody from the Alps to Ethiopia and from the Sardinia to Fiume is bound by loyalty to the Duce, such foolish distinctions do not exist. In Chicago and other Italian communities of America, the effort has been made, for many years, by the more intelligent element to abolish such provincial distinctions. This attitude, really, is losing ground yet once in a while it is nourished by newspaper articles containing regional distinctions, which are doing much harm to the unity of our colonies.</p>
   <p>The Italo-American National Union, since its inception, has adhered to a policy which looked with disfavor upon that attitude among its members (coming from all regions of Italy), and Italians in general. Twelve years ago we changed the name of our association to Italo-American National Union, thus abolishing the old name of Unione Siciliana under which it was organized, because at that time (1895) it was composed exclusively of Sicilians. We consider that a real Italian patriotic act, the object being the aim of closer unity among those of our race into one homogeneous group, which would be a credit to ourselves, to America, and to Italy.</p>
   <p>Forget about such provincial tendencies which, today, are against any conception of harmonious civic life. Be united and abolish that false rhetoric. We are no longer Tuscans, Lombardos, Sicilians, Emilians, Abruzians, Sardinians, Calabrians, etc. We must remember that 10,000,000 Italians scattered throughout the world, and 45,000,000 Italians in Italy are proud of their Italian origin and ready to act as one man for the prestige of the Motherland and the Italian name in foreign countries.</p>
