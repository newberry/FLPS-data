   <p>Italians! On August 23 the largest motor-ship in the world, the Vulcania, of the Italian line, will sail from New York to Italy with the Italian-American pilgrimage, organized under the auspices of the Order of the Sons of Italy in America.</p>
   <p>The reduction in the cost of the trip for the tourist will be considerable, and the Italian Government has facilitated in many ways the success of this pilgrimage and is preparing a hearty welcome and generous assistance in every city, included in the itinerary, from lavish Sicily to Trieste, queen of the sea.</p>
   <p>Besides this we have been notified that the Italian Government, for this pilgrimage only, has ruled to allow complete freedom and permission to go back to Italy to those who for any reason are not in good legal standing with the military conscription authorities. Thus no one will be molested.</p>
   <p>Those who sail on this pilgrimage will be furnished with identification cards signed by Giovanni di Silvestro, supreme venerable of the Order of the Sons of Italy and leader of the pilgrimage.</p>
