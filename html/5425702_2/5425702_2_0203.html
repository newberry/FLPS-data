   <p>In occasion of the birthday of H. M. Victor Emanuel II, King of Italy, which fell on November 11, a group of prominent Italians paid a visit to the Italian Consul Cav. Guido Sabetta. Among the visitors were Dr. Cav. Volini; Dr. P. Cutrera; Messrs. Malato and Gualano, lawyers, Prof. Mastrogiovanni; Mr. Russo; A. Mirabella; V. Farmusa and others who proposed to the Consul the idea of organizing a powerful society, in our colony to insure protection against the cowardly aggressions, committeed by some outcasts of our colony whom the Yellow Press of Chicago call the "Black Hand."</p>
   <p>The said gentlemen stated that they are ready to organize themselves that kind of society which they will call the "White Hand." The Royal Consul expressed his enthusiasm for the idea and promised his personal assistance as well as that of his office.</p>
   <p>We, from the Tribuna, enthusiastically give our full approval for the organization of such a society as the "White Hand" and we place at its disposal the columns of the Tribuna Italiana.</p>
