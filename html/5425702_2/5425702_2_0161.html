   <p>The contractor Nicolo Mancini, a member of the Evangelical Church at 248 Taylor street, is making a specialty of defrauding poor laborers.</p>
   <p>Toward the end of last month this fraud was practiced on one Santeo Aristodemo, who is a member of the union and has usually worked for $3.50 per day. Mr. Mancini, however, had the effrontery to pay him a total of $5.60 for four days' hard work.</p>
   <p>Santeo's protests to the union delegate have produced no result. Meanwhile this disciple of Christ, who reads and studies the Bible, continues his exploitation, acquiring the ownership of buildings with other people's money.</p>
