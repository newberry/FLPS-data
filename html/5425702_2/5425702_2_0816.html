   <p>Last March 16, at 9 a. m., about one hundred members met in the office of the Italian Chamber of Commerce to inaugurate the direct cable between America and Italy.</p>
   <p>The great event, which was the realization of the Italian colonies, deserves to be remembered in the history of our colony. Many expressions of gratitude and joy were addressed to our beloved King and to His Excellency Mussolini, who conceived and accomplished a deed which was never even considered by past governments.</p>
   <p>The accomplished undertaking which is celebrated today makes us feel nearer and more attached to our motherland, Italy.</p>
