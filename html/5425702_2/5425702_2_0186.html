   <p>December 29, 1894. The absence of Judge Everett, who has gone to spend the holidays with his family, has caused the postponement of the De Bartolo trial to some time in the near future.</p>
   <p>The rumor current in the Colony, that De Bartolo has been declared not guilty, is untrue. The change of venue, as we stated in a previous article, was made at the request of Wickersham, a lawyer, representing Mr. Durante, who charged that Judge Bradwell, before whom the case had previously been heard, favored too much the lawyer for the defense. Transferring the case to Judge Everett's court, a new order was issued for the arrest of De Bartolo.</p>
   <p>The trial will definitely get underway in ten days and we will keep our readers informed of its progress.</p>
