   <p>Our gallant soldiers in Tripoli are adding victory to victory. The flag of our country is feared as it proudly waves, commanding, every day, the respect of Arab and Turk. Unfortunately, this national glory also must bewail the heroes who generously sacrificed their lives on the altar of their country where every step forward for civilization has had its martyrs.</p>
   <p>Let us place, therefore, the flower of remembrance on the tombs of those who have gloriously fallen for our dear fatherland; let us carve their names on our hearts, and on our minds, that we may in the future, recite them to our children, but let us not forget their families who weep and are suffering.</p>
   <p>The Italia, interpreting the sentiment of all Italians residing in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, makes an appeal to their kindness of <span class="page-break">2</span>heart, sure that the appeal will be answered with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>All subscriptions can be addressed to Dr. C. Volini, 921 S. Halsted St., or Dr. A. Lagorio, 812 Dearborn St., both of whom are representatives of the Italian Red Cross, or to Dr. A. Pagano, who is secretary of the local committee for that organization, at 831 W. Polk St.</p>
