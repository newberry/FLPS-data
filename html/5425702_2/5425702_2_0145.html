   <p>A number of workers from this ward recently applied to James Acques &amp; Company for employment.</p>
   <p>Hired at a salary of seventeen cents an hour, each paid the agency a two dollar fee.</p>
   <p>When the men reported for work the foreman chased them away calling them dagoes and other names.</p>
   <p>They returned to the employment agency, which refused to refund the two dollar fee. They were threatened with a revolver.</p>
   <p>Workers, be on your guard! Do not allow yourselves to be robbed by unscrupulous agents of that which you have earned by the sweat of your brow.</p>
