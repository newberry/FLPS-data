   <p>The American flag was dedicated to the Italian Society, Di Mutuo Soccorso Trinacria Fratelanza Siciliana, by the Marquia Ungaro, Italian representative at the World's Fair, yesterday afternoon at Uhlich's Hall, North Clark Street. The hall was decorated profusely with the red, white, and green, the Italian colors, which mingled with the Stars and Stripes.</p>
   <p>The Trinacria is a benevolent society, and was organized April 25th, 1893, the charter members numbering twenty. The membership has increased to two hundred and fifty. One of the principal objects of its formation was to inspire a higher esteem for and allegiance for the American flag and American institutions on the part of the sons of Sicily in this city.</p>
   <p>Speeches were made in Italian by Count di Manassero, Italian Consul to the United <span class="page-break">\2</span>States, Sig. Russo, and President Vincent Formusa. Charles Triolo, who presented the flag to Marquis Ungara for dedication spoke in English, and among other things said: "A project now in contemplation of this society deserves a few words on this occasion. It has been proposed that steps be taken towards the erection of a public school in which Italian children can be trained in the English language, preparatory to entering our regular public schools. I hope this proposition will finally be acted upon, and such schools be erected.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Trinacria are: President, Vincent Formuso; Vice-president, J. Zucchero; Treasurer, Andrew Russa; Recording Secretary, C. Grmger; Financial Secretary, J. La Mantia; and Marshal, P. La Rocco.</p>
   <p>In the evening a banquet was served at Uhlich's Hall, at which a number of speeches were made.</p>
