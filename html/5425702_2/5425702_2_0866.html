   <p>The night before last, at the Verdi's Restaurant, 610 S. State Street, donations were accepted for Italian babies of families that cannot afford to buy milk. The amount collected was $28.07</p>
   <p>The money was given to L'Italia's editor, Mr. Nick Lo Frank, who will send it to Italy.</p>
   <p>The contributors, who want to be unknown, deserve our admiration for their kindness.</p>
