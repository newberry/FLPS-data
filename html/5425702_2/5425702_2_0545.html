   <p>Our field is in what is known as the lower North Side of our city, an area of about a mile and one-half long and three-quarters of a mile wide. Bounded by the Chicago River on the South, North Avenue on the North, Clark Street on the East, and the Chicago River on the West, this territory houses over 20,000 Italian speaking people, a colony made up from as many elements as there are provinces in Italy. Also differing in knowledge, habits and character very materially.</p>
   <p>As a rule the people are law abiding, industrious and frugal, but a small but vicious element casts a shadow of bad repute on the entire colony. As unjust as that might seem, it is a fact nevertheless.</p>

   <p>The spiritual condition of these people is as deplorable as any South American or Southern Italian city.</p>
   <p>If it is not atheistic materialism, it is fetish materialism of a pagan origin. Image worship and spiritism holds sway over the majority of them. In fact, ten yearly processions in honor of some saint or Madonna take place during the summer. These cost thousands of dollars, money the poor people can ill afford to lose. Needless to say, such feasts, as they are called, are nothing more than sensual orgies with music and fireworks, which often end with another procession to the cemetery and occasionally a march to the jail.</p>
   <p>A Brighter Picture</p>
   <p>It is in the midst of death that God has been pleased to manifest the life of His dear Son, and cause His light to shine in this dark place. "But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."</p>

   <p>Twelve years of Gospel preaching has made a great change in the people. God has honored His Word in the conversion of over four hundred souls. Apart from that, the people behave much better than before this Gospel work began. The dramas of brutal murders in real life are enacted as yet, but with a longer intermission between. The former prejudice and bitter persecution against the Gospel is not evident any longer, and the majority of the people look upon the Mission as a benefactor and a power for good.</p>
   <p>Our Arena - The Open Air</p>
   <p>A few converters in brother Procopio's home began the present work by giving their testimony in the open air. Gradually the open street became our arena where the good fight of faith was waged. Today the pulpit that draws the largest audience is the rough curb-stone. There the spirit of God has time and again convicted men of sin. It is a known fact that the Parish Priest <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>has at times led mobs of violent persecutors to break up such services, but last summer the tables were turned. While a meeting was being conducted in the heart of the colony, a large crown was reverently and attentively listening to the various speakers. A solemn hush seemed to be upon the crowd when, unexpectedly, there appeared the Priest of the Parish Church who interrupted the meeting by saying to the people, "It is wrong for you to listen to such preaching". To our amazement the unusual took place. God moved upon the people not to fear their false leader, but rather to disregard his conduct against us. Instead of dispersing the crowd as he had intended, on the contrary, their interest grew stronger as they gathered up closer to hear more of God's word and of the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be His Name for the victory of faith. Thirty-one open meetings were held last summer, and approximately ten thousand people heard the Gospel message. One hundred and fifty came to the workers for spiritual advice and fourteen professed conversion.</p>
   <p>Meeting the People Where They Are</p>
   <p>The house to house visitation affords us an opportunity to meet and deal with <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the people where they are more apt to open their hearts to us. Last year one-thousand one hundred and thirty-four homes were visited with scripture reading and prayer as the main features of the call.</p>
   <p>The following is a typical visit as reported by Mrs. Rocca:</p>
   <p>Upon visiting a home just a few days ago, I offered a woman some Christian literature. With piercing black, shining eyes and countenance which was all but a pleasant one, she said: "No, I shall never accept literature of such kind. I have holy books of my own to read, and furthermore I must observe the religion which my father taught me to observe." After having spoken for a moment, I told her that we are not responsible to God for the observance of any particular religion, but rather we must be saved by faith, through the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord. She was touched. Her countenance changed and immediately she invited me into her home. Soon I was brought before an image under which a light was burning. Many pictures of different saints hung on the walls, but she seemed more interested in the former one. "See how devout I am", she said.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>After such a statement I read to her Psalm 115, after which, in brief, the way of salvation was explained to her. By this time she became calm and serious. The eyes, that at the beginning looked piercing, now had a kindly, sweet expression. Just before leaving she said: "Signorina, do you know that according to my religion I have committed a sin for speaking or allowing you to speak on these things? I must therefore confess it all to the Priest, because we are not even allowed to speak to Protestants. But it has been through courtesy that I have admitted you into my home and allowed you to speak to me of such things." More encouragingly she invited me to call on her again.</p>
   <p>Praise God for these open doors, where people are willing to admit us notwithstanding their false spiritual leaders.</p>
