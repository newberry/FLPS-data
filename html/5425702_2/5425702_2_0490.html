   <p>A meeting of combined American Welfare Workers and Italians of Chicago was held at the Auditorium Hotel last Sunday, to determine ways and means of assisting needy Italians, but more than anything else to break the hold of unscrupulous political and labor bosses on the Italian worker.</p>
   <p>Although more than 150 Italians had been notified of the meeting, there were few in attendance. Among those present were Oscar Durante, V. E. Maggi, F. De Rosa and the Italian Consul, Rozwadowski, who was made Honorary President.</p>
   <p>Some of the speakers were Jane Addams, Julia Lathrop and a Miss Henrotin, Mrs. Mary Wilmarth presided. It was decided to establish a bureau similar to the one existing in New York. The initiation was set at $3.00 and a temporary office will be opened at 335 S. Halsted st.</p>
