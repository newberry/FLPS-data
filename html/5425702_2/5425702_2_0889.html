   <p>Our colleague Allesandro Mastrovalerio, who is much noted for his patriotism and attachment to art, wrote a letter proposing that we encourage the presentation of D'Annunzio's tragedy "La Nave," to celebrate the victory of our navy, which wiped out the shame of the old defeat at Lissa and changed from bitter to sweet the waters of the Adriatic.</p>
   <p>It is very opportune for the valiant actors of our colony of whom are many, to take this suggestion into consideration. We promise to give our full support from now on.</p>
   <p>Besides celebrating the victory of our navy, it also would honor our great Italian poet.</p>
