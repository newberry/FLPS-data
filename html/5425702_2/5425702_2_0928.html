   <p>Previous authorization from the authorities at Washington, secured through the initiative of this newspaper last Tuesday, permitted the eight ambulances already built to leave for the Italian front.</p>
   <p>These ambulances were built through the generous donations of the Italians in Chicago, which proves but one Italian colony still has faith and love for their mother-country.</p>
   <p>These ambulances bear the following dedications:</p>
   <p>Giornale "L'Italia" donated by the Italian Colony of Chicago</p>
   <p>Eitta di Parma donated by the Italian Colony of Chicago</p>
   <p>Dr. Luigi Alfieri donated by the Italian Colony of Chicago</p>
   <p>Dr. Aurelio Pagano donated by the Italian Riciglianes Society</p>
   <p>Dr. G.B. Bruno donated by the Italian Colony of Chicago</p>
