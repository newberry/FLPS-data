   <p>The United Societies have initiated a subscription for the benefit of the victims of the recent earthquake in Toscana. The following appeal was sent to all the presidents of societies in the name of the directive council:</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of our organization on September 24, we resolved to promote a subscription for the benefit of the victims of the recent earthquake. The misfortune which fell upon our fatherland was terrible and we who are living away from the catastrophe can help those victims with small contributions.</p>
   <p>The society which you represent can contribute a sum taken out of your social fund, or can have a subscription for private contributions outside of your society. If it is possible to have the whole three ways, so much the better.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>This money will be sent directly to the authorities in Italy, in the name of your society or private contributions, and your name will also appear in your local Italian newspaper, which will be sent to the Italian Government.</p>
   <p>Hoping that you and your society will not fall behind the magnanimous example of other associations, and that the sufferings of our country awake the sentiments of all who are the most fortunate sons of glorious Italy, and that your contributions for this noble cause, will come prompt and generous to lessen the sufferings of those being in this horrible catastrophe.</p>
   <p>Assured of your patriotism and your contributions the United Italian Association give you and your society, in the name of our father country, many thanks.</p>
   <p>I remain,</p>
   <p>President B. Barasa.</p>
   <p>Secretary John Panegasar.</p>
