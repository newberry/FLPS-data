   <p>On Sunday, March 1st, the Circolo Anti-clerical Giordano Bruno held its public forum as announced to refute the notorious clerical campaign organized by several Dunnes and Renzullis, against those Italians who do not mumble litanies and do not allow themselves to be flayed.</p>
   <p>The forum was crowded, and reporters of the American press attended.</p>
   <p>Mr. Marchese was chairman. Mr. Pecori spoke for the club in English, and comrade Joseph Bertelli spoke in Italian.</p>
   <p>The speakers called attention to the quibbling of the Catholic clergymen who because of their sectarianism incite public opinion against honest citizens, accusing them of planning massacres,-only because one unbalanced individual, who never had seen Chicago, killed a priest in Denver, Colorado.</p>

   <p>The forum was most orderly. It made such an impression on the representatives of the American press that their attacks, instigated by local priests, ceased to appear from that very day.</p>
   <p>Four policemen, who were somewhat intoxicated, came to annoy the dancers. Have they nothing else to do?</p>
