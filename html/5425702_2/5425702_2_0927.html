   <p>The dance given by the "Vittorio Alfieri" Philodramtic Club last March 10th for the benefit of the Italian Red Cross, was a financial failure. Figures revealed that the sum of $5.00 was lost.</p>
   <p>In order not to make this a complete failure, the members agreed on taking 125 lire from the treasury to send to the Italian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The money was sent to Conte Sornaglia, through the Mid-City Trust &amp; Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>This statement was in a letter signed by the secretary of this club, Mr. G. Beneventi.</p>
