   <p>We wonder when the next exaggerated story of Italians in crime will fill the blazing headlines and first columns of the morning paper. Nothing has happened so far and we wonder whether the reporters and writers are busy preparing false statements for the next murder. Surely they must keep busy and as long as the public admires propaganda their weekly check is safe.</p>
   <p>Yes, it is the poor Italian colony that suffers for the sins of one or two. We fail to see the names of O'Donnell and Saltis in heavy type. Naturally why should an Irish or German, or even the Chinese colony, suffer such a disgrace. This is folly. So think the high-minded men at the head of such a smooth running business. It is very peculiar why they should pick on Italians and try to destroy their good name, the more so should what they say be true.</p>
   <p>In the morning issue of the Chicago Tribune, October 3, page three, we read of a gas explosion in a sewer which killed three workingmen. These <span class="page-break">2</span>men happened to be Italians from Sicily and since they had never been heard of before, probably being newcomers in this state and in Chicago, only three lines were given to the matter.</p>
   <p>Here we have men who died that others might enjoy sanitation. Their time had come, it may be, but it had come while serving the public and certainly a little more space in the great Tribune would have done no harm.</p>
   <p>Here would be a good article to fill the whole paper with heavy print, material which put in story form would move the readers to tears. Pshaw! they are "wops," "dagoes," Sicilians - sorry to have even mentioned their names!</p>
   <p>However should an Italian commit a misdemeanor then the typewriters would bang away hurriedly; men would tear their hair if such news would not be in the next issue. It is not what the public wants because that's all the paper gives them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The public has been accustomed to reading gruesome murders and daring abductions. Should it fail to see the word murder on the top line of many Chicago newspapers of English language, it would take no interest.</p>
   <p>We do not infer that these papers are not properly written, or composed, but that the mud-slinging is always towards the Italian, who in his best manner leads a straight honest life, minds his own affairs and never casts any reflection toward the other foreign elements.</p>
   <p>Live and let live. Give credit where credit is due. Give a reprimand where a reprimand must be given. Cease these voluminous exaggerations and falsehoods, these uncouth statements, and be not as tyrannical as a too beloved woman, lest the public awaken to find out that not all which is written is true.</p>
