   <p>The day of January 13 has been set aside as Italian Day at the Allied Bazaar, to be held at the Coliseum. We urge every Italian of our colony to attend this bazaar, so as to show his respect and patriotism for his mother-country, and proof of the solidarity toward the allied people.</p>
   <p>A beautiful necklace valued at $50,000, will be raffled, and the proceeds will be given to the Bazaar-fund. Tickets $2.50.</p>
   <p>The Italian section will raffle a painting donated by the King, and a 1917 Chevrolet. Tickets, 25Â¢.</p>
   <p>Those who cannot attend this Bazaar can send their contributions to the Consul, 72 W. Adams St.</p>
