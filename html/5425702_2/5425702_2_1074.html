   <p>Antonio Sivore came to Chicago from Genoa in 1854, when Franklin Pierce was president. He was married in this city to a girl of Genoese parentage. He took an important part in the early industrial development of Chicago, as is shown by the directories of the 60's and 70's. He had four sons and one daughter, of whom, George F. Sivore, the third child, was born here in 1891.</p>
   <p>George F. Sivore went into business during 1910, with no capital other than a clearly defined objective - rentals and property management. He adhered steadily to that pre-determined plan and has become eminently successful. Today he is recognized as an expert in his chosen profession. He consistently disregards all side-lines and devotes his attention exclusively to handling downtown properties for many of the largest owners of stores and office buildings. Mr. Sivore represents some of the largest estates in the city. Although modest and reticent in the extreme, he is justifiably proud of a clientele comprised of corporations and railroads for whom he serves as appraiser.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sivore's success epitomizes the principle of specialization - the practice of concentration upon one particular line of effort. Being possessed of a pleasing personality and endowed with lofty ideals, he readily inspires and retains the confidence of his associates.</p>
   
   <p>He has one son, George A. Sivore, Jr., who has been educated in American schools and universities, with a post-graduate course at Oxford.</p>
