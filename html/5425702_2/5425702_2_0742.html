   <p>It was with joy and pleasure we heard that our member of the Board of Directors, Official Chevalier Giovanni Rigali, has been recently decorated Commendatore of the Crown of Italy.</p>
   <p>We extend to him the expression of our happiness and the wishes that his apostolate as head of the Daprato Statuary Company, as a citizen and as an Italian, will be everyday more fervid, sincere, and effective.</p>
   <p>Another to be decorated with the Cross of the Chevalier of the Crown of Italy was Giovanni Picco, Consular Agent at Springfield, Illinois. To him we extend our congratulations and hope he will become a member of our organization.</p>
   <p>And while talking about decorations, we shall not forget Father Simone, major in the American Army division stationed at Fort Sheridan. His personality as priest and soldier is well known to all the Italians of Chicago who hear with pleasure that he has been decorated as Official Chevalier.</p>
