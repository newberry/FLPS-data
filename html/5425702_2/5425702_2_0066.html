   <p>If we continue at the present rate, the Italian Colony of Chicago will soon take the lead over that of New York, in the matter of bombings, murders, and blackmail.</p>
   <p>The Italians are themselves responsible for this situation, since, when they are questioned by the police they become as dumb as fish and answer with the usual shrug of the shoulders, so that, because of this deplorable indifference, the criminal element flourishes until its effect is felt from one end of the city to the other, much to the detriment of the better-class Italians.</p>
   <p>The last deed of the Black Hand is a bomb which was set off in an attempt to wreck the saloon of Bartolomeo Scarizzo, 1901 S. Clark St. The explosion which shook that locality, breaking innumerable windows, occurred Tuesday night, around one o'clock. Scarizzo, with his wife and four children, and the Amuruso and Di Grazia families living in the same building, were thrown into a panic by the explosion and even the arrival of the police, soon after, was not enough to completely reassure them.</p>
   <p>The agents of the law then questioned Scarizzo as to a possible motive for the deed, but he confessed complete ignorance of any enemies until his oldest son let the cat out of the bag, by stating that his father had received two threatening letters demanding $2,000. The police have made one arrest.</p>
