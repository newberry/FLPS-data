   <p>The sons of Italy, scattered in the large American continent, are answering very enthusiastically to the appeal of their fatherland, which is an appeal for their help against our country's enemies. A quantity of letters have arrived at the consul's offices, written by young men who are eager to enlist.</p>
   <p>After the first departure of the reservists who arrived in Chicago last Sunday evening, others followed rapidly.</p>
   <p>They departed on the 16th of June from Milwaukee, St. Louis and Cleveland, and embarked in New York on the "Dante Aleghieri" which sailed on the 19th of June. There were fifty from Milwaukee, fifty from St. Louis, and one-hundred from Cleveland.</p>
   <p>The next departure of reservists from Chicago will take place Monday evening the 21st of June from the Polk St. station. There will be one-hundred, and they will embark on the "Europe", which will sail from New York on the 23rd of June.</p>
   <p>Then on the 24th of June there will be another departure of two-hundred reservists, fifty of whom are from Duluth, Minnesota.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, it does us good to know that the Italian government will assist the families of the soldiers who answered the call to arms in a foreign land, in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>addition to assistance given these families from a fund collected by the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>To assure assistance to the families of these soldiers a fund has been established by the "Figh d' Italia" Society in New York.</p>
   <p>In fact, the Supreme Lodge of the Sons of Italy has decided to help each family with a weekly contribution.</p>
