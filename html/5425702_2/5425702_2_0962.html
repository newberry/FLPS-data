   <p>Mr. A. Burlini, who resides at 66 W. Grand Avenue, sends us the following letter:</p>
   <p>"Respectable Mr. Director: I take the liberty to explain an idea of mine, which is recommended to the delegates of the Italian Red Cross of Chicago. My proposition is to organize a group of voluntary militiamen, completely equipped and directed by an Italian doctor, and ship them to their fatherland so that they may place themselves at the disposal of the Italian government."</p>
   <p>"I think that the carrying out of such a plan, besides furnishing a wonderful opportunity to serve their country, would also display the patriotism of the Italians of Chicago."</p>
