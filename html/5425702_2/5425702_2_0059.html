   <p>In answer to the screams of his wife, police and neighbors rushed into the home of Gioacchino Gattuso, 911 Laramie Avenue, to find him with eleven knife wounds inflicted by persons who had broken into his home at that early hour with the purpose of murdering him in his sleep. On the ground, not far from Gattuso's bedroom window and easily traced by a path of blood in the snow, police found the footprint of a man who was identified as A. Puelo or Pilo, 26 years old, living at 510 N. Wells. A few steps away they found the blood-stained pick with which it is believed Gattuso was struck while asleep. Andrea Caffaro, brother-in-law of Gattuso, wounded in the shooting fray was arrested in his home at 5960 W. Chicago Avenue. The police are also searching for Giovanni Caffaro, brother of Andrea, and for Antonio Gasparo, a barber.</p>
   <p>Gioacchino Gattuso was the victim of a previous assault. Last January, in the neighborhood of Wells Street and Chicago Avenue, unknown assailants fired several shots but missed him. Since then he had changed his residence, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hoping in that manner to elude the enemies who had been threatening him and demanding money since he is a retired well-to-do fruit merchant.</p>
   <p>But early Saturday morning Poli and the other men sought by the police forced their way into his son's room, thinking it was his, and when their flashlight showed their error, they searched until they had him. Gattuso, although taken unawares had the presence of mind to snatch the revolver which he kept under his pillow and start firing at random while his assailants kept striking with knives. Poli, it seems, was fatally wounded but had enough strength to reach the window out of which he fell breaking his neck.</p>
   <p>These deeds which continue to be committed so barbarously can do no more than 'augment' the sympathies of the Americans for the Italians, and we hope that they will be committed with more frequency since it will save us the expense of paying the return fare to Italy, because the authorities will surely be moved to send back to Italy free of charge all of us Italians, the good as well as the bad.</p>

   <p>Those champions of the Italian colony who to condone these misdeeds parade before them the high percentage of criminality in America, know very well that it is not the crime alone but the ferocity with which these deeds are committed that alarms the Americans, as does also the wall of silence with which eye-witnesses surround themselves and which sentimentalists in crime find so exalting and beautiful.</p>
