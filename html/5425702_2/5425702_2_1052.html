   <p>Wednesday, members of the Board of Education discussed the Mr. S. C. Walleck's proposition to grant the citizens of differnet nationalities the advantage of obligatory teaching of their language in the Public Schools.</p>
   <p>After heated discussions the proposition was rejected with eleven votes against five.</p>
   <p>The Germans alone remain to enjoy the privilege, and $150,000 to $175,000 are being spent annually to teach their language. Do not despair in the meantime, for this question will arise again in the future with greater intensity and the five votes of today may become a majority tomorrow.</p>
   <p>We are going to try our best to encourage our compatriots to watch for this event.</p>
