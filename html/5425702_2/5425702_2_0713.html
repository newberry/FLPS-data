   <p>We note with gratification that many patriotic and social affairs have been organized recently by our Italian associations.</p>
   <p>One of these occurred on Sunday, February 7, at the Sherman Hotel. It was a farewell dinner-dance given by the Italo-American National Union in honor of Consul General Carosi, who is leaving Chicago.</p>
   <p>More than two thousand guests attended.</p>
   <p>A selected musical program was presented by Professor A. Degrazia and the Bellavia orchestra.</p>
   <p>In the intermission G. Carlino Meneghetti, an Italian schoolboy, recited an appropriate poem, which was received with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Philip D'Andrea, president of the Italo-American National Union, after speaking of the association's various activities introduced the Italian consul general, Mr. <span class="page-break">\2</span>Carosi, who delivered a very patriotic speech and paid a tribute of thanks to the Italians of Chicago, who by cooperating with him have made his stay in Chicago very enjoyable.</p>
