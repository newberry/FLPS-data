   <p>After overcoming many obstacles, a committee of our countrymen succeeded in combining into one brotherhood under the name of "The United Italian Societies", the above mentioned Italian organizations for the purpose of assisting and protecting the Italians of Chicago. A building will be erected to be used for meetings, dances, banquets and so forth.</p>
   <p>To prove their brotherhood and solidarity, the twelve associations will hold a reunion with their respective flags on May 28, at the Coliseum Annex at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>For the past twenty years in Chicago, societies with perhaps one hundred members either because of jealousy, or the ambition of some factotum, have given their dances or picnics individually. The result was that on the same day, there would be three or more picnics or dances by as many different Italian societies. Since these twelve associations have united, these inconveniences will not occur again.</p>
