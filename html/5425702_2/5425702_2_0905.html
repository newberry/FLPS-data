   <p>We have received any letters of congratulations and requests from all parts of the United States by both Italians and Americans for the pamphlet written by the Honorable Alceste de Ambris entitled Italy and Jugo-Slavia published in English by the Italian Chamber of Commerce. Fifty thousands copies were distributed, the cost being covered by funds collected from the members of the Chamber.</p>
   <p>Several newspapers have shown much interest in this dispute particularly the Detroit Daily Journal, who in no uncertain terms stated: "It would be ungrateful and niggardly to deny Italy, after all its sacrifices of blood and money, that which is its sacred and holy right in Dalmatia, Istria and Trieste."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This same newspaper, before receiveing the pamphlet, had published a strong article against Italy on the same question. Therefore it proves that it is necessary to have publications of that sort and to encourage new ones for the honor and greatness of Italy and the Italians.</p>
   <p>The Italian Consul, Count Bolognesi, deserves much credit for the great help he has given the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, in the publication and distribution of these pamphlets.</p>
   <p>Following is an account of the subscriptions for the "Defense of the Italian Rights and the Redeemed Territories" given by the Treasurer, Mr. V. Formusa.</p>
