   <p>The Societa Operaia di Mutuo Soccorso Trivigno Magherita di Savoia, at its last meeting on May 6, after having voted $40 for the Vesuvius victims and $20 for the victims of California, discussed another question that to us seems of great importance.</p>
   <p>The Society decided there will be no more parading when a member dies, but instead one fourth of the members will ride in carriages. This is brought to the attention of the public so that other societies may follow suit.</p>
   <p>This decision by the Margherita is a worthy one from every angle.</p>
