   <p>One of the outstanding events of the year, took place last week at the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>It was the festival given by the Italian Women's Benefit Society.</p>
   <p>Many prominent Italians of the colony attended.</p>
   <p>This society has developed into the outstanding society of our colony.</p>
   <p>One of the many good deeds this society has done is the generous donations they have been giving for the benefit of the poor Italians of our colony in the past.</p>
   <p>We wish to congratulate the members for the splendid co-operation they have given in making the event an outstanding success.</p>
