   <p>A scene which recalled a comedy by Goldoni, is that which took place among the Catholics of St. Calisto church, the epilogue of which was published by the Corriere d'America, which we transcribe.</p>
   <p>For the past eleven years the pastor of St. Calisto Church, at DeKalb St., has been Father William Murphy, an Irish priest educated in Rome, who was devotedly respected and admired by his parishioners for his sacerdotal virtue and his charitable acts.</p>
   <p>But lately his health has been failing and somebody insinuated that the priest was drinking excessively.</p>
   <p>A few weeks after Easter the pastor absented himself from the church for a few days, and among the Italians of that parish, the rumor began to circulate that the assistant priest of St. Calisto, Father Puleo, had given Father Murphy something in his coffee to kill him and thus have the opportunity of becoming pastor of the church.</p>
   <p>This terrible gossip was spread and intensified after Father Murphy stated, two Sundays ago, that he would leave the church to go in a sanatorium for his health and that Father Puleo would be the new pastor.</p>
   <p>Then a tumult took place and the leaders of the riot closed the church and refused to listen to Father Puleo, threatening to kill him if he showed himself again.</p>
   <p>The archdiocese of Chicago sent two other priests, but even they were maltreated by the mob in spite of the intervention of the police.</p>
   <p>On the following Saturday another Irish priest tried to re-open the church, but without success, and he came in as near as to being lynched by the mob.</p>
   
   <p>Then Father Murphy was recalled temporarily, to try to placate the irate people. He was received with flowers and applause, but as soon as he stated that he had come back only for a short time, the mob started a new riot and again the police were unable to check it. The mob closed the church again and a notice was nailed to the door saying: "Closed till Father Murphy will be back."</p>
