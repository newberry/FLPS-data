   <p>A great and memorable affirmation of Christian faith and Italianism took place during the official celebration for the opening and dedication of the new Presbyterian Church of St. John, located at Harrison Street and Hoyne Avenue, of which the Director and Pastor is our well esteemed Editor, Rev. R. P. DeCarlo, untiring apostle with faith and heart sincerely Christian, never forgetful of his sentiments of devotion for the land of his origin and for this generous, great and hospitable nation.</p>
   <p>Forty years of missionary work as a promoter of Christ's Church and supporter and propagator of sentiments of patriotism and as missionary and publisher, make him worthy of our indelible gratitude.</p>
   <p>The dedication of the new church constituted an event, which met with the sympathy <span class="page-break">\2</span>and approval of our countrymen. In fact the week, May 18 to 25, of the dedication, has been a pilgrimage and a long procession of admirers and visitors, besides a large number of congratulatory messages and congratulations from outstanding Italo-Americans of different social status.</p>
   <p>Everyone,who participated in our services and heard all the speeches delivered by notable personalities,was greatly enthusiastic and favorably impressed by the educational teaching, that we all receive.</p>
   <p>All the orators, introduced by the Rev. DeCarlo, one after the other, on the days listed in our program, had words of praise and encouragement for Dr. DeCarlo's efforts as a promoter of the Christian faith and as an Italian.</p>
   <p>Among so many testimonials of esteem, the most important was that made by Hon. Frank J. Loesch, great jurist and distinguished American citizen, appointed by <span class="page-break">\3</span>President Hoover as a member of the commission against crime, who classified this event as one of the most important promoted by the Italian colony of Chicago. Worthy of praise were the speeches delivered by Edward R. Hills, attorney, by professor Alfred H. Barr, D.D., Dean of the Theological Presbyterian Seminary of Chicago, admirer of Dr. DeCarlo for the past 26 years, and by Rev. Henry S. Brown, who is very well-known all over the nation, and who, at present is General Superintendent of the Supreme Council of the "Presbyterian Church Extention Board of Chicago".</p>
