   <p>Proposed Federation of Italian Societies.</p>
   <p>The ReItalia Society has made the first move towards the organizing of all Italian societies into one group, by appointing a committee whose function shall be to present this idea to the presidents of all Italian political and social groups. A federation of all Italian societies will strengthen morally and materially the position of the Italian Colony in Chicago.</p>
