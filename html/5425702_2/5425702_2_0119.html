   <p>Pietro Marazzo, a laborer living in a small apartment, in the rear of a tenement located at 850 South Morgan Street, a few evenings ago caused the death of his wife and four children by cutting their throats. He then killed himself in the same way.</p>
   <p>For a week all of them had been sick with influenza. Marazzo had recently remarked to his brother-in-law, Giustino Abate, that he was tired of doctors and medicines, and added that he would cure them in his "own way".</p>
   <p>On the evening of the massacre, he shouted to his brother-in-law, who lives on a floor above: "Come down and see a beautiful revel."</p>
   <p>Abate arrived just as Marazzo was cutting the throat of his last offspring. The body of Angelina, his wife, was lying of the floor; and heaped in a <span class="page-break">2</span>corner were the bodies of the other three children; Jennie, 5 years old; Arthur, 3; and Albert, 2.</p>
   <p>After flinging his youngest child (Faustino, six months old), on the bed, Marazzo cut his own throat as his terrified relative looked on.</p>
   <p>Horrible as this slaughter may appear, it is an atom compared to what is actually happening and will happen in this wretched society of today, with its brazen and unjust division into classes: one class having too much, and the other (comprising the majority), having nothing.</p>
   <p>This under-privileged man, Marazzo, knew only one side of life: hard, continuous, tiresome work, and his duty to support and look after his family.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>When he saw his dear ones in the clutches of disease, his first and last thought was to end their suffering.</p>
   <p>Or perhaps - worse yet - he may have racked his brain to discover how to pay for medical attention and medicines.</p>
   <p>In a few seconds, he removed his family and himself from an infernal world; a world in which hospitals refuse admission to the have-nots, and where the cost of medicines and even funerals is prohibitive.</p>
   <p>He is not a murderer, nor a suicide, but a victim of society.</p>
