   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the executive council of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, it was decided to open a subscription campaign under the sponsorship of the Italian Chamber of Commerce for the printing of 25,000 copies of the splendid speech made by Senator L. Y. Sherman, in which he favored the annexation of Fiume, by Italy. The speech will be sent to every Italian club and society in America in order to spread propaganda favoring Italy's aims.</p>
   <p>The collection amounted to $360. Among the contributors were Count G. Bolognes, $100, Messrs., Bragno and Meistary, $50, John Goletti, $10, P. Cariola, $10, Malato, $50, Cav. P. Russo, $25, Otto Marino, $25, Frank Postorino, $10, Capt. G. Del Lungo, $5, Ario Flamma, $5, E. Martini, $10, Cav. John Rigali, $50. The above sum was collected in a few seconds. Credit is due the Italian Chamber of Commerce which is always first in line for its patriotic and humanitarian work. Mr. Malato suggested that a great rally be held among the Italians, at which Senator Sherman would be invited to talk. The Italian colony will be happy to pay homage to this friend of Italy.</p>
