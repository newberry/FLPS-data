   <p>A meeting was held by the Roman Pleasure and Athletic Club at 544 W. Oak Street, to urge the young Italians to join the National Guard....At the suggestion of Mr. Cairoli Gighivtti, president of the Lega Fiume, a project was proposed for the formation of one company, composed of Italians only. As a result, one hundred applications were signed. We are sure that more young men will join in the project and prove to Americans that the Italians are in the forefront in patriotic spirit.</p>
