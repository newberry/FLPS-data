   <p>Today the Terelli Band will inaugurate Sans Souci Park. Terelli is very well known, and it is therefore unnecessary to introduce him to our readers. He was born in Naples and finished studying at St. Peter's Conservatory in Marella. He was the first choir boy of the theater when only seventeen years old. He has been in Germany at different times and has had the opportunity to excel in German music. After coming to America, he became the director of the Ellery Band, attaining great success. He is only 29 years old, and is the youngest director in America. He loves Italian music, because he is Italian, but he also fervently admires the German music. His band occupies first place among the great bands and, for that reason, will return to Ravinia Park, this year, where he will retake the stand for the New York Symphony orchestra, which takes the place of Thomas' orchestra from Chicago. The band is composed of fifty players elected from among the best in America. In place of the soloists we find last year's orchestra members are the same.</p>
