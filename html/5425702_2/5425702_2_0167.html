   <p>Two detectives from the Englewood district station who had gone to make an arrest in the Italian quarter at 67th and Justine Streets, found themselves surrounded by a hostile mob of Italian men and women. One was relieved of his gun and was in danger of the same thing happening to him, but for the fortunate arrival of two patrolmen. In the confusion the culprit escaped.</p>
   <p>The two officers, Long and Reilly, had gone to arrest Michele Blice, recently paroled from Pontiac and residing at 6708 Justine Street. Blice was one of seven men being sought for a robbery. He did not resist the officers, but his sister, sixteen years old, on seeing him being taken away, gave a cry which attracted men and women to the scene. The officers were surrounded and set upon with pitchforks and buckets of boiling water. Long fired his gun twice and thus brought to the scene patrolmen Walsh and Keating, who came none too soon. Guiseppe Blice and his sister were both taken into custody.</p>
