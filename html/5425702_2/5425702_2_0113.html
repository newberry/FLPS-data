   <p>James Colosimo, called "Big Jim," has been shot and killed, for causes unknown.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, he operated a night club frequented by bon vivants of high and low society, who would spend a merry time there, relishing both the fresh meat from the kitchen, and the highly-seasoned variety from the . . . . gutter.</p>
   <p>From these sources "Big Jim" derived his stupendous income. He had no scruples or fears concerning civic or moral rules - not even when established by puritanical Americans.</p>
   <p>Among the many explanations of the murder, one stated that Colosimo was implicated in a plot concocted in New York for the seizure of five million dollars, while another pointed to jealousy.</p>

   <p>Many newspapers aver that "Big Jim" was a harborer of criminals, although this seems to be refuted by the quality of the persons who attended his funeral. In fact, among the two thousand present, there were judges, municipal employees of high standing, lawyers, physicians, university professors, and ministers.</p>
   <p>At any rate, their homage to the deceased can be interpreted at least as a gesture of gratitude for all the worldly delights they had enjoyed at his night club.</p>
   <p>But how can we reconcile this gesture with puritanical morality, particularly American?</p>
   <p>This is not all. Colosimo had divorced his wife in order to carry on with a younger woman, an entertainer at his club.</p>

   <p>Finally, nobody yet knows who will inherit "Big Jim's" vast wealth, for the law seems to be uncertain as to whether it should be awarded to the divorced wife or to "Big Jim's" more recently acquired companion.</p>
