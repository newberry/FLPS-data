   <p>For having violated the closing hour ordinance, Major Funkhouser has ordered that the restaurant of James Colosimo be closed. The charge was made by policewomen who said that they had bought beer in the place after one o'clock.</p>
   <p>Colosimo's lawyers, Marks and Jampolis, have asked for a continuance and trial has been set for September 5.</p>
   <p>A wire from New York informed Chicago police that Johnny Torrio, supposedly the manager of Colosimo's was being held by the authorities of that city, but since no warrant for his arrest was produced he was released.</p>
   <p>Torrio had found it expedient to leave Chicago after the affair on 22nd Street in which a police officer was killed and several others wounded.</p>
