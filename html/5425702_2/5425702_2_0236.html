   <p>Walking through the district bounded by Canal, Halsted, Van Buren and Taylor streets, one is offered the shameful spectacle of Italian women with bodice open and breasts exposed, nursing their babies. Neither drunkards' obscene remarks nor the sarcasm of pedestrians serve to awaken in them a feeling of shame for their immodest behavior.</p>
   <p>We appeal to those, whom these women look up to, and hope that they can convince them that nursing babies on the street is not a nice thing to do. Furthermore it gives the Americans another point on which to jeer the Italian.</p>
