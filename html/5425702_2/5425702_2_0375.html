   <p>Vittorio E. Maggi and Vincenzo Lamantia, after a long struggle, have finally organized a "Political Workers' Society" (Societa Political Operaia.</p>
   <p>Members of this Club, generally known as "Sons of Labor", come from the Provinces of Aquila and Di Campobasso.</p>
   <p>This Society is organized for the moral and material welfare of Workers.</p>
   <p>It has been incorporated through the State Laws of Illinois, in order to assure the members of the rights given them.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this Club is:</p>
   <p>1. To organize the Italian Workers into a Fraternal Union.</p>
   <p>2. To obtain work for the unemployed.</p>
   <p>3. To assure a standardized wage.</p>

   <p>4. To inform members, during the election of candidates, which will benefit them most.</p>
   <p>5. To have interpreters for the benefit of those who cannot read or write.</p>
   <p>6. To assure adequate compensation in the event of an accident while on the job.</p>
   <p>7. To help its members acquire their citizenship-papers.</p>
   <p>We urge every Italian Laborer to join this Union.</p>
