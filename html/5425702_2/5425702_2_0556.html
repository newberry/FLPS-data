   <p>In reading the financial statement for the year, 1921 of the Italian Church of the Holy Guardian Angel of Chicago, 717 Farquer Street, we would like to mention, briefly, the splendid religious, humanitarian and educational work accomplished by the missionary fathers of the church in behalf of our colony.</p>
   <p>We point with pride to the work of Dr. Manlio Ciufoletti, head of the Scalabrinian missionaries and pastor of this church.</p>
   <p>The contribution to the church fund was $915, without counting the private donations on hand. During 1921 through the efforts of the Pastor, the associated Catholic Charities of Chicago dispensed to the needy parishioners $4,181.61. About 192 families, composed of 143 adults and 773 children received this assistance. Of 42 of these families, the mother is dead; in eight of these families, the father is dead; and six were deserted by the fathers.</p>

   <p>To assist the Associated Catholic Charities in favor of our needy, 180 letters were written and 400 telephone calls made. Those figures show the effort and interest taken by the Fathers of Holy Guardian Angel Church, in behalf of their parishioners in need of material and financial assistance.</p>
   <p>Besides the humanitarian work it is worth while mentioning the education given to the children. In 1920, the Rev. Ciufoletti erected a beautiful school building which is used by 400 children and divided into six classes with ten nuns as teachers. Besides English they teach Italian, music and singing.</p>
   <p>The debt of the school, at the beginning of 1921 amounted to $66,367.73. During the year it was reduced by $6,367.73. For the management of the school the sum of $5,544.14 was spent for ordinary and extra expenses.</p>
   <p>The teachers are not paid for their work. The class-rooms are well lighted and very clean, and are furnished in accordance with hygienic and didactic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>rules.</p>
   <p>We wish to see the efforts of the Fathers of the Holy Guardian Angel Church esteemed and appreciated by Italians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Ciufoletti, very well known in our colony for his activities and for his spirit of Italianism, will not stop with his first success of this educational, religious and patriotic mission from which the Italians of Chicago are receiving many benefits.</p>
