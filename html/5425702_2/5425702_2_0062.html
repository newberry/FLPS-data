   <p>It seems as though the courts were occupied with nothing else, but the Italian malefactors this week. Much credit the Italians bring to their race.</p>
   <p>Charges of murder, assault with a deadly weapon, robbery and other crimes were preferred.</p>
   <p>The Grand Jury has indicted the ten Italians, who according to the police have been terrorizing Chicago. They are Nicola Viana; Tommaso Errico; Frank Campioni; Tony Sansoni; Leonardo Crapo; Samuele Cardinella; Beniamino Tortorici; Giuseppe Dario; Frank Giuraputo; and Carlo Balasca.</p>
