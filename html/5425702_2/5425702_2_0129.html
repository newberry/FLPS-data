   <p>A certain Stoian Lachisso, living at 811 West Adams street, swindled some Italian laborers a few weeks ago by pretending to be an employment agent and promising them a good job at Stevens Point, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>These unfortunate men succeeded by sacrifices in scraping together the money for the trip.</p>
   <p>However, having reached their destination, they discovered the swindle, for no such jobs existed.</p>
   <p>Last week Lachisso was tried and sentenced by Judge Hill to six months' imprisonment and a fine of $200.</p>
