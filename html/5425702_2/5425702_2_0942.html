   <p>At no time has one's fatherland so needed the help of the Red Cross as it does at present. In the last six months our colony has done little or nothing for the welfare of our fatherland.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to move fast and so assure a quick harvesting of new funds to alleviate the sufferings brought upon our fatherland by the tremendous offensive launched by the enemy.</p>
   <p>The mutual benefit societies have the sacred duty of heeding this new appeal which comes to us from the bloody fields of battle.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the United Societies a plan presented by Mr. Barto Chiappe, to inscribe in a gold book of the Italian Colony of Chicago, all the contributors to the Italian Red Cross, was unanimously accepted. Here is the manner in which it will be compiled:</p>
   
   <p>1. Societies that donate $100.00 will be given a page with the picture of the officials and the name of each member in the society, and the amount given will be specified.</p>
   <p>2. Societies that donate $50.00 will be given one-half of a page with name of the society, date of incorporation, names of officials, and the amount given will be specified.</p>
   <p>3. Societies who donate $35.00 will be given one-fourth of a page, with name of society, date of incorporation; and the amount will be specified.</p>
   <p>All societies, clubs, circles, or private individuals who co-operate in answering this appeal will be treated likewise.</p>
   <p>A star at the top of the page will serve to distinguish the society or private individual who donates more than $100.00.</p>
   
   <p>The name of societies and private individuals will be entered alphabetically in this gold book.</p>
   <p>To make this plan a success, necessitates the co-operation of at least thirty associations.</p>
   <p>After the gold book is compiled, it will be sent to Rome and will be deposited in the museum of National Re-Birth.</p>
   <p>All directors of Italian newspapers who co-operate in making this book a success will be mentioned in this gold book, gratis.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this book is to give you a chance to express your feelings toward your mother-country, to bring together Italian Societies and for the benefit of the Italian Red Cross.</p>
