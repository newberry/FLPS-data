   <p>In order to cover a shortage of custom duties caused by the European War, it was proposed in Congress to tax domestic manufacturers, especially on wines.</p>
   <p>It is well understood that the Italian people, throughout the United States, are large consumers of this product, and a dealing in it is, in consequence, much practiced in every Italian quarter. In California one can say it is the only industry upon which thousands of Italians depend for their living.</p>
   <p>Convinced that such a high tax as twenty-cents a gallon represents almost the cost of the wine itself, and it being that wine for Italian people constitutes an article of necessity, because of its being a long existing custom and national characteristic, and considering also that such a tax would only cause a light increase on the importation of the Italian wines.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce at its last session voted to protest the proposed tax, and has sent copies to the President, Representatives, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and the Senators who represent Illinois in Congress.</p>
   <p>We reprint the original text of the protest translated into English. Chicago, Illinois, September 11, 1914.</p>
   <p>Whereas,- The Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives is contemplating the imposition of a tax on light wines; and, Whereas, The moderate use of such light wines is prevalent among many citizens of this country who are of Italian nationality and Italian parentage; and Whereas,- The drinking of such light wines is a matter of long standing custom and habit and is a national characteristic; and, Whereas,- The number of our Italian countrymen and especially on those in poor or moderate circumstances!</p>
   <p>Now, therefore, be it resolved:- That the Italian Chamber of Commerce of the city of Chicago does hereby protest against the proposed tax on light wines, which we denounce as unjust and discriminating; and, Be it further resolved:-That the Secretary of this Chamber of Commerce is hereby directed to send copies of this resolution to the Senators and Representatives in Congress from the State of Illinois, and also said Secretary is hereby directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Italian Chamber of Commerce of New York City, with the request that they take similar action on said proposed tax.</p>
