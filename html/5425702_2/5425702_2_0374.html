   <p>In years gone by, the main social events for the Italian Colony were the dances given by the various Italian Societies. Then came the presentations of drama and song. But the most successful social event, since the founding of the Colony took place last Wednesday, when more than five hundred people, many Americans among them, made merry at the Venetian Club Italia at the South Side Turner Hall, 3143-49 S. State St.</p>
   <p>The merry-makers were treated to an exhibition of strength given by Romolo, the young Sicilian Hercules. The Grand March was led by V. E. Maggi, costumed as a doge of Venice. Among the Italians present were Misses and Mesdames Cafferata, L. Gazzolo, L. Arado, F. Visconti, A. Equi, E. De Stefano, R. Romano., V. Antaro, E. Libonati, and many others too numerous to mention.</p>
   <p>The festivities ended at 4 A. M. the following morning and the dance committee was satisfied that all had an enjoyable time. A special word of thanks to the Americans who attended this festival of which the Club may well be proud.</p>
