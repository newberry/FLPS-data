   <p>Mr. Antonio Sbarbaro is our friend and asks every one to take his advice and bear it in mind. Mr. Sbarbaro tells us that there is a certain foreman who goes from one Italian quarter to the other asking for money to engage a large number of workers for a certain railway job, which, this is all the bunk, and do not let them fool you.</p>
   <p>You all know Antonio Sbarbaro, I'm sure. He provided work for hundreds of individuals without seeking any compensation in return. He begs you all to be sure and keep this in mind and not to give any money to anyone for any job.</p>
   <p>We should all thank Mr. Antonio Sbarbaro for his loyal advice to the Italians of this city.</p>
