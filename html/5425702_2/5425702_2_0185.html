   <p>The failure of De Bartolo and his "compari" to appear in court to testify against the lame defendant, Giacomo Morelli, was the reason for his being declared not guilty of a crime of which he had been accused by the said De Bartolo and his friends.</p>
   <p>The first hearing had been set for Wednesday at 9 a. m. before Judge Blume, 146 W. Madison, at the instigation of the Jew, Fred Lang of whom we have previously spoken. The second, initiated by De Bartolo as the plaintiff was heard before Judge Bradwell at 151 S. Clark. At both hearings, more than forty witnesses testified in favor of Morelli.</p>
   <p>We have no comment to make at the present time but will have much to say at the trial of De Bartolo who has been indicted for attempted homicide.</p>
