   <p>This evening the North Side Turner Hall at 820 N. Clark street, there will be held a meeting to protest the insipid Jugo-Slav agitation against Italy's occupation of Fiume.</p>
   <p>The Italian Colony should be present at the gathering in full force to solemnly proclaim the Italian rights on the Adriatic Sea. It is necessary that we make the American people understand that we intend to occupy territory which we firmly believe belong to us because of historical and racial reasons. The Jugo-Slav people are forgetting that they owe their independence to Italy and now in retaliation they are repaying the Italian people with abject ingratitude. We should vindicate the good name of our country by demonstrating in the name of Wilson's spoken principles, the validity of our rights.</p>
   <p>At the gathering which will be presided over by Stephen Malato, the speaker will be Professor John Lorenzoni. Other speakers are the lawyer A. N. Gualano, and Judge B. Baraso. Consul Count Bolognesi will appear at the demonstration. All the Italians should be present at this solemn gathering.</p>
