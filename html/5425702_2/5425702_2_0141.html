   <p>The Italian rustic can live in America twenty years without learning the language, manners, and customs of this country.</p>
   <p>There are those who claim that the Chinese and white people can not assimilate. At present we Italians are the Chinese of Europe.</p>
   <p>The bath-tub in the American house is considered as much a necessity as bread, air, and light. But in many Italian houses that fixture is unknown because the Italian rarely uses it.</p>
   <p>The Italian spends his evenings and Sundays in the saloon. He trades at Italian grocery stores. His savings he deposits with Italian bankers of the Carmelo Morazzi type. (see the story of this swine in issue number 253 of this paper.)</p>

   <p>The barber who shaves him must likewise be a compatriot of his.</p>
   <p>It was for this reason that three Italian laborers, newly arrived from New York, decided to be shaved by a barbaric Italian barber by the name of Sillavo, of South Canal street.</p>
   <p>The tonsorial operations went through without a hitch, but what was their surprise to receive a bill for seven dollars and twenty cents!</p>
   <p>The three men carried their complaint to a municipal judge, who ordered the barber to return the seven dollars and twenty cents and pay a fine of twenty-five dollars.</p>
