   <p>A committee chosen from the Italian colony of Chicago recently organized a patriotic festival in the vast Bowen Hall of Hull House to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the battles of Solferino and San Martino. The festival was given for the benefit of Columbus Hospital and the Italian Womens' Welfare Society. The promoting committee was composed of persons who were liked and esteemed by the colony, and the hall could not have been more suitable in size and locality. No expense was spared in making the announcements; the program was most attractive; and the admission fee of twenty-five cents was ridiculously small. And yet, out of 70,000 Italians living in Chicago barely a hundred came to the celebration. Why?</p>
   <p>Let us first make an unbiased statement of facts. The music was good; the artists of both sexes, introduced by their Maestra, Mrs. Boetti, demonstrated their excellent training; the lecturer, Mr. Luigi Ferraro, is an orator of rare elegance; and Mrs. Elviva Remondini is a marvelous reciter. But the public was absent. Why?</p>

   <p>The first thing that one noticed upon arriving was the number of empty seats, and the second thing was the decoration of the stage. Three enormous American flags covered two thirds of the background while on one side there was a single, small Italian flag hidden by the Stars and Strips. We feel sure that Mr. Mastrovalerio, our charming fellow-journalist, though of the opposition who planned the festival, did not purposely arrange such a display of flags. Instead, we are convinced that he rummaged all through the colony in order to find an Italian flag of size and appearance adequate for the occasion. But he did not find it, and he could not find it, and that single little tri-colored flag, smothered by the three big American flags on a stage where the Italian fatherland was being glorified, was elected to be the index of Italian patriotism in America, - vanquished and scattered by the utilitarianism of the colony.</p>
   <p>The Italian royal march and the national anthem did not arouse much enthusiasm in the audience, for they are both expressions of one fatherland, one's own. Garibaldi's hymn was warmly and unanimously cheered, for that is the hymn of the soldier of all countries, of the hero who offers his sword to all who are oppressed. When the band played the Marseillaise, it was applauded with great fervor, even by the ladies in the audience; it is the hymn of revolution. Nearly all the members of the committee which promoted this festival were naturalized American citizens. If you should ask them how they were under solemn oath to renounce all duties and rights as Italians and to adopt another fatherland, they would all reply that it was a matter of self-interest.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Very well. But if self-interest justifies the abnegation of one's patrioticties, why should it not also justify the internationalism of socialist working-men?</p>
   <p>It was well to extol the beauty of our mother tongue on that evening. But why is it, then, that the children of ninety-nine percent of the Italians in America do not know how to speak correctly one word of Italian? Why, then, do these same Italo-Americans feel a sacred solidarity with the 100,000 Italians of Trieste who refuse to speak German while they remain indifferent toward their children's ignorance of Italian? Moreover, there are two millions and a half of us over here, and comparatively few Italians live in Austria.</p>
   <p>We Socialists feel and proclaim our internationalism. You fellow-countrymen of ours, on the other hand, cherish the delusion that you are not internationalists while all your actions point to the contrary. You plan a patriotic manifestation, and it demonstrates merely that Italian patriotism is lacking in America, - which is a good thing. This is evident when we see that even prominent Italo-Americans try to conceal their origin, that most of them display the clean-shaven upper lip of Americans, and that their offspring remain absolutely ignorant of their mother tongue.</p>
