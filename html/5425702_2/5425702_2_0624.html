   <p>Judge Louis B. Senese, Jr., is one of those men of sterling character, of unselfish and stout heart, who possessed a busy mind, and for whose untiring and beneficial work among the youth of Melrose Park, his community and the country, we owe a debt of gratitude.</p>
   <p>Judge Senese has found it possible to devote a part of his time to boy's work.</p>
   <p>Due to his interest and efforts the Melrose Park Boy's club of which he is founder and father was organized in July 1929. The Club occupies its own clubhouse, which was dedicated in September 1932. It is located on Broadway and 8th Street, one block north of Lake Street in Melrose Park.</p>

   <p>The clubhouse is the realization of a dream of Judge Senese and the wonderfully spirited citizens, who have cooperated with him in this worthy work. It is equipped with sound moving picture machines, shower baths, various games, boxing ring, and a kitchen.</p>
   <p>The Club, which was organized with an initial number of forty members, now has a membership of two hundred and twenty-five of which ninety-nine per cent are boys of Italian extradition.</p>
   <p>The Club's summer activities for 1933 are: Visit to A Century of Progress, Sox's Ball Park, the unveiling of the Columbus Monument, a picnic, a visit to the Cook County Fair.</p>

   <p>The past winter's activities were: Manual Training Classes, films of the "Life of George Washington," and "Christopher Columbus," film of "Anno IX" (of Fascist Regime), Italian Government films, Minstrel Show, Opera "La Traviata" at Proviso High School.</p>
   <p>There is a touch of romance connected with the erection of the clubhouse. It was purchased by the committee, with money collected and donated by the committee from School District #89, which used it as a double portable school house. And it was moved to and erected in its present location by parents of the members.</p>
   <p>Using the words in its dedicatory pamphlet: "The building is dedicated to the boys of Melrose Park to set in motion a program, which will inspire and encourage them to give the true, the good, and the beautiful, to the world in which we live."</p>
