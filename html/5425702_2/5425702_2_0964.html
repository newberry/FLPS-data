   <p>Last Tuesday evening 320 of our countrymen left Chicago on the Pere Marquette Railroad for New York to sail for Italy and offer their services to the nation.</p>
   <p>Scenes of sublime patriotism were shown as men enrolled at the depot in the hours preceding the departure.</p>
   <p>With the departure of Tuesday's group this colony numbers close to two thousand who have volunteered to fight for their Fatherland.</p>
   <p>This last convoy has boarded the "Tommaso di Savoia" for Italy.</p>
   <p>It is calculated that there arrives in Italy from all parts of the United States, from 3,000 to 5,000 men weekly.</p>
   <p>In all parts of the United States Italians parade through the Italian quarters singing patriotic songs, and enthusiastically applaud as the Italian flag passes by.</p>
