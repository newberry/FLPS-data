   <p>The Italo-American National Union, which sponsored the banquet held in the Sherman Hotel, May 24, 1936, in commemoration of the Italian victory in Ethiopia, has assigned the net profit ($206.10) to Consul-General Fontana to be used for the yearly summer tours through Italy of Italian students attending the after-school sessions held in the Italian language in Italian parochial schools throughout the country.</p>
   <p>The prize of a tour through the mother country is given the student who has won distinction in the study of Italian.</p>
   <p>Italian Consul-General Fontana acknowledged receipt of the money in a letter to our supreme president, Philip D'Andrea, in which he expressed his appreciation and thanks for the efforts of our union in assuring the success of the enterprise.</p>
