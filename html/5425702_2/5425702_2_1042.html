   <p>The Italian colony of this city is responding in a manner superior even to the colony of New York in answering the call of the unfortunate Calabresi brethrens.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are 45, 000 Italians while in New York there are 500,000. Compare the sums collected among the Italians of Chicago with those of New York, and the result will favor our good colony.</p>
   <p>From the first announcement of the earthquake we sent to the presidents of the Italian societies of Chicago the following letter:</p>
   <p>Dear President:</p>
   <p>Will you please answer the following questions?</p>
   <p>1. What are you going to do to help the Calabrian victims of the earthquake?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>2. How are you going to celebrate the glorious September 20th?</p>
   <p>3. Will you on that day make a pilgrimage to the Statue of Garibaldi on the Lake Shore Drive of Lincoln Park and place a wreath on the momument?</p>
   <p>4. Are you willing to join in sending to the Italian section of the Milan exposition which will open this May, a chronicle of your society and its aims? Do not fail to send me your address and that of the officers of your society.</p>
   <p>A. Mastrovalerio, editor.</p>
