   <p>A few more years and the Italian colony of Chicago will be in the ascendency over the Italian colonies of New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>For the past ten years, the Italians of America have progressed in such a way that they cannot be accused of civic lethargy. The Italians have finally understood that in order to gain the confidence and the respect of the Americans, it is necessary to step out of small industries and dedicate themselves with energy to a broader commercial field, which is more productive and renumerative.</p>
   <p>The Jews have taken the lead in the financial, industrial, theatrical fields. Why are the Italians, who in number, intelligence, and will-power, are not inferior to the Jews, supposed to remain in obscurity, to be looked upon with suspicion, and satisfied with being called filthy and illiterate? There are many reasons in the past why the Italians kept themselves on a low social level. We need many volumes to state the origin, the consequence, and remedy of these <span class="page-break">\2</span>causes.</p>
   <p>The following are some of the outstanding reasons: Negligence of the Italian Government in directing the Italian immigrants; the inefficiency and indifference of the consular authorities; criminality and dissension among the immigrants; one Italian, more shrewd and astute, defrauding another; and the lack of a spiritual assimilation.</p>
   <p>The war opened the way to a renaissance of the Italians. There was a spirit of unity when our colonists came in contact with the various governmental, press, economic, and diplomatic commissions. The consular authorities began to take an active part in the life of the Italian colony. The intellectual element, infused with new blood from across the sea, worked towards a new ideal and we saw the beginning of banking institutions like the "Board of Italy" of San Francisco, with Italian capital and directors, and useful industries, beautiful factories, and numerous commercial firms. The Italian colonies of America in a short period of time made themselves felt in the economic, political, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>moral fields.</p>
   <p>The evolutionary process of the Italian colonies in America has been slow, but as we have already stated, there are many reasons for this retardation and we do not wish to say whose is the responsibility. We must rejoice that the Italians in America are in the ascendancy and we hope that the progress of our colonies will never stop but will continue forever.</p>
   <p>THE ITALIAN PRESS.</p>
   <p>This is not a study of the various stages of the progress of the Italian colonies of the United States. We only intend to give a resume of what is most outstanding in the progress of the Italian colony of Chicago. Just as architecture reveals the taste of a people, so the press reveals its sentiments. The Italian Press of America, once edited by incompetent pseudo-newspapermen, contributed much with their vulgar controversies to the spreading of discord, division, and ignorance among the Italian colonies. The press of today, remodeled <span class="page-break">\4</span>and strengthened by educated and conscientious newspapermen, has taken steps to spread sound doctrines which will educate the masses.</p>
   <p>The patriotic and widely read review Il Corrocio under the supervision of Agostino di Biasa is an outstanding example. I1 Bolletino Della Sera and I1 Progresso Italo-Americano of New York; L'Italia of San Francisco; La Notizia and La Gazetta Del Massachusetts of Boston; and L'Opinione of Philadelphia are important newspapers rich in news value and editorials, with the double aim of keeping alive the sentiment of Italianism and of guiding towards a brighter future the Italian colonies in America.</p>
   <p>We point with pride to the high ideal set by the Italian Press of Chicago, which is equal, if not superior, to any in America. Leading Chicago Italian newspapers are: L'Italia, published since 1886, by Chev. Oscar Durante; La Tribuna Trans-Atlantica, whose policy is set by its owner and director, A. Mastro-Valerio; L'Idea, official organ of the Italian societies for the past ten years, and owned by A. Ferrari; Il Cittadino di Chicago which, though young in years has acquired for itself a good reputation with the public, and I1 Bolletino <span class="page-break">\5</span>which is on the way to becoming an important monthly review under the direction of Mr. Pietro Nanni.</p>
   <p>The Italian Press has been one of the leading factors in the growth of the Italian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>BANKS AND INDUSTRIES.</p>
   <p>This intellectual renascence, like a blood transfusion, has resulted in a commercial and industrial enlargement and in the opening of new fields to our men of affairs. In the past, Italian trade was limited to a few imported Italian products which were sold entirely in the Italian colonies. Today the colony of Chicago has, as active factors, an agency of the Banco di Napoli; the Romano and Ariani Banks, substantial and honest institutions. It numbers many first class importing and exporting firms operating in their own buildings, among which are Bragno and Mustari Co., Daprato Statuary Co., Andrea Russo, Garibaldi and Cuneo, and the Garibaldi Co., each a leader in its particular field.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Macaroni factories have been established in the past few years and their product has reached a standard which compares favorably with the best imported Italian macaroni. A. Morici and Co., Viviano Bros., Naples Macaroni Co., and Varco Bros. are equipped with modern machinery and furnished with all conveniencies.</p>
   <p>In an article of this size it is impossible to mention all the commercial and industrial activities, and the professions, such as law and medicine are so well represented that we cannot begin to name even their most prominent members. Of the Chicago Grand Opera Co., which this year gave the most outstanding and solemn confirmation of the superiority of Italian musical genius, we can only mention the name.</p>
   <p>THE SPIRIT OF INITIATIVE.</p>
   <p>A distinguishing trait of the Italian in the economic struggle is the spirit of initiative which has entered into the conscience of our men of affairs and <span class="page-break">\7</span>which has been the herald of future economic and moral victories.</p>
   <p>The idea of limiting commercial activities within a restricted Italian sphere is not favored by the younger generation which is, even now, branching out into the American market, thus expanding and augumenting Italian capital and assisting the creative and constructive genius of the Italian in America.</p>
   <p>The following are among the leading industries of the colony: Melodia Phonograph Co., Wabash Shade Co., Marcheroni Furniture Co., and the Excelsior Dramatic Co.</p>
   <p>The Melodia Phonograph is under the able direction of Mr. E. Malato. He expects it to become as prominent as the Victor, Columbia, and Edison phonographs. An important discovery developed at the Melodia factory is an improvement in the mechanism which eliminates the scratching sound of the needle on the disc. A testimonial on the quality of this machine from Gino Marinizzi, one of the most competent personalities in matters of music, appears in another section of this bulletin. (Gino Marinizzi was director of the Chicago Grand Opera Co., after the death of Cleofonte Campanini.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The Melodia Phonograph has all the elements for success. It is ably directed by men whose honesty is unquestioned and the factory, at 400 N. Sangamon, boasts every modern technical and hygienic improvement.</p>
   <p>The Wabash Shade Co. is owned by George Silvestri, an up and coming member of our colony. This company's success is due to the resourcefulness and intelligence of Mr. Silvestri.</p>
   <p>The Mascheroni Furniture Co., established by G. Mascheroni, sculptor and woodcarver, makes high grade furniture which is sold by Tobey and Co. and Marshall Field and Co.</p>
   <p>The Excelsior Dramatic Co. is a sound theatrical company that is bound to spread a better knowledge of Italian drama in America and consequently raise Italian prestige, since the theater, like the press, is an important medium for propaganda.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Italian is practically an unknown language to the Americans. The exaggerated admiration that this country shows for everything French is only equal to the diffidence shown for anything Italian. We are, more or less, responsible for this situation since we have but slightly taken advantage of the medium of publicity in asserting our Italianism. We have been blocked to a great extent by the Jugo-Slavs, Germans, and Austrians as well as by our "beloved" allies, the English and the French.</p>
   <p>In the Christmas week issue of the Bulletin of the New York Chamber of Commerce, Pasquale Di Biasi, the publisher, expressed the opinion that there is a need for an Italian theater on the order of the French theater which has been operating in New York for seven years, presenting French drama with French actors. We further suggest Italian drama translated into English and acted by American actors.</p>
   <p>The Excelsior Dramatic Co. has the unqualified support of the Italian public as well as that of Enrico Caruso, Italo Montemezzi, Gino Marinuzzi, Galli-Gurci, <span class="page-break">\10</span>Judge Barasa, the attorneys Malato and Gualano, and many other prominent personalities. In March it hopes to present in one of Chicago's principal theaters, an Italian drama for which all critics prophesy an unequaled success.</p>
   <p>We are proud that the Italian colony of Chicago has kept in step with the colossal development of Chicago.</p>
