   <p>Throughout yesterday afternoon Guido Sabetta the Italian consul; Bernard B. Barasa, his legal adviser, and Dr. Antonio Lagorio, treasurer, Stephen Malato, secretary, of the Chicago Italian committee selected to take charge of the work of obtaining funds from Italians of Chicago, remained in room 412 of the Masonic Temple greeting visitors and thanking them for donations.</p>
   <p>It was announced last evening that $2,000.00 is at hand to swell the fund already sent to the minister of foreign affairs at Rome and that today this sum, in all probability, will be increased to $4,000.00. It is the policy of consul Sabetta, whenever any considerable amount is on hand, to cable it to Rome as promptly as possible.</p>
   <p>Table Piled With Money.</p>
   <p>Throughout the afternoon Dr. Lagorio was kept busy receiving donations and toward evening gold, silver and bank notes were piled high upon the table before him.</p>

   <p>Consul Sabetta received a communication yesterday from P. S. Lombros, proprietor and editor of the Greek Star of Chicago, who announced that contributions collected by that publication for the relief of the earthquake sufferers already amounted to $185.50.
