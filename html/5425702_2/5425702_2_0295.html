   <p>To the Honorable Members,</p>
   <p>The Conference Committees,</p>
   <p>Prohibition Amendment Agriculture Bill.</p>
   <p>At a specially called meeting by the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, (an organization representing in a very wide sense of feelings and sentiments of all the wine-using population of the Middle West), held in Chicago, Illinois, on October 5, 1918, there was adopted without a dissenting vote, the following statement, touching a matter held vital to the health, contentment, and well being, not only of our population of Italian birth or descent, but likewise of those many other various populations who themselves, or whose immediate ancestors, came to the United States from countries where light wine is the universal national beverage.</p>
   
   <p>Whereas, An Amendment to the Agriculture Bill is about to be acted upon by your Honorable Committee, which will include in its provisions a prohibition of the manfacture of wine, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, protests are arriving on all sides from our wine-using population; and from growers of grapes, who foresee in the prohibition of wine manufacture the serious deterioration, if not practical destruction of America's great grape industry; we therefore respectfully beg the privilege, because of the seriousness of the situation, of bringing to your attention, briefly, the following declaration, and silent facts:</p>
   <p>First, we recognize that if possible all strictly alcoholic liquors should as beverages, be banished from America; not for the period of war, only, but for all time.</p>
   
   <p>Second, we recognize that under the stress of this World War an opportunity has come to carry through, and if proper wisdom is exercised, perhaps make binding indefinitely, this great consummation.</p>
   <p>Third, for the permanent welfare of America it is not enough that intoxicating liquors be barred during the war, they should be eradicated for all time and we hold this can best and most easily be done by substitution of light wines. The alcoholic liquors are to be permanently done away with, and this war time measure is primarily an effort in that direction. In the very nature of the case a substitute will be demanded and must be provided. What more healthful or harmless could be provided than wines restricted by law to a non-intoxicating alcoholic content, similar to the light wines, the peoples everyday wines.....of France and Italy?</p>
   
   <p>Fourth, it is exceedingly childish that because alcoholic liquors are the curse of the world, that non-intoxicating wines should be placed in the same category and denied our people, upon the false assumption that wine works either harm to the physique, or undermines the morale of the individual. Both assumptions are false. Without going further to show that wine is not inimical to morals we have the authority of our Savior; and that it is beneficial to health, we have the authority of the greatest of the Apostles.</p>
   <p>Fifth, this whole prohibition amendment is based wholly upon the necessity of conserving grain during the war. Since, then, this whole amendment is based upon the conservation of grain, why, we respectfully ask, should wine be included, when in its manufacture not one iota of grain is used? It may be claimed that if wine is omitted from the Prohibition Bill, that it opens the door for beer and whisky manufacturers to say that preference is being shown and demand like exemption or treatment for themselves, but before this door is opened it must be shown that beer and whisky use no more grain.</p>
   
   <p>Sixth, we respectfully call the attention of your Honorable Committee to the fact that grapes rank third (possibly second), in the great fruit crops of America, and that if the manufacture of wines should be prohibited, even for a single year, America's great grape industry would be seriously imperilled, if not in large measure ruined.</p>
   <p>Seventh, conservation of grain means conservation of food; prohibition of wine manufacture means destruction of food, this proves that there are thousands of tons of grapes, yearly, that for many reasons, such as violent wind storms, rains, hall storms, over-ripening, and so forth, can neither be shipped to market nor made into raisins at home. Bar these grapes from being made into wine and one of the principle props upon which the grape grower leans is knocked from under him. A bad season has faced the grower, but his ability to save his crop in the shape of wine, saves him from downright ruin. Turning his crop into wine is the more easily accomplished from the fact that the grower, who is in straitened circumstances, is not burdened with the hardship of buying sugar for making his wine, as the wine we advocate does not require a particle of sugar in its manufacture. It is simply the pure unadulterated juice of the grape fermented to a point where it holds a non-intoxicating percentage of alcohol, and fermentation is absent.</p>
   <p>Eighth, it may be questioned by the over zealous prohibition advocates why not make all these thousands of tons of otherwise wasted grapes into grape juice instead of wine? The answer is plain and simple, that a modicum of grapes are at the present time made into grape juice, and only a modicum, the reason being that grape juice is to very many neither agreeable to the palate nor stomach, while wine on the contrary, is practically universally agreeable to both.</p>
   
   <p>Ninth, truly ninety-eight per cent of Italians drink wine from childhood to old age, and yet, their longevity is proverbial and sobriety one of their cardinal virtues.</p>
   <p>Tenth, there are three greatly used beverages; coffee, tea and wine, all equally harmless, all with a certain percentage of food value, but wine, it may truthfully be said, has the greatest food value of any. Then why, since all are equally harmless, should the one of highest food value be chosed as the one to be denied our people? Is such an act grounded on sober wisdom or is it because a great wave of hysteria has carried the American people off their feet?</p>
   <p>Eleventh, the moment the war ends a great movement will be set on foot by the liquor interests for the restoration of alcoholic liquors, and joining this movement will be the whisky, brandy, gin and beer manufactures and drinkers, and should wine be prohibited during the war, then to these interests will be added the grape growers and wine manufacturers and drinkers.</p>
   
   <p>These will be reinforced by millions of our returning soldiers, who will return to our shores as confirmed wine drinkers as are their comrades of France and Italy. Should these returning soldiers return to a wineless America, they will at once clamor for their accustomed wine and be ready to join any movement, however, rash, that would restore to them their glass of wine at dinner; without which that meal would be as flat and tasteless as would be their breakfast without its cup of coffee. Let us be firm in this matter. Who is there would back a law which would deprive him of his morning coffee or his evening tea, knowing both to be harmless? Why then seek to deprive another of his mid-day or evening wine, he knowing fully well that his beverage is equally harmless?</p>
   <p>Twelfth, returning to the post-war agitation for alcoholic liquors; if wine is permitted during the war, hundred of thousands of whisky drinkers will have become during this war period, too accustomed to wine, to return to alcoholic drinks. They, instead of joining the forces of the advocates of strong liquors will join the forces of the opponents, and they will be joined by the grape growers and present wine drinkers, and will be reinforced by the thousands of our returned veterans, who prize their wine; and these three great forces added to by the great army of moderates when taken altogether, will constitute such a tremendous force that alcoholic liquors will never again throw their baleful shadow over the happiness of our people.</p>
   <p>Thirteenth, in submitting this somewhat lengthy statement, we do so with the respectful prayer that you will give it the consideration which the great issue at stake justifies. Should your wisdom decide that permission to manufacture wine during the war should not be denied and conclude that such action would result in the prevention after the war of a return in the manufacture of alcoholic liquors, we feel satisfied, since moderation in all things, especially legislation, is the soul of wisdom, that your your decision would be justified before the bar of the American people and the world. With sentiments of the highest regard, we subscribe ourselves,</p>
   <p>Most respectfully,</p>
   <p>F. Bragno, president, Ario Flamina, Sec'y.</p>
