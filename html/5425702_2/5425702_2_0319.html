   <p>The Italian patriotic societies are keeping alive interest in Fiume's fate by appealing to America's public opinion in the behalf of Fiume's annexation to Italy.</p>
   <p>United States senators are flooded with telegrams sent by Italians. This indicates that now more than ever the public of their great attachment for their fatherland. The Volturno and the San. Stephen of Castellani societies have sent two telegrams favoring Fiume's annexation to Italy to Senators Sherman and McCormic. For this we congratulate the directors of the two societies; Messrs. L. Di Silvestro; V. Di Ciccio; G. Di Silvestro; and V. Natardonato.</p>
