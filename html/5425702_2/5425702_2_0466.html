   <p>Tuesday the American patriots went to place wreaths of flowers on the tombs of their loved ones who died on the battle fields during the war for Independence. At 3:00 p.m. the great parade started from the center of the city and met with the strongest enthusiasm from the thousands and thousands of citizens who filled the streets. There were about 8,000 people who took part in the parade, and in this great crowd the two Italian Military Societies of Chicago formed a beautiful setting. These two Societies made the Italian flag fly proudly beside the stars and stripes of the American flag.</p>
