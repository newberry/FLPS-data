   <p>The president, Chevalier Italo I. Canini makes a brief report of his efforts in influencing the United States Senators for a favorable acceptance of the pact for the payment of the Italian debt to the United States.</p>
   <p>He read a letter from Senator McKinley of Illinois and another from the Illinois Manufacturers Association, in which both stated an interest in favor of the sanction. Chevalier Castruccio, Consul General, suggested that the Chamber take further measures or at least, make some protest against the malicious insinuations of the Chicago Daily Tribune, which has taken a harsh and false attitude against our race and the Italian Government.</p>
   <p>The Executive Council, adhering in general to the suggestion of Chevalier Castruccio, postponed the decision to the next meeting, in order to give the President enough time to make the protest in question.</p>
