   <p>This Italian Chamber of Commerce resolved to send to the Italian Societies the following letter, written by Mr. Canini:</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: We have the pleasure of informing you that the protest made by the Italian Societies against the insane and hateful claims of the Jugo-Slavs, over the Italian territory, strengthened by 160,000 signatures, was presented to President Wilson personally on March 4, by the delegation of this Chamber of Commerce, composed of Stefano Malato and Antonio Ferrari. The gentlemen also gave President Wilson a memorandum which clearly stated the rights of Italy over the Trentino, Trieste, Fiume, Istris and Dalmatia.</p>
   <p>The President replied that he would take into consideration the request of the Italian Societies and that he was seriously considering the Adriatic question. This promise does not end our work and we must continue in the campaign against the filthy Jugo-Slavian propaganda, based on infamous lies against Italy. We inclose a resolution approved by the Illinois Legislature introduced in the House of Representatives by Hon. Charles Coia and in the Senate by the Hon. Edw. Glaklin, and we beg you to work towards having a similar resolution approved by the State in which you reside. If you are successful, send a copy of the approved resolution to the Congressmen and Senators of your State and a summary of the same must be wired to President Wilson in Paris.</p>
   <p>Our nation, which has contributed much to the industrial development of this country, especially in the last quarter of a century, and has brought with it an inherent idealism and civilization, must reaffirm itself in this circumstance.</p>
   <p>We have the duty of enlightening American public opinion, so that America will not commit the error of being among those who would perpetrate this great injustice against Italy which has made so many sacrifices in blood and money.</p>
