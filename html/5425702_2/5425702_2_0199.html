   <p>The new chief of the Chicago Police Department is re-opening his crusade against Italians carrying concealed weapons. He has directed Detective Sergeant Storer, leader of the department's so-called 'Black Hand' Squad, to lead the crusade. The squad made many arrests among our countrymen, who were found in their usual hangouts carrying knives and revolvers.</p>
   <p>The squad intends to visit these places at least twice a week.</p>
