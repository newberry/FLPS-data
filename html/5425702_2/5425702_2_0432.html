   <p>The Roman Legion of America, a very strong and patriotic organization with branches all over the United States, made an appeal to every one of its delegates to promote for the next September 20, a national holiday for the Italians, with a big celebration of fraternity among the Italo-Americans.</p>
   <p>True to its program, the Roman Legion does not fail to celebrate any historical event, thus giving the opportunity to every citizen of Italian descent to consecrate again their sentiments of love and loyalty to this great country and to show their determination to cooperate, with every means, to the common victory. The Roman Legion of America is organizing a public demonstration to display our complete acquiescence to the democratic ideas of President Wilson. The noble enthusiasm and the ardent love of the Italian people for Italy and the United States will, without any doubt, lead them to respond to the appeal of the Roman Legion of America.</p>
