   <p>One of the first co-nationals to respond to the call to arms, was Dr. G. Bruno, son-in-law of Chev. Dr. Antonio Lagorio. He left a wife and three children behind to offer his services in defense of his fatherland.</p>
   <p>For two years Dr. Bruno has been face to face with death on the bloody battle-field, giving an assisting hand to the wounded soldiers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bruno has the title of Captain in the army. One of the ambulances which will be sent to Italy, through the initiative of the local committee of the Italian Red Cross, will bear the name of Dr. Bruno.</p>
