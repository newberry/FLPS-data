   <p>Immediately following the declaration of war between Italy and Austria, a committee composed of many members of the Italian colony was formed in Chicago, for the purpose of helping the families of the men called to arms and to raise funds for the Italian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The executive committee was composed of the Italian Consul Conte G. Bolognesi, and the delegates for the Italian Red Cross in this city, Dr. A. Lagorio, Dr. C. Volini, C. Barbier, Mr. J. Garibaldi, and John E. Rigali, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Honorable mention should be given to the Vice-Consul, Mr. Dall Agnol, who offered his services for the distribution of the benefits to the families of the men called to arms, and to Mr. J. Rodighiero, Secretary of the local Chamber of Commerce, who also gave his services gratis. He handled all the accounts and correspondence.</p>
   <p>Work already accomplished by the executive committee is as follows:</p>
   <p>(1) On July 1, 1915, it was agreed by the R. Governo that the parents or wife of the man called to arms should receive the sum of $12.00 monthly, and $2.00 for every child.</p>
   
   <p>The sum of $800.00 has already been spent for this purpose.</p>
   <p>(2) 55,000-lire have been given to the Italian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>(3) 60,000-lire have been spent for the assistance of several institutions in Italy.</p>
   <p>(4) An endowment fund of 100,000 lire was established by the Italian colony of Chicago, for the use of the National Federation of the Committee of Assistance for the blind-crippled soldiers at war.</p>
   <p>(5) 4,000 bundles containing woolen stockings, cigars, cigarettes, chocolates, etc. have been sent to Italy.</p>
   <p>(6) 10,000 lire were raised for the purchase of woolen clothing for the Italian soldiers.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank the Italian colony for its cooperation in making the Allied Bazaar a great success, and all the Italian societies of Chicago for their generous contributions to the Italian Red Cross and their mother-country.</p>
