   <p>The Women's Missionary Association, recently organized to make a steady missionary propaganda in favor of the Presbyterian Church of St. John, held its first meeting, Sunday, Feb. 3rd, at 4 P. M.</p>
   <p>It was an interesting session. Various committees were appointed to carry out the program.</p>
   <p>We expect a great deal from this organization with its nobility of purpose. We are very confident that the untiring efforts of the intelligent President, Mrs. Adele Bucaletti, with the assistance of Mesdames R. Piermattei and M. Ventrella, will insure new successes for the triumph of the faith in the Gospel.</p>
