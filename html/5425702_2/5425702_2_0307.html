   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce has forwarded a protest against the law's intention of imposing a twenty-cents tax on every gallon of wine.</p>
   <p>The readers were already informed of the dispatch that previously appeared in L'Italia; that the American Government found it necessary to face a diminution of the income from custom duties.</p>
   <p>To cover this deficit, the proposal of taxing beer and wine was advanced.</p>
   <p>The application of this bearing tax, beside tremendously damaging the vinious industry, also strikes the buyer, who would have to pay twenty-cents more per gallon to continue drinking it.</p>
   <p>The disadvantageous consequences of this law, were clearly explained in this protest forwarded by the Italian House of Commerce tothe senators and congressmen, who represent Illinois in Washington</p>
