   <p>Judge Hortonhas refused the appeal of Beriedetto Di Iono, and the prisoner is now in Joliet serving his twenty-one year sentence, less the time allowed for good behaviour.</p>
   <p>It was while playing cards and imbibing too much wine with friends at Clinton and Ewing, that Di Iono in a fit of rage during an argument of his own instigation, stabbed Domenico De Cristofaro to death.</p>
   <p>He was arrested and after the coroner's verdict of guilty he was held to the grand jury which indicated him and ordered his trial in a criminal court.</p>
   <p>The trial took place last October, and the jury finding him guilty, he was sentenced to Joliet for the term before mentioned.</p>

   <p>Di IONO appealed the sentence but as stated at beginning of this article his appeal was refused.</p>
   <p>We cannot condemn too much this vicious habit of carrying a knife.</p>
