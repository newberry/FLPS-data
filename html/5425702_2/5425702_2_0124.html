   <p>Chicago's Italian Chamber of Commerce has sent us a letter, begging us to warn our countrymen against a fraud cheerfully practiced here by their co-nationals.</p>
   <p>There are Italian merchants who pour the olive oil imported from Italy into barrels, mixing it with linseed oil. This mixture retails at a little less than the market price of oil, and it is advertised as pure olive oil from Lucca, the Riviera, or Sicily.</p>
   <p>The Chamber of Commerce wishes to notify the retailers of oil that the Federal laws against adulteration are most strict.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is to the interest of the retailers to sell Italian olive oil of well-known trade-marks, whose purity is guaranteed by both producers and retailers - as well as to the interest of the consumers and the products themselves.</p>
