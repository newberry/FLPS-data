   <p>It is almost impossible for us in this brief column of news to say enough about the personality and the work done for Italian art by that good man Commendatore Louis Eckstein. His name, of course, is well known to all the Italians in Chicago and environs because he gave us Ravinia with all her natural grandeur, and the exuberance of Italian operas and Italian singers. He gave it to us with all the generosity of a great heart and with all the enthusiasm of a noble artist, and when we heard that the king of Italy had conferred upon him the decoration of Commendatore of the Crown of Italy, we were overwhelmed with joy. At the Italian Chamber of Commerce we are even more enthusiastic as we have the honor of including Commendatore Eckstein as one of our life members.</p>
