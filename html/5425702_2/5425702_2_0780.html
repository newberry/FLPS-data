   <p>On January 27, under the auspices of the Royal Consul General Castruccio, a requiem mass was celebrated in the Church of Our Lady of Pompey, in commemoration of the death of Marshal Luigi Cadorna.</p>
   <p>The Italians numerously attended the sad rites in honor of Italy's unfortunate, but glorious and brave soldier. With Cadorna but through no fault of his, Italy lived through the hardest days of the World War, but she was also aware of the inexhaustible moral energy of the Marshal. Italy had its baptism at Caporeto and became Italian.</p>
   <p>Before the Caporeto disaster, which ended the war leadership of Cadorna, he had been a genial commander and a victorious leader. He began the war with a mass of untrained citizens, poorly armed, against one of the best trained armed and prepared nations. But he transformed that mass of citizens into invincible soldiers who fought and won eleven battles. He was unfortunate and unjustly accused but the Fascist government, aware of his heroism, genius, and military doctrine, promoted him to Marshal, and he was once again an expert adviser on the reorganization of the new army. On December 21, 1928, he died in Bordighiera and his death was mourned by all the nation.</p>
   <p>Italy lost one of the best men of the present era. Cadorna followed in the footsteps of his father and he accomplished what his father had long ago begun - the unity of Italy.</p>
