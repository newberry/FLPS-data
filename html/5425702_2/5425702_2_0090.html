   <p>One night of last week unknown vandals entered the church building at 2100 W. Harrison St., smashed all the window panes and destroyed the organ.</p>
   <p>The building was bought recently by the Presbyterian Church, and was turned over to the Rev. De Carlo to be used as propaganda center for the Evangelical faith.</p>
   <p>It is thought the deed might have been perpetrated for personal reasons.</p>
   <p>Rev. De Carlo, who is highly esteemed in our colony, has never in his thirty-five years of ministry received such an insult.</p>
   <p>In deploring the unjustifiable act, we trust that the culprit will be apprehended by the police. The windows will be immediately repaired and the church, which is the pride of the members of the Presbyterian Church of St. John, at present located at 1208 Taylor St., will go on with its activities in spite of vandals.</p>
