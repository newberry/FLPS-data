   <p>At 256 West Grand avenue two Italians have leased a shop, adorned its windows with the legend, "In the Name of Jesus," and painted it entirely in white, lighted it with white lamps, and furnished it with some fifty chairs and a speaker's platform.</p>
   <p>Every other day hundreds of Italians gather there, and strange rumors have been circulated regarding the bizarre ceremonies which are performed there.</p>
   <p>On last Sunday, the 23d, accompanied by some of our friends and co-workers, we went to the mysterious temple and attended the ceremony, disguised as gullible devotees.</p>
   <p>The hall contained about one hundred and fifty persons, half of whom were women, many with small children or nursing infants on their laps.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Howling at the end of the hall was a man about thirty years old, dressed like our laborers and wearing a large, thick, drooping, brown mustache; his face showed the emaciation of tuberculosis, and in his eyes burned the fire of madness.</p>
   <p>His voice had the characteristic hoarseness of the consumptive and at fixed intervals its pitch varied from high to low. He kept reiterating the same eight or ten phrases: "Repent! The eternal chastisement awaits us! God has called us!" and so on, and every sentence was punctuated by the same refrain: "May His holy name be praised!" In the meantime a goodly number in the audience would respond by beating their breasts, sobbing, and howling. Then the old fox would feign inspiration and would shout,"Oh!" several times, shaking his head madly, twisting his torso, and fixing his round, burning, feverish eyes on thoseof one or another of the faithful.</p>
   <p>At the entrance a gigantic fellow stood on guard, whose countenance revealed a mixture of wickedness, stupidity, and brutality.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We noticed during the ceremony that this man had the double task of watching the entrance and of giving volume of sound to the howls of repentance, the sobs, and the inspired prayers of the faithful.</p>
   <p>The whiteness of the bare walls, the white lights, the extraordinary heat of the stove, the air foul with the breath of the sick and the stench of filthy, heated garments, the cadence of the orator's voice, the incessant monotony of his shouting and that of his victims,- everything put together was affecting our nerves and making us realize with horror, by how powerful a hypnotic spell that gathering of unfortunate semi-illiterates must be bound.</p>
   <p>At the end of his effusions the speaker asked everybody to kneel on the stone floor, and he turned his back to the audience. Having intoned a prayer, he announced that the meeting was over and asked all to leave except the initiate. Two of us reporters mingled with these and remained.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>What a scene! Again we listened to shouts and the howls of the tubercular invalid, which were gradually augmented by the cries of the audience. "May His holy name be praised!" was repeated again and again.</p>
   <p>Then a young man about twenty years old leaped to his feet, his face drawn with epilepsy. He began to twist his body and to shout unintelligible words, in the midst of which he would interpolate the phrase so often repeated by the speaker--"May His holy name be praised!"</p>
   <p>A woman who for a whole hour had been sitting in silence next to me fell down and indulged in contortions like those of a serpent.</p>
   <p>A white-haired old man with an idiotic expression was shaking his head at the ceiling and praying that the Holy Ghost would visit him also.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Here lay a girl in a faint, there a man in convulsions; everywhere the wailing of children. Above all the noise rose the persistent, shrill, maddening refrain of the tubercular leader: "May His holy name be praised!"</p>
   <p>We could endure it no longer. We suggested to the mad or crafty villain that he call a doctor for the ailing persons. He replied that they were not ill, but that the Holy Ghost had entered their bodies!</p>
   <p>When we insisted and raised our voices, a group of furious and excited women interfered, which made it necessary for us to leave. Otherwise we should have had to defend ourselves against the demented and the diseased.</p>
   <p>Outside we suggested to a policeman that he attend to the matter. He replied that he could do nothing.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Moreover, two weeks ago a laborer gave to this exhorter at 256 West Grand avenue, the sum of four hundred dollars, which must have represented many a sacrifice. The laborer said that the Holy Ghost had ordered him to do so. Last week another Italian contributed a thousand dollars, likewise commanded by the Holy Ghost.</p>
   <p>We have vowed to unmask this fraud and to care for the sick, whether they are willing or not.</p>
   <p>However, let our comrades take note of how much work there is to be done for those who are willing to do it.</p>
