   <p>The echo of the spiritual message transmitted by the Pope over the radio to the entire Christian world is still vibrating in the souls of the people, and glowing comments are being made on the deep significance of this great event, which opens a new era in the history of the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>The message was devoutly heard all over the world by civilized and even by barbarous nations.</p>
   <p>For about an hour during the transmission of this message every private house or public place equipped with a radio set was transformed into a temple, and people of all creeds listened reverently to this prodigious voice which, enunciating Latin phrases, seemed to come from another world.</p>
   <p>The millions listening in felt inexpressible emotions. They saw in imagination the progress of the suggestive ceremony in the Vatican City; they beheld Guglielmo Marconi committing to the hands of the Holy Father the marvellous devices of the radio broadcasting station, which the Pope officially inaugurated on this occasion.</p>
   
   <p>A gesture of homage made by science to faith and by faith to science!</p>
