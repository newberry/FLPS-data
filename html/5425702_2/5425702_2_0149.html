   <p>Michele Camo left Chicago last June after making a careful getaway with all the deposits of the Banca d'Italia. He conducted a grocery store at 737 Taylor St. under the name of Banca d'Italia. There were always simpletons who, despite their past experience, did not hesitate to entrust their savings to this dishonest grocery owner as if he were a Rothschild or a Morgan.</p>
   <p>This was the result. One day last June, the supposed bank remained closed, and a group of depositors who gathered around the door, did not have the satisfaction of even seeing Como leave.</p>
   <p>However, he had the impudence to return and quietly live in Chicago under the assumed name of Michele Postorici. Detectives Riccio and De Vito discovered the real reason for the bank failure when they took him by surprise one day while he was playing cards at 943 W. Taylor St. It is believed that he defrauded the depositors of $10,000.</p>
   <p>The first one to appear against him was Luigi Manganaro, who claimed to have deposited one hundred and sixty dollars ($160).</p>
