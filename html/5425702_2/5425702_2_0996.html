   <p>Mr. Consul:</p>
   <p>What is happening in our colony compels me to reveal to you, in chronological order, the actual events taking place.</p>
   <p>These events are of such importance that they cannot be overlooked; as you know, the public should know the truth and should not be deceived as was the case when the Italian newspapers of Chicago, without knowledge of the real facts, filled various columns with incorrect statements, foolishness, and lies.</p>
   <p>Two or three weeks ago, the American newspapers made much ado over the news that the Italian Government, through its representative, Count G. Bolognesi, had rented a four-story building and furnished it with thirty beds, so that the poor people of our colony who are without any resources, could be sheltered and fed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We are not interested in the American press, but we would like to talk about the Italian newspapers. Do you think, Mr. Consul, that they are interested in protecting our honor and dignity? Certainly not. If they were, they would not say so much about the Lodging House.</p>
   <p>Why don't the newspapermen personally investigate the facts before writing their long articles? In expressing their own opinions to the public it is necessary that they be well informed, and aware of what they want to publish; we are sure that if they had followed our advice, they would not have printed so many lies, lies which are damaging our colony.</p>
   <p>Since it appears that we are lacking in honest newspapermen, I will assume the task and will try to do my best. Aroused by the curiosity to see the celebrated Lodging House established by the Italian Government through its representative in this city, last Friday I went in search of that welfare institution; but I could not find it-because it was not located on the street announced by the newspapers. The next day, Saturday, I finally found it-not on Little Street-but at 802 Centre Avenue-now Racine Avenue-.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It is not a four-story but a three-story building, and not all three floors are occupied by our indigent countrymen: the second and third floors are rented to private families. Thus only one floor, the first, is used for lodging. On this floor were crowded about fifty persons. It was about 10 A. M. when I arrived, and soup was being served. Every one was seated. Two or three were acting as waiters.</p>
   <p>A gentleman, a representative of Count Bolognesi, maintained order. At his request, I informed him that I was an Italian interested in seeing the place, I remained until the end of the meal. Thus I had the opportunity of seeing the quality of the soup that was served. The soup looked like dish water and it contained only a few pieces of broken macaroni of inferior quality. Four or five (wafer-thin) slices of bread completed the meal. Meals are served twice a day: at 10:30 A. M., and at 4:30 P. M. There is an interval of about nineteen (sic) hours between supper and the morning meal of the next day.</p>
   <p>I asked about the beds, and the representative of Count Bolognesi replied that the beds were not ready yet; but he could not tell me the reason. I thought: Perhaps the beds were ordered from a high-grade factory which <span class="page-break">4</span>specializes in high-grade beds, the only kind appropriate for a government shelter.</p>
   <p>The space used as a dormitory is not adequate for the needs, unless they consider the floor as a mattress and the roof as a blanket.</p>
   <p>Poor unfortunates! For two weeks they have lived this life. And all the newspapers are boasting to the public about the wonderful "Lodging House." And do you know why, most illustrious Count? Because you had the wonderful idea of availing yourself of your contact with the clerical gang.</p>
   <p>And before I ask you a few questions I would like to advise the readers and newspapermen of Chicago that they will accomplish a good deed if they will personally investigate [the conditions in the Shelter]. They will verify my contention that it is only a scheme to gain money to fatten those Sisters of the Sacred Heart.</p>
   <p>However, the press said that this Lodging House-not yet operating, incidentally-was financed by the Italian Government (with money collected from unfortunate Italian people); but to-day, subscription lists are being circulated among the Italians for that purpose.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Why do they not make themselves clear? Whose is the responsibility of supporting the Shelter, the Government's, or the colony's? If it is the colony's duty, [we ask,] how many welfare institutions must it support? Do you not think it time to stop such schemes? The colony is financially exhausted already. Who must take care of the shelter, the Italian Women's Society, or the Sisters of the Sacred Heart?</p>
   <p>We do not understand any thing any more. Too much confusion. And all this makes matters worse for the unfortunates in need, and ignorant people, who bite the bait only because some self-styled "Big Shot" makes a financial donation-not for any altruistic sentiment he might have-but only to make himself [favorably] conspicuous.</p>
   <p>You ask for proof? You want to know who these patriotic "Big Shots" are? Anything they have done or are doing, they do to help the priests and nuns, not to help the poor people.</p>
   <p>Ask those "Big Shots," if they ever gave any help to Hull House! And yet this institution has done much more good than all the priests and nuns.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Nine year ago, an Evangelical Mission was on Clark St., and Marquis Petacci was the pastor. During the winter, more than one hundred needy were sheltered and fed there. But the press and the self-styled conspicous people did not pay any attention to that.</p>
   <p>At the Evangelic Church on Polk and Sholto Street, I had the opportunity to notice that the pastor, Mr. Petacci, did not forget to help the poor Italians in need with milk, clothing, shoes, etc. But not one of the "Big-Shots" paid any tribute to Mr. Petacci. Do you understand, Count Bolognesi?</p>
   <p>But when your dear friend Father Gambara is doing a very small deed, you hear much "toad-croaking," and the Royal Consul works hard to bestow upon Father Gambara the Cross of the Crown of Italy.</p>
   <p>In concluding, I beg the Italians of Chicago to co-operate with me, financially and morally, in offering a floral tribute of garlic and onions to our illustrious Count, as a token of our gratitude to the "greatest benefactor" of the Italians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>(Signed) G. Orrico.</p>
