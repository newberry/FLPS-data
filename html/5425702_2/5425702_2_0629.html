   <p>There may be a great deal of room for argument as to whether men make history out of whole cloth, or make it out of conditions they find at hand. The truth will nevertheless remain, that men invariably have a strong influence in the solution of problems to which conditions have given rise, which solution often has its roots primarily in the ideals, ideas, and habits of thought of the man, or men, intent upon solving them. So it comes to pass, that whenever in the course of social events, the leader of a group or nation is gotten out of the way, the policy of that group, or nation, takes on a new and different aspect.</p>
   <p>The presence of Italians in America has given rise to problems of a rather peculiar nature and, therefore, a parallel struggle on the part of the Italians to obviate them. It was immediately discovered, that the social and political status of our co-nationals in America hardly bore any resemblance to the status hitherto enjoyed by them in the world at large and, as a result, within a short time, efforts were put forth by many Italian leaders to organize our people here, and make of them a solid and unified whole.</p>
   <p>The success of the various organizations has varied in proportion to the ability of the leaders and, therefore, one might say without fear or hesitation, that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the size and unity of any of our Italian groups can be well used as a measuring unit of the talent, ability and strength of the people who have led them.</p>
   <p>The Italo-American National Union is unquestionably among the strongest Italian organizations in America, and particularly in the State of Illinois. A list of the most important leaders will explain the growth of this organization and bear out, we feel sure, the assertion already made - Hon. Bernard P. Barasa, C. Vitello, P. Scaduto, V. E. Ferrara, T. H. Landise, Dr. S. Ingrao, C. Balzano, and others.</p>
   <p>The immediate object of this praise-worthy organization was that of uniting as many Italian immigrants, residing here, as conditions would permit and that, regardless of any province or territory whence they might have come. When this task was fairly well under way the organization, through its leaders, began toiling incessantly on the second part of the program, that is to say, the bringing of the younger Italian generation within the common fold.</p>
   <p>A few months ago, therefore, a resolution was passed by the Supreme Council, whose address is the general office of the organization at 8 S. Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois, thereby promoting the formation of juvenile groups within every lodge of the organization already made or to be made. The lodge <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>"Volturno" was the first among them to fall into line and, then, its twin sister "Umberto," No. 20 of Kensington, Illinois, rode the surf under the tireless guidance of F. Gasperini, its president. Within a short time a group of thirty-eight young men, all under eighteen years of age, was organized and a splendid baseball team formed. The necessary funds for the equipment were soon supplied by the Supreme Council, and that group of young Italian athletes was soon launched upon the field of Athenian competition.</p>
   <p>The team of Lodge No. 20 played several games and won four out of seven. It beat the "Volturno" team by a score of three to two, and battled the veterans of the Venetian Union to the losing end of a twelve to nine score.</p>
   <p>Riding on the enthusiastic crest of the baseball season, this group of Italian young men gave a ball on September 26, 1927, in the Venetian Hall at 135 Kensington Avenue and gathered there the very cream of the young girls and boys in the vicinity. The ball, as the rest of their active ties, was a complete success from every point of view; at present a basketball and a football team are well under way for the season of 1928.</p>
   <p>The moving spirit behind all these activities is unquestionably the Supreme <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Council, and particularly the chief officers in charge. They are seizing upon a need created here by the presence of many thousands of our countrymen, and are giving that need the proper solution and attention. A rough and threatening sea might suggest to all the sailors to seek refuge, or get out of the way, but it takes a well trained captain to suggest the right direction.</p>
