   <p>The legislative bodies of this country are in the process of completing an action of lese-humanity. It is the duty of those who hold their liberty in high respect to raise their voices in protest before it is too late. The House has passed the Burnett-Dillingham law, which stipulates that an immigrant must be able to read and write in order to be admitted to this country. It now goes to the Senate, after which it needs only the President's signature. The agitation promoted by the foreign element as well as by the more enlightened American groups promises to develop to a point which may deter this nation from besmirching itself with ineradicable shame. One can understand the desire to exclude persons with criminal records or incurable diseases, but to bar immigrants because of illiteracy for which they are not to blame, while they may possess all the other qualities required to make good citizens, is unpardonable.</p>
   <p>It is evident, that the aim is to exclude quantity rather than quality. This country has room for a billion people, and if to-day there is an excess <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of labor, it is not the fault of labor, but of the baroque system of capitalism, which every so often slows up production because of a slow market, despite the fact that the majority of the people have nothing but the barest necessities.</p>
   <p>And what is the Italian Government doing about it thru its representatives in this country? If the American Government were to forbid the importation of macaroni and wine, perhaps they would be moved to protest or to set up tariff walls on American products. But it affects only the workers, whose flight from Italy and low wages to countries where the wage-standards are much higher is looked upon with disfavor by the Italian Government and the ruling classes, who see in this exodus the reason for the growing independence of the workers who remain behind.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why the Italian Government is not concerning itself with the Burnett-Dillingham bill and is not interested in defeating it.</p>
   <p>America needs all classes of immigration; it needs literates and illiterates, the strong-minded and the strong-armed. The greatness of this nation is due <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to the unrestricted influx of immigration. The harm done by the illiterate immigrant is more than compensated for by his children, who grow up not only literate, but with the perfect American attitude.</p>
   <p>The American people will not be the first to experience the harm done by such foolish laws. Australia has had a similar law for several years and at the present time is preoccupied with the problem of increasing its population, following the example of France and trying to effect an increase in the birthrate.</p>
   <p>We cherish the hope that the Senate and the President will defeat this unjust law and thus allow anybody, even though illiterate, to be admitted to this country.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile we invite our readers to participate in the movement of protest which has already been initiated by filling in the following petition with name and address and sending it to the President of this Republic:</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>To the President of the United States, the Honorable William Howard Taft, Washington, D. C.:</p>
   <p>The undersigned respectfully voices his protest against the so-called Burnett-Dillingham bill, establishing a literary test for the immigrant to this country, since it is not the true test of qualification for the admission of the desirable immigrant.</p>
