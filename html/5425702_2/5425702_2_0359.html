   <p>The Fiume National League is not an institution which will end with the Adriatic Adjustment as some people erroneously believe because of its name. Once the league is enforced, it will remain for some time to come, and its affiliates will become members for life without further payments.</p>
   <p>The name Fiume National League was given to symbolize all the Italian efforts made when there was no national organization strong enough to induce the American politicians to respect the Italian rights in America. The league has done and is doing an excellent job and is attempting to affiliate the Italians into a strong union for the recognitions of their rights in this country.</p>
