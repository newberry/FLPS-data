   <p>p. 4-5. What do we mean by that phrase? There is no doubt but that any normal man or women is cognizant of its meaning, but in order to project a stronger light on what we intend to say in this article, we will briefly explain its true significance.</p>
   <p>The origin of this phrase is, plainly, of a material or physical order. Experience teaches us that when we place a finger in the wound, with some degree of pressure, we feel pain, more or less acute, all according to the amount of pressure. This is the literal meaning of the phrase. But men have given it another meaning of a moral order. When the teacher says to his pupil, "You are not doing your duty," he is doing nothing more than putting "his finger in the wound," that is, he produces disgust, revolt and displeasure in the heart of his pupil who, certainly, is not pleased with the reprimand, much as he may have merited it.</p>

   <p>When Christ harshly attacked the conduct of the Pharisees and called them hypocrites, whitened sepulchres, progeny of vipers and the rest, he was putting "his finger in the wound", and the Pharisees were much afflicted because Christ spoke the truth which always stings. Evil wills to dominate despotically and indisputably. If some one urged by a sense of goodness and justice has to raise his voice against injustice, adultery, drunkenness, pimping, corruption, peculation or immorality in general then a deafening chorus of protest is heard to emerge from the shady depths of the lawless, the degenerate the defrauders and what have you. The bombs begin to explode here and there; the attempts occur with chronometric regularity; and violence reigns everywhere. It is the spirit of hell that breaks with all its fury over the good, the just, and the champions of order, right and duty.</p>

   <p>It is the story of humanity! In the world - there are two forces: the good and the evil. And in the fight neither side is giving any quarter. How many the victims, how many the defeats. The good have succumbed many times but they have also triumphed. But what a price they paid for their victories. Blood will flow in rivers until the good cause triumphs. It is the law of the universe.</p>
   <p>Let us apply these principles to our Italy in this historic period of today. Let us place a hand on the breast and say truth and nothing but the truth. Let us strip ourselves of prejudices, of factional passions. Let each one of us examine the facts and not allow himself to be famished, despised by all. That is history. Can anyone destroy or doubt these facts?</p>

   <p>But let us look at the Italy of today. The apocalyptic vision of pre-fascist Italy has disappeared. The monster of Bolshevism that threatened to devour Italy has been killed. But, by whom? By Fascism whose soul is Benito Mussolini. Yes, that same Mussolini whom many hate, and would like to murder. It is history repeating itself.</p>
   <p>Mussolini has "put his finger in the wound." He is therefore hated by professional intriguers, by the lawless, by the spirits of disorder and dissolution, who enjoy fishing in turbid waters. Let us give, first of all a retrospective look on the pre-Fascist Italy. What a picture of horror forms before our eyes. The political, financial, moral and spiritual disintegration has reduced Italy to a mound of ruins. The factories, offices and mills that are a barometer of Italy's prosperity, are closed. There are wars between brothers and blood flows in streams.</p>

   <p>Poor Italy is reduced to tatters, Italy is weakened. Mussolini desires victory for justice; he wishes to purify that unhealthy area that threatens to suffocate the springs of material, moral, spiritual, financial, civic and political well-being of Italy. Mussolini believes in calling a spade a spade; adultery is adultery, abuse is abuse, fraud is fraud, immorality is immorality. And there is the reason for so much enemity against him.</p>
   <p>What do his enemies say about his absolute control of Italy? They say that he is a cruel dictator. Very well. But does that correspond to facts? Consult those who are on the inside of Italian affairs and can therefore speak with authority. They will tell you that Italy is heading with gigantic strides towards complete regeneration and that it is the only country in Europe where there is order and plethoric blooming of every good initiative.</p>

   <p>Our dear friend, ex-Judge Albert N. Gualano, in an article, which appeared in the February issue of this magazine, wrote the following on this question: "And so arose the Fascist revolution amusing itself by giving castor oil to the bad ones as one does with certain impertinent children. Impetuously and with sublime aspirations it arose to carry light where existed only chaos. Through Duce Benito Mussolini, backed by King Victor, the Third, the regeneration of the people was accomplished. And this people, now, loftily walks as it never had walked in the past, energetically, ardently, sure of the future. While peoples of other races, while muttering over certain small and inevitable imperfections, look on with admiration."</p>
   <p>Ex-Judge Gualano speaks with cognizance of his subject and millions of others do likewise. They have seen things with their own eyes and, freed of passions, sectarianisms and prejudices, they have told the plain, unadorned truth.</p>

   <p>Italy of today has unlimited credit. America and England, the two colossi of international finance, vie with each other in loaning money to Italy. This fact is symptomatic. It means that Italy is moving ahead with confidence in herself. The lira is on a sound financial basis and the ship of state is in full sail. Naturally, we do not pretend that Italy is a heaven on earth. Humanity carries with it the germ of pain. Evil, despite energetic corrective measures, creeps in everywhere.</p>
   <p>It is said that in Italy many are dissatisfied. It could not be otherwise. They who enjoyed the fruits without the labor, blaspheme Fascism because it has taken from them their easy living as Gualano says in his article. Others blaspheme because they have lost the freedom of writing their improprieties and bestialities for the newspapers. But their motives cover them with ridicule.</p>

   <p>Let us consider Italy as a whole. Then we shall see a work of Titans that is being accomplished, incessantly and inexorably. Against the horizon there is outlined a greater Italy, respected and feared. The defects are no more than shadows that give bolder relief to the silhouette.</p>
   <p>There is the Italy of Mussolini; beautiful, prosperous, robust, filled with energy and filled with faith in itself, that securely treads the path to a future filled with glory.</p>
   <p>The numerous groups of enemies is an infallible proof of its high value. All the noblest enterprises have had their implacable enemies. It is the law of the universe. Even Christ was not excepted from that law. More glory, therefore, to our great Duce Mussolini who fearlessly could put "his finger in the wound" at the opportune moment. Italy is in good hands. May God keep a vigil over its destinies, present and future.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova.</p>
