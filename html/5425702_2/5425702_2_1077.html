   <p>Mr. Serritella started as a newsboy and attained early recognition as a leader. He served many years as president of the Chicago Newsboy Association. He is renowned for his interest in the welfare of the people who live in his district and particularly popular because of his energies devoted to the relief of the unemployed, the widows, children and others in distress. Mr. Serritella wears a happy smile and possesses an amiable disposition. These attributes are doubtless contributory to his many friendships. He is now our capable city sealer.</p>
