   <p>Last Saturday, it became known that the committee of the Board of Education, which names public schools, has reconsidered the naming of the Giuseppe Garibaldi School, located on Polk Street, because of the insinuations made by Rev. Dunne, priest of the Italian Church of the Custodian Angel, on Forquer Street. Rev. Dunne and Mrs. O'Keefe, of the Board of Education, state that the Italian people prefer Michael Angelo's name to G. Garibaldi's.</p>
   <p>Oscar Durante, the editor of L'Italia, and his colleagues of the Trans-Atlantic, denied the possibility of such a monstrosity. They accused Rev. Dunne and Mrs. O'Keefe of bad-faith because they are not Italians and have no interest in Italian patriots.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education has delayed the decision for two more weeks.</p>
