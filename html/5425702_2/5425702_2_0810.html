   <p>The Italo-American National Union of Chicago, a really patriotic and beneficent organization, which for the last thirty years has distinguished itself for its fruitful activities, is once again answering to the appeal made by Italy to the Italians living over seas.</p>
   <p>This worthy gift is an act of spontaneous generosity and patriotism, and was the result of a resolve made at the meeting of the presidents of all lodges after pondering the best ways to help the mother country.</p>
   <p>The sum subscribed by our organization will be paid in five years at the rate of $3,000 a year, and we promise to pay because we are sure of the patriotism of our brother members. In New York and all the East there have been organized special committees and through the efforts of the local press and the various societies, they have already collected remarkable sums.</p>
   
   <p>We of the Middle West, and, especially of Chicago, will show that in our community our organization is second to none.</p>
   <p>Italy, the Duce, and the Royal General Consul of Chicago are expecting much from us and we will try to give much. The eyes of the world are on Italy. The eyes of Chicago are on us. Give in the name of our mother country and our self respect.</p>
