   <p>Our friend V. E. Ferrara, general treasurer of the Italo-American National Union, was recently appointed correspondent-agent for students from the State of Illinois in residence at the Royal University of Perugia.</p>
   <p>This renowned University has for its object the diffusion in foreign countries of the language, literature, history, art, and science of our great Italy.</p>
   <p>We are sure that Mr. Ferrara will discharge this new duty with the same skill and competence which he manifests in all his other activities.</p>
