   <p>President Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>White House, Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>In the name of thousands of Italians, loyal citizens of this democratic nation that will save the world from all injustice, despotism, and militarism, we beg you to consider that one of the best industrial resources of Italy is the exportation of wine.</p>
   <p>The same Italy which surprised the world by her heroism, sacrifice for the common cause of liberty and democracy, will suffer in consequence more than any other country, if the Prohibition Bill passes; because her economic resources are very limited.</p>
   <p>As the production of wines requires neither coal nor food stuffs, we earnestly ask you to allow the manufacture and sale of wines.</p>
   <p>Hoping your response will be in favor of our plea, we are proud to offer our fidelity to our country and our President.</p>
   <p>(N. B. This letter was sent in the name of the Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago to all presidents of all Italian societies.)</p>
