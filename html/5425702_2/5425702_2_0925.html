   <p>If today the Italian flag splendidly flies over the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, on La Salle Street and Jackson Boulevard, together with the Allied flags, we should be thankful for the initiative of one of our countryman, Mr. Frank Smeriglio, living at 625 South Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>Last week, Mr. Frank Smeriglio going to the bank on business noticed with regret that while the French and British flags were flying opposite that of the American flag, the Italian flag was missing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Smeriglio in seeing this, felt offended and went to complain to one of the employes of the bank regarding this matter in the presence of the president of the bank.</p>

   <p>Immediate action was taken in response to the Italian's just request, and the next day the Italian flag was also flying on a cornice in the bank.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Smeriglio received a letter from the president of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, saying that the bank was glad to fulfill his request which means so much to the Italians of this city.</p>
