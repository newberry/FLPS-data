   <p>Many Italians were detained at home because of the rain from attending Garibaldi's Commemoration held last Saturday evening at the Hull House.</p>
   <p>The valorous band, Regina Elena, directed by Mr. Luigi Quglia, started from 133 Ewing Street, towards the Hull House playing the Garibaldi hymn and leading a throng of people. The commemoration took place in the Women's Club Hall.</p>
   <p>The hall was decorated with flowers. The Italian flag crossed with the American flag on the platform in back of Garibaldi's bust, loaned by Mr. Oscar Durante, editor of L'Italia.</p>

   <p>The public that attended Garibaldi's Commemoration consisted not only of Italians, but also of Americans, Rumanians, French, English, and Greeks.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Galvani, Singer Sewing Machine agents, sent thousands of small fans to be distributed among the crowd that attended this great feast.</p>
   <p>Through the care of the committee, five hundred copies of the Garibaldi's hymn were distributed among the crowd. Mr. Marchese delivered a beautiful speech on the life of Garibaldi.</p>
   <p>This great evening ended with a dance which lasted until midnight.</p>
