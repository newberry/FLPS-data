   <p>Tomorrow the 16th, the Mission of the Italian Catholic Church of Assumption, on Illinois and Market Street, will begin its services and will continue for one week with sermons both day and night. Two Italian Missionaries will conduct the services. We hope that every Italian in this city will attend. It has been several years since the last Italian Mission was held in this city. So please leave your temporary affairs and come to the Mission.</p>
   <p>This is the last opportunity to prepare yourselves for Easter, by making a good confession and being prepared for Holy Communion.</p>
