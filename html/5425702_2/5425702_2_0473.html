   <p>The space of Barber Street, in between Union and Desplaines Sts. is blocked by a huge alter, erected by the Italians for the Feast of Saint Rosary. The altar which is illuminated by hundreds of electric lights, is fifty feet tall. Two hundred and fifty dollars were spent for its construction. It was projected by Mr. Antonio Stangarone.</p>
