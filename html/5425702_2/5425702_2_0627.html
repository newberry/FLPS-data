   <p>The Central Committee of the Boy Scout Organization is raising $225,000 for the work which is needed in Chicago. To help in this we were very glad to have with us on February 5, at 10 A. M., in the St. John's Church a fine group of Scouts under the leadership of their Scoutmaster Lavern Herbert. It was a great pleasure to have Mr. Herbert give us in concrete form the work and program of our Garibaldi Troop. He also introduced Anthony Antonelli and August Fiorini who both spoke in very good style telling us how scouting is helping them, and referring to the Scout oath which we may sum up in the following points:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>1. Duty to God and Country.</p>
   <p>2. Social obligation to other people.</p>
   <p>3. Mental development.</p>
   <p>4. Physical development based upon clean living and regard for laws of health.</p>
   <p>We are glad to have had the opportunity to have these boys with us and hope they will come often. All the young people of our community, boys and girls, are always welcome at the services of St. John's Church. The offering of the morning amounted to $16.99 which was sent to the Scout Central Committee. Allow me to congratulate through the Streak the boys who were with us, for their fine spirit, ability and manliness.</p>
   <p>God bless you all!</p>
