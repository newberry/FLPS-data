   <p>Italian Church Burned.</p>
   <p>Last Monday, February 26, 1900, 8 P. M., the Maria St. del Carmine Church, 69th and Page streets was completely destroyed by fire. People cannot understand why the church was locked from 4 P. M. that day. The church and the belongings were insured for $3,000 and the parishoners may rest assured that their church will soon be rebuilt.</p>
