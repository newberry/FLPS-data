   <p>As we mentioned in an earlier edition, the agitation against the proposed Burnett Literacy Test Bill has made itself felt in Washington, nor has it abated with the passing of time. Messages protesting against the passage of the bill have been sent to congressmen from all districts.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Italian Colony, the publisher of L'Italia - who is a member of the committee recently formed for the purpose of going to Washington to solicit Wilson's help on the question of freer immigration - last Monday, sent two messages to Congressmen Madden and Sabath, asking that they use their influence and prestige, in the defeat of the bill. The message read as follows:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>January 12, 1914</p>
   <p>Congressman Martin A. Madden</p>
   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   
   <p>As a constituent of yours, I feel that I voice the sentiments of my friends, neighbors and townspeople in asking you to refrain from voting in favor of the Burnett Literacy Test Bill. My reason for asking you is that, if the bill is enacted into law, it will bar from our heretofore hospitable shores the honest and sturdy people still so sorely needed for the development of our immense resources.</p>
   <p>Oscar Durante,</p>
   <p>Editor of L'Italia,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Congressman Madden answered as follows:</p>
   <p>First District of Illinois,</p>
   <p>House of Representatives, U. S.</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>January 13, 1914.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oscar Durante</p>
   <p>Editor L'Italia</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   
   <p>Dear Mr. Durante:</p>
   <p>I am in receipt of your telegram protesting against the passage of the Burnett Immigration Bill.</p>
   <p>I beg to say in reply, that I am opposed to the enactment of this bill into law. I have always stood against the literacy test in all immigration legislation and shall do all I can to prevent the enactment of the bill when it comes up before the House.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Martin B. Madden.</p>
