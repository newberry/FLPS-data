   <p>It is a great pleasure to us, to hear that in the House of Correction, with 1,200 inmates of nearly every nationality, there is not one Italian.</p>
   <p>This good news was given to us by the Rev. Father Paolo Ponziglione during a recent visit to that institution.</p>
   <p>We wish to call this fact to the attention of our American friends who are always ready to speak ill of the Italians.</p>
   <p>If all the other nationalities could point to as good a record, the authorities of this City could consider themselves very fortunate.</p>
