   <p>The Italian societies and political clubs of this city will meet Sunday afternoon at 2:30 P.M. in Smith's Hall at Hull House, on Polk and Halsted streets, to appoint a committee to raise funds for the defence of the two Italians, Ettore and Giovannetti, held in the Lawrence, Mass. prison, for the protection of the workers of that city during a riot.</p>
   <p>That justice may be done to a countryman, we ask every Italian to take a part in this good work, so that the gates of prison may open for these two innocent Italians.</p>
