   <p>In the hands of the Treasurer, February 29, 1916.....$9,620.75</p>
   <p>Of the above sum we can show that everything spent was for absolute necessities.</p>
   <p>We feel obliged to speak with admiration of the women of this committee, who went out to collect bundles of clothing, in the bitter-cold month of December, with a success surpassing all expectations. Certainly, the thought of our brothers in war who were suffering at the same time, gave them courage to help relieve that suffering.</p>
   <p>Chicago, March 15, 1916</p>
   <p>Signed: Mr. Attilio D'Ammadia, 2347 W. 25th Street,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Consiglia Bartolomei; Mr.Guiseppi Malato.</p>
