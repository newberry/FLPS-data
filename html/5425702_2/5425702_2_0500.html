   <p>Mr. P.R. De Carlo,</p>
   <p>Editor, Vita Nuova,</p>
   <p>1111 Blue Island Ave.,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Carlo:</p>
   <p>Unfortunately and by mishap, a publication of which you are the editor has fallen into my possession. I have, for some time been familiar with your work having heard of you from many Evangelists who know something of your qualities.</p>
   <p>But since I read the March-April issue of your Vita Nuova, in which appears your article "The Eternal Question," I have come to know you very well and I congratulate you since that which you write is worthy of you, Pasquale De Carlo, and I feel it is my duty to write to you the following:</p>
   <p>You say to us, sincere Protestants, that we do not believe that in Italy there exists freedom of religious discussion. You fanatical zealots! We, who know that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the contrary exists, that Italy does not have religious freedom, call you, and those who think like you, Parasites.</p>
   <p>Let us agree for your sake, that the concordat between Papacy and Fascism gave to the Papacy only a small state insignificant as to size, but, that which the Church of Rome in the 1116 years of its temporal power, could not obtain by excommunication or force of arms from princes, jealous of the political independence of their states, has been obtained from a ruffian who holds an entire nation in slavery and derives his power from infamous acts to execrable betrayal.</p>
   <p>This lying and ignorant despot who, by right, belongs in an insane asylum, raises his squat and obscene figure, against civilization, freedom and the progress of the century to place on the head of the gagged and conquered Italian people the leaden hood of the theological code of the Council of Trent in 1545.</p>
   <p>You say that faith must be sincerely felt, bravo Mr. De Carlo, tell me frankly, have you ever had sincere faith? Tell me, why has "hero" Mussolini, whom you laud, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>accepted and imposed on the Italian people in the twentieth century, that canonical law, so conceived and decreed that even the Spanish Inquisition refused to ever recognize it? He surely did not do it to give the Protestants the freedom of spreading the Gospel and create that faith in the hearts of men.</p>
   <p>For us, sincere Evangelists (you are excepted) the fall of the temporal power signified the crowning event of the "Risorgimento" and the fight for national unity. It signified the beginning of an era the sum and principles of which were liberty, equality and justice.</p>
   <p>No, instead, through the efforts of this miserable and many times criminal Mussolini, the Pope is, not only sovereign of an "insignificant" State, as you say, but also the spiritual father of the Italians through the observance of that canonical law, Again, Mr. De Carlo, do you consider the obligatory teaching of the false Catholic religion in the schools, freedom of worship in Italy - the fatherland of Bruno, Cavour, Garibaldi, Mazzini, Mameli, Cairolo, Savonarola?</p>
   <p>Come, come, Mr. De Carlo, tell me honestly, how much do you receive each month from the Fascist party for printing such lies and for calling sincere followers of Christ like us, fanatics, I ask you, "Can a mule give birth to Lambs?"</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>You refer us to the writings of the "Valdese Romano." What can it or any other paper published in Italy, say? Does a press exist in Italy? No! and if it does not exist, how can an Evangelical review express itself freely? Have you seen a single word contrary to the Concordat in the newspapers coming from Italy even in an Evangelical review?</p>
   <p>No, they cannot do it, and if they did, a prison or an island concentration camp would be their lot. Therefore, whatever we receive and read from Italy is only that which is allowed to be printed and not the truth. Remember, in Italy tyranny rules and the things which they write are the things which tyranny permits.</p>
   <p>If I say that you are false and that you are spreading falsehoods, it is because I can prove it.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, March 22, in an Evangelical Church of this city, a brother member, recently returned from Italy, where he had gone in the autumn of last year, gave a talk. This man, because of the vile and prostitute Italian press of North America was a Fascist. While in Italy he visited Rome and many other cities.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Wherever he found himself he visited the Church, of which he was a member of thirty year's standing. He asked no one's opinion as to the position of the Evangelical Church nor to what extent it was allowed to proselyte. He said the faith is in the hearts of our brothers. He made the statement that to our religion, proselyting is not permitted. I cannot repeat his talk word for word, all I can say is, that though he was a Fascist when he went over, he returned an Anti-Fascist, According to him, the Protestant Religion in Italy, thanks to the government which you so highly praise, finds itself in the position of a smuggler who attempts to enter his country between two rows of Internal Revenue men. And you say that there is freedom? For shame, "Iscariot!"</p>
   <p>His statements were verified last week by that mountebank, Barzini, of the Corriere, who said:</p>
   <p>"The Resto Del Carlino observes that the progagandists of the Methodist Church travel the country districts carrying a permit, ostensibly, to sell cakes and caramels, but actually they pass out religious tracts. The newspaper concludes the article by saying: that these distributors of sweets run the risk of a beating at the hands of these husky peasants after they have accepted and eaten the sweets.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The provocation of the courteous Bolognese newspaper against the propagandists of the Methodist Church is on a par with the "most noble" doctrine of the reformers of Italy who it seems are inspired by the maxim: "abuse and thrash."</p>
   <p>Do you see, De Carlo, how free is the discussion of our religion which, in order to propagate it, places our brothers (you are excepted, because I repeat, you are a parasite) under much risk?</p>
   <p>Mr. De Carlo, it is a great shame to know that you are an Evangelist but so was Judas an Apostle of our Lord, Jesus Christ. He betrayed the Lord for thirty pieces of silver. You are an Evangelist who is paid for being that, but it would not surprise me to know that you would betray thirty Christs for one piece of silver.</p>
   <p>Your work is well known and registered, the day of reckoning will come and you shall receive the reward you deserve.</p>
   <p>For Truth, Justice and Freedom,</p>
   <p>The Protestant, Ettore Chiarini,</p>
