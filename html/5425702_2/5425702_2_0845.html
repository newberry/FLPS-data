   <p>Mr. Carnovale sends us the following letter.</p>
   <p>My dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I have been told that my name was among those listed in the program as expected at the banquet in honor of Generalissimo Diaz on Sunday evening, November 20, 1921, at the Congress Hotel.</p>
   <p>This is strange, for the simple reason that I have not authorized anybody to use my name. Moreover, I was not in a position to authorize anybody, because no one had invited me to join the committee which was to plan the festivities, nor was I invited to the banquet given in honor of the Generalissimo.</p>
   <p>Still further, I hold my principles dearer than life itself.</p>
   <p>Concluding, my name has been used without my knowledge or permission, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>although I feel sure that the person who used it intended only to honor me.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Luigi Carnovale</p>
