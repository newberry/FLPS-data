   <p>In Judge Landis' court the trial of the officials of the Pan Motor Company has begun.</p>
   <p>They are accused of using the mails to defraud. The selection of a jury and the examining of the witnesses will take several weeks.</p>
   <p>District Attorney Charles Clyne is arguing for the government, and the defendants are defended by lawyers from New York, St. Paul, and Chicago.</p>
   <p>The main defendant is Samuele Pandolfo, president of the firm, who maintains that this is not more than persecution of business competitors.</p>
   <p>The swindled clients are mostly Italian laborers. We shall keep you informed of the proceedings.</p>
