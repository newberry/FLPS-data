   <p>The honors our colony pay as a tribute to the great sailor.</p>
   <p>The Italian colony of Chicago will celebrate Columbus Day this year with its customary enthusiasm, and in an even more dignified and genteel way.</p>
   <p>This year the energies of our colony have gathered around the powerful organization of the Unione Siciliana to celebrate in a sumptuous banquet, the great day of October 12th.</p>
   <p>The parade will also take place but within smaller proportions.</p>
   <p>The banquet will take place Sunday in the largest hall of the Sherman Hotel. The Italian Consul, Conte Guilio Bolognesi, will be among the thousands of guests expected to attend.</p>
   <p>All leading members of our colony will be there. The hall will be decorated with the Italian and American flags. There will be an orchestra to entertain. The program will follow with commemorative speeches made by the most prominent Italians of the colony. The banquet will take place at 7 P. M.</p>
   <p>Following an old tradition the Stella D'Italia will also celebrate this great day with an imposing banquet. So as not to conflict with the banquet of the UNione Siciliana, Stella D'Italia Society has decided to celebrate Columbus Day a day later, October 13th, with a banquet in Louis XVI Room at the Sherman Hotel, at 6 P.M. An orchestra will play Italian hymns. The program will include several speeches on this occasion.</p>
   <p>The parade in which the Italian societies will take part will be held Sunday from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M.</p>

   <p>At 10 A.M. they will parade down Halsted Street to Jackson Boulevard and Jackson Boulevard to Michigan Avenue to 14th Street, then marching back to Randolph Street and Michigan Avenue, and there the parade will scatter.</p>
