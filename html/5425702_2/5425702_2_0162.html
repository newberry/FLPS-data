   <p>Last Sunday in Denver, Colorado a priest was killed by an Italian, who boasted of being an anarchist.</p>
   <p>The following Monday, an American newspaper of Chicago published an interview with Rev. Angelucci of the Church of the Assumption, Chicago, which contained insinuations against the anti-clerical Giordano Bruno Club, and against a Chicago Italian newspaper.</p>
   <p>All other American newspapers except those of the Honorable Hearst, the American and the Herald &amp; Examiner, handled this argument with much fury against us and the Club, and were aided by insinuating remarks made by Father Dunne which are unjust. We do not want to lower ourselves by arguing the point. We only say that that responsibility rests with the Giordano Bruno Club.</p>
