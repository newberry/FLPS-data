   <p>Next Monday the Italian Consul of Chicago, Giulio Bolognesi, one of the most prominent figures among Italian representatives is leaving for Italy. He has gained for himself, during the eight years of his stay in Chicago, great popularity. Count Bolognesi has been away from Italy for about six years, all of which was spent in the United States, in work that has been entirely dedicated to the Fatherland.</p>
   <p>The results of his activity, represent the only success obtained recently by our government in America. It is incontestable testimony of what a man can accomplish, when he has the intelligence, the faith, and the equanimity of Count Bolognesi.</p>
   <p>He will accompanied by his wife, Countess Rosa Bolognesi. Their stay in Italy is limited to six weeks, which allows them only time enough to visit relatives, and their many friends.</p>
   
   <p>They are thinking of returning to Chicago in the early part of December, when the new problems that require the attention of Count Bolognesi will be tackled with the same enthusiasm.</p>
