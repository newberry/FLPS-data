   <p>A pitiful story is that of Gaetana Vella La Monica, who for the third time has crossed the ocean to live with her children who are citizens of this land of liberty.</p>
   <p>She hoped that her perseverance would win over the severity of the law; but she lost hope when she was compelled to go back to Italy.</p>
   <p>She is a divorced woman who came to the United States with her parents at the age of fifteen. She stated that her father was an American citizen but unfortunately his citizenship papers were lost. When her father, Joseph Vella, died in New Jersey she married a man who was not a citizen. Then she divorced him and after the divorce her husband became an American citizen.</p>

   <p>She had three children, Jenny, seven; Frances, six years; and Joseph, four years; all born in the United States.</p>
   <p>She went to Italy and when she came back to America she found the door closed, because somebody reported her divorce to the authorities. Therefore she was sent back to Italy. Last January she tried again to enter the United States, but she failed in her attempt and, as we said before, she was compelled to go back to Italy. Laws are laws and must be respected. But in a case like that of Mrs. La Monica we do not think that the law would suffer if a mother were permitted to join her children.</p>
   <p>The laws of nature and of the heart should be above human laws and we feel this poor mother, who made so many sacrifices, should be allowed to join and live happily with her children.</p>
