   <p>Session opened at 3:30 p. m. Minutes of the last meeting read and approved. Mr. Canini read the following telegram sent to President Wilson regarding the Dillinghan Bill which seeks to restrict immigration.</p>
   <p>The President, White House,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>We respectfully appeal to you to veto the Dillinghan Bill restricting immigration on a percentage basis, which would be injurious to our country for it would shut our gates to a large number of men and women who might become one of best elements in the population of the United States, while it would leave them open to many coming here with the intention of overthrowing our institutions and form of government. Chicago Italian Chamber of Commerce: Bragno, president; Canini and Formusa, vice presidents; Rigali, treasurer; De Grazia, attorney.
