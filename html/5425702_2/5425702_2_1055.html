   <p>The Italian Consul and the Society di Ricigliano.</p>
   <p>The Italian Consul has for three consecutive times refused the invitation of the Societa Operaia di Ricigliano to take part in the program contemplated in honor of the king's birthday, March 14.</p>
   <p>And why was the invitation refused? Because the Consul says the society insulted him. Yes, the society insulted him by holding a mass meeting on Sept. 20 of the past year, protesting against slurring remarks and acts made by the Consul's friends. As far as we know, the facts are as stated. Which is right we will not say until we have investigated more thoroughly the accusations of both.</p>
   <p>At the request of mutual friends and out of respect for an office representative of Italy, in our city, we forswore our campaign against the Consul, but now if the facts previously stated are true, that the society did graciously invite the Consul to join them in honoring such a patriotic day and that the Consul summarily refused, we will be forced to re-open our fight against him in the interest of the Colony and its institutions.</p>
