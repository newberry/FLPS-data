   <p>The election of the three delegates to represent the Italian Colony of Chicago in Rome, took place at the last meeting of the executive council of the local committee for the Colonial Congress in Rome.</p>
   <p>The following three were chose: Mr. Giuseppe Mirabella, Mr. Olindo Mariotti, and Mr. Oscar Durante. The first two have accepted, but Mr. Durante's business does not permit him to leave the United States during the Fall Season. The executive council will therefore have to choose another representative.</p>
