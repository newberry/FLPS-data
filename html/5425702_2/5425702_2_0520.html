   <p>A useful organization is the Political and Catholic Club, which is supported by a thousand Italian families and is making progress in settling disputes among the parishioners of San Callisto's Church.</p>
   <p>A committee submitted its reports to Judges Francis Allegretti and Philip Finnegan at the general meeting of February 26.</p>
   <p>On the basis of these reports Cardinal Mundelein promised to send a new Italian pastor to San Callisto's Church on DeKalb Street.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to organize a reception to welcome the new pastor, thus ending all disputes and controversies that were detracting from the good name of the Italians.</p>
   <p>Judge Allegretti, president of the Holy Name Society, deserves praise for being a real friend of the organization and for his interest in settling disputes.</p>
