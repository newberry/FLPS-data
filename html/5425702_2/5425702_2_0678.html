   <p>Big-bellied Taft has finally done something just. He has vetoed the law forbidding entry to illiterate immigrants.</p>
   <p>This proposed law had passed the House and the Senate; only Taft's signature was needed, and he placed his veto upon it.</p>
   <p>According to the Constitution the presidential veto can be overruled by a two thirds majority vote in the House and the Senate.</p>
   <p>The vote in the Senate was in favor of the bill more than the required two thirds, but in the House it lacked five of the necessary number.</p>
   <p>We are not at all partial to the autocratic presidential veto, but in this case we feel that it has been useful.</p>
