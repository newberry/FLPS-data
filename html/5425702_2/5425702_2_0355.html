   <p>On August 7, the Fiume Society, a national league for Italian citizens, was incorporated under the state laws of Illinois. The purpose of the organization is to increase the force and prestige of the Italian people and to give the Italian voters the influence and respect they deserve because of their ability and number. The Fiume was selected because it represents the symbol of glory and honor.</p>
   <p>The members of this league are to pay $1 and will receive an artistically designed certificate, the work of the Italian artist, Ceasare Benvenuti, and a button on which is written the word, "Fiume."</p>
   <p>Italians who wish to become a member of the National Fiume League, call or write to the temporary president, Mr. Cairoli Gigliotti, 105 W. Monroe Street.</p>
