   <p>Sunday afternoon, while a furious storm was raging, the patriotic entertainment, prepared by the Circolo Italiano of Chicago, a branch of the National Dante Alighieri Society of Rome, took place in the Auditorium of the Hull House. $120 was the amount raised by the raffle of an artistic vase.</p>
   <p>The Counsul and his wife, Count and Countess Rozwadowski arrived there an hour early to ascertain that all preparations had been made. After a short, but appropriate speech made by Count Spagiari, Mr. Gualano, a lawyer, made a beautiful speech, regarding the brave Italian soldiers, who, at present, are giving their lives in the Italian provinces of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.</p>

   <p>Mr. Gualano seemed to know just how to put that certain touch of Italian patriotism, and his speech was applauded greatly.</p>
   <p>The Dante Alighieri Club is to be congratulated for the wonderful success of this celebration.</p>
