   <p>If Garibaldi could have arisen from his grave and seen how he was profaned by the commemoration which the Italian officials of Chicago celebrated today, Alas! how he would have laughed.</p>
   <p>For two months previous to the recurrence of the centenary, the two Italian weeklies, L'Italia and La Tribuna, under the auspices of the Italian Consul Sabetta, proclaimed this celebration with soundings of trumpets inviting all Italians to participate.</p>
   <p>A meeting was held in Lincoln Park at the foot of Garibaldi's Statue. Early in the morning the members of our Socialist branch, who did not participate in that celebration, believing it better not to mingle with such dumb sheep, betook themselves to the Garibaldi monument to lay on it a wreath of red flowers on which was written, "The International is the Sun Rise of the Future."</p>

   <p>The Italian Socialists of Chicago not very long after our ceremony was ended, hung an effigy on the statue by means of a ribbon with a sward-like wreath.</p>
   <p>Poor Lion of Caprera!</p>
