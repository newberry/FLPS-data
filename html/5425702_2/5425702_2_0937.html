   <p>No praise could sufficiently describe the patriotism of the Italians in Chicago and vicinity. The appeal made by us to help victims of the Teutonic invasion,finds every Italian prepared to help. New contributions keep arriving every day, thus proving that the Italians, with their strong attachment for their mother country cannot remain indifferent to the painful cry that comes from the Venetian territory.</p>
   <p>Rich and poor animated by a great faith in the supreme destiny of Italy, rival one another in the extension of assistance and it is certain that even as in the past our colony will know how to achieve first place in this relief, always on guard to lighten the suffering of these Venetian fugitives.</p>
   <p>The offerings, which we received are representative of the sentiments that are in the hearts of our loyal compatriots.</p>
