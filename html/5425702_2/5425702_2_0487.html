The R. Consul presided and Mr. Borletti, secretary for the "Commercial House," and Attorney Trivisonni, secretary of the "White Hand" acted as temporary secretaries.</p>
   <p>The assembly deliberated the following points: The forming of a legal committee of presidents and delegates of all the adherent societies. The committee will be formed of twenty members nominated by the R. Consul and by the Region Consular Agents depending on the district of Chicago. The following were nominated: Lawyer Barasa, Mr. Bonelli, from Cleveland, Ohio, Mr. Costa, Mr. Capera from Cleveland, Ohio, Mr. Oscar Durante, Mr. Garibaldi John, Lawyer Gualano, Mr. Gugliotta di.

   <p>3. That three delegates be forwarded to Rome at their own expense, and if unable to do so, a voluntary contribution will be raised among the members. Other delegates may inquire, and then determine, whether or not they go at their own expense.</p>
   <p>4. That the office, printing, and other expenses be taken care of by the society and adherent members with an contribution which will soon be established.</p>
   
   <p>Delegates of several societies that were considering this contribution discussed the subject for a long length of time.</p>
   <p>The meeting finally came to the following decisions: From Mr. Di Cupua, that the R. Consul, Chal. Sabetti, be elected president of the Central Committee. From Mr. Sante Varco, a vote of thanks and greeting for the wonderful way the R. Consul carried on his work in the assembly. From Mr. Gazzola, a brotherly salute and greeting for the out-of-Chicago representatives present at the assembly.</p>
   <p>The meeting finally ended at 5:30 p. m. with the agreement that the temporary secretaries would take charge of the work, until the offices for the elected committee would be constructed.</p>
