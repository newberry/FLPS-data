   <p>Through the efforts of the Italian Chamber of Commerce and the Order Sons of Italy in Chicago, an Italian-American student was given the opportunity to make an educational tour of Italy with a group of Italian-Americans chosen by the various state orders of this organization throughout America. The tour is sponsored by the Supreme Council of the Order Sons of Italy in America and the Italian Chamber of Commerce in New York.</p>
   <p>This year, for special reasons, the contest in Chicago was limited to two people. Contestants in the Chicago area were restricted to members of the Chamber of Commerce or Order Sons of Italy and their families. The Examining Committee composed of three members of the Sons of Italy and two members of the Chamber of Commerce examined Pietro Formusa and Stefano W. Petacci. It chose Pietro Formusa who is now touring Italy.</p>
