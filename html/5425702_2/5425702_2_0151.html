   <p>No more knives or revolvers but rifles are used in the Italian quarters, as in war, to take revenge on their enemies. This discovery was made Tuesday night by police agents of the 22nd street station. Attracted by rifle shots, they found three men seriously wounded, on the ground on Archer Avenue and 21st Street.</p>
   <p>Antonio Cotroneo, 45 years, of 2321 Wentworth Avenue was fatally wounded. In his body were found twelve rifle bullets. The other two were Salvatore Rosa, 25 years of age, of 2321 Wentworth Avenue, who was shot in the right shoulder and in the back, and Salvatore Sahito, 32 years of age, of 2231 Princeton Avenue, who was shot in the left side near the heart and is in a serious condition. The three men were taken to the Peoples Hospital where they were questioned by the police, but refused to answer, saying that they didn't know who did it because they were shot from behind and as it was dark, they could not recognize the persons who shot them. But their eyes had a mean look that said they would pay the enemy back the same way.</p>
