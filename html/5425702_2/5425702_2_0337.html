   <p>On July 13, 1935, an article appeared in the Chicago Daily Tribune, the contents of which, among other things, was meant to convey the meaning that the Order Sons of Italy in America, took over the functions of old Fascist League of North America, that it is a Fascist organization; that it fosters a sort of dual allegiance to this country and Italy; that it stirs up war sentiment and that it promotes Fascist attacks on Ethiopia.</p>

   <p>It is customary before any charges are made that there be a strict investigation conducted free of any bias or prejudice. It is apparent that such was not the case in this particular instance; hence the commission of an injustice.</p>
   <p>Needless to state that if a fair and impartial investigation had been made it would have ascertained that the Order Sons of Italy in America, is a fraternal organization the scope of which, aside from sick and death benefits to its members, is to unite in one family all those of Italian birth or extraction residing in this country, inducing and aiding the non-citizens to become American citizens and to urge them to take an active interest in the civic, social, economic and political affairs of their newly adopted land, thereby bringing to the development of this great nation their highest contribution.</p>

   <p>The investigation would have further brought to light that the Order Sons of Italy in America, in the wisdom of its founders, laid down as a fundamental rule that it should not, as an organization, take sides with any political or religious question respect the political ideas and religious faith of its individual members and that, true to its doctrine, it has fostered and continues to foster American principles and American ideals, tends towards the social amelioration of its members and aims for a better future for the generation to come.</p>
   <p>The investigation would have further ascertained that the Order Sons of Italy in America, from the day it was formed, a little over a quarter of a century ago, (therefore many years prior to the advent of Fascism) has maintained itself true to its program as above outlined, and, that on account of such, thousands upon thousands have come within its folds, thereby making this organization the largest Italian-American organization in America.</p>

   <p>It is extremely unfair and un-American to charge an organization such as ours of fostering a sort of dual allegiance. Such a charge or insinuation questions the loyalty of its members toward this great, glorious union, the United States of America. We strongly resent such, for in time of war, as well as in time of peace, we have shown our fidelity to the land of our adoption and that, as far as we are concerned, we owe allegiance to no country but the United States of America. If to nourish a spiritual attachment to the traditions of one's land of origin or extraction be construed as fostering a part of dual allegiance, then we plead guilty to the charge and in defense, thereto, we state that a person should be proud of the land of his nativity or the land of the nativity of his father and mother. He or she who is not, is not worthy of becoming a citizen of this great country.</p>

   <p>In the name of justice and decency is there any one who could truthfully say that the Order Sons of Italy in America, as an organization, has done a single thing to stir up war sentiment or that it has promoted the Facist attack on Ethiopia?</p>
   <p>Or has there been a single act committed to show that it took over the functions of the old Fascist League of North America, or that it is a Fascist organization? My brother members know that the only answer to such an inquiry is a negative one and the world at large should know the same thing. False the charges or insinuations that have appeared in the article above referred to!</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It may be true that the Italians in Chicago and elsewhere have a certain opinion in reference to the Italian-Abyssinian situation, which opinion they may hold and express aiding their fellow-men without stirring up war sentiment.</p>
   <p>The same holds true of those who direct the destinies of the Chicago Daily Tribune, but by this right and privilege that the Chicago Daily Tribune has, it is not meant that it should have the right to indict 280,000 Italians in Chicago, much less the great American organization known as the Order Sons of Italy in America, of things and matters unbecoming to Americans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The conduct of the Chicago Daily Tribune does not and will not, however, discourage us in our mission to unite under the banner of the Order Sons of Italy in America, all those of Italian birth or extraction residing in this country, but on the contrary it furnishes us with more proof, that a union such as ours is necessary for under it we may combat all the abuses hurled at our people, thereby affirming just rights and privileges for us and our generations to follow.</p>
