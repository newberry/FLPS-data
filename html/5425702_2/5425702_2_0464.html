   <p>Thursday October 12th is the day dedicated by the Columbian Exposition Committee of Chicago to the Italians of America so that they may celebrate officially the memory of Christopher Columbus. We must say that it was very kind of the committee to offer the Italian Colony this day of remembrance to the glory of civilization.</p>
   <p>More than four centuries ago on the 12th of October, Christopher Columbus discovered the American Continent. Thursday is a day of consecration to the Italians. Hurrah! for Columbus, and Hurrah! for the Chicago Exposition. We hope this event will be a success.</p>
