   <p>For forty-six years, twenty-two of them in Chicago, the Rev. Pasquale Riccardi De Carlo has devoted his life to Christian service with the Italians in America. Founder of the Italian Christian Institute, 567 Taylor Street, he began his work in 1914 in the "bloody 19th Ward," pitting his energy and Christian teachings against the crime, superstition, indifference, prejudice and antagonism of this area. The mission was moved westward to 1206 W. Taylor Street in 1919, and became the Garibaldi Institute, one of the most well-known neighborhood houses in the city.</p>
   
   <p>A Story of St. John Presbyterian Institutional Church. (Pamphlet).</p>
   <p>Here a group of Italian men and women organized the St. John Presbyterian Church, buying the present building in 1930 with the aid of the Church Extension Board of the Chicago Presbytery.</p>
   <p>Members of St. John have said of the Rev. Pasquale De Carlo, "As a man of conviction, sincerity, earnestness and consecration, he is a true friend to his little children; he has saved boys from becoming criminals; he has influenced, encouraged, and aided young people to obtain a better education; he has brought peace to many a father and mother through his counsel; and he strives to interpret Christ continuously to all people of all ages."</p>
   <p>The growth and service of this church has been a story of the personality and service of its minister, a religious leader of marked practical philosophy and business acumen, a man of literary training and experience who has been editor of two Italian-American newspapers and a magazine.</p>
   
   <p>For twelve years a field representative of the Church Extension Board of the Chicago Presbytery, and now acting as Superintendent of Garibaldi Institute, as well as minister of St. John Church and the director of its manifold program, this elderly man has won the homage of his people and the respect of business men and denominational leaders.</p>
   <p>SOME GLIMPSES OF LIFE AND WORK AT ST. JOHN.</p>
   <p>Visit with the writer several typical programs at St. John Institutional Church. Throughout the week-day activities, a religious emphasis is the center of all group and personal work of the church staff, and reaches its culmination in the impressive Protestant services in the auditorium, each Sunday morning.</p>
   
   <p>But there is more than a Sunday schedule in this building. Every one present on Sunday is actively engaged in thirty or forty week-day programs.</p>
   <p>FOR THE FAMILY</p>
   <p>In its Family Department, the church interprets the needs and difficulties of hundreds of families in the community to the various relief organizations, securing contacts with clinics, dispensaries, and hospitals, visiting in countless homes each month, and maintaining friendly contacts throughout the community.</p>
   <p>Throughout the week the many organizations meeting in the church include a Junior and Intermediate Choir, a Junior High Choir, a Young People's Choir, as well as music classes and a music library, all provided for Italian young people, who have little opportunity or resources to pursue their musical interests.</p>
   
   <p>Moving from room to room of the church building on any week-day, we see many other practical activities sponsored by this realistic church and its very shrewd Minister, who understands so well the importance of a constructive use of leisure time. It is through these group activities that this church strives to teach the attributes of Christian character and the ways in which boys and girls, men and women, must live and work together.</p>
   <p>FOR BOYS AND GIRLS.</p>
   <p>There are clubs for boys and girls, sewing classes, Camp Fire Girls Scouts; Boy Scouts, music appreciation classes, home economics, manual training groups, carving classes, and other types of activity included in this church's institutional program for its children.</p>
   
   <p>FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</p>
   <p>The nature and quality of many young people's discussion groups, and the significant, serious problems which these Italian young people are considering under the educational leadership of staff members at St. John Church, are revealed in a striking way by a list of topics recently used in a series of discussion meetings of one of these groups:</p>
   <p>"The Advancement of Medicine"; "Vocational Guidance - the Choosing of a Profession"; "Child Psychology - the Care and Training of Children"; "Problems of Youth - Youth Administration Groups"; "Music - Its History and Background"; "The Care of the Body"; "World Peace"; "Real Causes of War"; and many others of a similar scope and importance to young people of today.</p>
   
   <p>FOR THE ITALIAN PARENTS.</p>
   <p>Adult men and women have found help at St. John in many ways. For many, life has been difficult in America. The only bright spot in the life of numerous Italian women is the "Women's League" meeting, once a week, in the Protestant church, where they make friends, sew, and learn many things by this contact with the outside world.</p>
   <p>Still another phase of this institution's program suggests to us that no better opportunity is offered on Chicago's West Side for the development of patriotic and loyal Americans, than through the Christian program and teachings of this church. For the parents there are classes in English and citizenship, helping to bridge language barriers and to foster Christian attitudes. Again, there are classes in Italian for young people, in order that there may be better understanding between the first and second generation of these families.</p>
   
   <p>It is the hope of St. John Church that its activities will facilitate, rather than prevent, the cultural transition of these people by aiding parent and youngster to join in becoming citizens of America.</p>
   <p>For, the church must interpret not only one generation to another, but must interpret America to its new citizens,presenting the best of American culture, and, at the same time, interpret the new citizens to America, conserving the finest elements of the alien culture brought to our shores.</p>
   <p>As I have come to know these things at St. John, I have begun to see the way in which young and old are welcomed into the friendly atmosphere of this building, so that entire families are served and aided. It is impossible to guess the significance, extent and depth, of such service as this.</p>
   
   <p>PLAY AND STUDY FOR SUMMER DAYS</p>
   <p>If our visit to the church of the great, tall spire at Harrison Street and Hoyne Avenue is during the Summer weeks, we will see one of the most impressive manifestations of the program for boys and girls, as we observe sessions of a vacation church school, that draws two hundred and fifty children for a daily program of Summer supervised play and instruction.</p>
   <p>This church school has welcomed everybody. It has taught children to adopt responsibilities, it has offered encouragement and opportunity for creative expression when such encouragement means most in the life of a youngster.</p>
   
   <p>It is by such effort as this that young people growing up in areas of undesirable influences, in the great neighborhoods of Chicago that breed criminals, are kept from becoming misfits in the social scheme of things.</p>
   <p>CITY.....COUNTRY...FAMILY...AND CHURCH.</p>
   <p>With our visit to these manifold activities completed, we return once more to the office of the Rev. De Carlo, who directs this detailed program, and yet finds time for many personal interviews and to advise many individuals in their problems. From our conversation with this seventy-two year old Minister, who still retains the energies and capacities of far younger men, we catch a new conception of the goals of St. John Presbyterian Institutional Church.</p>
   
   <p>Inseparably linked to these goals are the conceptions of the family, the city, the country and the church. Upon the family structure rest the institution of citizenship and the welfare of a nation, this Minister fervently believes it is the Christian church that can do most to preserve families in the midst of distracting and disturbing urban influences.</p>
   <p>So it is that at St. John, there is this varied schedule of daily activities designed to enrich the lives of families surrounding the church, making the church building a center for the educational interests of several hundred each week, a center for physical training and development, a center for the building of citizenship, a place for the worship of God and the strengthening of human character. To such a series of activities an attendance of sixty-eight thousand (68,000) persons was recorded last year. Of this figure hundreds were little children, while many others were parents and grandparents.</p>
   
   <p>BUILDING LEADERSHIP</p>
   <p>The fostering of family ties, by means of a ministry designed for every member of the family, is but one goal at St. John. Still another envisages the finding and training of individual leaders in this community that is so rich with potential leadership, if these characteristics and abilities are properly directed and guided. Every master criminal of Chicago's history, every sensational figure in its under-world who has come from its foreign speaking neighborhoods, has had the potentialities of a great leader; traits that were twisted until these qualities of leadership were used for law-breaking and destructive purposes.</p>
   <p>To build social leaders, Christian leaders, from the youth of a West Side community, is one of the things that St. John Church strives to do. No institution like it has so truly managed and expertly aimed at this goal. Few churches have adapted the philosophy of Jesus Christ to so practical an application in so useful a week-day program.</p>
