   <p>A group of Italian women has taken the initiative in having a "Tag Day" for the benefit of the victims of the Abruzzi earthquake, and it will take place March 13 and 14th, Saturday and Sunday.</p>
   <p>The downtown district is excluded from the selling of tags but, naturally, the greater sale of the tags will be more concentrated in the Italian wards.</p>
   <p>This Italian "Tag Day", will be under the direction of Miss Lucia Russo, 1031 South Morgan St., and Mrs. Elvira Bergamo. Their assistants will be Miss Anna George, Mrs. Anna Mardulli; Miss R. Maggi, Miss M. Labriola, Miss M. Barone, Mrs. R. Russo, Miss Louise Falco, Mrs. L. Palmero, Miss E. Wirch, Miss R. Bennett, Mrs. D. Parise, Mrs. M. Guarnicki, Miss J. Maguire, Miss M. Labriola, Miss A. Passo, Mrs. Lucy Volo, Miss Maria Angarola, Miss Emily Baladi, Mrs. L. Pecoraro, and Mrs. Messeli.</p>
