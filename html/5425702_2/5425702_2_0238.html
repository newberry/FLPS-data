   <p>Our electors know what great importance attaches to being citizens of the U.S. Out of 20,000 Italians in this city, only 700 have a right to vote; the other 19,300 are not as yet naturalized citizens of this country. 700 Italian voters is a very small number compared with 230,000 other voters of this city. Everyone is urged to become a citizen, because Italians will have more power than they now have.</p>
