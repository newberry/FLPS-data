   <p>While the war was still in progress, our colony sent nine ambulances to Italy. No word has been sent to us as to whether or not the ambulances were received.</p>
   <p>Following an investigation made by the Italian Consul, Conte Bolegnesi, it was discovered that the ambulances were given to the Italian Red Cross instead, which did not take the trouble to send a word of thanks.</p>
