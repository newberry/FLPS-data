   <p>Last Sunday, the Trinacria Siciliana Society and the Unione Siciliana Society held two large meetings to discuss definitely and proceed with the organization of a large and powerful association, called the "White Hand" created purposely to paralyze and destroy the socalled "Black Hand."</p>
   <p>The Royal Italian Consul, Cav. Guido Sabetta, Dr. Volini, Dr. Cutrera, Dr. Gino, Mr. Malato, Messers. Spagiari and Barbieri, A. Broletti, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce and many others were present at the meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>After a serious discussion, condemning the nefarious atrocities of the "Black Hand" the assembly resolved:</p>
   <p>1. We publicly notify all persons who send extortion letters to stop such nefarious proceedings for the good of the Italian name.</p>
   <p>2. We beg the public in general and the press of Chicago particularly to refrain from blaming the Sicilians for such deeds.</p>
   <p>3. We beg the public and the American press to cease mentioning the "Black Hand Society," because no organization of that kind exists in America or in Italy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malato, a lawyer and ex-State Legislator, delivered a violent speech condemning the acts of a few unworthy outcast Italians, who are degrading our <span class="page-break">3</span>name, and retarding our progress in every field of social life.</p>
   <p>This agitation shows the interest of the Sicialians in defending their reputation and in promising strong protection for the weaker victims of the "Black Hand."</p>
   <p>The Italian Consul promised the "White Hand Association" all his personal assistance as well as that of his office.</p>
