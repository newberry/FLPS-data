   <p>Chicago's Italian population is estimated at 15,000 to 20,000. This appears to be a low estimate in view of the fact that about 500,000 Italians have immigrated to the United States. The thousands of railroad and mine workers, undoubtedly, constitute a large portion of the number.</p>
   <p>In our city the Italian population lived in rather secluded colonies until this day. The largest settlement is located at Ewing, Taylor, Halsted Streets, and Blue Island Avenue. But we also find a large Italian element on South Clark Street between the viaduct and Harrison Street, and also on Clark Street and Archer Avenue, West Van Buren, Robey, Throop Streets and Hoyne Avenue, and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The first Italian immigrants arrived about 1845 on the shores of Lake Michigan. During the following ten years very few new-comers appeared. Among the first <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>settlers were Antonio Repetto, Antonio Raggio, J. Raggio, L. Arado, Frank Gazzolo, Dominich Botto and J. G. Cella. The last mentioned are supposed to be the richest Italians in this city.</p>
   <p>Giovanni L. Cella was the first Italian consul, and his appointment took place on July 6, 1868.</p>
   <p>Italians who succeed in the struggle for existence, soon become Americanized and good citizens. But we also find here as well as in other large cities a number of specific types of the street. Peddling of fruits on street corners in largely in the hands of Italians.</p>
   <p>The organ-grinders, passing through our streets begging, the ash-box investigators, male and female, the Italian street-cleaners and diggers are familiar to all. However, the great majority of the Italians occupy an honorable position among the population of the city.</p>

   <p>During recent years the Italians have obtained citizenship in real large numbers, and many of them are striving earnestly to overcome a certain prejudice against their nationality due, undoubtedly, to some street types, and they have been rewarded with splendid success.</p>
   <p>The average Italian is very economical, and with grinding frugality he saves his earnings in order to purchase his own home. The overwhelming majority of the Italians have succeeded through tireless efforts to become wealthy or at least to live in moderate circumstances.</p>
   <p>The Italians are strongly inclined to be social. Their many social clubs also give evidence to what extent they treasure the memory of their old fatherland. Many of the Italian organizations bear the names of Italian cities or provinces. The oldest society is the "Unione e Frattellenza" (Unity and Brotherhood). Well known are the Italian Sharpshooters with their colorful uniforms. There are many other clubs as the Garibaldi, Victor Emanuel, Margherita de Savoy, Christophoro Columbo, Carabinieri, Italia, etc. There are also a number of fraternal organizations <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and one of the strongest is the Italian Catholic Fraternity of Foresters.</p>
   <p>Three Italian papers are published in Chicago, L'Italia, L'America, and Il Fiecanaso. The first two are published weekly, and the third is an illustrated monthly magazine.</p>
   <p>Four large, beautiful halls serve as gathering places for their festivities. Music and dramatic art is cultivated among them with genuine Italian enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The largest of the Italian churches is the one located on Illinois and Franklin Streets, and is the center of religious activities among the Italian population.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that the land of the fine arts has worthy representatives in this youthful metropolis. One of them is V. Carpi, Director of Music of the Chicago Conservatory. A musician of outstanding ability is A. A. Jannotta. His music academy is located in the Auditorium Building. Francis Emilio Timponi, an orchestra director, was famous already in the old country. Known as well as <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>liked are the mandolin orchestras of Valisi and Tomaso. Of journalists, speakers, physicians and professors, we mention the following: Dr. G. Ronga, C. Sentile, O. Durante, Giovanni Almagia, E. Alfieri, Dr. C. Volini, Dr. Nicola Re, Dr. A. Lagoria, Dr. A. Mauro, Professor G. Mantellini, A. De Mateis, P. Bellivio, and D. A. Dasso.</p>
