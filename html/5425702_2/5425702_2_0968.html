   <p>The Executive Council of this Chamber of Commerce knowing that our motherland is in need of money to supply our heroic soldiers with ammunition and arms, has unanimously resolved to increase the propaganda among Italian merchants and industrialists of this and other cities and who are under this Consulate's jurisdiction, to induce them to buy more bonds of the Italian Government loan and which can be redeemed in the next 25 years. For that purpose it has sent a form letter to 29 newspapers published in Italian, in this Consular district, which will give more incentive to the drive for funds.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen know the dangers confronting our motherland and which are also ours. Save her from the threat of our enemy and know that he who helps to victory with money is as patriotic as he who gives himself.</p>

   <p>Besides the patriotic angle, subscribing to this Italian Loan will guarantee certain privileges as well as a substantial profit. This investment pays 5 per cent, is exempt from taxes present or future, and is payable every-year. Besides the subscribers will pay only 97.50 lire for every 100 lire bond.</p>
   <p>Considering the present exchange between the Italian and American money, the money invested will give a 30 per cent discount, thus to obtain a profit of 33 per cent it is only necessary to invest 67 lire to have a credit of 100 lire and the interest is paid on the 100 lire.</p>
   <p>Therefore we ask everyone who has money to invest to perform a double duty, one to help the mothercountry, and another to help himself with a sound and profitable investment.</p>

   <p>Said loan can be paid in nine months time and can be redeemed any time at 95 per cent of the current value with 5 per cent interest. Italy can meet the payment of this loan. We give you an idea of its financial position:</p>
   <p>a. The income of the nation is increasing because the national wealth is increasing.</p>
   <p>b. The nation has 414,000,000 lire of new incomes to pay the interest on the loan.</p>
   <p>c. The national wealth of Italy is increasing every year by 1,000,000,000, thus the war cost will be recuperated in a short time.</p>
   <p>No matter how small the investment, many small investments will add up to millions and billions. To our countrymen who have at heart the interest of the mother-country we say, "Give, and give, and give."</p>
