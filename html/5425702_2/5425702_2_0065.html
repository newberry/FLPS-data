   <p>For having violated the closing hour ordiance, Major Funkhouser has ordered the restaurant of James Colosimo, closed. The charge was made by police-women who said that they had bought beer in the place after 1 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Colosimo's lawyers, Marks and Jampolis, have asked for a continuance and the trial has been set for September 5th.</p>
   <p>A wire from New York informed Chicago Police that Johnny Torrio, supposedly the manager of Colosimo's, was being held by the authorities of that city, but since no warrant for his arrest was active, he was released.</p>
   <p>Torrio had found it expedient to leave Chicago after the affair on 22nd St., in which a police officer was killed and several other wounded.</p>
