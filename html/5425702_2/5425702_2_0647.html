   <p>There is reason, and it is high time for those who know our Italian fellow-citizens and appreciate their good qualities, to speak out in their behalf. By living among them, and working with them at Chicago Commons for more than thirty years, I have had the opportunity to learn the best and worst traits of their character and conduct.</p>
   <p>This personal acquaintance places me under obligation to my Italian neighbors and fellow-citizens, as well as to my home city, to tell what I know of them and say what I think of them, now that a very small minority is causing the great majority of them to be cruelly misunderstood and unjustly judged.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Everywhere in Italy, and here in America, Italians are a family folk. Their kinship is real, vital, affectionate and lifelong. Parents love their children, not always wisely, but passionately. They work hard and long, many of them to give the younger generations better advantages in America than they of the first generation of immigrants had on either side of the sea. And their children expect, and are expected, to provide for their parents. The Italian immigrant's first earnings are usually shared with the old folks at home.</p>
   <p>The married immigrant saves enough by economizing on his living expenses here, to support his wife and children in Italy, until he can pay for their voyage to America so that they can join him in starting home life here. Then, as one and another family circle begins to earn, a son and daughter add their wages to the family fund. Often the mother receives the unopened pay envelopes of father and children for household expenses and returns only <span class="page-break">\3</span>a fraction of the week's wage for the personal expenses of each. A short-sighted Americanism complains of "the loss" of the money sent abroad, failing to appreciate that America has gained by this industrious thrift habit, and by the family love and loyalty thus cultivated and expressed.</p>
   <p>A Family Neighborly Folk</p>
   <p>Italians are neighbors to one another to a greater extent than most--if not all--people of other races. Their rural villagers and city dwellers alike possess that elemental instinct which causes them to cling to the neighborly relationship. The emigrant clings to it more consciously and tenaciously when leaving the fatherland, and shrinks from losing it while seeking to perpetuate it upon his coming to this strange land. In most cases, his only guiding policy is to go where his kinsfolk or neighbors have gone before him. His destination <span class="page-break">\4</span>is where they happen to live. Whatever port he enters, he enters only to set foot on their threshold. He is hospitably taken into the family circle until he gains his foothold.</p>
   <p>They maintain their fellowship by sharing each other's joys at family festivals, at weddings, at baptisms, and at birthdays. By floral offerings and attendance at funerals, respect for the dead and sympathy for the living never fail to be displayed by every friend of both.</p>
   <p>Italians are naturally devoutly religious. They identify their church with their home and neighborhood. There they are at home. There the babe is brought for baptism, there the maid and her man come to be married, and from there the dead are taken for burial. The neighborhood is the parish. Its priest is as friendly as was the padre in the little hilltop parish where his parishioners grew up. The sanctuary worship and feasts inspire the little nativity shrine in the home circle and in the shop window, as well as the festa celebrated by every benefit order in <span class="page-break">\5</span>honor of its patron saint.</p>
   <p>Familiar with art and music as expressions of religious feeling and aspiration, the Italian is inspired to create love, and to appreciate song and artistic beauty. Among the masses of the people of no other race among us, least of all among our American-born people, is there any such familiarity with operatic music, or appreciation for sculpture and painting, as there is among Italian wage-workers.</p>
   <p>Conservative and Good Citizens</p>
   <p>The American citizenship of the Italians, like that of other foreign-born citizens, is better or worse according to the good or bad influences to which the immigrant is subjected during the early years of his experience in America. The man through whom he gets his first employment or under whom he works, usually interprets for the newcomer his first impressions of our political standards and practices.</p>
   <p>This "boss" is usually a partisan politician, who leads or drives the immigrant laborer to believe that his job depends upon his vote. Any higher <span class="page-break">\6</span>ideals of citizenship reach the foreign laborer too late, if at all, and too superficially to prompt his declaration of independence.</p>
   <p>As the padrone gradually loses control of the Americanized foreign-born worker, and seldom controls the worker's children, the political "boss" eventually fails to exercise autocratic control over those who at first depended upon him for their very living. One of our political ward "bosses," long since overthrown, sang his "swan song" in this lament: "There's no telling what those immigrants will do inside the voting booth".</p>
   <p>The great mass of Italian citizens are conservative, and are loyal Americans. But from Sicily, a lawless element has imported survivors of a lawlessness that has existed there longer than elsewhere because of weak and corrupt governments. Self protection at first drove self-respecting men to avenge themselves for injuries inflicted upon them. This demonstrated self-reliance. Failure to do so was looked upon with contempt. This expediency of self-protection against mis-government <span class="page-break">\7</span>in earlier times evolved into the terrorizing agency of both crime and misrule.</p>
   <p>For Justice to Sicilians</p>
   <p>But the great majority of our good American citizens of Sicilian birth justly protested against being suspected of having any part or lot with these parasites of their race, from whose lawlessness they themselves have suffered most. Yet racial prejudice often causes unjust suspicion of all Sicilians--if not all other Italians--implying that they are accomplices of the very criminals whom they abhor.</p>
   <p>In our united effort to rid our land of this blood revenge and blackmail, we must not forget how long we have tolerated similar forms of American lawlessness. We have not yet dispensed with "strong-arm" ruffians on either side of our industrial conflicts. Antagonists seeking "personal satisfaction" have not long been extinct.</p>
   <p>Lynch law still survives, while Congress hesitates to stamp it out. The <span class="page-break">\8</span>Ku-Klux are still abroad in the land. Bootlegger, gunmen and other assassins, not a few, bear other than Sicilian names. It will not help us to punish and deport the guilty if we are unjust to the innocent or if we discourage their loyal co-operation and support of American ideals.</p>
