   <p>Hon. James P. Allman</p>
   <p>Commissioner of Police</p>
   <p>City Hall</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I have been noticing in the Chicago American newspapers, and it has also been brought to my attention by many Italian-Americans in the city, a statement made by some officers of the police department, in connection with some deplorable man-slaughters which occurred in the last few months. These remarks have hurt the feelings of the Italians, especially those of that part of Italy originating from Sicily.</p>
   
   <p>May I recall that in Chicago are living over 60,000 Sicilians who are homest and hard-working people and who have done their bit for the progress and advancement of their adopted land. Therefore, if unfortunately, a few are not behaving themselves and observing the law, that absolutely should not affect the good name of all the rest of the said community.</p>
   <p>I have much respect for the police department and I always have appreciated their cooperation every time it was asked for by this office on several occasions. Therefore, I am sure that these remarks were, perhaps, made involuntarily.</p>
   <p>I do not intend to take the defense of the criminal whether or not he belongs to the race which I have the honor to represent in this country, but I would suggest that the police officers should be more careful, at least in their expressions, especially when they are not sure of the nationality of the criminal.</p>
   <p>I am bringing this to your attention in a very friendly way and I am sure you will appreciate my point.</p>
   <p>Thanking you, I am</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>M. Carosi</p>
   <p>Royal Italian Consul General.</p>
