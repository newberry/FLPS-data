   <p>An annual report from the Chicago Police Department, shows that 22,449 persons have been arrested and of these 26 are Italians.</p>
   <p>The Italian population in Chicago is 25,000 which is an average of one Italian arrested in every thousand.</p>
   <p>We are proud to present these figures because some American newspapers stated that the Italians in Chicago are trouble-makers, and these figures show ample proof that they are not.</p>
