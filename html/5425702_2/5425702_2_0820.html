   <p>From the local Italian and American press we are informed that our Supreme President, Judge Barasa, is at present in Italy where he had an audience with the Pope and with His Excellency Benito Mussolini.</p>
   <p>During his visit in Italy he visited many interesting cities and towns of Sicily. In Rome he presented Mussolini with a beautiful parchment sent by the Italo-American National Union of Chicago and also deposited a floral tribute on the tomb of the unknown soldier.</p>
   <p>Our association is waiting for the return of our leader, with his wife and daughter, who accompanied him.</p>
