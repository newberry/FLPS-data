   <p>The Italian Social and Educational Club, presided over by the energetic and intelligent Vincenzo Pappalardo, will take part in the celebration of the Italian Constitution Day program. This club will demonstrate the great events of history and will attempt to teach the Italians so that, like our forefathers, they will know how to break the secular tyranny of a church dynasty.</p>
   <p>After the commemoration, a bronze historical shield will be dedicated, at the club's headquarters, Polk and Sholto streets. The author of the inscription on the shield is Senator Nicolo Lazzaro, Director of the Gazzetta Ufficiale Regno of D'Italia. On the shield are inscribed a number of famous deeds, in order to awaken in the hearts of our children the honor of an eminent country rich in heroes, poets, and genius, and resplendent in the sun.</p>
