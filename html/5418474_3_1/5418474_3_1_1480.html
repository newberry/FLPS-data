   <p>The interest of the German voters mounts daily. All the German Democratic Clubs have taken on a permanent character and a large number of them have already expressed their preference for Hesing as mayor. Evidently, they are not satisfied with this very auspicious beginning. In many wards special Hesing clubs have been formed during the last few days and another was founded in the 22nd Ward yesterday, at a meeting in Ferd. Kuhlen's Hall on North Ave., which was mostly attended by Germans.</p>
   <p>It was a sizeable crowd, staunch supporters of Germanism from the 22nd Ward, who responded to the clarion call of Max Stern.... and others, to labor in the interests of their candidate, Washington Hesing. Aside from the above, many voters from the 16th, 17th, and 25th Wards were present. Among the more prominent citizens were noted the following: Max Stern ..... (28 names are listed) and many more.</p>
   <p>Mr. John W. Hermann opened the meeting with a few apt and very significant words. He said: "The coming mayoral election is of supreme importance, and <span class="page-break">2</span>particularly to the Germans; one of our compatriots, a son of German parents, in fact, a typical German,-a man endowed with exceptional talents and a thorough education - a man who is fully conversant with the conditions and requirements of our city, who, in spite of his comparative youth is probably more familiar with our existing needs than most leaders of our municipal administration during the last decade - a man in the sublimest sense of that word, is now a candidate for the mayor's office.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Germans are a solid mass; many an instance gave us an adequate demonstration, and in the present case our German element, irrespective of party affiliation should feel honored in elevating one of its own members to that exalted office which can be bestowed by the voters. The name Hesing is inseparably associated with Chicago's Germanism, a fact which a few straggling, dissenting stinkers cannot undo. The Germans of our city should be 'united to a man' in their nomination for Hesing and should express their intentions accordingly on election day!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Hermann thereupon nominated Mr. Adolph Sturm as chairman, since he considers him to be an energetic and staunch supporter of liberty and right. He was elected forthwith amidst vociferous approval. Mr. Hermann attended to the <span class="page-break">3</span>secretarial duties.</p>
   <p>The Chairman (Sturm) introduced Mr. Reisenegger who delivered a splendid speech wherein he severely criticized Hesing's adversary, Carter H. Harrison and characterized him as being undeserving of German support.</p>
   <p>"Washington Hesing is made of entirely different timber than the megalomaniac, Harrison. He is the eminent and respected son of Anton Caspar Hesing, who has done more than any other German for the furtherance of Germanity and obviously, none, except the envious gentry will quibble about it.</p>
   <p>"Washington Hesing is not a politician in conformity with the accepted definition of that tern, and therefore a potent expectancy manifests itself, that he will provide an honest, capable administration."</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Stern is a man of few words, but, true to the oft-quoted proverb, when he speaks, he hits the mail squarely on the head. He vindicated his reputation again last night by doling out expert advice on the approaching problems and declared that exigencies make it imperative to form a strong organization without delay. He suggested a Washington Hesing Club. His proposition found <span class="page-break">4</span>instantaneous acceptance, whereupon Mr. A. Sturm was elected presiding officer and Charles Errant, became the secretary of the new club.</p>
   <p>After this, Mr. Sturm admonished all in his convincing manner, that one of our essential duties consists in electing only trustworthy delegates to the convention, individuals who cannot be swayed in their nomination for Hesing; that we conscientiously participate at the primary election, since a mere declaration of principles and good intentions does not suffice.</p>
   <p>Messrs. A. Sturm, Gen. Lieb and O. Naef added their very interesting speeches. The election of Mr. Sturm to the club's presidency was a fortunate selection, since he bristles with enthusiasm, a valuable attribute during the present contingency. He formed his collaborators into a committee... of eight. They will meet on Sunday, 10 A. M., at Mr. Sturm's home, 515 wells St., to consider the divers strategic moves which must be formulated prior to the election.</p>
   <p>Above all, a large club membership from the 22nd Ward and contiguous territory appears highly desirable, and efforts will not lag in that direction. The club's second meeting will be held at Kuhlen's Hall, Tuesday evening.</p>
