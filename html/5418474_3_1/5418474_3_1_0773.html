   <p>The Group "Bruderlichkeit." The meeting was held last Wednesday under the presidency of Comrade August Muller. The lecture about Revolution provoked a lively debate, because the president in his long speech wanted to show the confusion prevailing in regard to the aims of the Social Revolution. That its purposes were not only to destroy and upset, but to build up the Communist Society everywhere. A publication of a pamphlet about the realization of the Communistic principles should be published. A lecture on Communism for the next meeting was announced. Upon the motion of several comrades it was arranged that they should assemble at Comrade Wichmann's Home, 1260 Ashland Avenue, Lake View, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, to hold a sociable meeting, to which the members of Group "Bruderlichkeit" are especially invited.</p>
