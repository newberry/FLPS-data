   <p>The first speaker was Comrade P. Grottkau, who said among other things, "We are living at a present in comparative peace or a period of armistice. The great general ill feeling of the body social is a symptom of sickness which points to an early outbreak of a fight between the parties. Economic crisis repeat themselves every ten years. The last crash occured in 1873. What we therefore may expect in the near future is no riddle to the thinking person. The large fires in business houses are not caused by accident. Everybody is trying to save himself the best way he can and they are not very particular about the means.</p>

   <p>"The commercial and business crisis in which we find ourselves will increase the number of unemployed. Those who at present manage to obtain a meager existence will also be thrown out. Poverty is increasing which is considered by the rich as a crime-the greatest of all crimes."------</p>
