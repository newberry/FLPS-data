   <p>The Altgeld Labor Legion, which has developed a commendable activity in this election campaign, has carefully investigated the damages caused by the contract system of prison labor to those trades which were directly affected by this system.... This legion has now issued a manifesto to the workers in Chicago, in which Mr. Fifer is accused of having committed a long list of sins, and in which labor is urgently requested to vote for J. P. Altgeld, from whom they can expect with certainty the protection of their interests. The manifesto, written in clear and forceful language, ends with the following words:</p>
   <p>"Victory for Altgeld is victory for labor! His defeat is our defeat! We must support a mutual cause. Our loyalty will be to our honor; but our indifference will be to our disgrace. Every one should do his duty!"</p>
