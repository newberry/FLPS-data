   <p>The militia bill now before the legislature of Illinois is receiving its third reading, and will, presumably, become a law during the present session. It contains, among other items, the following provisions:</p>
   <p>"It shall be unlawful for any body of men other than the regularly organized volunteer militia of this state, and the troops of the United States....to associate themselves together as a military company or organization, to drill or parade with arms in this state, except as hereinafter authorized:</p>
   <p>"Provided, that by and with the consent of the Governor, independent regiments, battalions, or companies, organized for the purpose of recreation or to acquire military knowledge that may better enable them to serve the state in time of public danger, if such should arise, may associate or organize themselves together as a military body, and may drill or parade with arms in <span class="page-break">2</span>public in this state:....</p>
   <p>"Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to prevent benevolent or social organizations from wearing swords. All military organizations in and by this section permitted to drill and parade with arms, shall, on occasions of public parade, be required to carry the flag of the United States in addition to any private ensign which they may carry:</p>
   <p>"Provided, that the consent herein specified may be withdrawn at the pleasure of the Governor. Whoever offends against the provisions of the preceding section or belongs to, or parades with, any such unauthorized body of men with arms shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the common jail for a term not to exceed six months or both."</p>
   <p>Meier, Socialist representative from Chicago, made a motion to eliminate this paragraph and said candidly that he made the request because this stipulation would sound the death knell for the Lehr-und Wehrverein (Instruction and <span class="page-break">3</span>Defense Club) and the Jaeger-Compagnie (Hunter Company) of the Chicago Socialists.</p>
   <p>Thomas, Republican representative from Chicago, then made a motion to proceed with the agenda, thus superceding Meier's motion, and Thomas's motion was passed by acclamation.</p>
   <p>Meier asked for a roll call to decide Thomas's motion, but a motion to hold a roll call for a vote on a measure was declared tenable only if at least five members asked for it, and not even five supporters could be mustered by the three Socialists or communists in the legislature (Meier, Meilbeck, and Ehrhard). Very little interest was shown in the Socialists, even by those representatives who endeavored to weaken the measure by the addition of various amendments. Thus the aforesaid stipulations remain in the law.</p>
   <p>Of course, the few armed communists are by no means as frightful....as the descriptions in Chicago's English language newspapers would lead us to believe. However, after the threatening, bloodthirsty rhetoric indulged <span class="page-break">4</span>in by the few communist representatives in the legislature, the Socialists need not be surprised if, henceforth, the peoples' delegates are unwilling to tolerate independent, fully equipped communist troops.</p>
   <p>If the militia bill is accepted in its entirety, then the afore-mentioned communist companies have no alternative except to disband, since there is little chance of their getting permission from the Governor to continue. They may affiliate themselves with the state militia, which is limited to eight thousand men, provided that there are vacancies.</p>
   <p>But as militia officers, the leaders of the communist companies must take the following oath: "I swear that I shall remain faithful and obedient to the United States and to the state of Illinois; that I shall uphold the Constitution of the United States and the state of Illinois; that I shall serve faithfully in the militia for five years, unless I am discharged at an earlier time or cease to be a resident of the state; that I shall obey my supreme chief (the Governor) and the officers as well as the military laws of Illinois, so help me God!"</p>

   <p>According to law, one of the specific duties of the militia is to suppress riots and insurrection. The law also stipulates that only male citizens may be members of the militia. The company officers of the militia are elected by the soldiers [that is, rank and file of the militia]. The lieutenants are appointed by the battalion or regiment commanders, upon recommendation of the captain. Officers must pass an examination before an examining commission appointed by the Governor; those who fail, will be dismissed. While on duty, in case of riots, insurrection, etc., the militia is governed by the strict and regular military laws of the United States Army, which punishes insubordination with death. The arms are provided by the state and are under state supervision.</p>
   <p>If the armed communist companies entered the state militia instead of disbanding, then the Socialists would not need to buy their weapons, but they would have to submit to the serious regulations stated above.</p>
   <p>Lodge members and members of other benevolent associations are permitted to carry swords during parades, according to the law.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In regard to the German rifle associations, it is obvious that the Governor will permit these clubs to continue their practice as well as to bear arms in parades--nor will the members of such clubs have to affiliate with the militia.</p>
