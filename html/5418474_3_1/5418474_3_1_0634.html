   <p>The manly letter written by-Oscar Neebe a prisoner, created a sensation among all the classes or our population.</p>
   <p>The contents of the letter give one a firm belief in the prisoner's innocence, and were it not for public indifference, the people would clamor for the release of the innocent prisoner who is a victim of a clique of murderous conspirators.</p>
   <p>Even capitalistic papers grant the fact that such a letter could have been written by an innocent man only.</p>
   <p>That clique, Gary and Grinnell, alone, which put him in jail, is not satisfied with this letter.</p>
   <p>Furthmann, Grinnell's errand-boy, made some statements to the Tribune in which he claimed that Neebe was an anarchist, and that he had <span class="page-break">\2</span>maimed his hand while experimenting with dynamite.</p>
   <p>Furthmann has a personal grudge against Neebe who always has ignored him.</p>
