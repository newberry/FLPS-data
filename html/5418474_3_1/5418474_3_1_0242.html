   <p>The Clergy of Chicago took occasion on yesterday's Sabbath to voice its opinion about the strike in a fatherly way. It is understood that the labor-agitators got the worst of it in these criticisms.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Thomas Green from St. Andreas' Church, Washington and Robey, was not ashamed to state that all labor-agitators without exception were despicable subjects.</p>
   <p>The working class does not prove to be clever, he said, to be led around by the nose by them. The workers should rather go to church and pray to God for help; but it is a pity that there are districts in the city of Chicago without any houses of God.</p>

   <p>He knows of one district inhabited by 36,000 people, where there is no religious institution. These are the regions where revolutionaries and agitators mostly come from.</p>
   <p>Another clergyman the Rev. Propst from the Westminister Presbyterian Church, denies that there is any sense in justice for the working class.</p>
