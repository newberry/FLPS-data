   <p>A meeting was held in Greif's hall yesterday in which some 30 of the most prominent socialists of Chicago debated their attitude for the coming election. During the last election, four years ago, the workers' election movement was chiefly started by German workers; this time, American Social Democrats took the initiative and the chances for a satisfying result are better.</p>
   <p>Tommy Morgan, who was present in order to report to his comrades the attitude of the German socialists, warned the meeting of the Union L. P. and United L. P. because both are under the leadership of people who want to acquire the votes of the working class for the Democrats.</p>
   <p>This assembly of about 30 German Social Democratic leaders in Chicago resolved with all but two votes to engage in the coming election.</p>
   <p>"... We (the assembly) are of the opinion that every clear-minded worker who advises against independent political workers' agitation, is recommending by that to his fellow-workers to vote for one of the capitalistic parties, who promise all kinds of reforms; by that, such worker is in common with our enemies.</p>

   <p>"We think it of lesser importance in our political agitation to look for the election of our candidates to political positions than to show our protest against the continuance of the present system through the number of our votes which we actually cast."</p>
   <p>At the same meeting the Central Ward Club was founded with John Knefel as secretary. It was resolved that:</p>
   <p>Every worker who does anything to help the Republican or Democratic party or any branch of either, or the Union Labor party or United Labor party, is working against himself.</p>
   <p>Every worker has to vote for the Radical Labor party and realize that tariff and tariff reform are nonsense.</p>
