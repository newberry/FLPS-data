   <p>It is impossible to find out why the first Monday in September should be called "Labor Day". If this day is supposed to be a review of the labor movement, there cannot be much said against this title, but how many believe so?</p>
   <p>However, this review showed no satisfactory results in Chicago, the masses having been absent, and there cannot be a demonstration without masses.</p>
   <p>The laborer's parade on Sep. 3rd in Chicago has proven, especially for this city, that the labor unions are at the present weaker than three years ago, before the eight hour movement. They are at only numerically smaller but also slacker towards the unions. The workers can not put the entire blame on humbug leaders like Rodgers, Cameron, Mulraney, Crawford, etc., but have first to blame themselves for their indifference.</p>
