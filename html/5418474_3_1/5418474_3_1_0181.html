   <p>At present there is serious danger that the industry of this country will be faced with strikes. The workers in the automobile industry, and in related branches of industry, as well as the railroad workers, are making preparations for a great struggle. The railroad workers demand higher wages, while the railroad companies want to lower pay. With the workers in the automobile industry it is a question of the right to organize; specifically, they want to form organizations of the type prescribed by the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>When the N. R. A. appeared on the scene, with its attempts to shorten the hours of labor and to increase pay, the opinion was often expressed that <span class="page-break">2</span>it would result in the destruction of the unions, since these were rendered superfluous by the act. The heads of the American Federation of Labor were of quite another opinion, however. They have made very strenuous efforts to organize the workers in various industries. Now they want to make the same attempt with workers in the automobile industry.</p>
   <p>William Green, president of the Federation, emphasizes the fact that Section 7 A of the National Recovery law explicitly gives workers the right to organize, and that workers in the automobile factories are determined to exercise this right. On the other hand, the automobile companies insist that, unfortunately, the object of the Federation's activities is to force workers to join the Federation against their will. Furthermore, they point out that for decades they have had no serious disputes with the workers, that they [the companies] consistently pay higher wages than most other industries, and that in general their people enjoy more favorable working conditions.</p>
   <p>The national chamber of commerce of the automobile industry, which includes <span class="page-break">3</span>all the larger manufacturers of automobiles and related products except the Ford Company, insists that its mambers have scrupulously complied with all the instructions of the N. R. A., that they pay higher hourly wages than in 1929, and that they give so much work to their employees that the average wage payment is ninety per cent of the wage paid in 1929, while the cost of living is only eighty-three per cent as high. The manufacturers also state that they have never denied the workers the right to organize and to engage in collective bargaining.</p>
   <p>For all these reasons the chamber of commerce feels justified in making the assertion that the American Federation of Labor is not seeking higher wages or better working conditions by the threatened strike, but is attempting to make use of the N. R. A. in securing more members, and in this way to increase its income. For this reason the manufacturers have refused the demands of the Federation. The representatives of the Federation of Labor have already started preparations for organizing a strike to secure their demands. They <span class="page-break">4</span>maintain that most automobile workers are on their side, while the manufacturers maintain that the opposite is true.</p>
   <p>In the case of the railroads the situation is quite different. President Roosevelt personally proposed to the railroads that the present wage agreement be extended to April 30, 1935. This proposal was rejected by both parties. The railroad companies demand a further wage reduction of fifteen per cent, while the employees insist on a wage increase of ten per cent. Even if it is assumed that both parties are prepared to modify their demands, it is difficult to see how, in this case, a compromise can be reached. Naturally the Federal Government is attempting to mediate in this case, also.</p>
   <p>For the Administration the threatened strikes are especially disquieting, because they are liable seriously to interrupt the revival of business which has started in so promising a manner. It is generally asserted that strikes are a sign of prosperity. In normal times this assertion is probably justified, but at present the economic situation is, unfortunately, still far from normal.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It is obvious that right at this time both strikes will have a disastrous effect upon the whole economic life of the country.</p>
