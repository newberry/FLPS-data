   <p>Yesterday, about 1,000 members of the United Order of Bricklayers' and Stone Masons paraded from their old headquarters to their own new hall at Peoria and Monroe St. After Mahoney's speech the vice-president Erhardt gave an address in German which emphasized the necessity of a closer union among the German members.</p>
   <p>The Arbeiter Zeitung also acknowledges that the ownership of such a magnificent hall is a credit to the Bricklayers' Union, and is it endorsing the contents of all the speeches made last night.</p>
   <p>However, one item was lacking: Not one word was mentioned about Comrade Grottkau being the one who organized the bricklayers and who freed them from long working hours and low wages, and who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>finally brought them to the point where they received half-way decent wages, at least in comparison to other unions.</p>
   <p>The new hall alone will not do it, but let us hope that a different spirit will reign there. Not the holy spirit of the clergy or of reaction, but the spirit of progress, liberty, and enlightenment.</p>
   <p>If this wish is fulfilled, then Grottkau will feel richly rewarded for all his labors and troubles.</p>
