   <p>The executive committee of the German-American Republican Central Association of Cook County has accepted their own special resolution regarding the present election campaign. The resolutions make the statement that the result of this election is of far-reaching national importance, and is not, as many usually assume, just a local affair. It is asserted that the Republican party has always acted in a geniune patriotic manner, whenever national affairs for the welfare of the country were under consideration. A victory of the Republican party in Cook County would be particularly desirable at this time, as it would be equivalent to a recognition of the federal government. The German American Republican Central Association therefore ask of the German-Americans of Cook County to indorse the Republican candidates, and to assist in every possible way in their election.</p>
