   <p>The protest of the Socialist party against the German Government's repression of the Socialists drew a large crowd to the mass meeting at the Turnhalle on the west side of Chicago. Women were unexpectedly present, and their enthusiasm was apparently as intense as that of the stronger sex.</p>
   <p>The object of this meeting was the delivery of a petition to the labor parties of the various states. This petition, which is to be sent to Congress, calls upon that legislative body to voice the protests of the United States to Germany in behalf of German subjects who are being persecuted by the German Government because of their Socialistic beliefs and activities.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, Geo. Schilling explained the purpose of socialism. He endeavored to show that the recently attempted assassinations of German officials were machinations of the reactionaries. He further defended the Socialist party against the accusation that Hoedel or Nobeling were Socialist hirelings <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>executing the party's commands. Therefore the workers of America, as free citizens, consider it their duty to protest against German monarchical tyranny.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Paul Grottkau who, after a lengthy introduction, followed the theme of the previous speaker. He gave a fervid and convincing comparison of our free Republic and the present declining, military controlled Germany. He averred that Emperor Wilhelm personifies brutality and cowardice. He who did not hesitate to fire on the walls of Rastatt and to kill like dogs the best men of the nation in '48, who showed no compunction about using shrapnel on his subjects, finds that the fates have changed, that he is despised, and that it is necessary for him to protect his life with squadrons. Germany has been branded as militaristic. No more may free men resort to free speech; public opinion, as the laboring element expresses it, is prohibited in Germany.</p>
   <p>If we wish to be true to our principles then it is our duty--even if our Government is otherwise inclined--to register a protest through the United States against this atrocious, inhuman behavior which is being directed against <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>individuals who object to monarchism or who seek to obtain a just social order.</p>
   <p>After the applause of the enthusiastic crowd had subsided he spoke about the adopted fatherland. He declared that the ruling class cannot be expected to give money to the workers, that the American as well as the German-American bourgeois longs for imperialism and is active in subjugating labor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grottrau declared that this protest should not be sent at the instance of the Government, but at the behest of the Labor party.</p>
   <p>"In the name of liberty, in the name of civilization, I recommend the adoption of the following resolutions!" The speaker's closing remarks were greeted with tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>The Resolutions</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The people of the United States represent a nation where the government rules by consent of the governed, and where the Constitution proclaims the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>holiest rights--freedom of speech and press; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our form of government was founded after prolonged mortal combat against monarchial institutions, and our ancestors liberated us from such a system and bequeathed to us a form of government which opposes every form of personal despotism; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It is the duty of nations as well as individuals to foster human rights, as well as to protect them when and wherever it may be necessary, not only in the interests of justice but also in the interests of personal welfare; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Germany now suffers under a depressing form of despotism which provides heavy penalties for expressions of opinion which are derogatory to the tyranny of the Emperor and his subordinates, and which inhibits criticism in periodicals and newspapers, circulars and books which oppose the present debasing social system under which the entire working population is subjugated to the rankest peonage and destitution, wherein it must remain; and</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"Whereas, The oppressed and maltreated people of Germany who favor the republican and democratic principles of our Government used no force and violated no German laws, excepting those statutes which prevent sufferers from mentioning their deplorable condition and misery; therefore be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the American people who have such close international relations with Germany brand as unjust the actions of the German Government whereby the civic rights for which a civilized world fought for centuries are now abrogated; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That it is the duty of our republican Government to protest before all nations Germany's present political policy.</p>
   <p>"We therefore request that Congress and the President issue a formal protest against the abolition of civil rights in Germany; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent forthwith to the Administration in Washington and to the newspapers.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>These resolutions were acclaimed enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Following the reading of the resolutions Mr. Belohradski addressed the assembly. This gentleman spoke in Bohemian and as our reporter is unable to interpret that language his speech does not appear in these columns. To judge from the approval of the audience his words must have been very impressive.</p>
   <p>Christ. Myer, the delegate of the Labor party, was then summoned to the platform by the applause of the crowd. He said that as a native American he is always proud of The Star-Spangled Banner, and that he considers no nation equal to America. He declared that the German Socialists have aroused his respect and that he feels profound sympathy for those poor, crushed men whose instincts for freedom now face eradication by a despotic militaristic government. He asserted that history has never known such infamy. He heartily approved of extending the sympathy of the Socialists of this free American Republic to their suffering brethren in Germany. He recommended that the assemblage deliver a protest through the United States Government against this despicable treatment of a freeborn, freethinking people.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>He concluded by saying: It is the duty of our Administration, which represents human rights, to interest itself in our mistreated fellow Socialists in Germany; it must object to the tactics of the German Government dictated by the despot Wilhelm, and the annihilator of liberty, Bismarck. Our Nation must protest against this insult to humanity and intelligence.</p>
   <p>The speaker left the rostrum amid great applause.</p>
   <p>Another speaker, Mr. Sipley, also expressed his regrets about conditions affecting the workers in Germany whose sympathies lie with the Socialist party. "And what have we workers here," he asked, "but subjugation by capital and a glorious President Grant in Ireland (sic)." At this point deafening applause rewarded the speaker. "We must protest," he continued, "against this tyranny afflicting our brothers across the ocean. There are no Vanderbilts among us, but we have hearts and courage with which to fight misfortune."</p>
   <p>W. B. Creech was then called and he sang two Socialistic songs to the tune of "Yankee Doodle" and "Hold The Fort", which were given tumultuous applause.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The final speaker was A. R. Parsons whose views on free speech, an unmuzzled press, and Bismarck's despotism coincided with those of the other speakers.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned after a collection was taken for the benefit of a few destitute Socialists who were expelled from Germany.</p>
