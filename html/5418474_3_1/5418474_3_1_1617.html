   <p>A number of German Republicans held a meeting last evening at No. 311 Larrabee street for the purpose of forming a German-American Republican Club of the Sixteenth Ward. Mr. George Vocke called the meeting to order, and stated that, owing to the preponderance of the German element in the ward, it would be desirable to form a ward club, at which the proceedings would be in German, because most of the Germans in the ward did not understand the English language, which was used exclusively at the general club. He thought this club should be auxiliary to the main one. Mr. John Van Danden was elected Chairman. Louis Nelke made a long oration advocating the establishment of an independent German club, one that would have nothing to do with the main club. Most of the citezens in the ward were Germans, and they should therefore have the leading club that could dictate the candidates. Mr. Hilderbrecht opposed Mr. Nelke's view, and thought if such action were taken it would only alienate the Americans, and split up the Republican vote in the ward still more than it was now. He could see no reason for forming an independent organization. If the Germans were really as strong as was claimed, they could just as well ren the main club.</p>
