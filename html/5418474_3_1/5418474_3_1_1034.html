   <p>The motion of the Illinois legislature, several weeks ago, to table the militia bill and continue with the agenda, was defeated by only a small majority, but now the House has passed the bill by a vote of 100 to 36, and most of the thirty-six dissenters did not vote against the measure as a favor to the Communists. Part of the opposition to the clause involving the Communists is due to a desire for economy in the interests of the farmers, and part, to a dislike for the ruling political party in general.</p>
   <p>The large vote of the House for the militia bill, and the prospects that the Senate will pass the measure in a similar manner, must be attributed to the "armed parade" of Chicago's Communists last Sunday, and to the dire threats made in a Chicago Communistic paper.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Representative Fosbender, (Democrat), of Marshall County said-"Heretofore I was opposed to the militia bill, but I saw the conduct of the Communists in Chicago and now I fully understand the situation; something must be done to curb these insolent men who show no respect for the law."</p>
   <p>Communist Ehrhard of Chicago declared Fosbender's remark to be untrue, and added: "If anyone wants to make a fool of himself by favoring, this bill, that's none of my business!"</p>
   <p>Thomas, Republican, of Chicago, favored the bill at the outset, and agreed with Fosbender; he said he saw the Chicago Communists parading in their grey uniforms holding aloft The Star Spangled Banner surmounted by a red rag. The speaker then requested the Secretary of the House to read a translation of an article originally appearing in the aforementioned Communistic paper, and reprinted in the Times. The account showed a defiant attitude towards the militia law. The representative then said that he saw how the atrocities of the Parisian Communists were celebrated and he noticed also the blood-red flag <span class="page-break">3</span>fluttering in the air. If the past actions of these men constitute liberty, then every respectable citizen must prefer despotism to freedom.</p>
   <p>Murray, Democrat, of Chicago, who formerly was opposed to the militia bill, said: "Communist Meilbeck (of Chicago) seated on my left, told me confidentially that, if the bill is passed, the next House would have twenty-one Socialists, and that he (Meilbeck) would be defeated by a Socialist. He does not believe it, but such threats do not intimidate him." That the Chicago Socialists are opposed to the law does not surprise him. Did they not carry a red flag in honor of the Parisian Communists, in honor of men who desecrated and demolished Catholic churches, who killed the Parisian archbishop Darboy, who revolted against the new French republic and who committed other atrocities? The Americans will never tolerate the views of such people. It is but natural for such people to be opposed to a patriotic state militia, which would end all Communistic violence in Chicago. The Communists assert that the workers are opposed to the militia law. Well, one of the best and most reliable militia regiments, the Second regiment, consists in its entirety--from the highest <span class="page-break">4</span>ranking officer to the lowliest soldier--of good and true Irish workingmen. There are also armed Irish clubs not affiliated with the State militia, the "Clanna Gael" and the "Hibernians" for instance, but as orderly, law--abiding associations they have nothing to fear so far as the militia law is concerned: the Adjutant General already gave assurances that these associations will either be accepted by the militia, or else will be permitted by the Governor to continue independently as heretofore. If Communists are not given permission to bear arms, then it is only because of their threats. But if the armed Communistic clubs are not organized for the purpose of creating riots and rebellion, why then are they opposed to affiliation with the militia, which only defends the laws of the state?</p>
   <p>Trusdell, Democrat, of Lee County, who originally was opposed to the militia law, said that he now favors such a statute because it provides that no association or troop may be organized, exercise, possess arms or parade within the State, contrary to constituted authority or without giving a military oath of allegiance. As far as Chicago is concerned, he favors giving the <span class="page-break">5</span>administration authority to patrol the streets in the event of a Communistic attempt to foment a riot, and to nip it in the bud.</p>
   <p>Socialism--even a revolution--may be pardonable in a despotic country like Russia; but in the "Land of the Free," where every reform can be attained by peaceful, legal means, such conduct is inexcusable, and every Communist who attempts to use force in interfering with the State or social order should and must be shot without mercy, just like a wild animal.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the State to protect its citizens against such hordes. The armed Communist bands must be abolished in Chicago. Such hordes, which threaten the State and their adopted country, can no longer be tolerated.</p>
   <p>The measure was accepted after the staunch friends of the militia bill left its defence almost entirely within the hands of its erstwhile opponents, who changed their minds because of the threatening conduct of the Communists.</p>
