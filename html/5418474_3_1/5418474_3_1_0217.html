   <p>The local German newspapers, Abendpost, Chicagoer Tageblatt, and Freie Presse are involved in difficulties with their compositors. These troubles have their origin in an agreement made by the above German newspapers in Chicago and elsewhere with Typographia No. 9. The Typographia Union No. 9 submitted to the owners of these papers the following demands:</p>
