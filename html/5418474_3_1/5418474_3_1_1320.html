   <p>Chicago's citizens did a splendid voting job yesterday and the result promises to benefit the city.</p>
   <p>Not less than 311,034 men and 154,637 women went to the polls to cast their votes in the primaries. The percentage of qualified voters who had registered was seventy for the men and seventy-seven for the women. This reveals a great interest in politics and a high degree of response to civic duty, because political work is not entertaining or recreational.</p>
   <p>Of the total votes cast, 289,669 were Democratic and 176,002 Republican, and of this former 182,534 were for Sweitzer and 104,983 for Harrison, while William Hale Thompson received 87,060 and Harry Olson 84,735 of the Republican votes. This shows a high degree of understanding of local politics, an appreciation for the situation and its requirements, which is altogether laudable and presages <span class="page-break">2</span>a good chance for Chicago's future.</p>
   <p>The results of the Republican primary can be marked down as a triumph for the liberal element of the party. Both main contestants for the Republican nomination could be termed personally honorably and efficient men. The only difference between them was that Thompson was "anti-Deneen," but at the same time reliably liberal, while Olson figured as a reform candidate for the dry wing of the party. And liberalism won, if only by a small majority; but to this can be added the 4,200 votes or so which were cast for Jakob A. Hey, because you can be sure that this true-blue German liberal did not poll any "dry" votes.</p>
   <p>The result of the Democratic primary is a splendid and overwhelming victory of the progressive liberal spirit and of the Deutschtum [German element]. It is a definite proof that the German spirit, which has produced such wonderful results in city planning and city administration over there, is also at work here in our City of Chicago and clamors for active expression.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harrison personally is an honorable man, and has always had many friends among <span class="page-break">3</span>the Germans in the City, but as mayor he was a failure, because he never did anything. He is capable but indolent. As mayor, he was in favor of muddling along without too much effort. But Chicago is a working city and needs a top man who is not afraid to work. It will have such a man in Robert M. Sweitzer, because he has distinguished himself as an exceedingly industrious, persevering, and efficient worker. The saying goes that a leopard will never change his spots Sweitzer, if elected, will not change to a policy of procrastination, humoring along and making empty promises any more so than Mr. Harrison could turn into an active worker with a lot of punch behind him, if he had been elected. Chicago's chances of getting a liberal, absolutely dependable and progressive mayor are as good as Mr. Sweitzer's chances for a victory in the April elections.</p>
   <p>Sweitzer was seeking the nomination as a German-American, and he appealed for support to the German-American element in particular. He triumphed by a splendid majority over Harrison, who in former elections had found his main support in the German element. A close study of the election results in the various wards will show that Sweitzer owes his overwhelming victory, for the most part, <span class="page-break">4</span>to the German vote. Chicago's German element can rightly claim Sweitzer's victory as their own. And this victory is a triumph for the Deutschtum [German element] in the whole country. All German America can be proud that, in these stormy days, the strongest political party of the western metropolis elected a German-American as leader. All of America (and the rest of the world) will have to admit that Chicago is manifestly "pro-German," a city of German spirit in the best sense of the word, if Sweitzer, the German candidate, is elected mayor next April.</p>
   <p>Every good German should work for the attainment of this goal. It is the duty of all good Germans to make Sweitzer's election unanimous, as far as the German element is concerned.</p>
