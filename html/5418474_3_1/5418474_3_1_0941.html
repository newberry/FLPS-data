   <p>The Socialists Petersen, Editor of the "Nye Tid", and Grottkau, collaborator of the Arbeiter Zeitung have been expelled from the party because they defended the Socialist program against Greenback-ism.</p>
   <p>The newest standpoint of the political movement is this, that it is not permitted, within the socialist party any longer, to defend Socialism against over-watering. The free expression of opinion is not only suppressed, but it is punished by expelling the member from the party. The Socialists are removed from the party, because they dared to have a different opinion from Philipp von Patten and his followers in Chicago concerning the parleys of the Socialist Delegates to the Greenback Convention on June 9th. There should have been a primary ballot within the Socialist party. The expelled Socialists, Petersen and Grottkau, were so foolish as to take this voting seriously and to conclude: Every election has to be preceded by a consideration of circumstances. A consideration takes place only, if they hear the "pro and con" of a matter and examine same. Without discussion no consideration, therefore they started a discussion which was directed against the Compromise with other <span class="page-break">\2</span>parties, also against the Greenbackers and in favor of pure socialism.-</p>
   <p>And if the members, before the voting, should not have the right to express their opinion, why do they let them vote at all? Suffice it, that Van Patten and his followers will not permit even before the voting to have any opposition against their opinion and decisions said or written. The voting therefore is under such circumstances, nothing but a gamble with cards shuffled in advance. Petersen and Grottkau, who had the courage to tell the members before the voting, that nothing good could be expected from Greenbackers, who were directed by Machine Politicians, that every compromise is unworthy of the socialists-and for their audacity they were expelled.</p>
   <p>The Arbeiter Zeitung will receive these official declarations, and we shall not fail to publish same. The next General Section Meeting should sanction the decisions, which were passed yesterday, and we intend to come back to this matter frequently after theis.</p>
