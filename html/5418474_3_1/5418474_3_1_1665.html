   <p>I was nominated as a candidate for City Treasurer without having sought the office and contrary to my desire.</p>
   <p>After voicing many objections, I accepted the candidacy, because no good citizen should refuse a public office if his fellow citizens see fit to choose him.</p>
   <p>Because of my nomination, several personal plans--among them an extended journey to Europe which I had contemplated--had to be changed. And, since I am not a voluntary candidate in the true sense of the word, I would not like to be defeated in the coming election. For this reason, I ask my fellow German citizens for their vote, and assure them that I shall represent their interests whenever the occasion arises, and that I shall not misappropriate a penny of the money entrusted to me when transferring the city's account to my successor.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Wm. C. Seipp</p>
