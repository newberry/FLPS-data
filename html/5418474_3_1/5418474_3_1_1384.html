   <p>"I Thank the Germans from the bottom of my heart. They have stuck to me faithfully. Especially the members of the same race on the Northside, who have shown their confidence and supported me energetically."</p>
   <p>These words were addressed by Mayor Busse this noon, in his business locality on Sedgwick Street, to a reporter of the Abendpost, where he expressed his gratitude to the Germans who supported him so manimously, thereby helping him to achieve the victory. It was a continuous coming and going in the locality which serves as a home to the Busse Coal Co. Political friends and supporters came to congratulate the newly-elected mayor.</p>
