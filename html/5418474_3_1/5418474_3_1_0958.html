   <p>Last night, in Hoff's Hall, 703 Milwaukee Avenue, Mr. F. Bielefeld, gave an interesting lecture for the Socialists on emigration to America, and about the increase of same every year with especial reference to German immigration.</p>
   <p>The speaker brought out that one of the major reasons was high taxation and why. On account of the expenses of a large standing army. He pointed out that we should mix with these newcomers and get them united with us before the rich factories get them for small wages. The big men are tickled pink to see the immigrants, unaccustomed to our wages, go to work for them.</p>
   <p>The speaker received great applause.</p>
