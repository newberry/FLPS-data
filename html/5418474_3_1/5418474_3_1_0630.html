   <p>Benjamin Harrison is not only President of the United States and in certain respects the "first gentleman" of the country; he is also a pillar of the church, an admirer of all the virtues which distinguish only true Christians, a man of "immaculate reputation" and a fierce lover of the law, which even induced him twelve years ago to shoulder a rifle and join the ranks of the militia as a volunteer in order to shoot down hungry laborers whom desperation drove out on the streets.</p>
   <p>Could anybody exalt a citizen's virtue to a higher degree than by showing his willingness to murder helpless human beings?</p>
