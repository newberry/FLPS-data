   <p>In November last year four men were murdered in Chicago, one driven to commit suicide and two others buried in prisons for the rest of their lives. What have these men done? The only thing that could be proved with the aid of all possible legal tricks was that they might once have thought, said or written something which might have led to the throwing of a bomb by an unknown person on the Haymarket.</p>
   <p>That any one of the accused had any personal contact with the unknown bomb thrower or influenced him in any way to throw a bomb was not mentioned in the sentence and naturally not proved. In spite of this purely circumstantial evidence and although everything possible was done by the working class to secure justice for its pioneers, the judicial murder sentence was carried out.</p>
