   <p>Things are always different from the way you think they are. When the government announced its plan to regulate the country's industry, the assumption was made by many that this would mean the end of the unions. This assumption was apparently justified because, since the government regulates wages and time of work, the unions appeared to be superfluous. But even in this case it turned out differently for, from the reports we receive from numerous parts of the country, it appears that the unions are using the opportunity to strengthen their position and to solicit new members, It is obvious that they are successful.</p>
   <p>One might suppose that labor struggles are out of the question under the domination of the N R A, and that all the workers are now peacefully encamped beneath the pinions of the blue eagle. But this is by no means the case. Reports come from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, New York, Illinois, and many other states telling of furious struggles in the industries. Especially in Pennsylvania, with its large coal and steel industry, strikes are the order of the day. It is reported that workers crowd together, go from one mine or steel mill to the other, and call upon those willing to work to join them.</p>
   <p>Strange that neither the leaders of the workers nor the proper authorities should be clear as to the causes of the strike! It is reported from many directions that communist agitators are in back of the movement, but this is always claimed in this country on every similar occasion, and it never sounds particularly plausible.</p>
   <p>According to other reports, strikers are, in the majority of instances, union men and especially persons who only recently joined the organizations.</p>
   
   <p>The statement was made that organizers have been zealously active in recent months, making it clear to the workers that they could reap the best advantages from N R A if they belonged to the American Federation of Labor. The new members, it seems, are now disappointed with the advantages they expected by joining the federation. There may be some trouble caused by radical elements in it.</p>
   <p>It must, of course, not be overlooked that there is such a thing as strike fever. There are malcontents at all times and they are naturally prepared to agitate and to take advantage of the upheavals that came in the wake of the introduction of the N R A. Others are permitting themselves to be infected, and a general strike is on its way. Henry Ford, too, is giving the heads of the N R A much to do. He has not yet signed the code for the automobile industry, and this was obviously regarded by many workers of several Ford factories as sufficient ground for a strike.</p>
   
   <p>The chairman of the labor relations board, Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, has issued a number of venomous statements which seem to refer to the obstreperous flivver magnate of Detroit. But, until now, nothing of importance has been done against him. The government has sent men to the various strike areas to try to bring about a settlement. Senator Wagner himself designates the strikes as children's diseases which were to be expected from the upheavals, and which will shortly disappear.</p>
   <p>It is quite remarkable that little or nothing is reported concerning the demands of the strikers. In some instances, the strikers seek to enforce their right to organize. Many of the miners apparently went on strike in an effort to induce their comrades who work in other mines to join the union. At all events, it is quite clear from what happened that government regulation is one insurance against workers' wars. It even seems that, in some cases, they were incited by the regulations.</p>
