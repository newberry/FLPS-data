   <p>The Socialist Convention which was held last night in Meridian Hall, 99 West Randolph Street, was opened by T. J. Morgan.</p>
   <p>A. R. Parsons was appointed chairman; Frank Bielefeld, vice-president; and August Spiess, secretary.</p>
   <p>On Mr. Bishop's suggestion Mr. Healy, a member of the Eight-Hour League, was given permission to address the meeting. After having cautioned the workers' organizations to preserve unity, he then emphasized the main points of the platform of the organization to which he belongs. These platform planks were in complete accord with the principles of the workers' associations. At the request of the speaker Morgan read the platform of the eight-Hour League. At the conclusion of his address Healy talked of the necessity of a canal connection with the Mississippi River via the Illinois River. He ended his talk by enlisting the good will of the convention for the League to which he belonged.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Morgan declared that the Socialist Workers' party had convened for the purpose of nominating candidates for the election and that, therefore, the platform of a newly organized party, founded only eight days ago, could not be discussed at the present time.</p>
   <p>The four Socialist alderman, Stauber, Meier, Altpeter, and Lorenz, were invited to be seated on the platform.</p>
   <p>Alderman Meyer declared that he and his colleagues had been asked by [party] headquarters to give a report regarding their activities in the City Council, but that this request had come too late to be complied with. He explained that lately their hands had been filled with business, and that there had been no opportunity to prepare a report within such a short time. He said that they would try to make up for it, however. Alderman Stauber agreed to these observations.</p>
   <p>Alderman Altpeter congratulated the party upon its efficient representation in the <span class="page-break">3</span>City Council by Aldermen Meier and Stauber. He declared that these men had helped to put over ordinances which had proved of incalculable value to the Workers' party, and said he hoped that the party would further avail itself of the services of these two young men.</p>
   <p>Morgan moved that these four aldermen be voted the gratitude of the party for their great services; the motion was carried unanimously.</p>
   <p>The platform of the National Convention of the Socialist party, read by Morgan, is almost identical with that of last year.</p>
   <p>Alderman Meyer wanted to insert a paragraph calling for limitations on the railroad monopoly. The railroads have been taking possession of any streets that might enable them to gain a right of way into the city of Chicago; he advocated that each section of the city should have a central station and that the railroad companies should be assigned certain rights of way on which to lay their tracks. Then a small property owner need never awaken some fine morning to find a train <span class="page-break">4</span>chugging by his front yard. It was resolved that the matter be referred to the Central Committee with the request that it formulate a suitable platform plank.</p>
   <p>There followed an endless discussion on the various provisions of the platform: the municipal bond issue, which, according to the platform, should be in denominations; and the clause relative to control over the elevated lines, which Alderman Altpeter wanted to have stricken altogether in order to prevent the construction of such railroads. Finally the platform was adopted.</p>
   <p>Then Bowler reported a resolution to the effect that the only candidates to the party should be the ones appointed at this convention, and that the Central Committee should have no right to call another convention. The resolution was adopted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Clemens' nomination as alderman of the First Ward was unanimously approved; for the Second Ward, Henry Appel; the Third Ward, C. S. White; the Fourth Ward, Reinhard Muenster; the Fifth Ward, Thomas Ryan; (T. J. Morgan, who was also <span class="page-break">5</span>nominated, declined and received a minority vote.)</p>
   <p>Martin Baumrucker was suggested for the Sixth Ward. Sullivan opposed his nomination on the grounds that he did not speak English well enough to be able to present the cause of the Ward properly in the City Council. Alderman Altpeter denied this, and a heated argument ensued between the followers of the German, Baumrucker, and the Irishman, Tim O'Mara, who had also been nominated but had declined. Finally Baumrucker won the nomination.</p>
   <p>For the Seventh Ward Frank Bielefeld was suggested, but he declined definitely, and suggested Mr. James Gorman. On Morgan's motion, the refusal of Bielefeld was put on the table and the latter was forced to accept the nomination. George Krix was nominated for the Eigth Ward; the Ninth Ward, J. R. Pratt; the Tenth Ward, Robert Beck; the Eleventh Ward, A. M. Glasgow; the Twelth Ward, Dr. D. Colton.</p>
   <p>For the Thirteenth Ward George Brown was suggested, but he definitely declined. The nomination was left up to the Central Committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>For the Fourteenth Ward, Frank Stauber was nominated; for the Fifteenth Ward, John K. Soller; for the Sixteenth Ward, Henry Stahl; for the Seventeenth Ward, Alfred Gould.</p>
   <p>Eugene Wittmann, who was suggested for the Eighteenth Ward, declined. Hermann Tintjer was nominated in his stead.</p>
   <p>After the appointment of a collection committee, the Convention took up the nomination of the candidates for the town offices, with the following results (in case officers for all three towns are to be elected):</p>
   <p>South Town: Collector, Wm. Smith; Supervisor, Chas. Kelly; Clerk, John Ryan; Assesor, A. B. Juergens.</p>
   <p>West Town: Collector, August Spiess; Supervisor, Rudolph Hartmann; Clerk, John Fossel. After Dan Sullivan declined, the nomination of assessor was referred to the Central Committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>North Town: The following names were selected from the several tickets: Collector, J. C. Warner; Supervisor, John Peterson; Clerk, Frank Hirth; Assessor, Edward Weissert.</p>
   <p>The case officers are to be elected for one town only: Collector, J. C. Warner; Supervisor, Wm. Smith; Clerk, Frank Hirth; Assessor, Tim O'Mara.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
