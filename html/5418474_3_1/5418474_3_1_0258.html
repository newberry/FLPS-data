   <p>Powderly's latest treatise about the mode of living among the Huns is very interesting although we are sorry to say not true.</p>
   <p>This general foreman has forgotten or overlooked that the said Huns lasted and fought the longest during all the strikes in the coke region and even kept on while Powderly and his pitiful henchmen were already retreating and partially giving up.</p>
   <p>The Huns are not satisfied with the starvation wages being given by the representatives of the robber protective custom system which is being so ardently defended by the general foreman.</p>
