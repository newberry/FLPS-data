   <p>The Socialists of the Northside held their regular meeting Monday in the Thuringer Halle. There was no weekly report made, because several business matters had to be attended to. It was resolved that at the next picnic a procession with decorations should take place, and that the "Group," to cover the previous expenses, will tax every member in good standing 25Â¢.</p>
   <p>To complement the Arrangement Committee, Comrades Pollin and Hirschberger were elected. Comrades Renter and Polling were added to the Committee which arranges the Basket Picnic of the three Northside Groups. A call of the German Comrades was debated, and the "Group" decided to leave it to its members to act individually in the matter.</p>
