   <p>"The present mayoralty campaign will definitely decide the issues and controversies between Harrison and Altgeld. The uncertainty regarding Altgeld's real strength is an element of grave concern to Harrison. If the convention would be called at an early date, then this strength could be ascertained, and then there is still sufficient time available, to enable the 'Harrisonites' to convert some of Altgeld's followers. This suits the experienced politician Altgeld, it fits into his schemes, if the regular Democratic City-Convention is post-poned, since he is not able to promote an extensive election campaign, as he lacks the physicial stamina and the necessary funds. However, he is fully able, to follow the mayor from one election meeting to another, where he can publically discuss Harrison's speeches and incidently, defend his own views.</p>
   <p>Altgeld after all, has a great magnetic personality, which holds sway over many voters and it would be a serious political blunder to under-estimate his power.</p>

   <p>The Ex-Governor will never be elected. If the Harrison adherants become convinced, that they are fighting for 'a lost cause', then the majority of them will follow the band-wagon into the Republican camp rather, than to let the 'bolter' Altgeld carry the emblem of the Democratic party. But even in this case, the 'bolter' will have reached his goal, the fall of Harrison,-undismayed that his own political future has undoubtedly been destroyed by such machinations."</p>
