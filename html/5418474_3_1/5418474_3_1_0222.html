   <p>You have published an article in today's issue wherein you say, that the strike at the Schmidt Bakery on Clybourne Avenue is unjustified and, amongst other statements you claim that the Schmidt Baking Company only ascertained the reasons for this strike in the press, and that Schmidt had made a contract with the majority of his men, which does not expire until July, 1892. I beg, that you may also show the other side:</p>
   <p>1. Mr. Schmidt has not first read about the grievances in the press, instead he was informed by a committee of the two German Bakery Unions, eight days before the strike, and, in order to settle the controversy peaceably, on the very evening prior to the strike, a committee was sent to Mr. Schmidt. He dismissed them with the words, that it was immaterial to him, whether his men strike now, or on May 1st.</p>
   <p>2. Only a minority of Mr. Schmidt's employees, merely 11 men signed the agreement. Thereby they committed an offense against their co-workers, since the rules of the organization do not permit separate contracts with individual members, without <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the knowledge of the union.</p>
   <p>3. It is not true, that Mr. Schmidt has obtained substitutes, since in several German and English papers, want ads offered jobs there, and today, the Swedish Bakers also joined in the walk out.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
