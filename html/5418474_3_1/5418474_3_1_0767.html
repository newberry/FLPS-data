   <p>The meeting of the I. A. A. which was called upon motion of Mr. Alexander Jonas, was held yesterday evening. Comrade Lange Presided. Mr. Jonas held a short address in which he brought forward the following questions to be answered:</p>
   <p>1) Are there differences of principle between us or are there personal motives?</p>
   <p>2) Are you Anarchists, who stand on the ground of classical Anarchism- in this case no thought could be given to a union- or are you Communists, and if so, what separates us? Why then the unfortunate quarrel, which cripples propaganda?-</p>
   <p>The speaker gave a short description of the controversial question, which has for over four years, separated the two most important workers' newspapers of the country. He accused the local Arbeiter Zeitung, that they <span class="page-break">\2</span>did not publish in full, shortly after the Congress in Baltimore, an article referring to the "Freiheit" and requested the answering of his questions. Comrade Spies replied that before answering the question-"Whether Anarchists or Communists", we have to define first what Anarchism signifies. According to his conception, modern anarchism which is principally noticeable in Latin countries and in Russia, is nothing else but Communism.</p>
   <p>Besides, the I. A. A. was described by others as anarchistic, although Mr. Jonas himself admitted, that the Pittsburgh Manifesto was Communistic.- In regard to the insertion mentioned the speaker asked Mr. Jonas, whether he made the declaration against the I. A. A. as a Baltimore reporter implied? Mr. Jonas disavowed the question. Spies continued and said, that the reporter asserted that Mr. Jonas read a copy of the interview, before it went to press. Therefore Mr. Jonas had no right to complain about the "Arbeiter Zeitung."</p>
   <p>Schwab, a correspondent of the New York Volkszeitung, stated lately that Engels and Bebel were anarchists. The Social Democrat answered, that not those but the correspondent was an anarchist. As long as people are not <span class="page-break">\3</span>clear about the conception of anarchism, the question of Anarchists vs. Communists is unjustified.</p>
   <p>Comrade Grottkau: I also am of the opinion, that there is a difference between anarchism and communism. The one wants individualism, the other solidarity. I consider that the quarrel is of a personal nature. The two organizations could agitate side by side. They don't have to oppose each other as enemies. Comrade Ray: There are members of the S. A. P. who provoke and instigate the scandal; who slander and disgrace us. The "New York Volks Zeitung" made itself a partner in this contemptible fight. An alliance, with men, who have to be extricated from the gutters where they are sprawled drunk once or twice a week. We respectable people could not associate with them.- We leave them alone and ask that they do the same.</p>
   <p>Fehling: Spoke about the origin of the German "Anarchists". They were people who resisted the papal edicts of Zurich. He condemns reforms only, because they cannot be carried out under the corrupt conditions.- Further <span class="page-break">\4</span>speakers were Blume, M. Schwab, Spies, Kiessling, Rau and Grottkau. Mr. Jonas was given the opportunity to answer every speaker. The question whether the "New Yorker Volkszeitung" had not to be paid for publishing notices of the I. A. A. meetings, he answered in the affirmative.</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting he declared, that whether they agitate separately or side by side, he nevertheless hopes, that some day they will attack jointly.-</p>
   <p>The meeting was peaceful and very orderly.</p>
