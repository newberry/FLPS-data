   <p>The strike of printers on the Freie Presse,Abendpost, Tageblatt, and Rundshan was extended yesterday by the action of the English unions in calling out the stereotypers and pressmen. Other features of the strike were a resort to violence and other illegal methods. After receiving the order the stereotypers quit to a man in all the offices but that of the Freie Presse, where but a part of the force quit. All the papers were set up in the Freie Presse, but the stereotyping and presswork were to have been done in the separate offices. The strike of the stereotypers and pressmen prevented the Tageblatt from getting its issue on the streets in time. "It was an outrage for these English stereotypers to strike without giving us a chance to be heard" said Mr. Michaelis of the Freie Presse." English papers have been misrepresenting us as to our salary list. The printers on day work earned in six days of eight hours from $18 to $20 a week and on night work from $20 upwards. When the strike was on in the Staats Zeitung we did not abuse that paper. We treated that paper fairly. The strikers have however, succeeded in placing their appeals as advertisements in the Staats Zeitung.</p>
   
   <p>We favored arbitration and have been fair throughout the fight and will stand by our position." A hallway leading to the Freie Presse composing rooms was the scene of violence at 9:30 o'clock last night Samuel Dunker and Joseph Markanpang, non-union printers on the Freie Presse,were assaulted, it is claimed by striking union printers Reinhold Foersteling and George Schuvik, a leader among the strikers, who, it is said, invited his fellows, were both arrested by Officer Stephans, who was detailed at the building an unknown man who with Foersteling hid himself in a closet of the hallway to await the appearance of the printers for work, escaped. Markanpang was struck in the face by a blunt instrument and a cut an inch long was inflicted on his face. Markanpang says, the two strikers sprang upon them from the closet. Foersteling struck Markanpang knocking him down, while the other attacked Dunker. There was trouble earlier in the day. Two attempts to ruin machinery were discovered in the Tageblatt and Abendpost offices. In the former office depredations were averted by a timely inspection of the presses, but in the stereotyping department of the Abendpost a nominal damage was done. In the intricate machinery of the Tageblatt's press, hidden from view, were some copper wires firmly coiled in such a manner that at the first motion of the coys of the presses would be almost ruined. The wires were removed and the edition of the paper was run off. Later in the afternoon stereotypers from the Freie Presse were sent to the Abendpost office to get off the afternoon edition.</p>
   
   <p>They found that a number of crews had been removed from the machinery as soon as a start was made the large belt through which power is conveyed to the machinery left its bearings, the entire plant was thrown out of gear and the forms were multilated. The breakage caused a delay of four hours. Mr. Glogauer of the Abendpost says that he knows who is responsible for the damage and that prosecutions will follow extra policemen were detailed last all the offices where the strike is in progress. The strikers declare that they are not responsible for the attempts to injure machinery and charge that the mischief was done by persons on the other side to call away sympathy from the union men. The strikers yesterday issued the Agitator, which sets forth their claims making no disturbance. The Arbeiter Zeitung is now poking fun at its German contemporaries and advocating the cause of the strikers. Job printers will ask an increase in the scale from thirty-five to forty cents per 1,000 ems May 2. So typographical Union No. 16 has ordered proprietors will be given the option of employing men at $18, $17 and $16 a week, but will be required to make contracts for a year. It is believed there will be little trouble in securing these concessions.</p>
   
   <p>A conference was held last evening between John C. Harding and M. W. Madden of Typographical Union No. 16 and the publisher. Madden said at the conference. "The publishers are in a flury. They could not be brought down to business. We assured them, we could settle the matter in justice to all. We were called in by them to act in the matter. We asked them to reduce to writing, what they were willing to do and there the affair stands.</p>
   <p>Late last night a dozen of the striking printers gathered at the foot of the stairway leading to the Freie Presse composing rooms. They taunted everybody who passed in and out of the doorway, and tried to bribe the messenger boys to bring copies of the paper from the press room. Officer Stephans ordered them away, and Joseph Solum and John Sirus told him to mind his own business. The officer placed Solum under arrest and Sirus interfered, saying that he would stand by a Union printer to the death. Officer McLann appeared, and the two belligerent typos were locked up. Senor Back another printer, who was found in the hall near the composing room was also ousted.</p>
