   <p>The Socialist Club of the Northwest side held last night a well attended meeting in Nutzhorn's hall. Comrade Adolph Fischer gave an interesting speech on the topic: " Is Freedom in Today's Society Imaginable?" The speaker proved, that the only real freedom could not be reconciled with the interests of capitalism and therefore could not exist in the midst of to-day's corrupt social system.</p>
   <p>Only after the present society has been overthrown and the free communistic society has taken its place, can true freedom develop. The speaker in a convincing way explained, that the present laws are contrary to reason and nature, and that there always will be oppressors and oppressed as long as there exists any trace of laws. The place of to-day's laws would be taken by common sense which now a days is crippled and weakened, and common sense would guide people in all their actions in a free society.</p>
   <p>Common sense will perfect itself in the free society, because there no obstructions will bar its way.</p>
