   <p>A large crowd filled the halls of the "Vorwarts Turnhalle" at West 12th Street, yesterday, About twenty clubs mostly singing and athletic had arranged a large concert and ball for the benefit of the families of the executed anarchists. The"Central Labor Union, "and the"Pioneer Aid and Support Association" cooperated, and the program was well arranged and carried out brilliantly. The audience, being estimated at 7,000 persons, refrained from all demonstration, and nothing betrayed the character of the gathering with the exception of a few red flowers and red bands, which some of the guests carried. The whole affair made upon the visitors the impression that it was a cheerful gathering and that all were enjoying the skillful performances of the singers, the musicians, and the athletes. Some of the numbers were rendered, indeed, with such marvelous skill that there was evidence of true understanding and commendable zeal on the part of the performers to created real enjoyment in the audience.</p>
