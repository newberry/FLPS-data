   <p>A very good and well attended meeting took place yesterday afternoon in Schmidt's place 416 N. 25th Street at 3 o'clock. The agent of the German Section, M. G. Bartels, opened the meeting and functioned as chairman. The order of business was the Autumn Election and the Press. It has been ascertained that the reviewer, Comrade P. Grottkau, had not put in an appearance and the chairman and Albrecht Strehlaw took over the review. Both speakers in a lengthy debate pointed out that the Capitalistic Press tries to destroy workman's organizations. The socialistic workers organization is entirely against any combinations even with the Greenback movement, as also this party will not be in the position to remove the exploitation of the individual by others. The workers party can only gain strength by the maintenance of the Socialist ideas and principles. General approval has been expressed to joining the Socialist Workers Association and supporting energetically the Workmen's newspaper, to encourage the members in their battle against inside and outside enemies <span class="page-break">\2</span>and to continue in the way they have started. Afterwards the chairman excused the absence of Mr. Grottkau and the meeting was adjourned. Just then, some members had already left, the Reviewer, P. Grottkau, arrived. The meeting was reopened and member Grottkau made a speech which had general approval. Several other members wanted to speak and afterwards all agreed to do their best for the development of the press.</p>
