   <p>Delegates of nine German singing societies met last night in Pfaff's saloon to discuss the program for the November 11th memorial celebration in Waldheim.</p>
   <p>The report ends with the last lines of the song selected, with the title: "On the grave of our friends."</p>
   <p>"Rest then you beloved brothers,</p>
   <p>Rest quietly in the dark of the graves,</p>
   <p>Praising you are our songs</p>
   <p>You fulfilled your work,</p>
   <p>Rest quietly in the dark of the grave"-</p>
