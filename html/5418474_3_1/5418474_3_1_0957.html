   <p>The Associated Press publishes a telegram, according to which, the convention of the Socialist Labor Party on June 8th in Chicago, will nominate General Butler as Presidential Candidate of this party. This news is in every respect premature, because even the main question, whether the Socialist Party is going to have a candidate has been undecided so far.</p>
   <p>The convention will have to take this matter up and even supposing that, the decision is favorable, the indorsement of General Butler has not been considered.</p>
   <p>A decision for the entire party can not be deduced from it.</p>
