   <p>These three men have conducted themselves very satisfactorily since their liberation. They surely had ample opportunities to conduct themselves as martyrs but tactfully resisted such a temptation. When they had to make speeches they behaved faultlessly. They appeared before the alliance which had obtained their liberation, the Amnesty Association, in order to express their profound thanks to all those who had worked for their cause.</p>
   <p>Neebe and Schwab gave their heartfelt thanks also to the good men and women who joined the movement of the "Personal Rights League," which had requested gubernatorial intervention. Neebe emphasized, that among those who interceded so fervently, were people of all political parties. Schwab offered special thanks to the many labor organizations and the host of prominent men who, although they did not share their views, came to their rescue, because they believed that the three had been punished enough.</p>
   <p>Particularly touching were Fielden's words of gratitude. After thanking every one most fervently he said, his eyes dimmed with tears: "Our seven years imprisonment was a greater hardship for our families than for us. In <span class="page-break">2</span>the name of my family I thank all who took an interest in me. When you return to your respective homes today and look at your wives and children, then your hearts will tell you: 'It was a good action to have restored them to their families.'"</p>
   <p>The three men professed deep appreciation for Governor Altgeld's intercession.</p>
