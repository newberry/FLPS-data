   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung is sorry to have to deliver to its readers today an incomplete paper. Last night the typographers went on strike and it was impossible to secure substitutes on such short notice. For that reason we were unable to print the local news. The Staats Zeitung feels that it has always fulfilled the just requests of its typographers.</p>
   <p>For over ten years it has paid them the union wage although the majority of the German newspapers pay at least five cents less. Now the typographers not only want five cents more than is paid here in Chicago by any newspaper, but also a guarantee that this rate will be paid for the next six months. The news we had to omit today will be published later.</p>
