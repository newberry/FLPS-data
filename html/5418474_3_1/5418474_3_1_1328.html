   <p>Carter H. Harrison for Mayor</p>
   <p>and to induce your family members and friends to do likewise.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison is honest. Not even his worst enemies dare deny that.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison has labored ceaselessly for the progress of our city, which today has the admiration of the world. This, too, is admitted.</p>

   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Water, telephone, gas and electric light rates have been reduced. Harbor improvements, a Union Station, bathing beaches, hospital construction, the widening of Twelfth Street and Michigan Boulevard and other enterprises important for Chicago's future development have been successfully started. Nobody denies that.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison has treated the Germans not only fairly, but with special sympathy, and in questions of personal freedom he has always acted according to his principles. We Germans know this and appreciate it. Are we now, as citizens and Germans, to become guilty of gross ingratitude? Never! Harrison's opponent, for lack of any plausible argument which would speak in his favor, has resorted to a cheap demagogic trick. He poses as a German. It has been proven irrefutably that he has no right whatever to call himself such.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison is honest, educated and experienced. Carter H. Harrison is and always has been independent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>His opponent is and has been the tool of the Ogden gas magnates, Roger C. Sullivan, John P. Hopkins, and others. German men and women! Be true to yourselves! Stay on the right track! Vote for the interest of your city and its future! Dubious experiments are dangerous and expensive for the taxpayer.</p>
   <p>Vote for Carter H. Harrison</p>
