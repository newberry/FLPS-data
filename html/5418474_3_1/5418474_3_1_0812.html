   <p>The Club "Bridgeport" held its regular agitation meeting yesterday. Comrade Bergman presided. They began with the criticism of the proposition to set aside the economic wage laws of F.O. Ures. There followed a lively debate.</p>
   <p>The delegate of the general committee made his report. Because the question whether Bebel should be invited for an agitation tour has been referred to the different groups, and as the group "Bridgeport" voted in the affirmative, Comrade Herwig was delegated to get in touch with the partly elected committees of the other groups. An invitation was extended to all to participate in the Saturday evening party.</p>
