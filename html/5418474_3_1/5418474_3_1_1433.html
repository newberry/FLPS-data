   <p>The German Democrats of the 21st Senate-District are on the warpath. They want to boost the candidacy of a German Democrat, whereas the political boss of that district is favoring J. H. Farrell, who is an oldtimer in the political game.</p>
   <p>The German group is threatening to bolt and vote for the Populist Christian Meyer, in case the German Democratic candidate does not get a free run. Also in other districts, the German-Americans, regardless of party lines, seem to work hard towards one object...to arouse the German population in favor of German political leaders.</p>
