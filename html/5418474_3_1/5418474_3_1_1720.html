   <p>I shall not retranslate the article of the Chicago Tribune, I am sure this article has been transcribed by the one who worked on the Chicago Tribune I shall give here only the comments of the Staats Zeitung concerning the article of the Chicago Tribune. Recognition must be given the Chicago Tribune for having judged the union of the Germans so impartially. While it hits the nail on the head in many points, there are nevertheless a few errors. There is no time to correct them now. Today we only wish to say that neither Mr. Hesing nor the Illinois Staats Zeitung are claiming any leadership, but only give expression to the feelings and wishes of the Germans. It was evident that as soon as Medill became a fool of temperance fanatics, that Germans could not belong any longer to the regular Republican party. If the Tribune wishes to remain faithful to its past, it must support the Germans with all its energy in this fight.</p>
