   <p>The union of all the Germans which had such an auspicious start yesterday, created excitement also in American milieus. Many Americans, who in spite of all the friendliness shown them by Germans, either directly supported the temperance fanatics or said nothing against them are now beginning to sing the first stanza of the contrition song.</p>
   <p>Among the Germans joy is unanimous because they have been able to forget their dissensions in order to be united against the common enemy. Only if the Germans remain united can they hope for victory in the next fall elections.</p>
