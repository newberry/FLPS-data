   <p>At the meeting called for Saturday evening in the Arbeiter Halle corner Sedgwick and Blackhawk Streets, for the German citizens' candidate, General Lieb, disgraceful scenes were enacted. Irishmen, supposedly, hired rowdies, started, during the speeches, to make such terrible noises, that the speakers could hardly be understood-declaring that they will not listen to anything that is "Dutch" and actually compelled the principal speaker, to continue before a German audience exclusively in English.</p>
   <p>The 22nd Ward, has among its 6200 voters, only 200 Irish votes and one of them is the famous Captain Farrell. Shall he, with his 200 followers, be able to beat you tomorrow at the polls, you other 6000 voters of the 22nd Ward?</p>
