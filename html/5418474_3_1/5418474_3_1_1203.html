   <p>The struggle for the primaries has passed. Tomorrow the voting citizens of all parties will have the opportunity to select those men--in individual cases also women--whom they consider worthy of being vested with certain offices for which the votes will be cast in November.</p>
   <p>There are to be nominated: county judge, sheriff, county treasurer, county clerk, probate judge, probate clerk, clerk of the criminal court, superintendent of county schools, three members of the tax board (two for the full period of six years and one for the vacancy caused by the death of M. K. Sheridan), one member of the board of tax revisions, president of the county board, ten members of the county board in Chicago and five in the country districts of Cook County, three members of the board of the water department.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Furthermore, there is to be nominated a United States senator, a representative to Congress, state treasurer, state superintendent of schools, members of the State Senate and of the Assembly, clerk of the Supreme Court, a clerk of the Court of Appeals, members of the State board of executives (Vollziehungs-ausschuss) and twelve municipal judges for a period of six years.</p>
   <p>Each voter receives, besides the ballot upon which the names of the candidates are listed, two so-called "proposition ballots". Upon one of these, which is nearly as long as the ballot sheet of candidates, there are eighteen various bond issues for which your votes are needed. The other proposition ballot is for deciding the question of whether professional boxing matches should or should not be allowed.</p>
   <p>The primaries are strictly party elections. It should therefore not be decisive as to where the man of your choice belongs but what qualifications he is possessed of. Officers who have already proved their mettle should be given preference <span class="page-break">\3</span>where there are two or more applicants who would be otherwise equally recommendable.</p>
   <p>In cases where the candidates for an office are equally qualified and fit, voters of German extraction will certainly not fail to step in for those candidates who made declarations in favor of personal liberty and against hypocritical sanctimoniousness.</p>
   <p>Concerning the positions of municipal judges, it is here necessary to exclude politics more than in any of the other offices. One should choose persons who are well qualified for this office of responsibility. Among the large number of aspirants who are now again in the field those are recommended by the Abendpost to its readers who have received the endorsement of the Chicago Bar Association. At a tentative vote taken recently by the latter's members, the following candidates received the highest number of votes:</p>

   <p>The struggle for the primaries that has just come to a close was a particularily bitter one as far as the nomination for the office of United States senator is concerned. Senator William B. McKinley, who is running for renomination on the Republican ticket, has an opponent in the person of Frank L. Smith, who must not be underestimated. Respecting this office, the Abendpost refrains from making any recommendations. Senator McKinley, in unison with president Coolidge's politics which he supported, voted in favor of America's entry into the World Court. He never attempted to hide the fact that he is not particularily interested in efforts aimed at mitigating prohibition laws. Smith likewise was not to be moved to declare his views distinctly on the subject. On the other hand, he severely combated America's entry into the World Court and he promises, if he is elected, to work with all means at his disposal to have the resolution in its favor rescinded. He is emphatically in favor of preserving State rights against usurpations on the part of the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>[Here follows another number of candidates who are against or for repeal of the eighteenth amendment. The Abendpost is openly in favor of the latter. List omitted by translator.]</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The number of applicants for seats in the legislature is naturally a particularly large one. It would therefore be difficult to make recommendations in all cases. At any rate, the Abendpost regards it as its duty to recommend a limited number of candidates whom it knows to be reliable and liberal-minded: For the State Senate, Republicans Theodore R. Steinert and Hermann J. Haenisch, Democrat Thomas J. Courtney. For the House of Representatives, Republicans Arthur J. Nutshaw, Bailey Samelow, and Roy Inul, Democrats Thomas J. O'Grady, Michael L. Igoe, Charles H. Weber, Walter L. Orlikowski and James O'Toole.</p>
   <p>Let us add that you may give your candidate for the House of Representatives three votes in case you vote for one only.</p>
   <p>Besides the ballot containing the name of the candidates, every voter receives on Tuesday two so-called "proposition ballots". The larger one calls for the vote on eighteen different bond issues. The Abendpost advises its readers to vote for the first sixteen of them. The next question on the ballot, which no <span class="page-break">\6</span>one can understand, deals with money to be appropriated for the increase of salaries for clerks and attendants of the municipal court. The last question deals with a bond issue in connection with a small extra tax to be used for a zoological garden at Riverview. It must be left to the decision of the readers of the Abendpost whether they want to vote for the increase of salaries as mentioned. On the other hand, the Abendpost advises its readers to vote against the appropriation of money for a zoological garden. The ballot dealing with professional boxing matches is printed on a separate sheet. Here, too, the Abendpost advises its readers to vote against the proposition.</p>
