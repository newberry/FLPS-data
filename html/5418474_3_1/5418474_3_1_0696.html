   <p>Joe Cannon writes in the Labor Enquirer that all socialists, not belonging to a national party, should vote for a candidate who opposes the tariff, he coming closest to socialist principles. We agree with him that this is at present the best policy, but we decline to make it a matter of principle.</p>
   <p>What do principles mean to a smart American politician? For him there is but one principle, and that is to stay in office, and if he is outside to get in. Cleveland is in and Harrison is out, this is their principle and everything is governed by that.</p>
   <p>Both are, at present, enemies of the working class, reactionaries. We therefore propose and advise all our members to refrain from voting in this election for anyone except a 100% socialist and should feel sorry if our English speaking brethren are of a different opinion. We simply cannot join.</p>
