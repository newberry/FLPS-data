   <p>The Socialists of the Northwest Side held their regular meeting last night at Nutzhorn's Hall at which Comrade Kobitzsch presided. "Agitation in general" was the subject of discussion. Comrade Spies proposed to ask the Central Committee to grant a certain sum of money for the purchase of agitation matter, having in mind especially Mr. George's "Progress and Poverty" which should be obtained in English for the distribution among the English workers. This was accepted. Mr. Spies proposed further, that in future the opening of every meeting should be characterized by a Socialistic declamation. He proposed next, to send an agitator on a trip through Illinois and the neighboring States, which to decide upon is the task of the Central Committee. He declared, more agitation within the Illinois and Workers Societies is also necessary in the future.</p>
