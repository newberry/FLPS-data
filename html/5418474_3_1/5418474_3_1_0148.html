   <p>After July Fourth a day's work will be eight hours. That is the resolution of the "punks" who call themselves labor leaders. We wouldn't say anything about it, if these would-be dictators could at least prove that they actually worked for eight hours.</p>
   <p>To work eight hours out of twenty-four is not objectionable; the question is, "Who pays the piper?" One does not receive the same wage for eight hours as for ten; or, do the gentlemen believe the wage will be the same, or will even be increased?</p>
   <p>But, regardless of whether wages will increase or whether one works fewer hours, the price of necessities will rise. And what have the workers gained by that? Do the workers believe that the citizens can be bamboozled by the labor agitators, and that the consumers will willingly pay higher prices?</p>
   <p>we would like to know how these dictators intend to enforce their plan. If they repeat their acts of two years ago, they may find a fly in the ointment.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's Volksstimme Des Westens makes the following statement:</p>
   <p>"As our readers probably know, a movement was started to obtain a shortening of the working day; it is to be eight hours after July fourth.</p>
   <p>"Obviously, eight hours at present; then, later this will be reduced to six hours and--finally--no work at all."</p>
