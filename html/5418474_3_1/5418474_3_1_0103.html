   <p>Experience has taught us that the cost of living for the last decade has greatly increased, also that the prices of raw materials and goods have considerably advanced; while on the other hand no change of increase in wages is noticeable. Therefore, in order to equalize the wage conditions with the daily necessities of life, we decided to follow the example of other unions and found a union too, so that we could get in touch with others, in order to obtain, in a peaceful way, an increase in the present wages.</p>
   <p>As there is no danger of overproduction in our business, and consequently our employment is only a temporary one, we feel that we are even more entitled to obtain better wages, than other lines. At the same time, it is not our object to try to reduce the employers' profits, but to persuade them to obtain higher prices for their products, and by doing so to be in a position to pay the workers such wages which would enable them to lead a more humane existence.</p>
