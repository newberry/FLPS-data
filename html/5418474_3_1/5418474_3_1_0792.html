   <p>The meeting called for yesterday afternoon in Nutzhorn's Hall was well attended. Comrade Kinnemeyer, senior, presided. The first speaker, P. Grottkau, spoke at length on the rapid development of classes in this country.</p>
   <p>According to his views, last week's state-workers' convention contained the germs of Socialism. These elements are still in arrears, still immature, as could be observed by their resolutions. Referring to the elections, he said to condemn same would be foolish; we must fight with all means at our disposal, and to this belongs the right to elect. At the present moment it seems inadvisable--owing to the immature state of the movement-- to lay stress on the elections.</p>
   <p>After this, Comrade Parsons delivered a speech in English. A collection of the family of Comrade Stellmacher was taken up, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
