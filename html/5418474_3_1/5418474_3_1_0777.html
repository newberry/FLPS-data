   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the Socialist Labor Party, there were about two dozen members present who attended mostly to business matters. The Central Committee was entrusted with the arrangement of this party's picnic, which takes place the end of May. The publishing of a newspaper was discussed, and those present wanted to hear a report of the Central Committee first. Alexander Jonas, the famous New York Fox will honor Chicago with his visit in the near future.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to supply him with enough material. Should Mr. Jonas peruse this material, then the meetings will prove very amusing. George Sloan, who sinned against the authority of the S.A.P. about two years ago by starting an agitation on his own hook and received censure for it, was honored through the withdrawal of same. Winneu rose and declared with solemnity that anarchists and Socialists are not the same. In the course of the debate the anarchists were declared to be nothing but fools and scoundrels. The notorious thief of the Northwest Side was lauded as a hero.</p>
