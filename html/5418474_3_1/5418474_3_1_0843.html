   <p>Yesterday morning under the chairmanship of Comrade Lange a general meeting of the Socialist groups was held.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this meeting was to discuss congress matters and to elect delegates for the congress.</p>
   <p>A long and very interesting debate took place about the question whether the congress should create a party or an organization for propaganda. The decision was unanimously for the latter.</p>
   <p>An instruction for the delegates was moved and accepted containing the following sentences: We, the socialists of Chicago, resolve to authorize our delegates for this year's socialist congress in Pittsburgh, Pa., to act for us in the following way: It is the duty and task of all socialists in the United States of North America, to unite more closely to avoid party quarrels and to attack jointly and with force our common enemy, the capitalists, because the social battle requires a great determined, and self confident army of trained socialist workers.</p>
