   <p>An evidence of the interest taken by the Germans in the coming city election was afforded by the large attendance at Aurora Turner-Hall last evening at the Republican mass-meeting. The addresses of A. M. Wright, John Wentworth, and Emery A. Storrs contained good sound reasons why the Germans, who have almost invariably supported the Republican ticket in Chicago, should not desire the election of a Democratic Mayor, and more especially the kind of Democrat that Carter H. Harrison is.</p>
   <p>The election of Harrison would be a notification to all the world that Chicago approves of the party policy of which he is the exponent, and that the people of Chicago welcome the Southern Brigadiers as conquerors and rulers.</p>
