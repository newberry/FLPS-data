   <p>Saturday evening the bakers' union No. 49 intended to hold a memorial celebration in Mueller's Hall, N. Clark Street, for the martyrs of the judicial murder of November 11th. Because the gang of rogues, supposedly entrusted with keeping up order, has a tremendous horror of such meetings, many obstacles were imposed.</p>
   <p>The innkeepers, for instance, were informed that to rent their premises for the celebration in question would result in the revocation of their licenses. In order not to subject the innkeepers to police persecution or expose them to loss of their licenses - it was decided to desist from a celebration on these premises.</p>
   <p>A public celebration was therefore out of the question, and the union had to hold a secret meeting. The same took place that evening in a large hall, the location of which has not been made public. We have been asked, however, to publish the report of the meeting.</p>

   <p>The celebration was most dignified. The Choral Society of Union #49 contributed by singing several liberty-songs in an excellent manner. Mr. Christensen extolled the merits of the martyrs of Waldheim and Joliet and showed in what manner the last will of the departed ones must be understood and fulfilled.</p>
   <p>The common opinion was that the celebration could not have been more beautiful and impressive.</p>
