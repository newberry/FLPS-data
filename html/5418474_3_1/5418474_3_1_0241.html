   <p>The attack by Thomas Morgan last Saturday evening against George Schilling by the very small and unimportant English section of the SLP was unworthy of Morgan and unjustified.</p>
   <p>Morgan holds it against Schilling that he has lost every strike that was under his leadership. This seems to be too far-fetched. According to our knowledge Schilling was engaged as strike-leader in former years only in the great Stock Yards strike, 1886.</p>
   <p>Did he lose that strike? We do not think so. Mr. Morgan should be more careful. To give vent to personal animosity at such a time and in such a way is no nice and should not be tolerated because it is so dumb.</p>
