   <p>The army of organized workers marching through the streets of Chicago yesterday, represent the pioneers of all human progress. Mental work is unthinkable with out manual labor. Although the efforts and exertion of the inventors, of the heads of large industries and commercial institutions not only create work, but make it also more profitable, the fact remains, however, that the products of manual labor only make the existence of all so called mental labor possible.</p>
   <p>The gigantic progress in all departments of industry, the substitution of the individual masters of the crafts and trades by corporations and the individual skill of the worker by machinery, the seclusion of the guilds substituted by the unrestraint and the free movement of the modern factory workers have endangered that which was justly called the "dignity" of labor. Instead of the guild, which included the employer, and consisted of workers who entertained the prospect of becoming a master tradesman sooner or later, we have the trade unions, which are now the representatives of the large masses of skilled industrial labor.</p>
   <p>Nobody will question the right nor the necessity for such organizations. No intelligent and thinking worker will fail to recognize today that organized <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>labor in their fight with heartless corporations and capital achieved and maintained with force, higher wages shorter working hours, and a better standard of living in general. Politicians and so called national economists have tried very hard to convince the American worker of the infallible effects which "free trade" or "protective tariffs" would have upon their living conidtions. Free trade we have never tried; but as far as the effects of an extreme protectionism is concerned which is embodied in the McKinley bill, it can be ascertained that highly protected industrialists sing the praises of excessive tariffs, but the workers know that they must fight for better wages in spite of high tariffs, and that organization is the only method to secure a decent living, where the short sightedness of the employers can see an advantage only by oppressing the producers.</p>
   <p>Such colossal demonstrations, however, as we saw in Chicago yesterday, such vast masses of organized workers parading not only here, but in all larger cities of the United States, may arouse in the heads of many all sorts of absurd and untenable ideas. Even if we agree with our Socialist friends and concede the recognition of the theory of the right to work we must, nevertheless, admit that such a right involves the responsibility to accept work under conditions how and where it is offered. The economic liberty of the people should <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>go hand in hand with political freedom. The worker has a perfect right to strive for independence, just as we try to regulate our political affairs without kings or emperors, but economic liberty can not be achieved by blind submission to the dictates of labor leaders or certain organizations; it is just as impossible as to find political freedom in the servitude of party politics....</p>
   <p>The future belongs to the organized workers, unquestionably, but their responsibility increases with their power, and the individual worker must be increasingly alert, not to sacrifice the welfare of the people as a whole to the personal interests of individual labor leaders, or to the stupidity and absurdity of individuals or fanatics.</p>
