   <p>Yesterday we received the following telegram from Springfield:</p>
   <p>"Governor Beveridge has just dismissed Theodore Canisius, inspector of prisons, and has appointed Woodbury M. Taylor to the position."</p>
   <p>The significance of this simultaneous dismissal and appointment may well be summed up in the words: "Damn the Dutch".</p>
   <p>To our knowledge, Mr. Canisius was the only German who received a state office from the Republican governor. In 1872 Mr. Canisius had zealously and successfully worked for the candidates of the Republican party, and he was one of the few prominent Germans of the state who did not join the opposition party. However, he is a German, and by far the greater number of Germans have severed <span class="page-break">2</span>their connection with the Republican party, so: "Away with the Dutchman!" As long as his name could serve to lead German voters into the Republican fold, he was permitted to retain his office; but now that he has lost this influence, he is cast aside like a juiceless orange.</p>
   <p>The dismissal of Dr. Canisius signifies that the native American Republicans intend to give free rein to their hitherto ill-concealed hatred toward the Germans who are no longer their political allies. Now their true attitude, which is characterized by anger and narrow-minded contempt toward "the Dutch," comes to light. The raving of downstate members of the Republican party against German habits and customs is a result of a long concealed paroxysm of rage which has broken out with double fury. It is significant that all of Farwell's followers who are leaders in the various communities of the Third Congressional District were especially instrumental in fanning the smoldering hatred against Germans into a searing flame. Only in Chicago, where the Peoples party slapped their fingers and cut their claws, are they powerless, and they are so much meaner to Germans who reside outside of the city, in <span class="page-break">3</span>Waukegan, Lake Forest, Evanston, and other suburbs. Their watchword is: "Down with the Germans!"</p>
   <p>Woodbury M. Taylor, whom Governor Beveridge appointed inspector of prisons is the same mean, poisonous toad who slandered the Germans through articles published in the Evening Post. His appointment is a direct insult to all Germans, and the Evening Post is one of their most relentless enemies. Aside from this, Taylor's appointment means that Beveridge wants to rescue the influence of that half-bankrupt crowd in his endeavor to be elected to the Senate in place of Logan. No doubt, Beveridge is acting according to the adage: "Every little bit helps."</p>
   <p>However, we have not yet seen the end of this matter. We would like to remind the Governor of another proverb: "There is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip." There are indications that the regime of the Republican party in Illinois has seen its best days, and that in the election for the national senatorship it will be immaterial whether the Republican party, which meanwhile <span class="page-break">4</span>will have become the minority party, wants Beveridge or Logan.</p>
