   <p>Fellow Union Members!</p>
   <p>In last Saturday's edition the Illinois Staats Zeitung criticizes our Union alleging that we are interfering and trying to prevent local boys from learning the mason's trade.</p>
   <p>To this accusation we can only answer that the Bricklayer's Union has never interfered with any young man eager to become an apprentice. How can any youngster have any intention of working hard when he continually sees and hears, how all the wealthy have become Wich through laziness, robberies and speculation. They leave hard work to the "Dutchman."</p>
   <p>I therefore ask all masons who subscribe to this paper, to this paper, to immediately terminate their subscription. I will also move at the next meeting to boycott the Illinois Staats Zeitung and hope for your support. Signed George Muller.</p>
