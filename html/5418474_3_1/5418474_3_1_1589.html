   <p>Last night at 8 o'clock, a large audience gathered in the Aurora Turnhalle, to talk over today's Election. Many women were present. The audience was called to order and Comrade Goldwater was voted president and Comrade Spitz secretrary. The speaker, Ernest Schmidt, was introduced by the President. His speech was made in the German Language as follows: " Friends and Citizens; All of us who work from early morning to late at night for the purpose of supporting our families the best we know how should unite and try to understand, that in united effort is strength, and it is the only way we can gain our aim. But I am sorry to state that neither we nor our children shall see the day that the worker, the daily bread-winner will be the ruling force in our country. It is very strange that the capitalistic papers has not been throwing any mud at our alderman. The city council states that our 4 alderman were honorable and attended to their duties. The Staats-Zeitung was praising the conduct of our aldermen in general. We want people like that, men we can trust and depend on. On our ticket today we have men of a far better quality than the old parties ever had. Every fair minded man even if not a Socialist <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will on election day vote our way as he can understand that our candidates are working for the interests of the people. The Chicago Council, is not an organization that can impart communism especially, since 20 socialists are already in. We are American Citizens and work slow but sure. Therefore, towmorrow, everybody should bote a straight Socialist Ticket. It stands for liberty, social equality, and fraternity. Vote for alderman Stauber. His reputation is A-1 honest and loyal.</p>
