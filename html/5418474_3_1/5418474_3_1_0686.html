   <p>It is known to everybody that the local police with Bonfield at its head has lately done a new deed of vulgarity which in consequence will demand the sacrifice of four innocent men. These men have no means of support and are the heads of families. We think it the duty of every human being to secure at least able defense for their trial and collect the necessary money.</p>
   <p>A committee has been formed for that purpose and will meet tomorrow at Clark and Lake and requests the presence of a delegate of all progressive organizations then and there.</p>
   <p>New lists for collections will be issued in German, English and Bohemian.</p>
   <p>H. Rohlfs, Secretary.</p>
