   <p>The public has received the financial plan of the Administration with an equanimity that is astonishing. Since the War people have become accustomed to speaking and thinking in terms of billions; but it nevertheless would have been only natural if the budget message of the President had created surprise, wonder, and even panic among Republican publications and within financial circles. That, however, did not happen. Perhaps some were nonplussed by the brutal frankness with which the President submitted his proposals to Congress; but then they studied the message more closely and found that the figures are of astronomic proportions indeed. However they saw that the plans recommended are not fantastic.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the personality of the President has asserted itself. The people have confidence in him. In fact, they have so much confidence in him that even the most militant members of the Republican party do not dare to attack his ideas in general, nor his economic program in particular. Even conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Republican newspapers do not have the courage to oppose him. They are very shy about criticizing him, and approve of all plans of the Administration. And the reason for this implicit trust in the President is to be found in his personal characteristics. He is frank, he is courageous, and he is intelligent, and these qualities are all the more effective since for many years the leaders of our country have lacked them.</p>
   <p>The people ceased long ago to have any illusions regarding Harding. Coolidge was a plain, straightforward man who had a kind of "home-made" adroitness at his command; however, he was not equal to the great tasks which were connected with the office which fate bestowed upon him. He never had one original idea, nor was the really conscious of what went on about him. His trend of thought moved along in the same rut travelled by the better class of professional politicians. He did no damage, but he could do nothing constructive; and he would have failed utterly, had a critical situation developed during his term of office.</p>
   
   <p>His successor, Mr. Hoover, met this fate however. Hoover had all the weaknesses of Coolidge without the latter's redeeming characteristics. He was helpless. Millions of Americans still recall, with bitterness in their hearts, the naive way in which he denied that a depression even existed, though poverty and unemployment were widespread in our country. And his attitude toward prohibition was also characterized by a lack of courage.</p>
   <p>The results of the 1928 election were evidence that prohibition would be an issue in the subsequent presidential election, and that an end would be put to the dry humbug. And the result of the congressional election of 1930 and of the by-elections during the period from 1928 to 1932 served to strengthen this evidence. Still Hoover observed nothing. He had not the slightest idea of the temperament of the people, and still believed that he could succeed by acting according to the old formula: "Be dry while among the drys and wet while among the wets".</p>
   <p>In all these respects Roosevelt was just the opposite. He declared that he was in favor of abolishing prohibition and legalizing beer, and having once made this declaration, he considered the matter to be settled. After he was elected he accomplished these two parts of his program with such breath-taking rapidity that prohibition was abolished before most of the leaders of the drys knew just what might be done about retaining the Volstead Act.</p>
   <p>There cannot be the least doubt that this display of courage, resoluteness, and driving energy made a very good impression upon the entire country.</p>
   <p>Because of these characteristics the drys admire Roosevelt just as much as the opponents of prohibition do. All of them know that he keeps his promises, that he cannot be tethered by bureaucratic objections, that he quickly and unhesitatingly does what he knows to be right. Roosevelt's personality is one of the most effective factors in economic restoration.</p>
