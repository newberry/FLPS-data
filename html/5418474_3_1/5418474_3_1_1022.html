   <p>Party Comrades! It cannot be new to any of you, that our agitation meetings fail to meet with the same interest of our members as was formerly the case. This leads us to the conclusion that, the method we have used is not practical any longer and different proceedings will have to be resorted to in the future.</p>
   <p>This question will be the subject in our next meeting.</p>
   <p>The Section members will have to decide, as to the course to be taken.</p>
