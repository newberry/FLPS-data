   <p>The Socialists of the Northwest Side, held yesterday their regular agitation meeting, at Nutzorn's Hall. Comrade Pollmacher was elected chairman.</p>
   <p>Comrade Waterstraat, as first speaker, gave a short sketch of conditions in Egypt, of the recent Socialist proceedings in Germany, the strikes in this country, etc. Some of the members added also, the present session of the Temperance Convention in Chicago. There ensued a very lively debate as to the significance of the Temperance movement and its influence on the labor movement. It was decided to make the Temperance question the main topic of discussion at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Comrade Spies, whose subject was "Administration of Justice." Mr. Spies held that the application of the words "administration of justice" in regard to the execution of our present day laws is absolutely mistaken. If there is justice, it necessarily has to be based on unchangeable principles of nature and like any other science it has to become a subject of deep study. Justice can not be changed, but laws undergo almost daily changes which brings us to the conclusion that "justice" and "law" are two quite different conceptions. The existing civil laws stand in direct opposition to justice.</p>

   <p>Laws and regulations could be just only if they were applied without discrimination. For this it would be necessary that the economic conditions were alike for all. Justice is the principle of equality, while our laws without exception are purposely fostering and protecting inequality. If justice means equality, and laws inequality, it is clear that law is contrary to justice and therefore, unjust. Laws, which create private property are not the manifestation of psychological facts, nor the development of natural laws, nor are they based on a moral foundation. Our civil laws have created rights where there can be no rights. They have suppressed the voice of nature which unknowingly stirs in every one of us and have lulled our consciences into sleep. The greatest of catastrophies and the bloodiest of wars have been the outcome of it.</p>
   <p>What meaning has the phrase "public order?" Nothing more than the continuation of the existing order of things, of private property. For instance, the "mob" called Congress, corrupt as it is, has given away millions of acres of "our" most beautiful land. Are we supposed to consider that land to be the property of those companies just because some of those scoundrels in power have given it to them? We, the co-owners of that land, did not give our consent to such a deed. And had we been asked, we could not have the right to give away land, which we can make use of, but do not own.</p>

   <p>He concluded by saying, "A radical change of economic conditions has to take place before we can act and introduce "just" laws, if laws should then be necessary at all. I do not believe that an economic reform of law, either at present nor at any other time, could take place in the sense of Socialism; for one injustice can not correct another injustice. The economic revolution, and economic equality have to be our first consideration."</p>
   <p>A very animated debate followed, in which Jeffers, Boerner, Pollmacher, Schwab, and Rau participated.</p>
