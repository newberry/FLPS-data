   <p>The Cook County Democratic party shows by its last nomination to the legislature how the two great political parties represent the people.</p>
   <p>Among the 21 candidates for Senate and House of Representatives are three Irish saloonkeepers of fourth grade educations, five shyster lawyers who hang around police courts as pig killers. The others are lawyers of somewhat higher rank, real estate and exchange agents, in short, people who live on their wits at others' expense. And these are called representatives of the people and found sacred laws.</p>
