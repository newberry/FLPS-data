   <p>Yesterday when several representatives of progressive organizations interviewed the business management of the Illinois Staats Zeitung in regard to the German Typographers' Union, they were advised that there was no time now for deliverations. Besides, all printers of the Illinois Staats Zeitung were doubtless satisfied with their lot and apparently do not wish any change of their present conditions. Against this statement one may note the decision of the organized German Typographers to demand the recognition of the unions schedule by the Staats Zeitung. This schedule has been already accepted by many business concerns and will be again the subject of a discussion during several mass-meetings planned by the Press-Committee for the near future.</p>
