   <p>The War is ended and everyone is endeavoring to bring about normal conditions. Apparently, however, these efforts are not successful in every instance. There is no indication that the prices paid for food and other necessities will decline from their present high levels. In this respect our countrymen have experienced a very unwelcome surprise, for they were confident that hard times would terminate soon after the Armistice was signed. And now we hear from very learned professors and various experts in the field of economics that after the return of usual peacetime conditions prices will not decrease very much, and that prices will not be adjusted to conditions, but that conditions will have to be adjusted to prices.</p>
   <p>Experience will have to prove whether or not these theorists, who base their statement on their study of the general history of economics are correct. The study of economic developments in past centuries may not be applicable to the present. Men are living under conditions which are entirely different, and in the expansion of world economy there are important factors which were unknown in years gone by. Yet much may be said in favor of the theory mentioned above. For example, it is a familiar fact that under any conditions prices are more inclined to rise than to drop. They increase upon the slightest impulse, but very heavy pressure is necessary to cause them to fall. The second reason which those economists adduce for the correctness of their assumption is the fact that the War has been a gold mine for a certain class of people. Contractors who enriched themselves by furnishing war materials are in a position to spend lavishly of their easily acquired money and to pay any price for the gratification of their desires. As long as the money of these gentlemen lasts the value of many articles, among which not a few are necessities, will be gauged according to the paying ability of the war profiteers.</p>
   <p>In addition, the wages of workers in factories in which munitions and war materials were manufactured, and subsequently the wages of workers in general industries, were greatly increased because of various conditions which resulted from the war, especially a scarcity of laborers. Because of this wage increase, and also because of a rise in prices for all raw materials, the manufacturing cost of nearly every product was greatly increased. Only when this cost can be decreased can a drop in prices be expected. But the question is: Can manufacturing costs be brought down? A decrease will not be initiated by the reduction of wages, which will be maintained at their present level until the cost of living has declined somewhat. A decrease in prices would have to originate in lower costs of raw materials. It is to be assumed that the price of raw materials will drop gradually after the chief demand for them has been met and normal conditions in transportation have returned. By purchasing raw materials for less, manufacturers will be able to sell their products to dealers at lower prices, and the dealers can then set their prices accordingly. If this recession of prices for manufactured goods becomes general, the cost of living will decline, and that again will affect the wage level in the course of time. Years may elapse, years of further retrenchment and sacrifice for those classes of people who are not financially well situated and whose income is not as readily adjustable to the changing scale of the cost of living as that of organized labor is before the new normal price scale, which will be lower than that which prevails at present, but considerably higher than the pre-war scale, has been attained in the manner described. This class, the so-called middle class, suffered most during the War. Perhaps the continuation of conditions which are adverse to them will convince this class, also, that it must organize if it is not to be crushed by the other two classes. The laborers have shown the middle class what can be achieved by class-conscious solidarity and close organization. The laborers (organized) have already attained power which is nearly sufficient to enable them to dictate to corporations the terms under which the laborers will work. At present the middle class lacks the necessary force of mass power. Necessity and the urge for self-preservation may teach it to unite, in order to preserve its position beside the other classes, the capitalists and the laborers.</p>
