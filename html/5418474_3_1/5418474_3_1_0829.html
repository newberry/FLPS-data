   <p>"Among many workers the view still prevails that the welfare of their class depends on the 'Democratic Party', that this party in opposition to the Republican party is the people's party- Do these nearsighted, misled wage slave still believe in this stupid idea-after the Ohio Democrats sold the U. S. Senate seat to the larges monoply, the Standard Oil Co.? Nearsighted men consider the Democratic party as the people's party; in other states the Republican party enjoys this preference.</p>
   <p>The secret is simply this: Where the Republican party is dominant the Democrats pretend to be the friends of the people, exploiting the peoples' suffering for their selfish purposes.</p>
   <p>The same role is played by the Republicans wherever the Democrats are in the majority. The game is to old and has been repeated so many times that only the most thickheaded and stupid people fall into the trap.--But <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>unfortunately there are still plenty of this species left in the country.----</p>
