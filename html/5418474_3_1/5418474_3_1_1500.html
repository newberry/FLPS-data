   <p>The first German Democratic mass-meeting of this campaign took place last night in the Central Music Hall. It can be truthfully said, that it was a very fortunate beginning. The meeting was well attended, but not as well as expected, since there were some empty seats... This meeting was a real German gathering - German through and through. Here were men in their working clothes, the small business man, the tradesman, - people, who do not make a business of politics. They recognize this battle for Cleveland and Altgeld, and against class-legislation, high tariffs and nativism, as a defense of a principle. The audience became acquainted with Dr. J. Senner, the editor of the New York Staats-Zeitung. He is a capable and effective speaker, and his words made a deep impression upon the audience. His logical, well-arranged arguments for a tariff reform, his defense of Cleveland's attitude toward the tariff question, so clearly explained that everybody could understand it, were received with generous and repeated applause. When the speaker declared that the Germans in the East extend their sympathy to the German-Americans in the West in their battle against all <span class="page-break">\2</span>forms of nativism, and when he portrayed Cleveland as the man who stands closer to the Germans than any other American statesman ever has since Abraham Lincoln, a thunderous applause went through the hall, evidencing the fact that Grover Cleveland was understood in this meeting.</p>
   <p>Another storm of applause roared through the hall, when the second speaker of the evening, the candidate for Congress, J. Goldzier, reminded the audience, that for the first time in the history of the state the Germans were honored to have a man from their group carry the banner of the Democratic Party, J. P. Altgeld. If the Germans, he stated farther, do their duty, then one of them will receive the delegates from the nations of the earth at the World's Fair, as Governor of the State, J. P. Altgeld....</p>
