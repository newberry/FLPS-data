   <p>Anton J. Cermak has proved himself to be a representative of the people. He is now running for the office of sheriff of Cook County. Untiringly and faithfully he has fought for the interests of the people, regardless of their nationality, first as alderman, then as representative in Springfield, and as bailiff of the City of Chicago; and in spite of all adversities he remained in the front ranks in the fight for right and justice. He is one of the most capable and efficient officials and should therefore be elected as sheriff for Cook County on November 5. His co-operation with Americans of German descent is well known.</p>
