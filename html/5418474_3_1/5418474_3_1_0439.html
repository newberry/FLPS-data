   <p>Wherever you go and wherever you sit, you hear people talk about bad times. We seem to think that times never have been as bad as right now and just cannot remember that times have been worse at least several times in the history of this young country.</p>
   <p>Particularly the farmers should not complain, if they know how to keep out of debt. They still have a home, dont pay any rent, and raise their own food. The demand for grain is weak, of course, and subsequently the prices for wheat, oats and corn are kept down. But still the farmers can raise chickens, ducks, etc, also pigs and calves for sale, so that they can buy groceries, clothes and other necessities of life.</p>
   <p>The lot of the city dwellers is different. Some have become wealthy, some are faring comparatively well, some are working hard at low wages, and many are idle for lack of work. It is the latter class of people, that has a right to complain, and that deserves the assistance of the community in the struggle <span class="page-break">2</span>for their daily bread.</p>
