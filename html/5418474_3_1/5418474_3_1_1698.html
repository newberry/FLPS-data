   <p>The enthroned Sunday tyrant, Jos. Medill, has the nerve to say that the Sunday question has nothing to do with today's election.</p>
   <p>He makes this assertion in the face of the stringent state Sunday laws adopted by the state Republican majority, according to which not only saloons would be closed, but also private social meetings in restaurants would be forbidden.</p>
   <p>This same hypocrite now tells the Germans, that the Americans are more inclined than the Irishmen, to do justice to German customs and habits.</p>
   <p>Does Medill think that the Germans are idiots? Does he believe the Germans have forgotten having heard the same hypocrital lullaby before? Does he believe the Germans have forgotten that it was their alliance with the Irish which broke the chains forged by Medill? The Germans will prove to their oppressor that they have a good memory.</p>
