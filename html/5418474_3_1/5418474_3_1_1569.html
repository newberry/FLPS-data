   <p>The local scandal organ, the Times, which is also the organ of places, of ill-fame, reported in yesterday's issue the supposed approval of Clark for Mayor, by M. C. McDonald. Moreover, it reports his intention to work and vote for Clark's candidacy. This, however, is a lie. There is only one prominent democratic politician by the name of Mike McDonald in Chicago, the same one we have reference to, and he is a strong supporter of Carter Harrison. This same McDonald, would be quite willing to spend large sums of money for the election of his friend. Why not? It was during the Harrison regime that his gambling house proved most profitable. He would unscrupulously take the last penny either from the very young, or from the irresponsible breadwinner of a large family, all this behind drawn curtains; yet the police have never molested him in the least. Mike McDonald is the last man to give his support to J. M. Clark to win the election as Mayor of Chicago. He is well aware of the fact, that his career would soon come to an end under Clark's regime, the same as it did during the administration of Mayor Heath.</p>

   <p>The statement of the Times, that John Feldkamp, the well-known tavern keeper of Quincy No. 9, who was president of the Innkeeper's Society until recently,was in favor of Carter Harrison, is also a lie. In fact, when interviewed by our reporter, Mr. Feldkamp stated, that Chicago has never had a more abominable city administration. As a respectable tavern keeper, he said, he is filled with indignation over the horrible negligence displayed by Mayor Harrison and his staff, in dispensing licenses for retailing alcoholic beverages. Disregard for the law imposing a penalty of $2,000 for the offender, is the principle reason for the existence of so many undesirable taverns, which is a disgrace to this business. There is still another thing to be considered, namely, that this sort of innkeeper furnishes the temperance fanatics with the right kind of material for their movement. Therefore, Mr. Feldkamp, as a German innkeeper of excellent reputation desires to have an end put to such misdemeanors. No discrimination whatsoever is made between houses of ill-fame, gambling places and dens of thieves, and the respectable German gathering places with decent entertainment. As a German innkeeper of good reputation, Mr. John Feldkamp is <span class="page-break">3</span>opposed to Carter Harrison, who because he allowed gambling dens and houses of ill-fame to operate in connection with taverns and inns, has given that business a bad name.</p>
