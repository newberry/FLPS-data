   <p>In consideration of the fact that the amounts of money destined for the defense of the Bohemians now held in jail, are coming in very sparsely, contrary to all expectations, the Workmen's Legal Aid Society, having taken it upon itself to secure an able defense for the accused, is obliged to request all keepers of lists within and outside the city of Chicago to return the same as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>Workers, consider that the beast called Capital is in the process now of adding another shameful deed to the one of November 11th, by depriving some of your brothers of their liberty.</p>
   <p>Try to stop this! The accused men are poor, simple laborers from your midst who only had the best intentions, and therefore should enjoy your full sympathy and help.</p>

   <p>Show your feelings of solidarity by not making any distinction between nations, leaders, and common soldiers of the social revolution. Act quickly.</p>
