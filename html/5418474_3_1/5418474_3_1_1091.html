Beyersdorf and Mr. Rosenthal, (the last named a candidate for Judge of the Probate Court on the Labor ticket), who offered financial support to the Central Committee of our party. The attack made upon the Central Committee by the Chicago Times, that our candidates were asked for financial support, is an infamous lie....The Times also found it necessary to warn business men against Communism; but who are really the Communists? Is it labor or newspapers like the Times and the Tribune?...The success of the party depends on organization in wards and townships and, also, on the founding of a party's newspaper. True and correct information for the workingmen is necessary to serve him as a guide in his own interests. But this cannot be done without money, therefore, it would be important for workers of every district to get together and <span class="page-break">3</span>determine how large a contribution they can raise. They cancount on the small business men, for their lot is the same....</p>
   <p>Complying with the general request, Mr. W. B. Barr, introduced by the President, stepped on the speaker's platform and said: "There was no such party as a Labor Party last Tuesday morning, but with 7000 votes for their candidates, the zero of the morning became a 'Party' by night. The Labor Party is destined to govern this country in the near future; it is the most honest party, at the present moment, in the United States.... Who are the Communists in thiscountry? Tom Scott is one, because he is head of the railroad system. As soon as a new line has been completed, it becomes the property of this system, not under the name of Communism but pooling....

   <p>Considering that the necessity of a Third political party seemed great, which existence would compel the old partiex to consider the interest of the people, and:</p>
   <p>Considering that the Labor Party of the United States, has conducted a campaign with no money at its disposal and even with the press against it, and being the sole hope for the future welfare of the workers and society in general, it is</p>

   <p>Mr. Lyser the next speaker stated in German that:</p>
   <p>The English press proposed to drive out all the Communists, but, he remarked, a well known French national economist had said that no harm would ever befall any country when expelling the idle rich and the big capitalist, but, that the expulsion of labor would be a grave mistake which could compare with bankruptcy and ruin.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Lyser advocated an English newspaper for the party, thus bringing the English element in closer touch with the party. The large Irish vote at the election indicates that they are also ready to join the Labor Party.</p>
   <p>The Declaration</p>
   <p>Those present at the meeting in the Vorwarts Turn Hall, in Chicago, declare themselves in full accord with the principles of the speakers of the Labor Party of the United States. They also declare that they will help in making these principles generally known and thus aid the party to success at the next election.....</p>
