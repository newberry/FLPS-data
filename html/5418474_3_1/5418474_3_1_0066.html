   <p>Yesterday's labor demonstration was a really important one. Remarkable was the total absence of any political character which is the more important on account of the coming November elections.</p>
   <p>The Central Labor Union wholly achieved its purpose not only to prove that it still sticks to its former platform but also was able to give the whole festivity an appearance unfriendly to capitalistic ideas.</p>
   <p>If the bricklayers and blacksmiths unions could have joined this demonstration it would have been about the strongest Chicago has ever seen from its workers.</p>
   <p>The picnic in Ogden's Grove was orderly; it was attended by about 20,000 people.</p>
