   <p>Of greater importance than ever are the elections for the Illinois Legislature, the members of which will be elected by the voters next Tuesday. The problems which the state legislative body will have to solve in the coming session will be of greater importance than all the problems with which the state has had to deal since the end of the Civil War. The state has to be made ready for the period of reconstruction which will follow the conclusion of peace, and the transition from war to peace conditions will have to be made in a manner that will least disrupt the economic life of the state. The legislature will also be called upon to hold a constitutional convention during which a new basic law for the state will be drafted. This is of particular importance to the liberal element of the state since, naturally, much will depend upon the composition of the constitutional convention; whether, for instance, the prohibition problem will be treated in the state constitution, or whether the question will be settled by the current legislature, as should be the case. Furthermore, the legislature will have to decide in the ensuing session whether <span class="page-break">\2</span>or not the amendment to the United States Constitution introducing national prohibition is to be ratified by Illinois.</p>
   <p>For these reasons it is extremely important to the liberal element of the state that men be elected to the next legislature whose liberal attitude cannot be doubted and who combine good common sense and experience with an understanding of the needs and desires of a great cosmopolitan center like Chicago. It is desirable that previous members of the legislature who have demonstrated their ability be re-elected, since they have experience in the treatment and solution of legislative problems.</p>
   <p>Keeping all this in mind, the Abendpost submits to its readers the following names of candidates for the legislature who deserve the support of the liberal-minded population. In senatorial districts where only one or two candidates are named, liberal-minded voters should concentrate their energies on these <span class="page-break">\3</span>men, in order to assure their election. The candidates worthy of support are:</p>
