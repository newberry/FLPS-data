   <p>Only a few more days and the shouts of victory will peal through the whole country, "Babylon, the great, is fallen, is fallen!"</p>
   <p>Some Germans also will stand aside, ashamed of having betrayed their brethren or of having acted as cowards and weaklings in this sacred combat. Indeed, they have given away, for a mess of pottage, their liberty of conscience, their parental right, and their civil rights of equality.</p>
   <p>If a German still fails to understand that, if he votes Republican at this election, he supports his enemies, he must be actually totally blind. Every candidate listed upon the Republican ballot co-operates with the nativists and Know-Nothings for our defeat, for the abolition of all German schools, and of all rights and privileges of a free German-Americanism. The hypocrisy, lies, and exaggerations of the Republicans can hardly be more fully exposed, than it was in this election campaign.</p>
   <p>How completely unmasked is Governor Fifer's hypocrisy against the Germans! And his pretense of favoring a complete change of the tyrannical school law has been fully uncovered.</p>
   <p>All the contemptible pamphlets from the Republicans, full of falsehoods and deceits, are now fully and completely refuted by real witnesses. It would be an unpardonable indifference and stupidity to pretend not to know that the Germans are to be robbed of their liberty.</p>
   <p>Therefore, wake up, you Germans! Wake up, you Christians, especially!... God extends to you, Christians, his helping hand through the Democratic party. Can't you see it, you German, you, Christian? Why do you hesitate to grasp his helping hand? After our enemies have opposed us so bitterly and openly, we can do nothing else but to vote next Tuesday for the Democratic candidates. Neither would you be honest, if you acted otherwise. You are, on the one hand, willing to accept help from the Democrats, namely, to liberate you from the tyrannical school law and other oppressions, and on the other hand, you desire to bring about their defeat. You welcome them with one hand, and in the other hand you hold the dagger with which you want to kill your friend in his time of need.</p>
   <p>You expect help from the Democrats, and they have already proven to you that they will help you; but you try to defeat them by voting for their enemy. Are you not ashamed of such treachery? You can not afford to do it. Think it over! Quit drinking from the intoxicating cup of Republican lies and pretensions!</p>
