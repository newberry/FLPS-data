   <p>To the German Voters of Chicago! On the eve of such an important election as the one scheduled for next Tuesday, it behooves the separate parties to define in an equitable manner the reasons why public support is solicited for certain <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>candidates. In so far as this applies to the Democratic candidates, we shall submit in this article an outline in conformance with the afore-mentioned civic duty and we shall thus fulfill our obligations, particularly to the Germans of Chicago. No eulogistic phrases are required, nor is it necessary to resort to the methods used by the Republicans, who apparently are intent on vilifying and disparaging their opponents in every conceivable manner. We ask for all our candidates the votes of the intelligent and liberal-minded, because we are convinced that thereby Chicago will at long last acquire the capable, honest, and economical administration--in the idealistic sense of the phrase--which every good citizen desires. Secondly, we believe that the qualifications of the candidates of other parties cannot provide assurance that their management of municipal affairs will prove satisfactory in every respect. The confusion--one might say, the apprehension--now apparent in the ranks of the Republicans after their recent boastful remarks on the impossibility of a Democratic victory, shows that they share our own feeling, as well as the feeling of the majority, that ours is the strongest ticket <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that has been assembled in recent years, not only by the Democrats but by any party.</p>
   <p>The very methods pursued by the Republican party in this campaign must appear, ridiculous to any intelligent person. Neither party organs nor ward meetings attach much importance to MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS, which after all, are the only issues in this election. However, two points are being emphasized by the speakers and Party papers. It is asserted, first of all, that the city election is but the beginning of the PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN of 1880. The second phase consists, in political parlance, in waving the "bloody shirt"--that is, appeal is made not to common sense but to the emotions and prejudices of the multitude; Falsehood is given the appearance of truth: the people are being told that the confederatism of the Civil War still jeopardizes the Union, that the revolt may take on any form in municipal affairs. Under other circumstances, we would not hesitate to accept this challenge, because we are fully prepared to face the public on the same basis as of 1876, when <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the PRESIDENCY WAS STOLEN, a Republican crime conceded even by fairly reputable Republican newspapers. Since that time, the Democratic party has not become worse, and the Republicans have certainly not improved, so that we are convinced that if another national election were at issue, the American people, and particularly the Germans, would provide that overwhelming decision of which there was every appearance in 1876.</p>
   <p>But that is not a present problem, and so we refuse to inject any irrelevant issue into a local election. A person is certainly relying heavily on the stupidity of the people if he thinks he can bamboozle them into believing that a municipal election involves national problems. It is proof indeed that the Republican party, for better or worse, is dominated by corrupt "machine" politicians, when the party dares proclaim that it desires to control city affairs because it wants to bring the municipality into the ranks of the party machine in 1880.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>WE SHALL NOT follow this deplorable example. We have submitted to the people a list of irreproachable candidates, whose integrity cannot be impugned even by their most outspoken enemies. All our candidates were chosen with one thought in mind: THE WELFARE OF THE CITY, regardless of Party prejudices or the effect on national politics. Our success on election day, in anticipation of which our opponents are all a-tremble, will be merely a reward for honest efforts in protecting and promoting our municipality's interests. That this intention was our sole motivating force, which this year united the Democrats in an almost unprecedented manner; that the party's sole interest has been centered in the welfare of CHICAGO'S TAXPAYERS, with proper recognition of the interests of all classes, is proven by our list of candidates.</p>
   <p>Every impartial, intelligent citizen must admit that the Democratic party has defended the constitutional rights of the liberal-minded citizens against the attacks of KNOW-NOTHINGISM AND BIGOTRY, whereas the Republican party has been the chief stronghold of Know-Nothingism, nativism, and its associated movements.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>These facts should not be overlooked during the election! The Democratic party has again taken measures during the nomination to insure that the RIGHTS OF ALL LIBERAL-MINDED CITIZENS shall be protected after the election of the candidates. And, therefore, the Democratic party expects confidently that its honest intentions will be rewarded by the citizens.</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, the names of OUR CANDIDATES are an assurance in themselves that if they are elected, the city administration is destined to be honest and frugal--but, as we said before, honest and economical in their idealistic sense, and that signifies a Democratic administration which cannot be induced to forego necessary public work, and thus jeopardize the prosperity of the city and prevent HUNDREDS OF WORKERS from obtaining a livelihood.....</p>
   <p>The Democratic candidate for mayor is CARTER H. HARRISON, and it is almost superfluous to recommend him, especially to the local Germans. Mr. Harrison <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>is more closely allied to the German spirit than probably any other American of Chicago. His inclinations, education, the prolonged association with our countrymen where he has his staunchest friends regardless of party affiliations --everything German attracts him, and his leanings are so strongly Teutonic that German is spoken exclusively in his household, and all of his children have attended German schools abroad.</p>
   <p>But this fact alone should not prove decisive; one must consider, rather, the other characteristics which will enable Mr. Harrison capably to perform the duties of mayor. Even the most embittered enemies of Democracy cannot deny that Mr. Harrison would make an EXCELLENT MAYOR, if elected. Actually, he has the qualifications which are desirable, yes, indispensable for the office. He is a gentleman in the true sense of the word; he is not only a man of culture, but he has that innate amiability and sentiment which we Germans esteem so much in persons having exalted positions. In addition, he is endowed with those fine qualities so essential to a statesman. He has proved <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>it often enough. As County Commissioner he was never absent; he worked zealously and untiringly for economy and reform, so that even the opposing newspapers were lavish in their praise. Later, in Congress, he was undoubtedly the most capable representative Chicago has had for many a decade, so that the attempts of the newspapers to deride him proved abortive and succeeded only in increasing the public's esteem. Harrison's record as a public official earned for him that rare and enviable position of enjoying a reputation above reproach, and this gives assurance that no questionable elements will be connected with his office.</p>
   <p>Here and there, a few attempts have been made to attack Harrison on the TEMPERANCE AND SUNDAY QUESTION merely because he had the courage in this instance--as well as in other matters--to refer to his well-known past, a policy which was not adopted by his opponent, Wright, who was formerly associated with the hypocritical elements among the Americans. The best refutation of these ludicrous attacks by Harrison's enemies is provided by the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>action of those mostly interested, the WIRTHSVEREIN, which refused to express its confidence in Wright's words, despite the fact that he resorted to the best honey-and-glue flypaper words in making his speech. The Chicago Germans may draw their own conclusions whether to vote for Wright or HARRISON.</p>
   <p>For City Treasurer, the Democrats have niminated WILLIAM C. SEIPP who hardly need be recommended to the Germans. But we must recall that his nomination created boundless enthusiasm among local Germans, especially the younger element. We do not exaggerate when we declare that no German candidate in Chicago has ever been received with equal acclaim by his countrymen as well as the citizens in general. At this time, his election can already be regarded as a foregone conclusion, not only because of his social or business standing, or his affluence, ....but because of his splendid personal qualifications. Mr. Seipp is well educated and very wealthy. He has a responsible position in the Seipp Brewery and works just like any other laborer. This attitude is highly esteemed by his friends, since his favorable financial<a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>position has never made him domineering, and nothing was so helpful toward making him popular than his modest, unassuming manner. We feel that it is unnecessary to elaborate further.</p>
   <p>Our party has nominated JULIUS S. GRINNELL for corporation counsel, a young attorney who is to be preferred to the awe-inspiring war hero and stump speaker, Colonel Ricaby. Mr. Grinnell....is thoroughly versed in law, where- as Colonel Ricaby's knowledge is very likely to be of a decidedly limited kind; and it seems to us that the legal problems of the city require more than a war record and an ability to make stump speeches.</p>
   <p>A BASE INSINUATION comes from our Republican opponents regarding the City Clerk's office. They claim that the Germans will not vote for P. J. HOWARD, a native Chicagoan, because he is of Irish descent. In other words, the friends of Mr. Buschwah, who sails under German colors on the Republican ticket, appeal to the spirit of Know-Nothingism among the Germans, which <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>we hope does not exist. Besides, it would be entirely inappropriate in this case, because Mr. Howard is a more capable man for the office than his opponent. And Mr. Howard has proved his ability while in the civil service, whereas Mr. Buschwah--otherwise a nice gentleman--claims the position mainly on the strength of being a ward club president.</p>
   <p>These are, briefly, the reasons why we solicit the people's vote for our candidates, and we are convinced that we can await confidently the decision next Tuesday.</p>
