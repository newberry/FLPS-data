   <p>Members of nearly all German gymnastic clubs have made the following appeal in favor of the election of candidate, Frank Wenter, as Mayor of Chicago. You all know that the present first speaker of the National Gymnastic Club Frank Wenter, has been nominated unanimously for candidate as Mayor of Chicago at the convention of the Democratic party, Saturday the 9th of this month. It would be a great honor for the Germans of Chicago and especially for the German gymnasts, if a person from our midst should hold this very important office. Frank Wenter, during his public service of long standing has proved himself as a person of the greatest ability, of indefatigable zeal and immaculate honesty not only as a member of the School Board but also as President of the drainage Committee. He is a friend of progress and has the interests of the working class at heart. We members of the Chicago gymnastic clubs especially should be pleased to have the chance to demonstrate to the gymnastic Frank Wenter, that we did not forget the valuable services he had rendered German gymnastics as a member of the City school board. We think it our duty and our right to remind the old gymnasts and inform the young ones, that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Frank Werner and Louis Nettelhorst, after a long struggle succeeded in making gymnastic exercises a study at the public schools of Chicago. Members let us forget all party differences at thecoming election and let us vote for the best man suited for the office of Mayor of Chicago, the man, whose character,whose ability, whose past, and whose views guarantee us the best and most honest administration. Vote for the gymnast, Frank Wenter.</p>
