   <p>The 5th Ward had last night on the corner of Archer Avenue and Savage Street an out-of-door meeting. Several hundred voters were gathered together. The first speaker was Maurice Bowles and with his wonderful personality and good speech won all the voter's respect and good wishes as a candidate for next election on "The Socialist ticket." Next Speaker was Thomas Ryan, declaring that he would keep all his promises concerning the platform, he would in every way try to please all the voters, and in an honest way be on the party's side and not be like his competitors who were with the Swine Capitalists.</p>
   <p>Big applause and all promised to be with Ryan on election day.</p>
