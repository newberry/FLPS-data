   <p>The Armed Organizations of the "Lehr and Wehr" Club and the Sportsmen's Club are asked to keep watch over the great Indignation-meeting to be held to-morrow evening in the Turner Hall. The presence of the people's Wehr is very much required as possible political vagabonds and followers could try to disturb and dissolve the meeting.</p>
   <p>The sight of our vigorous warriors will be sufficient to keep in check all rough and rowdy elements who may get inside the Turner Hall.</p>
