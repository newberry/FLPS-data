   <p>The decision of Congress to authorize the maintenance of the CCC camps for two years more and to increase their enrollment to 600,000 can, in the light of the success and accomplishments of these camps, be considered only as a step in the right direction.</p>
   <p>Aside from the fact that this arrangement has provided useful work for hundreds of thousands of unemployed young men and has taken them away from a life of idleness with its many dangers, the statistics of the Emergency Conservation Works Administration show that about three million persons who would otherwise have been on public relief have derived benefit from the earnings of the CCC workers.</p>
   <p>This relief program of the Roosevelt Administration was authorized by an act of Congress of March 31, 1933. On April 5 of the same year <span class="page-break">\2</span>Robert Fechner was appointed director of the program, and only two days later the first man was enrolled. Ten days later, on April 17, the first camp was established, with two hundred men, in Luray, Virginia. In the course of the next three months 1,469 camps of this sort were established all over the country, with a total enrollment of 250,000 young men, 25,000 war veterans, and the same number of experienced woodsmen. Furthermore, by July 1 of the same year similar camps were established on the Indian reservations. This provided employment for 12,000 Indians and successfully alleviated the distress which has been becoming increasingly noticeable in this section of the population.</p>
   <p>During the past two years 1,070,000 persons, of whom ninety-four per cent were young people, have found employment in these camps. It would be difficult to enumerate the various kinds of work that they have done. Entirely aside from the educational and moral advantages enjoyed by those actually enrolled in the camps, the American forest economy has profited so greatly that, in the judgment of experts, it has made a twenty years' advance <span class="page-break">\3</span>in development and progress.</p>
   <p>We believe the greatest achievement of this program, however, is the probability that if the country ever starts working at full production again, these young people will be considered among its best forces. This has in large measure already been proved, for most of the CCC workers who have completed their term of enrollment find it relatively easy to secure a job in private industry, a thing they were unable to do before.</p>
   <p>These results are the more worthy of recognition in that they have been accomplished in a relatively short time and without the controversies, charges and countercharges that have frequently obstructed the other experiments of the present National Administration in the realm of public relief and the alleviation of the general economic situation.</p>
   <p>The Emergency Conservation Works Administration wishes to increase the enrollment in the CCC camps to 600,000 by August 1, and to increase the value of <span class="page-break">\4</span>their activity correspondingly. If the Administration is as successful in this as in the past, it can be sure of winning the unreserved gratitude of all those who have the welfare of the country at heart.</p>
