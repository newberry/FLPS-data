   <p>In his address read at the opening of Congress, President Roosevelt stated:</p>
   <p>"The people have come to understand that the welfare of mankind lies neither in materialism nor in a life of luxury, but that real progress is possible only when purity of will, unselfishness, and a sense of responsibility and justice are valued highly."</p>
   <p>Various sentences of this address have been placed before the public in large print; but this sentence has been ignored. And yet it contains two important matters: first, the keynote to the greatest imaginable upheaval in all phases of life; and second, a rhetorical inaccuracy--that the wish was made the father of the thought.</p>
   <p>From a survey of the last few years it is evident that the President has touched <span class="page-break">\2</span>upon matters which are primarily responsible for the Government's being forced to concern itself with things that are not within the sphere of its activity, and that today our national authorities are receiving requests for aid from all parts of the country, especially from those people who formerly yelped loudest about every "encroachment" by the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>If all local governments really were bent on satisfying the needs of the people, instead of on playing politics, if the responsible officers had acted unselfishly, and had they possessed the necessary sense of responsibility and justice, the depression could never have grown to such great proportions. The burden of debt which those officers who lacked the required characteristics have placed upon the shoulders of the taxpayers is the result of a system which is in urgent need of a change. In general, it is questionable whether a complete economic recovery will be possible if these debts are not removed in some manner.</p>
   <p>In regard to the rhetorical inaccuracy, we point out that the people do not <span class="page-break">\3</span>yet understand that happiness on earth does not lie in "materialism nor in a life of luxury". Otherwise the efforts of the Government to counteract the depression would be better understood and more effective. In regard to wages, salaries, and income from other sources, the public is still governed in its computations by figures that date from a period which unscrupulous agitators have acclaimed as "normal times". The furore about the "standard of living" has not yet subsided. People refuse to believe that the United States is only one nation among the nations of the earth, subject to the same social influences and economic fluctuations as the rest of the world. They do not try to make the best of life with the things which are at their disposal; they do not want to forego anything which they once possessed; they believe that life should be in keeping with the dignity of man. They forget that scarcely seventy years have elapsed since the pioneers conquered the country amid many dangers and under great hardships, with scarcely even one of the conveniences to which people of today give barely a thought; and that, in spite of this, those pioneers led a humane existence.</p>
   <p>In its fight on the depression, if the Government succeeds in stemming the <span class="page-break">\4</span>tide of materialism, it will have gained an advantage that cannot be destroyed by any temporary setback.</p>
