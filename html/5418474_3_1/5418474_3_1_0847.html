   <p>Last Saturday the South Side Socialists held their regular agitation meeting at Koster's Hall under the presidency of Comrade Thelen. The meeting was well frequented and those present were listening with eager attention to the speech of Comrade Rau on the "Benefits of the Union" (Nutzen Der Gewwekschaften). The speaker asked the members, to try and teach socialism as much as possible among their fellow workers.</p>
   <p>This speech created a lively discussion, wherein a few comrades participated, declining to support the views of the speaker. Finally all came to the conclusion that the socialist agitation should be transmitted by the union as strongly as possible. etc.</p>
