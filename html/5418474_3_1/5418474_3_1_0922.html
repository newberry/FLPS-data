   <p>As far as the armed are direct members of the organization party, they are requested man for man to appear to-morrow, Sunday evening at the convention at Greenbaum's Hall. It has been stated by some of the agents of the Green-backers at one of the last meeting of the main section, that the members of the Armed Organizations did not belong to the party. The Armed were only "voting cattle", which were misused to dissolve meetings. Similar untrue statements have repeatedly been made in public from the notorious Clique and have disturbed the meeting in question.</p>
   <p>Just for this reason, it will be necessary that the active members of the party which at the same time belong to the Armed Organizations should appear at the Convention and by identification prove the lie of the statements made in the last meeting of the main Section. By their appearance and independent activity, it will further be proved that they have been slandered when called "voting cattle".</p>

   <p>Thirdly by their appearance and their activity will be proved that their action does not exist to disturb meetings but more so to remove the disturbers of the order. Comrades these are enough reasons to induce everyone, who is a good party member to be at his place at the meeting.</p>
   <p>O.H., M.S., O.R., P.G.</p>
