   <p>P. C. Diener, Republican, is the aldermanic candidate for the Sixth Ward. Mr. Diener did not seek the office; to the contrary, after considerable insistence he consented to be a candidate. He has lived in the Ward for twenty years and has the support of all good Republicans, such as Louis Hutt, Wm. Ludewig, and Chris. Tegtmeyer. Hence he needs but little support from the Democrats to be elected. It is to be hoped that he receives this aid, as he deserves it. It was always agreed in this ward that a German and an Irishman should represent it in the City Council, and, as Lodding whose term is expiring, does not care to run again and as Cullerton remains in the Council, it is no more than fair that Mr. Diener should be elected. Besides, he is not only the best candidate the Ward nominated but is excellently fitted for the office. Mr. Diener is a stonecutter by trade and is a member of the firm Diener and Robinson.</p>
