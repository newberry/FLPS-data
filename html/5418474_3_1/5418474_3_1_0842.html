   <p>The Socialist Club of the Northwest Side held last night a well attended meeting under the chairmanship of Comrade Knierstaedt at 636 Milwaukee Avenue. Comrade Grottkau made an exceedingly interesting speech about "Socialist Schools"....... The speaker first of all gave a sketch of a school measuring up to the socialist principles, showing what high demands we would make of it. He then went on to show that the establishing of Socialist Schools at the present moment would be impartial and utopian. He proved this in so convincing a way, that also the greatest enthusiast had to be convinced by his reasoning.</p>
   <p>That "the establishing of Socialistic schools at present would be nonsense, would be a mistake because it would be premature. If one wanted to go through with such a project, it would be necessary to build a grandiose institute, which should surpass anything created by the present-day Society, and this he can not do, because we have not the necessary means. But with half of the funds, which would be far this purpose necessary we could transform our present public schools, and through this we should gain very much for our cause.</p>
