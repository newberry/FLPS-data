   <p>The Sudwestseite (Southwest Side) Club No. 1 held yesterday evening in its Hall, 104 Canalport Avenue, a well-attended meeting. Comrade Grottkau lectured about the different classes in today's society. He critized business politicians, exploiters, the clergy and the capitalistic press. The liberty of the masses is nothing but a lie. The soecalled equality before the law of its citizens is nothing but a swindle. The rich are above, the poor beneath, the law. The clergy are assistants of the robber capitalists. As reward for their services they are granted tax exemptions, privilege to beg, etc.</p>
   <p>The speaker furthermore pointed to the idea and expectation of the class-conscious proletariat and the aims of socialism.</p>
