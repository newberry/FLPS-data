   <p>The Central Committee held its meeting last night with Comrade W. Blum presiding. Concerning the wholesale murder at Braidwood, Comrade Spies reported that he took up contacts with various unions in order to induce all the workers to action in this highly important matter. The apathy which he encountered everywhere, however, had disheartened him. It was then moved and resolved to let this matter rest. Mr. Schwab reported that a certain Julius Mark presented the library with a number of valuable books. The delegates from different groups reported an increase of membership. The Bohemian delegates asked for advice concerning Bohemian Tailors and other shops employing girls 10-12 years of age, working 10-12 hours a day which means a systematic ruination for these children. (Advice was given). Resolved to send $15.00 to Comrade Justus Schwab of New York and urge the publication of the Communist Manifasto printed in English.</p>
   <p>The publication in German will commence this week. The elected officials are: August Spies, Secretary; Michel Schwab, librarian; Mittlacher was appointed auditor replacing the resigning Schernig. B. Rau replaces Rosenberg as a member of the agitation committee which will call a general meeting, with the purpose of officially discussing the relief money sent to Germany.</p>
