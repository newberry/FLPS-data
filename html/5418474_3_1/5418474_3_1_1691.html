   <p>Col. Francis Rodman, of Chicago, known as one of the best German Republican stump speakers in the State, honored the Republican office with a call on Tuesday last. Col. Rodman canvassed the State with John G. Logan in 1870, and did gallant service for the Republican party, and we are glad to find that his patriotism has not abated an iota. We discovered too, that he is a warm friend of E. B. Washburne, and desires his nomination for Governor. He says that in various parts of the State where he has been on business, the people are making up to the importance. He thinks the German vote would be almost solid for Washburne, while he would be stronger with all other classes of citizens than any other candidate named.</p>
