   <p>Dyer D. Lum came last year to Chicago to revive the Alarm. He complained in an article that the former co-workers of August Spies not only declined to co-operate with or to help him, but threatened to oppose the revival of that paper.</p>
   <p>Upon request of Parsons, Lingg and Fischer, Lum came to Chicago to revive the Alarm but they either showed no special interest or, as was the case with August Spies, declared themselves against the republication of the Alarm for the main reason that Buchanan's Enquirer was built on such a broad basis that there was room enough for conservative as well as radical labor parties.</p>
   <p>The failure of the Enquirer proved that it would be too costly for the German working class to carry the burden of two papers for the English speaking members.</p>
   <p>We point out that the S.P.S. neither was in a position nor intended to support two English papers.</p>
   <p>Lum cannot deny that we helped the Alarm shortly before its discontinuance.</p>
