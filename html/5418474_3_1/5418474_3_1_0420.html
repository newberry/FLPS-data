   <p>Widespread unemployment has recently been reported from many cities and areas of our country. It is said that many thousands of ex-soldiers cannot find work, that conditions are becoming worse, and that the worst may happen if energetic measures are not taken to create opportunities for work. For the army of unemployed is increasing day by day, being greatly augmented by the demobilization of our armed forces. It is a fact that young men can be seen looking for work in uniform; they complain about the difficulty of securing positions, and many are angry because they have not been able to obtain employment. And it is known that state and municipal authorities have resolved to create as much opportunity to work as is possible by immediately launching and carrying out a public works program.</p>
   <p>An altogether different description of the employment situation in the United States was given last Tuesday at a meeting of officers of the Federal Bureau of Information on Employment and high officials of the leading railroads. There it was said that America at present needs two million male workers, owing to the decrease in immigration and the casualties of the war; <span class="page-break">\2</span>and must consider the problem of the replacement of these forces in order to make the necessary expansion of our industries and railroads possible. "Importation" of 125,000 Mexicans for work on the rights of way of the railroads was recommended as a way out.</p>
   <p>Naturally, they also considered the reports that in many cities and regions applications for work are seemingly far in excess of available jobs, and that many discharged soldiers complain that they cannot find employment; and it was said that these conditions might be due to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Information on Employment is not yet well organized, and also to the harmful competition of private employment agencies, which promise workers better wages than the railroads are able to pay. This led to the proposal that the Federal Bureau use the railroads to place discharged soldiers and sailors.</p>
   <p>A good idea, indeed! But Mr. Ford, a railroad man, declared at this meeting: "Let's be honest in regard to this point. The railroads need common workers-- <span class="page-break">\3</span>workers who use their muscles, not their brains. We have educated these young men for military service, and thus we have elevated, ennobled them. They do not want to do manual labor--not now. You can be certain that we will obtain precious few workers from this source."</p>
   <p>It is not reported that anyone contradicted Mr. Ford, and it is not probable that anyone did. For the truth of his statement is so obvious that everybody must recognize it as such. Even before the war it was difficult to induce our young men to do manual labor. This is doubly true of our young men today; and while it was necessary, before the war, to get outside help to do the heavy work on railroads, in mines, mills, and factories where heavy machinery is made, the necessity of obtaining laborers from the same source after the war is much greater. The description of the situation given by that railroad official is very accurate. Millions of those who were trained for military service consider themselves elevated to a higher sphere, and they are very immoderate and extremely unreasonable in their demands, much more so than they were before entering the army or navy. Many of them had "positions," not "jobs," <span class="page-break">\4</span>prior to hostilities, and now they are demanding not "just-as-good" positions but better positions than they held before, and would consider it a calamity if they were forced to accomodate themselves to work of a humbler nature.</p>
   <p>That is only natural and their demands are justified. For every ambition for advancement is not only permissible, but also laudable. The only question is how to satisfy this ambition, since it is entertained by nearly all young Americans, and nearly all native Americans consider themselves much too good to do any manual labor.</p>
   <p>Up to the present, or rather before the war, this problem was solved by immigration, which provided the country with ever-increasing numbers of men to do the heavier and heaviest labor, making possible the rapid and great development of our land, of industries and railroads, and causing the advancement of the native Americans to better-paid work, to "positions". It was a natural and <span class="page-break">\5</span>beneficial process. Does anyone know of a better one? Then, let's have it! If not, then we should at least retain the procedure which has made us a prosperous nation. Let us open our doors to immigrants, let us attract them by liberal and just legislation, and welcome them to our country; let us receive them as friends, who come to us with ability and love for work. Then all native Americans can have the best that America has to offer, and this "best" will increase in quantity and quality.</p>
