   <p>Four thousand men and women demonstrated yesterday at the Pioneer Aid Society's picnic in Sheffield that the working class of Chicago possesses a spirit of resistance which cannot be broken by a lying press or police tricks or persecutions.</p>
   <p>Dr. E. Schmidt was the first speaker. The picnic was arranged by all German workers' clubs through the Pioneer Aid Society in order to raise funds for a monument for the Haymarket heroes.</p>
