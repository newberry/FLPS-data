   <p>One of the most urgent problems in the State of Illinois is that of providing work. The great density of population in Chicago and vicinity has brought the number of unemployed to many hundreds of thousands, and misery and want have acquired frightening proportions. The sums needed for the care of the poor have attained a fantastic level, and the demands made on the work of those already employed are increasingly larger. This situation can be mended by decreasing the numbers of the unemployed, by providing them with work. The "how" in this case is the great problem.</p>
   <p>Since it is not entirely impossible to solve the difficult question if all circles involved would co-operate, the newly elected governor, Horner, took it upon himself to nominate a commission, and after consulting with Governor Emmerson, to give this commission the task of trying to solve the problem <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of providing work. It consists of representatives of industry, commerce, the unions, and science. The problem to be discussed has for long been the topic of conversation throughout the country, but a workable solution has never been found. Sometime ago President Hoover likewise inaugurated a big program which caused public and private building programs to be initiated. These programs never materialized, however. The difficult equation between theory and practice, between willing and doing, was not solved.</p>
   <p>The commission named by Horner will be faced with an exceedingly difficult task. Lack of money will prevent the carrying out of building programs in such proportions that they would result in a marked diminution in the number of unemployed. And yet building activities represent perhaps the only possibility of reaching a solution of the problem. It will therefore be necessary to concentrate attention on the question of procuring money for the buildings to be undertaken. Our calculations might perhaps become easier if we took into consideration the fact that, with each job filled, the relief authorities have one less burden and are able to get along with less money.</p>

   <p>Whether the introduction of a shorter working time would help appreciably is to be doubted, especially since shorter hours have been established in many work shops, and it is no longer possible to make them shorter. Where this is not yet in practice, it could, of course, be done if it only would help improve the situation.</p>
   <p>The utilization of material to be found or produced in Illinois for the building of governmental structures, as Horner recommended to the commission, is an idea worth thinking about. Moreover, Horner's observation that rich harvests are rotting in the fields while hundreds of thousands of families do not know where their next meal is coming from deserves the attention of the commission when they make their suggestions.</p>
   <p>All the commission has to do is to work out suggestions which may be submitted to the legislature for acceptance. Horner promised beforehand that he will do his best to put into effect all feasible recommendations. Something must be done; in fact, much must be done if misery and want are to be <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>arrested. It cannot continue as it has hitherto. The population, insofar as it has been deprived of its income by the economic crisis, is coming closer and closer to despair. It is therefore desirable that the commission named by Horner perform swift and successful work.</p>
