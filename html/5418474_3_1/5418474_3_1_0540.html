   <p>The Bolshevist movement in general is directed, not so much against the outgrowths of the old political systems, but against private ownership. It is incorrect to call Bolshevism an outgrowth of socialism. No matter what one thinks of socialism, it is a fact that it advocates the erection of something new and, in the opinion of its adherents, something better, in place of that which it thinks should be torn down. Bolshevism contemplates no building whatsoever.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism is similar to an autocratic system of government, with only this difference, that under the latter those in control were prudent enough to use force moderately, for they knew that their existence and their power were very closely connected with the welfare of their subjects. They were very strict, it is true, and gave those whom they did not trust very little opportunity for political activity. But they did insist upon order and protected the life and property of the individual. The Bolsheviki in Russia, on the other hand, are carrying on a veritable reign of terror. Their hands are steeped in blood and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>nobody is protected against a neighbor.</p>
   <p>It seems to be inconceivable that such a reign of terror could exist for any length of time, and that the decent citizens do not unite and drive out the usurpers, for the non-Bolshevists must outnumber the criminals who are toying with the lives and property of their fellow citizens. Of course, in every country there are a small fraction of persons who really should be in jail, and there are a number of others who are easily led by the criminal elements. If the latter class finds able leaders, who know how to turn a political or economic crisis to their advantage, the result is a sad condition, such as obtains in Russia today.</p>
   <p>In Russia the demagogues were aided by the inability of the bourgeois Government; the inhabitants were hungry; defeated soldiers returned home and wanted land on which to grow food for themselves and their families, and the Government could not comply with their wish as quickly as they desired. A spark was all that was necessary to kindle the tinder that had accumulated. Conditions in Hungary were similar. The Hungarians were hungry, the peace promised was <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>delayed, and neighboring states took steps to cut up the hide of the slain bear for distribution. No wonder that the excitement in that part of the population which usually fares worst in such crises increased to such an extent that flames soon broke forth from the smoldering mass. Apparently the wind necessary for fanning the flames was supplied when French and Rumanian troops took possession of certain parts of Hungary. Have the Hungarians anything else to lose? They observe that their enemies are oppressing them more and more, despite the fact that the armistice has been signed and peace is imminent.</p>
   <p>In Hungary as well as in Russia the Bolshevists were able to assume control, since the inhabitants were in the grip of despair because no relief from the existing political and economic conditions was in immediate prospect. The ease with which the power of government was delivered into irresponsible and criminal hands may serve as an instigation to Bolshevists in other countries. The only preventive measure consists in bringing about normal conditions in the world--by immediately concluding peace. When people are fed well they are not as easily accessible to Bolshevist endeavor as they are when they have no food and see their children die of starvation. Immediate peace and systematic and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>reasonable social legislation are the best preventives against the further spread of Bolshevism.</p>
