   <p>It looks as if the Philadelphia ex-convict, Yerkes, is going to force his people into a new strike. In last Sunday's agreement, which formed the basis for a provisional peace between the strikers and himself, he expressly contracted the reinstatement of all strikers with the exception of those only who did damage to the property of the street car company or harmed the scabs during the strike.</p>
   <p>Those few scabs who actually were in service during that time (understood in the contract) should be allowed to remain as long as they pleased and an equivalent number of strikers should be used for extra service for the time being.</p>
   <p>The meaning of the contract, (and the committee of the strikers could have understood it only this way otherwise they would never/signed it), have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was to give all strikers a chance, in time, to regain their old positions. Yesterday, Yerkes did not even think of being bound by this contract. Aside from the fact that he put more scabs in service yesterday morning than he had ever employed before he also declared that all positions becoming vacant will be filled by scabs.</p>
   <p>As he states the number of scabs in service at the present time is 201, there would be 201 old workers out of jobs. When Furthmann, Yerkes' assistant, was asked about the apparent breach of contract, he answered:</p>
   <p>"Never mind the contract! Do you think Mr. Yerkes intends to commit suicide? What would he do during the next strike? Who would work for him in the next strike if he would not take care of the 'new men'?</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"The contract says that the 'new men' should have preference, that is the point!"</p>
   <p>The dissatisfaction of the old North Side people as well as the West siders over the chief's breach of promise is so great that it seems very likely that a second big strike will be called within the next few days, with the participation of the employees of all street car lines of the Philadelphian money-bag concern in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York, etc.</p>
   <p>The recent strike has shown that the workers of Chicago have not quite forgotten how to help each other and combat a mutual enemy together. Yerkes' employees can rely upon the help and aid of the workers and also the majority of business people.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>They would be assured of that, even if some misguided citizens and scoundrels of Raster's type should mobilize the militia and the "shooting boys" of the so-called regular troops in the interest of the Philadelphia syndicate.</p>
   <p>It is certain that doings will be pretty lively in case of a second strike in Chicago, and perhpas also in other cities tributary to the Philadelphia monopolists.</p>
   <p>The Lake View mayor, Mr. Bolden Weck, who was present at last night's mass meeting at Clybourn and North Avenues, informed the strikers that the Lake View city council had taken steps to void the right of way within its city limits for Yerkes' company.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Upon George Schilling's request and advice the same assembly elected a new and smaller committee to confer with Yerkes and eventually with the mayor of Chicago. The names of the committee members were kept secret.</p>
   <p>Upon motion of his friend, Dixon, a vote of thanks was expressed, in yesterday's city council session, to the mayor for his "effective" efforts in disposing of the strike.</p>
   <p>No serious riots have occurred so far. Yerkes seems to have transferred his scab-colony to the limits-stables for reasons of safety.</p>
   <p>When the employees of the Yerkes concern suffer the establishment by Yerkes of a scab-colony anywhere within the city, to be used as a bodyguard for himself, they will be unconditionally lost for all future.</p>
