   <p>Chicago, June 28, 1879.</p>
   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned, citizens of the 14th ward, desire to call the attention of the Germans living in that ward to the underhanded malicious practice of the Democratic ward club in selecting names for the campaign committee.</p>
   <p>As the Germans constitute nearly three-fifths of the Democratic voters in that ward, it would be no more than fair, as well as democratic to give them equal representation. Although fifty citizens were selected for the committee, only thirteen were Germans. The remainder are of the following national origins: Polish, three; Scandinavian, three; Americans, two; Irish, twenty-nine.</p>
   <p>That a group which, at most, consists of one-fourth of the total voters should be represented by more than one-half of the committee members, seems decidely unfair.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Therefore, we desire to urge the German voters to fight for their rights, so that they may have proper representation--and, if it is impossible to obtain justice under the present circumstances, then it is the duty of the Germans to organize a new club.</p>
   <p>Jacob Kestner,</p>
