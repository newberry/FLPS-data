   <p>An indignation meeting was held last night at Nutzhorn's Hall at which Michael Schwab was elected president. In the absence of Mr. F. A. Stauber, Comrade August Spies was the speaker of the evening. He related in English the well-known story of Gibbs, Walsh, Malone and Mc Grath and contended that the acquittal of those scoundrels in the election fraud case was a crime which was even greater than the crime committed. Judge Gardner declared through this action, that in the future any crook can impose onto the voters a representative of his own liking and like character.</p>
   <p>States Attorney L. L. Mills is as guilty as Gardner for he has postponed the case until he was successful in bringing it into Judge Gardner's Court whose unscrupulousness and dishonesty was known to him. The speaker considers Gardner's decision a death blow to the fundamental principles of the government of a Republican State.</p>

   <p>Mr. Paul Grottkau followed the first speaker saying in German:-"The story and crime of this election swindle is known to every one. Therefore our main concern now is the decision rendered by the judge; there lies the danger for our Republic. Our form of government considers the decisions and viting rights of the people as sacred, for it is the foundation which it is build. To judge by the decision of that jurist, the peeple have no more rights to make their own decisions, but a few corrupt individuals are entitled to form and guide their destiny. The executor in effigy of this quartet of criminals will possibly be followed soon, by the enraged public with a real execution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Spies submitted then the following resolutions which were accepted unanimously:="Considering that the right and power of self-government is granted to the people in a Republican State, and considering that honest voting and honest counting of votes, by which the People's wish can alone be expressed is the first and most sacred <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>right of a people under a Republican form of Government and furthermore that this right has been trampled upon during the Aldermanic election of the 14th ward in the year 1880 as it was proven in the Circuit and Criminal Courts and, considering that 'Honorable' Gardner the presiding Judge in this case, despite proofs and confessions of the criminals acquitted them of the crime, we the citizens of 14th ward, have decided, although indignantly condemning the crooks Gibbs, Walsh, Malone and Mc Grath, to hold Judge Gardner, responsible for this crime that he through his decision has sanctioned. It was also resolved to consider Judge Gardner as unable to pass judgment in the sense of the law after he has committed such an enormous crime against the freedom of the people. Therefore, we ask his removal from office and prison for his deed. It is decided that the hanging of these scoundrels which is effected today on their effigies only, shall, in proper time, when, the people awake to protect themselves against corruption become bitter reality.</p>

   <p>Presently the crowd fastened wire between telegraph posts from which the effigies of these four criminals were dangling in the light to the accompaniment of the cheering of the crowd.</p>
