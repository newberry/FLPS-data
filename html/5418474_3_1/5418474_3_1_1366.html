   <p>Loyal service, German courage, and devotion to a good cause were rewarded and found their appreciation in a demonstration which the Germans of the Ninth Congressional District held last night in the North Side Turner Hall, where they honored their representative in Congress, Mr. Fred A. Britten. The German element of Chicago's north side wanted to prove that gratitude toward a man who had always championed their interests faithfully and honorably was no empty gesture, as far as the Germans were concerned. Six-hundred Germans of the district, representing all classes and factions of the German population, gathered together to let Congressman Britten know how much they appreciated his courageous fight for the cause of their German brothers overseas, and to assure him of their support in the coming election. The mood and spirit of the meeting found eloquent expression in the following resolution, drafted and proposed by a committee under the chairmanship of Louis O. Kohtz, and adopted unanimously:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"We, American citizens of German descent, assembled here this 15th day of October, 1914 in the North Side Turner Hall, do hereby express our deep appreciation for the services on behalf of truth and justice for the good cause, which our representative in the Congress of the United States, Mr. Fred A. Britten, has rendered his constituents. We assure Mr. Britten of our appreciation of his activities in this matter. The voters of the Ninth Congressional District assembled here are proud of their representative in the Congressional of the world's greatest republic. They assure him of their fullest support, and will do their best to secure Mr. Fred A. Britten's re-election."</p>
   <p>A NONPARTISAN DEMONSTRATION</p>
   <p>The demonstration, which assumed an informal character, was nonpartisan. Republicans and Democrats alike, regardless of party affiliations, paid their respects to the honor guest of the evening for the services which the had rendered the German element of the Ninth Congressional District in the <span class="page-break">3</span>lower house of the national legislature. The president of the Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner Association). Mr. Ernst G. Kusswurm, was in charge of the meeting. The main speaker was Pastor Alfred Meyer of the Evangelical St. John's Congregation. In eloquent terms he described the merits which the evening's honor guest had earned in Washington by couragously championing the German cause, as well as liberty, truth, and justice. The speaker pointed out how Congressman Britten, resolutely criticising the administration, had challenged the Allies' propaganda campaign in the American press against the German Reich and Austria-Hungary, by urging immediate reparation of the [German transatlantic] wireless station in Tuckerton, thus enabling the United States to receive unbiased reports on the European war from German sources.</p>
   <p>PROTEST AGAINST "BRITONS OF THE EAST"</p>
   <p>Amidst loud applause, the speaker called attention to Congressman Britten's demand in Congress that the State Department and the federal government issue <span class="page-break">4</span>a protest to the Japanese, these "Britons of the Far East," for having occupied German island possessions lying within the zone of interest of the United States. This militant attitude towards Japanese arrogance, and potential danger to the United States, reflected true German courage, Pastor Meyer pointed out. "This courageous action in the face of an opposition which has grown very powerful in the nation's capital", declared the speaker, "merits Fred A. Britten's re-election, by an overwhelming majority to the office whose duties he has so ably discharged." Pastor Meyer then mentioned still another service which Representative Britten had performed, namely, his favoring of German immigration during the debate on the Immigration Bill. The speaker added that hardly ever had a representative in Congress described, so eloquently and forcefully, the achievements and contributions made by the German immigrants to the development of the United States. All these things have made it the duty of the Germans in the Ninth Congressional District to see to it that the honor guest is re-elected by an overwhelming majority.</p>

   <p>BRITTEN'S ADDRESS</p>
   <p>Pastor Meyer's speech was received with great applause, and was followed by an address by the evening's honor guest, who modestly pointed out that his championing of the German cause was nothing more than natural, since both his father and mother had come from Germany, and that he consequently tried to do all he could for the German element, whether it met with the approval of the English [language] press or not. The German cause needed German representatives in a Congress which was dominated by the South and incapable of understanding German interests and the German element. The speaker called his listeners' attention to the Prohibition bill, proposed by a southern representative, Hobson (who wanted to foist Prohibition on the whole country) and urged the audience to present a united front against any such proposal. The speaker went into details about the war tax proposal [bill] which, he said, originated with the President. He called the measure unfair, since it imposed new tax burdens on the masses, while the federal government had deposited in banks seventy-five million dollars, to be kept there so as not <span class="page-break">6</span>to disturb the credit of the nation, as the President expressed it. Urging the German element of the state and the city to take a more active part in politics if they wanted to gain the recognition due them, the representative concluded his speech by thanking the audience for the confidence they had shown him.</p>
