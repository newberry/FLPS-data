   <p>The German-American Socialist Group held last night at the Vorwarts-Turnhalle (Forward Turner Hall) a meeting, presided over by M. V. Britzius, who introduced the agitator, K. Hardie. The latter expressed the hope, that the human rights, existing so far only on paper, would become some day a practical fact. Predicting the rise of the working classes to power and leadership, he insisted, that the red symbol of international brotherhood should stand high above all national flags.</p>
