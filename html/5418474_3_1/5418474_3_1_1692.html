   <p>The fact that the Hon. E. B. Washburne will probably be the Republican candidate for Governor has so alarmed our Democratic friends in this section that they are beginning to try to discourage his candidature. To this end, a gentleman who trains with the Democracy is out in last Monday's St. Louis Republican with an article headed "Washburne and the Germans" wherein he tries to break the force of the argument which the Tribune employed some time ago to show why Washburne is very popular with our German-American citizens. Notwithstanding this, however, The Tribune is right, for the fact is patent to all that Minister Washburne is, for good reasons. very popular with our German friends, as well as immensely strong with our party.</p>
   <p>What does all this uproar about Washburne mean in the Democratic papers? It simply means that our Democratic friends know that, if Washburne is nominated for Governor, their ticket will be beaten 50,000 votes in Illinois this fall...</p>
