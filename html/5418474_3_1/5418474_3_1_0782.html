   <p>The Group "Northwestside" held yesterday evening it's regular meeting, Comrade Krause presided. Comrade Kramer lectured interestingly about the development of the argicultural and industrial conditions in America. The speaker lived in this country for more than 37 years. When he came here there was only one millionaire; today there are more than 500. At that time there were no beggers; today we find hundreds of thousands. He described the existence of the three correlative working forces, which control modern society and transform the earth into a valley of misery: the class policy, Religion and the Capitalists. The last named form the issue, the basis of the first named; without them the others could not exist. He showed how everything points towards the fight, that the Reform movements were nothing but soap bubbles-- exterior signs of inward decomposition. The large masses who have no possessions are driven to fight -- they must fight or perish. Against the bayonets of the ruling classes, they will use different weapons in the approaching fight. A single electric machine is capable of destroying whole armies with the turn of hands, and such a machine is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>already in existence. The speaker was loudly acclaimed.</p>
