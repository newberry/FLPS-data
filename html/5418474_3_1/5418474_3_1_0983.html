   <p>The monthly meeting of the German Section, was held yesterday. Agent Kempke opened the meeting, after which Comrade Bluhm was appointed chairman, and then the voting on several proposed candidates took place, thus to enable them, to participate at the meeting. Following this Mr. Gestefeld acting for the editor of the "Arbeiter Zeitung" discussed a message from comrade Spies, who brands the participation of the German Section, in connection with the election of delegates to the National Convention, as abominable, and endeavored to defeat the Central-Committee's decision, to call a meeting yesterday, at which to name the delegates. It has been decided, after a lively debate, to give comrade Spies a chance, at the next meeting, to speak about and explain his belief. After this, the usual procedure of meetings has begun. The minutes of the two preceding sessions have been read and accepted, and the reports of the secretary of finance, and that of the Treasurer, assigned to the review Committee.</p>
   <p>A number of officials have been appointed for the arrangement, of the Ball, to be given by the Party on New Years Eve.</p>
   <p>A long drawn out debate ensued, as to the right of the German Section, to send <span class="page-break">\2</span>delegates independently to the Party's convention. It has been finally decided, to submit the whole matter to the Central Committee for consent, and to receive their authorization. During the debate concerning the appointment of delegates, comrade Frawz declared, that Jeffer's decided attitude as far, as the presidential election is in question, is such, which would necessitate an instruction from the delegates. As for the question, of an independent presidential candidate to be put up by the Socialist Labor Party, every one at the meeting seemed to be in favor of, but the form of instruction to the delegates, gave cause for a long debate. Mr. Frawz proposed the following: "Our delegates shall be authorized to work and vote for an independent presidential candidate. Furthermore, that under circumstances, a Union with the "Labor Party of California", the "Labor Party of Fall River" and that of Massachusettes" and with the Labor Elements of the "National-Greenback Party", "The Liberal League" and the "Free-Thinkers", could be resorted to, but to take care, that no compromise whatsoever should be made, by putting up a Platform. Mr. Gestefeld spoke against this proposal, saying that such action would mean compromises for the Labor Parties, and voiced his opinion, that it would be far more advantageous to act independently, especially, if the candidates platform would be of such nature, which could win the labouring people. Only that which was obtainable, should be given consideration. Mr. Sievers was of the same opinion. Mr. Frawz opposed this proposition, which would mean a departure from socialist principles and insisted, that his proposition should be taken into consideration. Mr. Gestefeld raised again opposition<span class="page-break">\3</span> and pointed out, that the Labor Party of Massachusetts is dictated by Benjamin F. Butler, and that the Party would co-operate with him to promote his ambitious plans. After a long debate, Mr. Frawz's proposition has been accepted. According to a report made by the agent, the assignments of Mr. Stern and Mr. Huth as members of the Central-Committee have been withdrawn, and in their stead, Messrs. Wolfgang Pfeiffer and Leon appointed.</p>
