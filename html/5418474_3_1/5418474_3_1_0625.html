   <p>In the olden times May Day used to be warm and pleasant and folks danced on the green without chest protectors or winter overcoats. That played out some years ago, and people have been celebrating May Day as moving day which is not a feast, but a day of fasting and humiliation. But now May Day has taken a new complexion. It asserts itself as the new Labor Day. It is the day on which labor rises up and makes demands. It wants eight hours for a day's work now. It makes no promises what it will want in the future. It says only, "Eight hours a day."</p>
   <p>Among the many organizations who took part in the big parade of 10,000 workers were the German Turner Societies numbering about 820 and the Bohemian wood turners numbering 248. The German section carried a banner <span class="page-break">\2</span>with the familiar German Sentiment Einigkect Macht "Stark." It means Unity makes strength. It was paraphrased by the English transparency "In Unity, with reason, you will receive justice".................... There was much joking with the Bohemian sash, door, and blind makers, as they carried specimens of their handicraft with them and the spectators cast many a jibe at the workmanship, but it was all taken good naturedly as it was sent. Speeches were made by the leaders of the various organizations.</p>
