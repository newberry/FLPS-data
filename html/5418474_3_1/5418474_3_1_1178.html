   <p>Various measures advocated by the administration must also be decided by the voters.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow is the judicial election.</p>
   <p>There are forty-five candidates; twenty-two must be chosen for the important post, i. e. twenty for the Superior Court and two for the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>But in this instance the judicial election is combined with certain acceptances or rejections of administrational measures.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, everyone's duty to consider and vote on these important measures.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The polls are open from six o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Recommendations of the Abendpost</p>

Our opinion is based on all the important questions arising in this choice and we recommend the following twenty candidates who appear on the Democratic list. They are printed in bold type. The asterisk before the name signifies that the candidate is a judge at present.</p>
   <p>In the lower list, showing the Circuit Court candidates, the Abendpost recommends Daniel P. Trude, Democrat, and Edgar A. Jonas, Republican.</p>

   <p>The Bond Issues</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>A separate ballot asks for twenty million dollars for the Park Board. It concerns all the voters of West Side Wards and the Ward numbers are printed near the upper right-hand corner. It involves the building of a highway towards Kinzie Street.</p>
   <p>Another ballot is presented by the Lincoln Park Board. Here also appears the numbers of the Wards concerned, also in the upper right-hand corner. A request for three million dollars is made. This represents an additional three million dollars to the legislative grant of nine million dollars for the enlargement of the Park.</p>
   <p>All voters will receive a special ballot containing the following propositions:</p>
   <p>Proposition One contains a request for two and one-half millions for sanitary improvements in the forest reservation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Proposition Two contains a mysterious request, enabling the County to change the tax rate for County streets without the necessity of first asking for a vote.</p>
   <p>Proposition Three asks for $3,320,500 to repair the above roads. A vote of "yes" for number Two also requires affirming number Three. Likewise in the negative.</p>
   <p>Propositions Four, Five, and Six represent loans for the city administration, Faherty's Department, to reimburse property owners on Ashland Avenue and Western Avenue and North La Salle Street.</p>
   <p>Proposition Seven again presents a mysterious text.</p>
   <p>Interpreted, it gives the treasurer and corporation counsel the power to represent city employees in matters appertaining to litigation and defray <span class="page-break">\7</span>the cost.</p>
   <p>Proposition Eight provides for a change in the aldermanical election laws.</p>
   <p>Proposition Nine enables the city court to increase the number of judges, if circumstances require it.</p>
   <p>The Position of the Abendpost</p>
   <p>After a thorough consideration of all factors involved, the Abendpost recommends:</p>
   <p>In regard to the highway on Kinzie Street, the Abendpost is of the opinion that no objections can be raised, but at this time and in view of the present financial condition of the treasury the matter requires serious introspection.</p>
   <p>Regarding the Lincoln Park district, that matter concerns only the residents <span class="page-break">\8</span>in that section and they must bear the taxes alone, so the choice rests with them.</p>
   <p>About the long list of propositions the Abendpost remarks:</p>
   <p>No objections can be raised about Proposition One, but we must consider that the County's financial condition is very bad at present.</p>
   <p>Propositions Two and Three need the same consideration.</p>
   <p>Regarding Propositions Four, Five, and Six: Here the Abendpost does not care to make any recommendations.</p>
   <p>These latter propositions emanate from Flaherty and two or three times before the voters turned thumbs down on them, so it appears that the gentleman does not enjoy full public confidence anymore.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>The property owners, whose land was taken by condemnation proceedings, deserve the money. They were compelled to wait long enough, and it is about time that they received it.</p>
   <p>Propositions Seven and Nine should be rejected, because the text does not explain what one votes for.</p>
   <p>No objections arise about Proposition Eight.</p>
