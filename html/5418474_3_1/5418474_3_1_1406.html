   <p>Although A. S. Trude is not personally interested in the Judicial-Campaign, he wants to assist the candidacy of his brother George A. Trude, and is particularly anxious, that his "record" as member of the Schoolboard should especially help him.</p>
   <p>That the Germans, in the person of A. S. Trude, possess a true friend is well known. At the meeting of the school board committee, on March 20th, 1893 he voted with his colleages Halle, Duggan, Cusack and Mrs. Burt, that also in the primary schools the German language should be taught and in the deciding general meeting of April 12th, he frustrated the opponents of German teaching, by leaving the room with Messrs. Halle, Boldenweck, Dr. Bluthardt and Duggan, to prevent a quorum. George A. Trude has, on that occassion, privately used all his influence in favor of the Germans.</p>
