   <p>The main Section of the Socialist Labor-Party met yesterday afternoon, at Zepp's Halle, which had a large attendance.</p>
   <p>The meeting which was presided at first by Mr. H. Stahl and later by F. Bielefeld, was very lively, but after a debate of about three hours, it became possible to settle the differences between the German and the English Sections. The first question to deal with was, whether the Chicago Section will be permitted to send delegates to the National Congress, for they are in arrears with their contributions to the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>A hot debate ensued, as to the cause of this, but after a lengthy explanation, that costs of agitation, etc. were directly to blame for it but not the slightest <span class="page-break">2</span>suspicion can be cast upon any of the officials. A proposition made by Mr. Morgan, that the financial difficulties of this Section should be explained to the National Congress, and with the promise to pay their debts at the earliest moment possible, to ask the Main Section for permission to send their delegates. The next step was, the election of delegates. The English Section proposed Parsons, Bishop and Stahl. The choice of the German Section fell upon Jeffers and Kempke. The Bohemian,French and Scandinavian Sections refrained from putting up candidates.</p>
   <p>Parsons received 86 votes, Jeffers 72 and Kempke 55 votes. The Main Section then, assigned Parsons and Kempke to the National Congress. Considering the expenses, it had been previously decided, to send two delegates only.</p>
