   <p>No public election is imaginable without a campaign preceeding it. If election campaigns were prohibited, then elections would be but farcical, as no one would know whom to elect. In the ancient Greek city republics, campaignless elections proved possible in the long run, for in those small communities numbering at most a mere few thousand voting citizens, it was assumed that everybody knew everyone else - - knew what mind he was possessed of and whether he would fit into the office for which he was running. Even in the largest of the Greek free states, Athens, one might have dispensed with a campaign because a rather limited number of persons came into consideration for a real election, and all of them were generally well known.</p>
   <p>At any rate, there might perhaps have developed a regular election campaign in Athens, had there been elections in the sense applied today. But most <span class="page-break">\2</span>offices, insofar as they were granted by the people, used to be "raffled off", partly for fear that some one might compete for favors with the populace, thus acquiring considerable power, and partly because the party system was hardly known there. Only in the rarest cases before an election were there certain programs worked out for the future conduct of the government or for the adherence to a certain political platform. The elected were trusted, whoever they might be, and were expected to guide the fate of the State for the best interest of the inhabitants. They had every reason to have that trust because, if the rulers acted in contrast to public opinion, they could expect dire, even cruel punishment. Democracy was then still in its infancy, its principles and its aims were simple and understandable to everyone.</p>
   <p>Today the world is much more complicated, and its administration even more so, because everywhere interests clash. The voting citizens of Athens probably never constituted more than a fiftieth part of the voters of Chicago. The difference in itself would make an election campaign a necessity, because <span class="page-break">\3</span>the candidates must needs seek contact with the voters. The divergence of interests among the voters in itself necessitates a campaign, because the individual interests have to be fought for by different candidates. Modern political and economic life is so complicated that usually only a relatively small portion of the population is able to appreciate, in advance, the merits of the programs of the parties and candidates. The campaign is to serve this purpose of elucidating to the voter the attitude of the candidates toward some burning questions, to enable them to form an opinion of their own as to whether this or the other candidate is better fitted for the office coveted. In the modern republic, and in every country governed in accordance with modern constitutions, election campaigns are a necessity. They constitute the terms upon which an intelligent exercise of the right of suffrage by the voting masses is based.</p>
   <p>It is regrettable that the institution is often a source of public irritation, namely when the opposition candidate, instead of fighting over differences of <span class="page-break">\4</span>opinion in a matter-of-fact way, utilize the opportunity for unjustified personal aussaults which have nothing to do with the issue. Those who make use of such weapons are ill advised, and hurt only themselves generally. Because personal tacklings so much in the order of the day during the present election campaign in Chicago as a rule fall back upon the tackler because people involuntarily (and perhaps unconsciously), but with no less instinctive precision, draw, certain conclusions from the candidates method of fighting upon the character of the fighter. At election, they are easily swayed by the impression so received. It is perhaps an exaggeration to think that all people do that. There will be some who always go with their candidate through thick and thin, no matter how far he may stretch the limits of honest ways of fighting, not unlike those who greedily wallow in gossip as pigs do in filth.</p>
   <p>But these advance troops are, in the last analysis, not always decisive. In the majority of elections the large numbers of those bring about a decision who are otherwise not much concerned with politics and are not awakened from <span class="page-break">\5</span>their sleep until the last weeks before elections. The candidates seem to overlook the bad impression made by their indiscriminate personal abuse and by their attempts to blacken the apponent's reputation. They deport themselves in such a manner as to make it appear that a successful election depends solely upon the one who has the biggest mouth. But things are no longer that way. The average voter of today is intelligent enough to have the correct evaluation of the "unfairness" of such fire of abuse. In justice to himself, he thinks that candidates who, in the main, discharge their feelings with contumely do so because they cannot fight with essential facts. As soon as the voter gets this realization the abusing candidate has lost his game. The adage "Political song, ugly song" is generally known and one is well used to muckraking for the undermining of the personal reputation of an opponent. Every decent man senses, in the long run, the indignity of such procedure. It is evident that mutual personal abuse is not necessarily a sequel of an election campaign.</p>
