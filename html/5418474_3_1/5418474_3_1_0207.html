   <p>Bad news comes from the Coke region of Pennsylvania (Fayette County). About one half of the miners laid down their tools and joined the horde of unemployed, already in existence there since last fall. According to the same report, the mass of these striking miners and unemployed consists mainly of Slavs and Huns, who are now touring daily the whole district, threatening the population with firearms and terrorizing anybody, willing to go back to work. And now comes the most peculiar part of the report: This mob of rude foreigners , who speak only broken English, is led by Americans, who are seemingly trying their best, to keep the foreign brutes from violence.</p>
   <p>Our own correspondent checked up on this report and gave us the following facts. The miners' strike in Fayette County was caused by broken wage-increase promises of the mine-owners, who have called in strike-breakers during the last six years at various strike occasions. This has caused a surplus of labor and a steady increase of unemployed. The present strikers consist of Poles, Russians, Hungarians and Irishmen. The latter obviously are the leaders and as spokesmen <span class="page-break">2</span>deliberate over the heads of the strikers with the mine-owners, who probably will give them the better jobs, when the strike is over, as an equivalent for keeping the ignorant mob from violence. As often before, the Irish are winning the game, by duping the multitude and holding the hands open for rewards from the owners and bosses.</p>
