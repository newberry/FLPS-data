   <p>To-morrow evening, a general meeting of all German Democrats will be held at 106 Randolph Street, William H. Young's Hall, for the purpose of uniting all German members and adherents of the party under a single banner, or rather to select "Representation" for them, so that their rights may be properly represented and that the German element will be better organized during the elections.</p>
   <p>All Germans who subscribe to the Democratic principals, are requested to be present.</p>
