   <p>Last Sunday an agitation meeting was held in Gruhlky's Hall, 220 45th Street. Comrade Kiesling presided. Comrade Schwab delivered a lecture that was well received. The workingmen of Town Lake appeared in large numbers. Comrade Schwab depicted in strong language the misery and suffering of the working people and the exploiting they must endure from the capitalistic class.</p>
   <p>After the lecture they proceeded to organize and because it was getting late, the election of officers was postponed till next Sunday. Twenty-five new members joined the group immediately. It was hoped that within a short time the club would grow to be one of the largest local groups, which does not seem to be an exaggeration.</p>
