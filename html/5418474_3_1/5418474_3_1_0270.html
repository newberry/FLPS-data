   <p>The strike of the bakers is now a thing of the past. With the exception of a few strikers all the men went back to work at the request of their employers, who conceded all points demanded by the union.</p>
   <p>Among the nearly fifty bakeries practically all the large German concerns are included, such as Fred Voltz, Frank Schweinfurth, Heissler and Junge, H. Piper, William Schmidt, Philip Henrici, P. Groll, C. Muench, and William Muench.</p>
   <p>However, another meeting was scheduled for this morning, at Klare's Hall, to organize all those bakery workers who have not yet joined the union. [Translator's note: A previous article shows that the officials of the union are Germans.] The union does not intend to meet until the recently obtained benefits are shared by all bakery workers in Chicago.</p>
