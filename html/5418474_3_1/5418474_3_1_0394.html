   <p>Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel, the economic advisor to Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, contends that in the "Back to the Land" movement there is no solution for America's unemployment problem. If the standard of living could be raised in proportion to the possibilities of machine production, at least four million agricultural laborers would have to be settled in the cities.</p>
   <p>In other words, Dr. Ezeciel advocates a "Back to the Factories" movement which, through all sorts of legislation and other means, has been attempted before.</p>
   <p>According to official statistics, between three and five million persons have come back to work. It is only to be desired that the movement, which deals with migrations of large numbers of unemployed factories and other places of occupation, and not from the country into the cities, should become a means of alleviating unemployment. If all unemployed workers could be placed in <span class="page-break">\2</span>the many branches of industry, a "Back to the Country" movement would be altogether unnecessary.</p>
   <p>Unemployment, however, is and still remains a great problem. The National Industrial Conference Board estimates the number of unemployed in this country at approximately eight million. According to the figures obtained by the National Federation of Labor, the number of number of unemployed amounts to nearly five million. Under these circumstances it is difficult to visualize how four additional million or forty per cent of all agricultural workers could be brought to the factories the cities, as Dr. Ezekiel wants to do.</p>
   <p>Who is going to buy the products of industry if the country's entire population, save for a small percentage, works in factories or is otherwise absorbed by the cities? Industry can hardly maintain itself by selling its products to its own employees. It must be in a position to dispose of them to the farmers, to more, in fact, than just a small percentage of them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It may indeed be true that a relatively small number of farmers can raise all the food needed by the population of the United States and even for purposes of export, unless there are continuous droughts or other blights imposed by nature, as, for instance, this year.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it cannot be contested that industry can produce more than it can sell at the present time, even though millions are still out of work and are otherwise dependent upon public relief.</p>
   <p>The problem of unemployment can be solved neither by a "Back to the Country" movement nor by a "Back to the Factories" movement. Both movements seem needed if that balance is reached which will enable a real change. But in no manner is real help possible if forty per cent of all agricultural workers suddenly placed in factories, as was suggested by Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel; this would increase the number of unemployed by just that many. The burdens carried by the communities in the form of public charities will become heavier and more unbearable than they are already.</p>
