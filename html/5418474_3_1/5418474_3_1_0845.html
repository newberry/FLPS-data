   <p>The carpenters and Joiners held last night a fairly well-attended meeting at 691 South Halsted Street. M. Schwab lectured on the attitude of the unions towards Socialism. The speaker explained that the Socialists always have been the best friends of the unions. That they always had fought for the workers receiving the full product of his work.</p>
   <p>This goal could be reached only by land and by the tools of labor becoming the common property of the people. The union should be cherished, cultivated, supported, and should not be used mostly for relief purposes.</p>
   <p>The speech lasted one hour and was applauded by every body. The spirit in this union is sound and active.</p>
