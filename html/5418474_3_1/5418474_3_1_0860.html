   <p>The Central Committee of Chicago's Socialists held its regular meeting yesterday. The delegates reported that there were well-attended meetings as well as active agitation throughout the various districts of the city. Mikolanta reported on his trip to Braidwood and the founding of the Bohemian group there. He requested of the Central Committee, an explanation of their principles in Bohemian. The permission was given him to have same translated and printed in that language.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that the Chicago Socialists express their sympathy to the Irish revolutionists: Sheridan, Walsh, and Tynan, whose extradition is asked by the English government. Any eventual attempt by our government to comply with this request shall be met with the most vigorous protest on our part, and we shall resort to any means at our disposal to render such proceedings impossible.</p>
