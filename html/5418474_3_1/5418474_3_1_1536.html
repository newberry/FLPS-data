   <p>A conference was held yesterday in the 2nd Ward by German-American friends of Alderman Bierling and of candidate Cooper. The purpose of the meeting was to find ways and means of preventing the election of candidate Levee and of the Irish bully, Horan. They came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to unite their efforts upon one of the candidates, and to choose the stronger one, apparently Cooper, in order to protect the Ward against Horan. However, no resolutions were adopted.</p>
