   <p>The group "Town of Lake" held a well attended Agitation Meeting last Saturday in their Hall at 220-45th Court. Comrade Schiffner presided. As there was nobody present to lecture, Comrade Kiesling started a debate of the theme: "Free Love." The motion was made and accepted that $1.75, which was collected for the family of Comrade Stellmacher, should be handed over to the committee in charge.</p>
