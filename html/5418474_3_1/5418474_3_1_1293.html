   <p>The German-American Citizens' Committee appeals to the German voters of Chicago to stand united during these perilous times, and to realize clearly that the defeat of Robert M. Sweitzer would mean a defeat of the German element [Deutschtum] and would be exploited as such by the anti-German forces all over the land. The Citizens' Committee comprises all classes of the Deutschtum,regardless of party affiliations. It was established more than a year before the election campaign got under way, and declared itself after the primaries for Sweitzer because it felt that Sweitzer's election was of vital necessity for the Deutschtum of the city and of the entire country as well. The Committee mailed many thousands of letters yesterday to German-American voters in the city and has included four postal cards in each, bearing the imprint: "The election of a German- <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>American to the office of mayor for the second largest city of the country will make a greater impression in Washington than all the protest meetings and resolutions held and adopted so far, etc." The recipients of the letters were asked to mail these postal cards to their friends with the request to vote for Sweitzer next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>The appeal, directed at the German element, runs as follows:</p>
   <p>During these grave times the Germans should understand what the election or defeat of Sweitzer would mean!</p>
   <p>Germans, be united for once -</p>
   <p>Don't bring disgrace upon yourselves!</p>
   <p>Sweitzer's election would be a German victory and would be regarded as such all over the country and in the whole world.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Sweitzer's defeat would be marked up as a defeat of the Deutschtum [German element].</p>
   <p>Contribute to the success of the Deutschtum; work and vote for Sweitzer. Distribute the enclosed cards among your friends.</p>
   <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>[signed] H. O. Lange, President.</p>
   <p>Rudolf Seifert, Secretary.</p>
