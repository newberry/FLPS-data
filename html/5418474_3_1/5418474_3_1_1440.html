   <p>While the Republican morning and evening papers press steadily upon their readers to vote for Judge Gary and the complete Republican ticket, most of the Democratic party organs show a shocking indifference. Of course the election of judges and county commissioners should be entirely independent of "Politics", but it is anyhow noteworthy that the independence is this time preached only to the Democratic voters. Is the Republican ballot so excellent and the Democratic one so terribly rotten, that each Republican can come with pride and each Democrat with shame to the polls?</p>
   <p>In fact the list of the judicial candidates especially has been put together much clumsier by the Republican convention of ex-office holders as by the Democratic convention of office holders. On it you find next to the "anarchist killer" Gary two lawyers who introduced themselves chiefly by their connection with socialistic and populistic endeavors. By the great "Old man" the well-to-do's and conservatives shall be baited, and by Sears and Kraft those who have nothing to lose and nothing to gain. Apart from this demagogical trick the list can be called pretty good. The German candidate Blanke especially is called, by all who know him closer, an able jurist and a man of honor.</p>

   <p>The Democratic ballot is without doubt influenced by Carter Harrison in as far as the candidates for the different juristical offices are concerned. Still the worst political opponents of this man only could object to the one thing, that the name of the Republican Gary is missing. Harrison's old friends had in fact more reason for dissatisfaction than his enemies, because their wishes were not cared for. But this is a matter, that does not concern the general public. The public generally only asks whether a candidate is worthy of the public confidence. And in this point the Democratic ticket answers all reasonable demands following careful inquiries it can be asserted that not a single name stands in this list that deserves to be erased. Concerning the German candidate, the well-known and beloved police judge George Kersten, it is hardly necessary to give him an extra recommendation. He has while in office in contrast to many other police judges, always exercised impartial justice and very seldom made an error. With good conscience one can say that he is a man of the genuine old German block.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances it cannot be seen why the Democratic voters should give preference to the Republican ticket, especially when it is known, that the Republican voters stick truly to their banner. Besides, a possible victory of the Republicans would be used in the coming mayor's election for their benefit and above all, would be called a personal defeat of Governor Altgeld. The attacks of the republican press are solely aimed against Altgeld who in fact has nothing at all to do with this election. Day by day the Democratic voters are solicited, to give to <span class="page-break">3</span>the Democratic governor a vote of distrust. On this point revolves the entire election battle.</p>
   <p>The German Democrats and independents know exactly what is what, and so may take measures accordingly for their decisions.</p>
