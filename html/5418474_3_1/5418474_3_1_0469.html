   <p>The principle of equalization which the German National Socialists prize so highly has already done much good. It has certainly served to hold the Germans together as a nation, since Hitler abruptly deprived the states of their independence and reduced them to mere provinces. This arbitrary equalization from above was necessary, since Germans suffer from the evil trait of making life miserable for one another, whether at home or abroad; and they do so with a zeal that is worthy of a better cause. The German states were jealous of each other, and no less quarrelsome. It was not so long ago that they were at war with each other. Fortunately, they have survived this stage. Hitler's equalization has proved effective.</p>
   <p>That is the most important result of the application of the principle. However, Hitler's party has much wider aims in view. Not only all distinctions of origin, but also all class distinctions are to fall by the wayside, and employers and <span class="page-break">2</span>employees are to be on the same footing. [Translator's note: This sentence is translated verbatim. The author apparently means to say that more of the German states shall continue to exist independently, or as a political entity.] In this respect, also, equalization has had unexpectedly quick results.</p>
   <p>Apparently there are no limits to equalization, as long as whole groups are to be placed on the same level. Governmental authority, as it exists in its most extreme form in Germany today, destroys all resistance by groups from the outset.</p>
   <p>However, matters are different in respect to individuals. An individual cannot be detected or seized as easily as a group, since his conduct is not as conspicuous as that of a group; but according to the wish of Hitlerites, individuals too are to be equalized in the Third Reich. Individualism is to be systematically eradicated and supplanted by a collective mind. Individual philosophy of life is to be eradicated to make way for the philosophy of life as prescribed by the State. And to attain this object, Hitler has appointed Dr. Alfred Rosenberg as Director of German Philosophy of Life. The Director has the unenviable task of <span class="page-break">3</span>destroying German individualism. It seems that authorities at Berlin, the center of the new philosophy, have overlooked the fact that they are thus robbing German nature of its very essence. In this instance the advocates of equalization have undertaken a task which unbiased observers regard as beyond the limits of possibility.</p>
   <p>From a purely theoretical standpoint, the new dictator of the German philosophy of life is following the correct procedure--he intends to anchor the new philosophy in a new religion. The gods of the old Germans are to be revived: Wotan, Donar, Frigg, and Freya, who were worshiped by the old Germans, when the latter were not idling the time away drinking Met or losing their property and families by gambling, are to be the symbols of the new religion. An effort is being made to learn from history. Buddhism and Mohammedanism created new philosophies which decided the fate of nations. It is not yet known who is to be the chief god of the new religion or the greatest prophet of the chief god, but that is not very important. The matter itself is what counts. Many centuries have elapsed since the time of Buddha and Mohammed: centuries in which men have progressed mentally, and have learned to protect their ego against every attack from without.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Gone, long gone, are the days of Buddha and Mohammed, and it is a Sisyphean task to attempt to force upon a materially minded world a new religion that will eradicate individualism. Here National Socialism has arrived at the limit of its power. If it goes beyond this limit it may bring destruction upon itself.</p>
