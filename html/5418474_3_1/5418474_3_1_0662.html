   <p>The County Hospital investigation committee reported at yesterday's meeting of the Trade's Council that the complaints of the carpenter, Keisler, about inhuman treatment in that corpse-factory were exaggerated.</p>
   <p>The physicians informed the committee that Keisler was delirious and had to be tied to his bed. The members of the committee, after pronouncing Keisler a liar or at least a person who does not know what is good for him, found it necessary to pronounce a eulogy of the present management of the County Hospital.</p>
