   <p>It is too bad that we did not get the 8 hour day voted in as a law.</p>
   <p>This election year should be a good time to work on that problem; the politicians are more ingratiating. Don't let that fool you as you can't depend on their promises-- We hope that on June the 9th the Labor Convention here in Chicago will be able to put up a Third Party with an 8 hour day platform.</p>
   <p>Next 4th of July is the day of all for an 8 Hour-Demonstration.-</p>
