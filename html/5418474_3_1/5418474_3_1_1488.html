   <p>The next election in Chicago will take place on April 4, 1893. The local English-speaking press has written about it for the last six months, and has persistently brought up Washington Hesing's name in connection with it.</p>
   <p>We remained silent about the whole affair, because we considered it premature. However, discussions about it have become so lively in many circles, that we can no longer evade it in these columns.</p>
   <p>We have printed upon another page W. Hesing's statements, made to a reporter of the Chicago Herald. Through these the readers are informed how Hesing arrived at the decision of presenting himself at the Democratic city convention as a candidate for mayor, next spring; and how Carter H. Harrison has urged him to do so.</p>
   
   <p>At this time, Hesing stated clearly and definitely the principles, upon which he would act in case he should be nominated and elected. The principles include the following: Reasonable liberty on Sundays, as well as during week days, but no licentiousness; honest and economical administration; suppressing of social evils, but no hypocritical promises of a complete and impossible eradication; keeping streets and alleys clean; sufficient police protection; as many improvements as our unfair taxing system permits; one term only for city officials, in order to eliminate every temptation to obtain a second term by means put at their disposal by their offices; the welfare of the city above party-politics; industrious public officials and workers in accordance with an eight-hour-day; personal supervision of the City Council by the mayor; capable men at the head of the different departments of the administration, and running affairs in business-like manner; initiation of reforms before administration scandals breakout; changes in the tax system in favor of small property owners; persistent efforts to maintain the city in an appropriate condition for the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>This is a sound but difficult program. However, Washington Hesing is the man who is able to carry it out; and whoever knows his past, will agree with us.</p>
   <p>As one of the managers of a large newspaper concern such as the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, he has gathered experience and gained the ability to manage a large city in accordance with sound business principles.</p>
   <p>Nobody in Chicago knows the machinery of the city administration better than he does. He obtained this knowledge by an eager study of conditions and laws of the city, as well as through personal contacts and cooperation. As a member of the City and County School Boards he has rendered willing and valuable service.</p>
   
   <p>Since Hesing is proficient in several languages, he is especially well qualified for the position of mayor during the World's Fair. Chicago never had a German mayor, although the Germans have chiefly contributed to its development and growth. Hesing has defended the rights of the Germans for over twenty-one years. He was one of the first who insisted, three years ago, upon a free Sunday during the World's Fair, in an address to the directors of the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Hesing not only possesses the necessary integrity, knowledge and education to execute his program successfully, but he has also a strong will and self-confidence.</p>
   <p>The above contains the cool deliberations of the mind only. We purposely kept the voice of the heart silent. But these alone ought to be sufficient to make his candidacy highly desirable particularly to the Germans.</p>
