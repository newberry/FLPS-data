   <p>The group "Vorwarts" held yesterday evening at 120 Wells Street a well-attended Agitation meeting. Comrade Pabst presided. The announced lecture about social conditions in Mexico could not be held, because the reporter was not present. Instead Comrade Fleiser held a lecture about food adulteration. Owing to the fact that the speaker is a butcher by trade, he mainly dwelt upon the methods of the manufacture of sausages, and proved that, for this purpose, not only meat of poor quality, but also totally unfit meat is used, and warned, in conclusion, that people should refrain from eating sausages altogether.</p>
   <p>About adulteration of other foods, Comrades Altherr and Peschke spoke. Several business matters were discussed; among others it was resolved that only those should be admitted to Saturday evening's entertainment who possess red cards or have been introduced by members of the I. A. A.</p>
   <p>After admitting several new members, the meeting adjourned.</p>
