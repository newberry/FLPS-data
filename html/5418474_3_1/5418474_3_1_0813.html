   <p>The Club "Freiheit" (Liberty) held under the presidency of Comrade Kaulbitz its weekly agitation meeting at 202 E. Van Buren Street.</p>
   <p>Owing to the absence of the scribe, Comrade Krusch was appointed as substitute. Comrade Reifschneider mentioned, in his lecture, the murderous attack of the exploiters who seem to have the privilege of murdering the workingmen without being prosecuted by the law. A lively debate followed the lecture.</p>
   <p>Comrade Kaulbitz reminded those present to agitate among their friends and to strengthen the organization because the workingmen can only attain their rights by sticking together.</p>
   <p>Several new members were admitted and the meeting closed.</p>
