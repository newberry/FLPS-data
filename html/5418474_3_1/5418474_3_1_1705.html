   <p>Several newspapers which are very anxious to receive once in a while a kick from the Illinois Staats Zeitung, are now scolding us because we have passed over to the Democratic Party or because we intend to do so. Today's meeting of the Democratic state central committee gives us an opportunity to clarify our position.</p>
   <p>After the failure of the Illinois farmer convention, we made the remark that it was now up to the Democrats to take the initiative in the formation of a larger party. This could be done by sending an invitation to attend the meeting of the state central committee to all the adversaries of the corrupt management in Washington and of the Sunday laws. If that were done and the committee would in these matters take a position acceptable to the Germans, it would be most probable that they would then join the movement. This is, what those stupid newspapers mean by talking of our going over to the Democratic Party.</p>
