   <p>Also there were German mass-meetings at the Apollo Hall and the Southside Turner Hall, which proved a growing interest of the Chicago Germans in the coming election.</p>
   <p>Another German mass-meeting to-night at the Labor Hall, 12th and Waller Street, will introduce several prominent Democratic speakers.</p>
   <p>It is apparent, that the Populist movement is losing a lot of supporters to the old Democratic party-machine, which even Eugene Debs could not stop during the last ten years.</p>
