   <p>If the warning, "Don't talk of the devil, or he will appear," is well founded, and it is true that much talking about an imaginary or remote danger will bring the danger into concrete existence, or bring it closer, then we must assume that our country is really threatened by Bolshevism, very seriously threatened.</p>
   <p>Bolsheviki--Bolshevism?! When these two words first occurred in the cable dispatches of the press, and for a long time thereafter, the great mass of our people understood them as names for Russian robbers and cutthroats, aimless revolution and bloody chaos. And this was so strange, so monstrous, and so unintelligible, that there was no room for the thought that America could experience the same thing some day.</p>
   
   <p>Bolshevism did not affect our people in the least. Our citizens were conscious of no guilt. They had no inclination toward Bolshevism, but were filled with horror by this strange, unintelligible, monstrous thing. But the "representatives," "leaders," and self-appointed "educators" of our people were not aware of this, or they were suspicious. Apparently they were, and still are, plagued by a bad conscience; they seemed to be convinced that the masses had good reasons to accept Bolshevism, and that, according to all indications, the masses must be dominated by Bolshevistic tendencies--unknown to the masses themselves, because the masses knew nothing about the nature of Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>The leaders exercised great zeal and diligence in explaining to the people that the picture which they (the people) drew of the Russian ghost was not an accurate likeness of Bolshevism, and that Bolshevism and the Bolsheviki are not as foolish and violent as they (the people) thought. This was done by applying the term "Bolshevism" to every great strike movement, to every unreasonable demand of labor groups, or every demand that appeared to be unreasonable to the vested interests; so every meeting in which the social and political system by which our country is ruled, was criticized, or in which improved social and economic conditions were demanded. It was done by branding as "Bolsheviki" all who believed and said that labor was not receiving a just share in what it produced; that labor was being led about by the nose and exploited, and should free itself from this miserable condition and assume the rule.</p>
   <p>By these tactics the citizens were told that there were actually many "Bolsheviki" in the country already, and that "Bolshevism" and the "Bolsheviki" are not bad. For the citizens had considered the people who were now called "Bolsheviki" to be eccentric, and merely had shaken their heads upon hearing the speeches of radicals; but the citizens did not look upon these so-called "Bolsheviki" as robbers and cutthroats. The thinking citizen merely said, "Let them talk and let off steam; then they will be harmless."</p>
   
   <p>Now the citizens either have become afraid--and fear often engenders foolishness--or they consider the persecution and condemnation of those unsatisfied persons an injustice, which offends against the spirit of free America, since the persecuted and condemned merely strove to improve the condition of the masses, holding that the worker has every right to strive for a greater share of this world's goods. Every American is entitled to "pursue happiness" according to our Constitution, but only by the use of legal means of course, not through violence. But even people who were scrupulously careful not to preach violence, but warned against any attempt to attain their object by use of violence--have been called Bolsheviki.</p>
   <p>Thus fear is no longer connected with the words "Bolshevism" and "Bolsheviki" as far as the masses are concerned. The masses no longer believe in the existence of the Russian ghost, but are becoming more and more accustomed to apply the term "Bolshevism" to dissatisfaction with and improvement of the living conditions of our workers. In this way the danger of Bolshevism originated, for, unfortunately, there is much cause for dissatisfaction.</p>
   <p>The number of dissatisfied people will be increased by millions through prohibition--if it should be enforced. And more millions will be added to the army of those who are discontented and despair of the genuineness of American democracy and freedom, if Senator Overman's plan to prohibit every foreign-language publication, and the numerous other disturbing plans which defy the democracy and liberty of our people, are carried out.</p>
