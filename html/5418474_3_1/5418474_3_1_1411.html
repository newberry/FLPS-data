   <p>An appeal directed against Altgeld which contains 200 German names and among others, makes the following statements:</p>
   <p>"We cannot use a man as Governor of Illinois, who does not uphold the honor of our country, and would pay his debts with depreciated money, with a value of". 50 on the Dollar." Furthermore, we can not use a Governor, who instead of protecting same, wants to beat down honest labor, through prison-work.</p>
   <p>"Third, we can not use a Governor, who wants to place States rights, above United States rights."</p>
   <p>After this, they recommend highly Mr. Tanner. Everybody, who reads newspapers, knows that Altgeld did not seek his renomination, but on the contrary, asked his friends, not to bring his name forward, but that the Democrats unanimously nominated him, because his exemplary administration of the States-affairs, made him the strongest and most desired candidate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Altgeld submitted to the will of his fellow-citizens. He sacrificed his health <span class="page-break">\2</span>and his private interests, to the service of the State, and everybody, whose heart is capable of a noble feeling, should meet the Governor with the consideration, which a respectable man deserves.</p>
   <p>Especially should the Germans not refuse their appreciation, to the German Reform Governor of Illinois. The Germans can, so much sooner vote for Mr. Altgeld, because his opponent is a crooked machine politician of a disreputable sort, who, as president of the Republican State Central Committee, caused the adjournment of the States-Legislature, at the particular time, when that body wanted to enact a law, which would have put an end to the tax-frauds of the large corporations. Mr. Tanner frustrated, through this adjournment, the reform-plan of Altgeld's and we now find Germans, who not only prefer, but, at the same time, attack him, in a disgraceful manner. Have the signers therefore, lost all self-respect and sense of shame, that they are prepared to serve a Tanner, and scatter such absurd and baseless lies in the world, as mentioned above? The gossiping about the .50 Dollar, the accusation, that a friend of the working man, like the Governor, could have hurt "honest labor", and that he, who as a 16 year old boy, enlisted in the Union Army to fight against the confederates, would place State's rights above those of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>union, such babble is so stupid, that we dont need to pay further attention to it. Except for a few State Republican office-hunters and cross grained fellows, not a single prominent German-Republican has signed the disgraceful manifesto, and this fact proves, what those 200 wretched people want to contest: "That the Germans, without party distinction, are for Altgeld: not because he is of German descent, but because he is the best Governor the State of Illinois ever had."</p>
