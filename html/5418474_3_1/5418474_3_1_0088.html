   <p>The Progressive Union of the local Cigarmakers, which was founded only lately, and as the name implies represents the progressive element of this trade, is holding its first entertainment and Ball in the North Side Turnhalle next Saturday evening. The Union deserves the assistance of all progessive workingmen, the more because they just emerged victoriously from a hard fight with the reactionary element.</p>
   <p>We strongly recommend the attendance to our friends.</p>
