   <p>The meeting of the Socialists and the Typographia No. 9, the German Typographical Association, took place last night in Globe Hall on Desplaines Street. The purpose of the meeting was to give the Staats Zeitung a lecture. The meeting was purely communistic. Few of the typographers appeared, because several of the decent typographers of the Staats Zeitung, frightened by this type of meeting, have resumed their work. The communist, Jacob Winnen, was chairman and the communist Conzett, former typographer and now publisher of the Vorbote, thundered against the Staats Zeitung, its editors and business executives. Also the other daily newspapers were not spared.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Pfeiffer tried to make his audience understand that German type was harder to work with and for that reason German typographers should get better pay than their English fellow-workers. The final speech was made by the well known Communist Thorsmark. After that, happy over the insults heaped upon the capitalistic adversaries, the meeting adjourned.</p>
