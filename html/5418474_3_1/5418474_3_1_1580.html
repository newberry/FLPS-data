   <p>Mr. Paul Strohbach, the well-known Republican politician from Alabama, who recently was appointed a member of the National Executive Committee of the Republican party, made the following remark when in Chicago: "We are tired of hearing perpetually about that bogeyman, the German vote. Take him away. We are not Germans, we are American citizens."</p>
   <p>Now, we completely agree with Mr. Strohbach, but he would have done better if he had refrained from making such utterances in front of an Anglo-American audience; it smacks too much of obsequiousness and of trying to make an impression. Such things are better discussed "inside the family circle" and not before people with whom one hopes to become popular. By the way, Mr. Strohbach is quite right when he says "We are not Germans," because he really is not one; he is at most an Austrian--to be sure, there are many good Germans among the German-Austrians-- or a "Wasserpollacke," and therefore should not take it upon himself to speak for the Germans. We also deny him the right to talk about this question because he has managed for years, just as have all his co-religionists in New York, to use the German vote to his own advantage, and has done pretty well for himself at that. Mr. Strohbach should know that he is by no means such an important, intelligent, and efficient politician and that, when he was made representative of a Southern state in the National Committee [Republican] it was due only to the much dispised "German vote," which served him as background. If it were not for Mr. Strohbach's German name and the many Germans living in the South to whom one wanted to pay a compliment by appointing him, nobody would ever have thought of honoring Mr. Strohbach by calling him into the Republican National Committee; moreover, he is not the most prominent Alabama Republican by a long shot. Mr. Strohbach should therefore have used better judgment than to utter such a remark before Anglo-Americans. If independent German newspapers criticise useless boasting about the German vote on the part of some colleagues, that is a totally different matter. But that does not justify a politician, who owes his success to the German vote and who has made capital from this Southern vote for years, to do the same thing, and the old Latin proverb applies: "Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi."</p>
