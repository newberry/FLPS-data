   <p>At last the proletarians of Chicago seem to make serious efforts to become unionized. Setting aside all personal interests one common goal will prevail - enlightenment of the masses and emancipation of humanity.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was the second meeting in Grief's Hall of the newly formed "Bund" which received the temporary name: Arbeiter Bund. The meeting proved to be a success. The hall was almost too small for the great number of men and women who came to spend a few hours in a Verein (club) where no fighting would take place and which would include all progressive proletarians irrespective of party affiliations. A total of 40 new members was enrolled.</p>
