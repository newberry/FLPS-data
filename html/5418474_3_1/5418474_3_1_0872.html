   <p>The weekly meeting of the northside Socialists yesterday was well attended at which comrade Lange presided. Comrade Brassholz gave the weekly report with an ensuing debate. This was followed by comrade Schwab's announced speech on the theme "Free Love". He gave a picture of the marriages of today which are the result of industrial conditions. He said this was the cause for murders committed on unborn children as well as on the ones, having been brought into the world. Modern marriages are based on nothing but misery. Under our present system the wife is subordinate to her husband but under the Socialist system she would be his equal. The material interest which plays the principal part in marriages of today would be disregarded. Marriage would not mean slavery to women any more.</p>
   <p>People would live in palaces, comparatively equipped with all the latest comforts and, machines to do the heavy work. Children would be reared in educational institutions. Only then, marriage could be noble and only then affection could be considered. Such unions would eventually prove to be of longer duration than modern marriages are. But in a case of incompatibility, the union could be dissolved.</p>
