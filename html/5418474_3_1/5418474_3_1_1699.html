   <p>Mr. Edmund Jussen says that all he claims is "that every element of this great nation, whether to the manor born or guided hither from a foreign shore, has an equal right to express its opinion and exert its influence in shaping the manners and laws of the country." Is it upon such a claim that Boss Hesing proposes to "run" the Illinois legislature this winter? Is it upon such a claim that the Boss makes himself a public enemy to the well-being of Chicago by opposing reorganization under the new city charter? Or is it his love of $20,000 a year, which the present abomination called a city charter takes from the earnings of the citizens and transfers to the pocket in which he carries the German vote?</p>
