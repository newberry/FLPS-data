Bary, attorney, gave his version in English. It was decided to sue for the abrogation of contracts, as a recent law requires that in all litigation arising between employer and employee, the former must bear the inevitable court costs, During the assembley the un-American system that compels me to sign a contract or starve was adequately condemned, also all citizens were incited to voice their protests. A strike was in progress at the time and the pickets succeeded well in dissuading others from entering the yards. Over 200 new members joined the new organization. It was voted to keep the Union independent of existing Central organizations.</p>
