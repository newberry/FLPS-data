   <p>In the political history of Chicago no event has caused such a joy as the meeting of the German citizens of the 17th Ward without regard to party affiliations. In the 17th Ward the experiment of the egg of Columbus has been made and has been successful. Like a prairie fire the news spread over the entire city. The fraternization of old political adversaries was celebrated everywhere. Committees in many other wards have been formed in order to organize meetings.</p>
