   <p>The "German-American Silver Club of the 15th ward, decided at its last general meeting, that its members should take an active interest in the candidate, John P. Altgeld. Mr. August Wendel, the club's vice-president, held a speech which inspired his party-brethren, and as a consequence, it was decided to issue an appeal to all the German voters of the 15th ward, and call a mass-meeting for the purpose of creating propoganda for Altgeld.</p>
