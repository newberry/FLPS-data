   <p>An explanation of the defeats of the working class by its enemies, as well as its momentous irresolution, can be found in the fact that the time has not yet come for action.</p>
   <p>The English speaking big labor organizations tried to achieve their goal highest wages, shortest hours, by remaining neutral in national politics in other words, they sold their votes where they could get most for them.</p>
   <p>The Socialist organizations however, not expecting to reach their goal through any of the old parties, were either too weak or too disgusted to meet the enemy in the political field.</p>
   <p>In spite of all experiences it does not seem to be clear to many of us that a really progressive worker cannot expect anything of present politics and that some professional politicians are only trying to take advantage for their own benefit by starting some little fusion, giving promises, etc.</p>
   <p>Among the latter there is talk of freeing our comrades in Joliet if we should elect a Democratic governor. There is no doubt that such a price is worth <span class="page-break">2</span>any possible effort but if we should ask our comrades, whose liberty is concerned, if they believe in these ways and means of liberation, they would decidedly say no.</p>
   <p>If the future governor of Illinois is a man of honor, as far as such a thing is possible in that position, he will liberate our innocent jailed comrades anyhow; if he is on the other hand a true representative of his class, which is more likely, he will not keep any indirectly given promises.</p>
   <p>We are confident that the working class of this country will be politically organized as a body for itself, independent of the old parties.</p>
