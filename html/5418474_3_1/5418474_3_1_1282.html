   <p>If the unanimity and enthusiasm, which were expressed by German-American citizens at a mass meeting held last night in the Lincoln Turner Hall will find their repetition at the ballot box next Tuesday--and we don't doubt that for one moment--the election of the German candidate for mayor, Robert M. Sweitzer, can be considered secure.</p>
   <p>The most prominent and best known representatives of Chicago's German element had come to give testimony in eloquent terms, or by their mere presence that, just as in the old country all party considerations had to give way to the "one-people-one-mind" idea, Chicago Germans, too, were ready to forget all political differences of opinion when it came to exercising their franchise and voting power to entrust a fellow citizen of German blood with the highest office of their adopted home town. Sweitzer's appearance caused a demonstration so impressive and lasting as had never been recorded before in Lincoln <span class="page-break">2</span>Turner Hall, this meeting place so familiar to all political parties. The strains of the national anthem were nearly drowned out by the yelling and ovations of the crowd, among which there were many women. Every time a speaker mentioned Sweitzer's name there were spontaneous outbursts of applause, revealing testimonials of the fact that the citizens of German descent, male and female, were definitely aware of the tremendous importance of Sweitzer's election.</p>
   <p>The hall, decorated with German and American colors, was crowded long before the scheduled time. The program of speeches was preceded by a good orchestra and performances of a male and female quartet as well as a male singing chorus. Solo renditions of songs by Mr. Max Frahm and by the well-known singer Mrs. Ada von Gersdorff were gratefully received.</p>
   <p>Sheriff Traeger Chairman</p>
   <p>After Mr. Chas. Kellermann, president of the German-American Robt. M. Sweitzer <span class="page-break">3</span>Club had introduced Mr. John E. Traeger, the chairman, to the audience and the latter had assumed this office with a brief address, the first speaker of the evening, former sheriff and present city treasurer, M. Zimmer took the floor. "I have come here," he said, "to speak not so much on behalf of our candidate as on behalf of the citizens of Chicago, because if the public would follow their own best interest in having a good city administration during the next four years and even after, they must necessarily give their vote for Robert M. Sweitzer, a man whose whole career is a guarantee that he will redeem his pledge for a competent and conscientious city administration to the fullest extent. Sweitzer's past official record reveals an unceasing and successful effort to improve public service, to accomplish more things, to reduce expenditures, while his Republican opponent has done nothing during his two terms of office. Indeed, we should not find it hard to choose between a man who is close to us because of his birth, his education, and his manner of living and way of earning it, or a "sportsman and society lion."</p>

   <p>Mrs. Blocki Appeals to German Sense of Solidarity</p>
   <p>Mrs. Fred W. Blocki proved to be an adroit speaker, who expressed the views of the women voters. "For the first time," declared Mrs.Blocki, who comes from an old and respected German family, "we women have a chance to participate in a mayoralty election. Nothing could give us of German blood more satisfaction than to have a chance to give our first vote to a candidate who is worthy of it, not only on account of his splendid abilities, but because his [German] heritage makes him one of us. Anyone still in doubt should consider what influence and effect, the election of a German-American to mayor of our second largest metropolis will have on public opinion, which is so unfriendly to our nationality. Sweitzer combines all the characteristics which typify the German and are held in highest esteem: Honesty, efficiency, discipline,and courage. The head of the city household must have order in his house and promote the welfare of his charges just as any other head of a family, even if Sweitzer's family, the people of Chicago, should pass the two million mark. Just like our men folk, we, too, are interested in better police protection, better street cleaning and garbage removal etc., but above <span class="page-break">5</span>all else we like to see our children derive the best possible benefit from the public school system. For this reason, the school board must consist of men of high character who have a sympathetic understanding of the needs of the common people. Mr. Sweitzer has given us his assurance in this respect, which is tantamount with the acknowledgment of our wishes, because with him it is 'A man, a word'. After the speaker had pointed out that Mr.Sweitzer, if elected, would give due recognition to the happy and liberal spirit prevailing in this metropolis, she mentioned that German love of nature had manifested itself with Mr. Sweitzer years ago, when he had financed the distribution of thousands of circulars, asking for the protection of migratory birds. "If you want to render a service to your old country as well as to your adopted one, vote for Sweitzer", Mrs. Blocki concluded her address amidst loud applause. "We honor ourselves by honoring him".</p>
   <p>Thompson a Friend of the Prohibitionist</p>
   <p>Mrs. Joanna Downes, president of the Association of Democratic Women Voters in city and country, was not so well received at the beginning of her speech, because <span class="page-break">6</span>she ventured too much into the realm of national politics. However, she received lively applause, with her demand to display as good marksmanship when aiming the ballots at incompetence and waste as the Germans did with their bullets when shooting at the enemy.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Thompson, who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and probably uses a golden tooth pick to clean his teeth with, did not attend 48 meetings out of 132 held by the County Board when he was County Commissioner. We do not want a mayor who governs in absentia. If you want to know more about Thompson, this law-abiding citizen and philanthropist, go and see the tenants of his houses on West Sangamon Street and ask them what kind of landlord he is. The courts even had to make him put in fire escapes as provided by law. He has been indorsed by the Prohibitionist League. If you have Chicago's welfare at heart, if you are an upright and honest person, if you can tell the difference between the real thing and a phoney," the speaker concluded, "you will without hesitation cast your ballot for Sweitzer and the rest of the Democratic candidates."</p>

   <p>Harry Ruben's Address</p>
   <p>After an address by J. J. Sullivan, candidate for city treasurer, Mr. Harry Rubens took the floor to advise the audience in English of the necessity to elect Sweitzer. He started out to say that he could not help having apprehensions, when women were given the franchise, but Mrs. Bloki's speech had made such a great impression upon him that now he was in favor of having all political business handled by women. "The efforts of our political opponents, to influence the coming election by dragging in national issues, are not worthy of attention," he continued. "The votes we are going to cast next Tuesday will have no offect on our monetary standard, will not threaten monopolies, and neither will they oblige the United States to take up the problem of true nationality. The Federal Census reveals that more than half of the United States population live in cities and that the latter wield a powerful influence in behalf of popular government. Chicago's significance in this respect, as the second largest city in the Union, can hardly be overestimated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>It is unfortunate that, under the prevailing political system party politics can play such a decisive role in the election of a city's chief executive, but it is up to the citizens as partners in the municipal enterprise to select the most competent and most diligent of the applicants. The main objectives, which we expect the head of our municipality to achieve during the next four years are: Greater safety for the life and property of the citizens. I do not believe that the police are as bad as they are reputed, but I am sure that they are not as good as they could be. The mayor appoints the chiefs of the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Department of Public Works, the Board of Health etc. and he alone, therefore, must be held accountable for the city administration. We want better transportation facilities because the men and women who have to make two trips daily between their homes and places of work are entitled to efficient service and a seat in the street car. We want the best school administration possible. We want to see worthless and unnecessary delays done away with and ask for an educational system which adequately prepares boys and girls for their future vocation in life. The future of Chicago, and even of the <span class="page-break">9</span>United States, depends on our schools, and the German way of teaching may be called a model in this respect. We ask the inalienable right for Chicago's population, representing all countries in the world, to retain and preserve their long-established habits and customs and to continue in the way of living most pleasing to them, as long as they do not trespass upon the rights of the community or their neighbors.</p>
   <p>We do not want to see the time again when the participants of a quiet and orderly picnic could be arrested for disturbing the Sunday peace as happened under the administration of Mayor Medill. In sizing up the candidates, we must not ask ourselves who makes the most promises, but who is most likely to keep the promises he makes. Without indulging in too much praise, I can nevertheless make the statement, after an impartial comparison between Thompson and Sweitzer, that the latter stands sky-high above his opponent when it comes to campaign pledges. He has never promised any more than he could keep under the existing circumstances, and this fact alone makes him the preferred choice. Next Sunday is Easter, the day of Resurrection.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Let us make next Tuesday a festival of resurrection for an honest and competent city administration and for the German-American element at large."</p>
   <p>The speaker had to interrupt his address when a parade of voters, of the 24th Ward, led by a hand marched through the hall cheering and waving flags. Next on the list was Dr. Maximilian Herzog, who had just started to speak, when a resounding applause announced the appearance of the candidate. Mr. Traeger introduced him, with stirring words as a man of our blood, our own attitude and station in life, who had worked himself up to his present position from modest beginnings.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sweitzer, who on account of his strenuous campaign oratory, was very hoarse, declared that his vocal chords were "on strike" and that he had to limit himself to a few words. "But even if my vocal chords are striking, everything else about me is in excellent shape", he remarked laughingly. I can judge by this true-hearted welcome that men and women are fully aware of <span class="page-break">11</span>the importance of next Tuesday's election. They demand that this municipality, with its 20,000 employees and an annual budget of eighty million dollars, be governed with efficiency. They want streets to be illuminated sufficiently at night and safe from crime any hour of the day. They want better schools, an understanding appreciation of the wishes of the mass of the people, and I hope in my own behalf that they will seek the fulfillment of these things in a candidate who has their own social background. All I can honestly promise you at this time is that I shall try to redeem every one of my platform pledges conscientiously, and perhaps you will put greater credence into my words if you will examine my past official record. I shall lack neither understanding nor willingness to work, and I beg you to afford me a chance, by voting for me, to establish a record of which Chicago and my family can justly be proud."</p>
