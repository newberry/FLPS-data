   <p>Yesterday's celebration in the Vorwaerts Turn Hall was attended by 21 organizations.</p>
   <p>No wonder that even this large hall was too small to hold all those, who by participating in this festival proclaimed their condemnation of the present administration.</p>
   <p>The capitalistic press is of course highly indignant and storms and roars like a wounded lion.</p>
   <p>The press is inconvenienced by the fact that these 21 organizations consist only of honest people.</p>
   
   <p>No gamblers, usurers, thieves, capitalists, politicians, jury-fixers, brothel-keepers, stock-brokers; hundred-per-cent patriots or pseudo-Christians compose this assembly. Those people are workers who support themselves and their families by their own industry.</p>
   <p>That this type of people should make of this celebration - of this "anarchistic" festival - such a success is indeed very, very inconvenient.</p>
