   <p>A joint committee meeting of the cigar manufacturers and cigar makers was held yesterday at the hall on 85 Dearborn Street, to settle the strike, if possible.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wagenfuehr opened the meeting. Messrs. Lussem, Deutsch, Meyer, Goldwater, Hirth, Betting, Steele, Buechler, and a large number of cigar makers were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hirth submitted the report of the cigar makers' committee. The compromise offered by the manufacturers was rejected by the cigar makers. The manufacturers' proposal was read to the union members on the previous evening, and the men objected to certain stipulations.</p>

   <p>Mr. Wagenfuehr asked if the proposal concerning the makers of the wrappers was included in the objections. He believed the workers would at least do something to effect a compromise.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldwater said the manufacturers had admitted that the demands of the workers were fair, as far as the better cigars were concerned. Altogether, 120 manufacturers accepted all the demands of the workers, regardless of the various kinds of cigars. The manufacturers did not raise wages when business improved, and therefore the men had to resort to a strike, since the wages were insufficient to pay living expenses. Mr. Goldwater declared that the trouble was not attributable to the workers or manufacturers, but to the consumer, and that only the latter would be able to ameliorate conditions. If the tenement system in New York, where men worked in their homes were abolished--and that could be done--working conditions would improve throughout the country. The workers resolved to starve and be on the street rather than <span class="page-break">3</span>to suffer hunger and stay in workshops. Competition with New York was a poor excuse. Why did some manufacturers pay $6, while others offered only $5.50 for the same kind of work?</p>
   <p>The speech was met with great acclaim by the workers present, but the chairman promptly suppressed the outburst.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lussem remarked that the best thing would be for every manufacturer to proceed as he deemed advisable, since the cigar makers refused to accept a compromise. He would pay the full price, and if matters depended on him, the new rates would be enforced universally.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wagenfuehr stated that he would pay the wages demanded in the new rate schedule beginning Monday, but considered the price for seed cigars unreasonable. The workers should not bear resentment, nor harbor the feeling that the manufacturers want to exploit them. He had expected that the cigar makers would <span class="page-break">4</span>make at least one concession.</p>
   <p>The committee adjourned sine die.</p>
   <p>It is highly probable that by Monday all the cigar workers will work at union wages.</p>
