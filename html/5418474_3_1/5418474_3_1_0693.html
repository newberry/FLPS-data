   <p>In no other country in the world is there a private detective agency which occupies a position above the law as does the Pinkerton Crooks Corps.</p>
   <p>Here in this country every scoundrel is able to commit any crime as long as he hires Pinkerton men to do it.</p>
   <p>If the director of a railway, the owner of a coal mine or a manufacturer, believes a minor or major murderous attack would end a strike or influence his working men, all he has to do is order one of Pinkerton's blue coated tramps. This man is instructed to secure information about a brewing conspiracy among the workers to dynamite some railroad, for instance, and to uncover the plot immediately.</p>
   <p>If he does not succeed within a limited time he can be sure he will be fired for being a useless blockhead; if he does succeed, he is praised, celebrated and promoted. No wonder he selects the shortest and in most cases the only route left to organize a conspiracy himself.</p>
   <p>He knows that his superiors expect that from him, that he will go free in court, <span class="page-break">2</span>and that he will receive a reward from the agency.</p>
   <p>These Pinkertonians are indeed a greater disgrace to America than were the inquisition and witch burnings in medieval times.</p>
   <p>Those cruelties were committed in dark zealotry, but here we have to deal with a crime which is openly committed and publicly rewarded, under cover of laws, and protected by the Bourgeoisie in an open minded century.</p>
