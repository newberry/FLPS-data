   <p>The undersigned are well aware of the fact that many of the German-American citizens do not as yet know anything about the opportunity offered to them, namely to elect a man who deserves to be elected to the office for which he has been made a candidate in the last hour without any effort on his part. The German voters and German influence should carry him through to victory. For this reason we take the liberty to acquaint you with the candidate, Emil Hoechster, Assessor for the Northside. It appears superfluous to mention Mr. Hoechster's intelligence, ability, and reliability; however, we wish to remind the German voters that Mr. Hoechster is not only a German by birth but that he has proven by his efforts and public activity that he is a German-American in the truest sense of the term. He has always tried to promote the interests of the German-Americans. We believe that he fully deserves the support of the German-Americans and that he has a just claim to it, therefore we ask of you to extend it to him. In the performance of his duties in that official capacity he will be an honor not only to himself but also to all German-Americans.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Louis Nettelhorst,</p>

   <p>The undersigned are eminent German, E. Hoechster can be proud of these endorsements. His popularity among the Germans increases daily irrespective of certain attacks from certain people on the northside.</p>
   <p>The same is true of the honest German business man of the Northwest, Adam Wulf. His friends and supporters among the citizens and taxpayers on the Westside are becoming more numerous. Adam Wulf has voluntarily agreed to turn over to the city all interest which may accrue from the deposits of municipal tax money. No assessor has done this until now. If Wulf is elected this promise will be kept, because he possesses an honorable and dependable character and is known as a genuine German business man of Chicago Avenue.</p>
