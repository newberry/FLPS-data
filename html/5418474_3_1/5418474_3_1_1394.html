   <p>In order to obtain the German vote of the city, the Democrats have resorted to a very noteworthy measure. They are on the threshold of creating a "German Democratic State Committee" and induced Henry Raab, former superintendent of Public instruction, and the first Democrat who was elected to a Stateoffice, to be the chairman of such a Committee. This assembly is to be entirely independent of the Democratic State Committee but at times it may proceed in conjunction with the latter. The plan was conceived several weeks ago, and at that time its originators thought of Raab as a suitable leader. At first he declined to accept that office, although he admitted that he is in favor of Bryan and Stevenson. However, several prominent Democrats, among them William J. Bryan, Adlai Stevenson, Dr. Walter Nelson, "Buck" Hinrichsen and Samuel Alschuler weakened his decision, and when Alschuler and Hinrichsen visited him, last Saturday at Elkhart Lake, he consented.</p>
   <p>The Committee is to be composed of prominent Germans; professional politicans will be excluded.</p>
