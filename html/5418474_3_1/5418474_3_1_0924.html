   <p>A statement made by the Capitalistic Press in this country referring to Socialism states, "In European countries where the masses suffer from hunger and are guarded politically by the aristocrats and where the pressure of taxes for the maintenance of militarism is excessive, Socialism may gain ground on account of the general justified dissatisfaction of the people. It may therefore, greatly benefit them to battle for a part of the management in public affairs of state and country. Naturally this admission could not be taken, and even in European countries it could happen at any time, that the economical dreams of the Socialists and those excessive brain sick professors could ever be realized from theory to practice.</p>
   <p>The economic demands of the Socialistic party are incompatible with the existence of modern states. No reasonable thinking person could suppose that the present Government would dissolve itself to make room for anarchism, so consequently, even in the most favorable case of the political program of the Socialists, points to the formation of a Government for the people. Its <span class="page-break">2</span>desire of the removal of Monarchy and the installation of a Republic with general voting power. The most far reaching demand of that reform would be the right of the Initiative and Referendum of the rights of the proposals and rejections that will reform the taxation. All these demands can be readily granted. This program of the Socialists has already been put forward by the Democracy of 1848. Some obscure heads have tried to plant "European Socialism" in America, they have forgotten one thing, and that is very remarkable for the Socialistic enthusiasts, they overlooked with their imported ideas that most of their political demands are already in effect here. We admit that the Socialist in Europe will assist to overthrow militatism sooner or later, or to reduce same to a minimum extent. We also admit that they will assist at the realization of the liberty of the press, speeches, formation of clubs and unions. We live here as a free people in a free country, our militatism puts no pressure on the people. Every one can speak and write in any language he chooses; no difference exist in classes; the police do not interfere with the political ideas of the citizens, they have sufficient work to protect the safety of the individual and their property against outlaws. There is work enough for every one who wants work, wages are good, and no one need starve.</p>

   <p>Plenty of land uncultivated can be got without payments or at cheap rates. In this free land every diligent and ambitious person can be free and independent. Therefore in America there is no fertile ground for Socialism. What then: is the answer ot the Socialists to these statements of the Capitalistic Press: They say conditions in America are not what they used to be. The much discussed liberty of the people, which existed, in the beginning of this century is very much over-rated and exists only on paper. The poor have not any more rights and they say independence of classes only exists in theory. A moneyed class has developed, who demands all kinds of privileges through the might of Capitalism. Political liberty and independence are notions that do not exist. The South of the U.S.A. is only politically free, as is, also the white workers of the North. Are they independent? They are not. The good land is taken by the Monopolists and can only be obtained for good money. Good work is not so easy to find any more, wages are reduced constantly, farmers are getting in debt, small business concerns are pushed out of existence, strikes and unemployment are on the down grade. Socialism in this country will have plenty to do to assist the masses from being suppressed and enslaved by the Capitalists.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The people feel that independence had ceased and that they are not properly protected. So they look to Socialism to eleviate their conditions. Love of liberty of the masses favors Socialism and its agitations. So the U. S. A. provides a fruitful ground for Socialism. The old established splendor of America has become imaginary through the Capitalist and the monopolist. The people refused to be lured to the blood-thirsty dragon of monopolism. In making Socialism the reigning factor of this country, to set the people free from the damaging cause of Capitalism, the right way of the Constitution will be followed.</p>
