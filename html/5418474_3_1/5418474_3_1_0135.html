   <p>The 8 Hour Demonstration to be given to-day at the Armory of the Second Regiment, on Michigan Avenue will undoubtedly be a great success. Robert Nelson, President of the Chicago "Gewerkschaftsrathes" (Labor Union Advisory Board) will preside and Judge Altgeld will deliver the principal speech. The names of the other speakers have been previously mentioned.</p>
   <p>Joe Cannon sent a note wherein he regretted that he could not appear. All labor organizations will be present at to-day's demonstration.</p>
   <p>After the official proceedings a ball is on the program. The proceeds will be used to organize the unorganized workers so that the 8 hour day can be generally enforced on May 1st.</p>
