   <p>"The Socialist Club Vorwarts" (Forward) held its regular meeting at 120 Wells St., yesterday evening. There was a large attendance. Comrade Neudeck presided. The first point of the order of business was a lecture of Comrade Grottkau about 'What is Freedom, and what is Oppression?' He explained the meaning of Freedom and Oppression in a very interesting manner and came to the conclusion that Oppression is ruling at present but that Freedom is not possible in a society which is not based on common ownership,- only Communism can bring Freedom because they strive to bring about the development of all natural forces and abilities of the people. ---</p>
