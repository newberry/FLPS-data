   <p>The German Democratic Organization, has decided for Carter Harrison and asked all German Democrats, to take part in the election. It has been stated that Cregier, will govern the convention, being supported by the Messrs. McDonands and the Bread and Butter Brigade. The registered lists however show, the German voters in the majority and superior in numbers to the Irish and a greater part of the Americans. They chiefly support today the Democratic cause, consequently, it should not be difficult for the Germans to arrange the nomination of their favorite candidate at the convention. If they, however, do not go to the primary and leave the field to the Irish without battle, they must not complain later about the superiority of the Irish. The whole secret of the large Irish success is, that they not only discuss politics in the saloons, but act politically at the polls. The Abendpost states openly that none of the proposed candidates for mayor has their sympathy and that it would have preferred to see the establishment of a solid, healthy citizens's party. However, as those ideals cannot be satisfied yet, it must make the best of what can be realized and nothing else is left, than to choose between Carter Harrison, De Witt Cregier Hampstead <span class="page-break">2</span>Washburne and Elmer Washburn. Of these four, Harrison, notwithstanding his childish vanity and boasting, is the most intelligent, the most energetic and the most experienced one. Cregier has proved to be a weakling, Hampstead Washburne is not more suited as mayor of Chicago than 10,000 other nice young fellows of whom nothing detrimental can be said and Elmer Washburn represents the eye rolling Pharisees of the Yankees. As the Germans have decided to support the Democratic ticket with Harrison for mayor it is not only their honorable duty but also an obligation for their political independence to help their candidate to victory.</p>
   <p>The political influence of the Germans, which in Chicago is the strongest, can only be accomplished, if the Germans make an energetic use of their rights as citizens.</p>
