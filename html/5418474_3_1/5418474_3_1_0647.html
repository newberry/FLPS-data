   <p>In re: Arbeiterbund vs. Roche and consorts, the law has not reached its limit yet with Master-in-Chancery Thomas J. Windes' memorial. The Arbeiter-bund could not feel content with this rhetoric which did not contain anything but the oft-repeated assurance that the Bund was right. The Bund should take legal steps in a different direction.</p>
   <p>Corporation Counsel Green intimated yesterday that court appeals of people, ill-favored by the police, should be rejected without arguments for - if the judge and the public were to be informed as much about the purposes and intentions of the Arbeiter bund as the city authorities know, it would harm the whole matter more than help it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Green has already declared that, in case the judges give the Bund permits to hold its meetings, the city would have to proceed against the Bund-members under the common conspiracy law, as soon as an overt act is committed within the borders of Illinois. (That such act will take place is Mr. Bonfield's job.)</p>

   <p>As the matter stands now, the members of the Bund as well as the corporation counsels have appealed Mr. Windes' explanations, which will be argued before Judge Tuley today.</p>
