   <p>The dishonest clique of district assembly No. 24, suffered a terrible defeat last night. Not one of their candidates was elected delegate to the general assembly at Minneapolis. The battle for the nomination of delegates lasted about four hours with George A. Schilling, Charles F. Seib, Robert Nelson, and J. J. Mahoney, victors in the fight.</p>
   <p>If the election had resulted in favor of the crooked candidates, the capitalistic press would have devoted pages to their glorification, but as it is, some of those papers made just a slight mention of it while others disregarded the outcome entirely.</p>
