   <p>To the German Bricklayers of Chicago:</p>
   <p>Brothers, Friday, Jan. 4th, at 8 P. M., the election of officers of our union will once more take place. We German members for well-known reasons - have always wanted to have a German president and treasurer in office. This wish can become reality next Friday evening.</p>
   <p>It is furthermore to the interest of every member to see that the elected officers justify their confidence.</p>
   <p>I do not want to mention any person already nominated as I could then be accused of partisanship. However, I want to request you, German brothers, to be all there tomorrow evening and stand up for our union and its best interests.</p>
   
   <p>Get rid of your indolence and take care of your own affairs. Think that you have to sow first before you can reap.</p>
   <p>Our union needs a complete reorganization and if this is not started soon by determined, intelligent men and we do not give to this work our whole, active support, we can easily today prophesy that the new hall will become our own burial place - and that this year. The tombstone would bear the following inscription: "Here once lived the bricklayers from Chicago - they succumbed to indolence and indifference."</p>
   <p>Voice of the people.</p>
   <p>W. L.</p>
