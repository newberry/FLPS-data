   <p>The German bricklayers held a mass meeting last night in their hall at 55 N. Clark Street, the out-come of which is to be seen from the following letter to our paper:</p>
   <p>Editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung:</p>
   <p>We have the honor to inform you and the public of Chicago that we, too, the German Bricklayers' Union of Chicago shall be resolved to participate in the strike for the eight hour day and $4 per day wage......... The employers have caused the strike themselves by trying to institute wage reductions that we could not possibly tolerate, after having helping diligently and without complaint, all through the summer to rebuild Chicago. We stand all for one, and one for all, and will not resume work until the employers give in, and also present security that they will keep their promise in the future.</p>
