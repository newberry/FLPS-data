   <p>Every voter of German stock should vote tomorrow for Mr. Frank J. Rydzewski, present election commissioner and candidate for clerk of the Municipal Court. He is not, and never has been, a German-hater and as election commissioner has always shown himself to be liberal-minded and honest. At the same time, no voter should forget to vote for Judge Thomas F. Scully as County Judge and Dennis J. Egan as bailiff of the Municipal Court.</p>
