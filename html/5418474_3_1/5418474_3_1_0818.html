   <p>The "Nordwestseite" Group of the I. A. A. called an agitation meeting for yesterday afternoon to be held in Nutzhorn's Hall, 636 Milwaukee Avenue, which was well attended. Comrade Wm. Bluhm was elected Chairman. The first speaker was Comrade Parsons. He declared that he had to attend another meeting and therefore would be very brief.</p>
   <p>He drew a picture of today's society and showed that same is headed towards destruction.- -</p>
   <p>It should not depend merely on our inclinations that we become Socialists- We must become Socialists under all circumstances. A few days he read in the (ago) newspaper that a young man dropped dead of starvation at Canal Street. Another article pointed out that 22 million bushels of wheat are stored in our elevators.- It seems therefore, that he had to starve because there is so much surplus amassed in storage. After sharply criticizing the prevailing conditions, he pointed out what the communists intended to do, to ameliorate the workingmen's sufferings.</p>
