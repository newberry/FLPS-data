   <p>The great strike in San Francisco is attracting the attention of the entire country, because everyone tells himself that what is going on there now could be put into another scene elsewhere tomorrow or the day after. The country is seething with unrest, and social and political agitators do not find it particularly hard to drive existing discontent with living conditions to insensate explosions. There is no reason for dealing here with the motives of the original strike of the dock laborers. They have in the meantime become more or less irrelevant. The working conditions which were there and which led up to the strike were presumably not much worse than they are in many other places in this country, and, in the face of the economic state of affairs, could hardly be otherwise. Unemployment and the inability to cope with it by artificial means naturally provokes dissatisfaction among those affected by it--they are not only the unemployed proper, but also those whose incomes depend on the former; they <span class="page-break">\2</span>are merchants and artisans as well as farmers. The present administration sincerely endeavored to bring succor, and it even succeeded to a certain extent, by the use of billions of dollars. However, a radical removal of unemployment is unthinkable until the entire economic situation of the world is on the road to sanity. This road still seems to be far distant.</p>
   <p>Under normal conditions it is difficult to satisfy all the people. Under the present economic and social conditions, the difficulties accumulate in everincreasing measure. Added to them are certain political influences whose aim is to increase the existing discontent with the purpose of making a good catch while the waters remain troubled. These influences spring from two different sources. The year 1934 is an election year. The fall season will see an unusually sharp campaign of the two major parties. That of the opposition has already begun. The Republicans make use of every opportunity that presents itself to sow distrust in the measures of the administration, hoping as they do to make better gains from the harvest of votes at next November's elections. The attacks of the Republicans upon the Democratic government have already begun <span class="page-break">\3</span>to extend beyond all measures of decency, distinguishing themselves by so much ruthlessness that the consequences are certain to be unfortunate.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that the Democrats, on the other hand, are eager to defend their administration and its measures for the upbuilding of industry, but they will also have to defend themselves against the charge that they have squandered willfully and have practiced the spoils system. It is clear that the object of the dispute, confused by the good and ill will of the parties quarreling, is presented to the public in a distorted shape, and unlike the viewing of a thing first in a concave and then in a convex mirror. The object of the quarrel is here taken to include all measures introduced by the Democratic administration and by the Democratic Congress for the removal of unemployment and for the curbing of industry. All the forces answering to the name "Democratic" give fulsome praise to the N. R. A. and all the dictatorial innovations, whereas the Republicans blacken them as breaches of the Constitution or worse. That for this reason the administrative machine is made to work in an ever-increasing vacuum is only natural.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It is just as natural that the discontent among the people is thereby nurtured and the soil is prepared for passive and even active resistance. As soon as the people become receptive to it, a second political influence begins to predominate which, in the majority of instances, originates from irresponsible, mostly foreign radicals who serve as advance guards for Communism and Bolshevism. Wherever bigger strikes occur in the United States, there will also be found these homeless Communist leaders who do not give a whoop whether the workers receive what is right, but have one aim in mind: to fortify existing discontent, justified or unjustified, and to goad the strikers as much as possible to deeds of violence so as to weaken the authority of the government.</p>
   <p>Everyone who works for wages in the United States has a right to lay down his work if the conditions under which the work is to be done are no longer suitable to him. The workers also have the right to unite and to lay down their work in common and, by means of this pressure, to obtain better conditions of work. They have, furthermore, the right to explain the situation to those who are <span class="page-break">\5</span>willing to work or are made to take the place of the workers on strike and to make them come over to their side by means of personal persuasion. But they have no right to use violent means for that purpose, and they have, of course, no right to damage the shops in which they laid down their work. Not only the worker, but the employer, too, has some rights. Just as the state concedes to the worker the right to strike, at the same time it also guarantees protection to the employer as well as to the disinterested public against violence.</p>
   <p>Many San Francisco unions joined the strike of the harbor workers not because they had any grievances of their own, but purely out of sympathy for the harbor workers. So far they are fully within their rights. But wherever there are large masses of strikers assembled, there is danger that the masses, incited by agitators and political demagogues, may be given to violence. This danger exists in San Francisco as well. To avoid this, the governor sent a large part of the state militia to the Golden Gate. The strikers attempted to prevent the bringing of food to San Francisco. The authorities could not <span class="page-break">\6</span>tolerate that. With this attempt, however, the strikers lost a great deal of sympathy on the part of the public which they may have had at the outset. Should violence occur, then we may be certain that the governor of the state will protect the rights of the public. It is futile to attempt a prediction as to the possible outcome of the strike. As a rule such mass walkouts have brought the strikers more harm than good.</p>
