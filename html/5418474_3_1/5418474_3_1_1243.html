   <p>The fatherland is saved! Methodist ministers, assembled in the First Methodist Episcopal Church, have endorsed William Hale Thompson for mayor, "because their moral and social interests are secured by him". Mr. Thompson immediately thanked them and declared that politics should not be discussed in saloons, but in churches. Now there is nothing left for liberal Americans of German descent to do but to join in the Methodists' hallelujah for Thompson. I hope that there will be a considerable number of Germans in Chicago who will not let themselves be deceived by the alleged friendliness of Thompson and his henchmen, the Methodist ministers, and who will vote for Robert Sweitzer, the liberal candidate, who has declared himself against prohibition, against reformers, and against hypocrites.</p>
