   <p>The Chicago Tribune, which, without doubt, has not much sympathy for German aspirations in Chicago, is giving bad advice to the voters of the 9th Ward. This Newspaper(Tribune) is recommending a split vote, by advising the 9th Ward voters to put any respectable name on the ticket, as long as this name does not indicate a "Saloonkeeper" or "Notorious Politican."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune, for known reasons does not even mention the name of Mr. Frederick Rohde, who has been for years a respectable personality in the 9th Ward. Even if Mr. Rohde would not be a German, he would have all German votes just the same due to his clean past and honest character.</p>
