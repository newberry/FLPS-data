   <p>The communistic career of that incorrigible Blatherskite, "Dr. Butts" and his followers, Woodman, Smith, etc., has come to a sudden and inglorious end. Only two weeks ago they perfected the great amalgamation of the would-be reformers speaking the English tongue, with the burly teutonic crowd, headed by Klings, Teller, Nusser, etc., and of which they had expected the most astonishing results. But yesterday the coalition split wide open and the old leaders are again in the exclusive command of the communistic army. It appears that Klings and his friends were disgusted with the arrogant demeanor of the "Doctor" and his confreres, and had decided to frustrate their efforts to assume the leadership at once, Teller and Feltes, the two German members of the committee, were accordingly instructed to keep up a row in their meetings, to disagree with whatever proposition might come from Butts and Woodman, and prepare a report of their own, while the veteran forces were informed in the meetings of their respective sections, to uphold Teller and vote down the report of the "intruders".</p>
   
   <p>This programme was faithfully carried out, and the proceedings of yesterday's meeting therefore of an exceedingly stormy character.</p>
   <p>Although these facts were pretty generally known, the crowd which assembled yesterday afternoon at the Twelfth Street Turner Hall was considerably smaller than that of the first meeting two weeks ago, numbering but seven or eight hundred persons. Teller had just appeared on the stage and called the meeting to order, when the voice of "Dr." Butts was heard from the back end of the hall, protesting against Teller assuming the authority of opening the proceedings, and calling upon the assemblage not to listen to his call. Teller, however, paid no attention to that, and declared that the election of officers was then in order.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jeffers was accordingly elected chairman. McAuliffe was nominated for vice-president but declined, as, in his opinion, this was simply an adjourned meeting, and the old officers were entitled to act.</p>
   
   <p>Klings differed from McAuliffe, saying that the meeting was sovereign and had a right to choose whomsoever they pleased.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Woodman had mounted the stage, and grasping the gavel said that he had nobody else was the authorized chairman, and he would continue to act in that capacity unless legally removed.</p>
   <p>After some more wrangling about the question who should be the officers, a new election took place, with the following result: President, Jeffers; vice presidents, McAuliffe and Pekadill; secretaries, Simmen, Teller, and Meilbeck.</p>
   <p>Teller then proceeded to report for the committee appointed to investigate the books of the Relief and Aid society. He said that the committee held several meetings, and conferred with the committee of the common council. No satisfactory results could be obtained, however, as the officers of the relief society had refused to submit the books for his perusal, pretending that they could not be spared at present. It is evident that they only intend to pull them around by the nose, but he was one of those fellows whom they could not fool around.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feltes also reported on the work performed by the committee. After detailing the various sessions held by the committee, and complaining of the discourteous treatment which they had to suffer on the part of Mr. Kling, he said that they had decided to desist from all further efforts, as the relief society intended to delay them in their work until the warm season would arrive and the members of the committee would find work. They had, therefore, confined themselves to an investigation of the numerous complaints which they had received from aggrieved parties. He added that an investigation of the books would have been of no benefit, as the books of the relief society were undoubtedly kept in the same manner as those of bankrupt business men, who want to shield themselves from legal persecutions by fraudulent entries and the like.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Conyett, the orator of the day, next obtained the floor. He spoke substantially as follows:</p>
   <p>Fellow-workingmen! you have heard the report of your committee, and were informed of the various difficulties they had to encounter.</p>
   <p>The relief society is dishonest in its offers to submit the books to a careful investigation. Its officers simply want to fool us till we despair of going any further. It would have been the duty of the common council to order an investigation long ago, but this was not done, and it can easily be understood why it was omitted. The aldermen are like the officers of the relief society, aristocrats, who feed themselves at the expense of the working classes. Nothing can, therefore, be accomplished in a legal manner. The so-called legal way of remedying the coil is no way at all. They say we have the right to suffrage, and the ballot-box is the safeguard of our liberties. But I tell you that the people are not controlling the ballot-box. It is the money-bag. The wealthy classes keep us in gilded shackles, so that we might not perceive our slavery; but they are shackles, nevertheless. The great scoundrels have left us but one remedy, and that is the remedy of violence.</p>
   <p>(Great Applause). The laws made by the money aristocracy are nothing but the demands of a band of robbers. We are not bound to obey these demands, and we ought to treat them in the same manner as we would treat a highwayman, who demands our purse and our watch. (Applause).</p>
   <p>The poor ignorant people are annually driven to the polls to vote for the professional politicians. This must be stopped. You must organize without delay, and establish a party which is based upon the wants of the people, and not adhere to a party organized by a number of professional politicians, shortly before an election takes place, for the purpose of filling their pockets. You want time for preparation. You are ignorant of the science of politics and political economy. All you know about it you have derived from the lying press in the pay of your oppressors, the capitalists. (Applause). The press applauds the robbing public officers and makes heroes out of them, who sacrifice themselves for the welfare of the people. Look at our great Anton Caspar Hesing. A year or two ago we were not even permitted to enjoy a glass of beer, on the Sabbath. Now, thanks to his noble efforts, we can drink as much as we please, and whenever we please. Therefore, he says, we have to follow him blindly and do whatever he says for the entire rest of our lives. (Applause). The people are taught to despise communism, and you are told horrid stories in regard to the Paris commune. But I assure you, those stories were mere lies. The capitalistic press lied about us when we exposed the corruption of the relief society, and it lies about the Paris commune and communism in general. The people must be taught to distrust the capitalistic press, and instead of paying for the falsehoods, as dished up by the daily papers, to subscribe for papers published in the interest of the people, like the Vorbote. (Forerunner). Then they will learn the truth. If they remain in their lethargy, they will continue to suffer for years and years to come, and their children will damn their fathers for their indifference. If you would just keep your eyes open, you could readily perceive the terrible system of robbery, as carried on by your government. The last congress increased the duties on such articles which are mainly consumed by the working classes, and exacted no duty at all for the diamonds of the daughter of Gen. Sherman, which would otherwise have been taxed with not less than $30,000. Your legislators are thieves and scalawags of the meanest order. When the general assembly convenes at Albany, hundreds of vile prostitutes emigrate from New York City to the capital of the state, knowing that they will be extensively patronized by the so-called representatives of the people. During the sessions of congress, the gambling hells of Washington are kept in full blast. Will such facts not convince you that the ballot-box of the present day is but a mere humbug? (Applause). There is no liberty, as long as the working man is deprived of the means to participate freely in the government. He is a slave, no matter whether he wears shackles or not.</p>
   <p>It is our holy duty to deprive the money-bag of his power and to take the government into our own hands. Then only the cry "liberty, equality, fraternity, and welfare to all" will be no mere phrases. (Thundering applause).....</p>
