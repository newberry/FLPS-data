   <p>Among the candidates who seek political offices this time there are a large number of people with German names. To be sure, one's name is not always good evidence of one's origin. There are people with German names who have become completely Americanized, and who have completely forgotten their German origin. On the other hand, there are people with English, Irish, or some other kind of name, who are close to the German people because they have, or had, a good German mother, a fact for which there is no evidence in their names. Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago, for instance, belongs to this group.</p>
   <p>This newspaper has always advocated giving preference to candidates of German extraction without regard to party affiliations. The paper believes this attitude correct, because one of the most serious weaknesses of the German- <span class="page-break">2</span>American element is its insufficient representation in political offices. For that reason the German-speaking voters should make it a practice to give their votes, in all elections, to the members of their race--provided, of course, that these candidates are trustworthy and are capable of filling the offices to which they aspire.</p>
   <p>In recommending candidates for office the newspaper assumes that these recommendations are desired by its readers. It will not attempt to influence its readers, but wants only to give them information and pointers which will help them to perform their duty at the polls. In this article, which deals with candidates of German descent, all who are of the German race, and can justly lay claim to the support of their fellow Germans, are recommended to the voters. Whether a candidate deserves this support does not depend, in this paper's opinion, upon his ability to speak a few words of broken German, or upon the number of times he treats others to drinks at German festivals, but upon whether he has the proper <span class="page-break">3</span>understanding for the German character, and whether he is proud to acknowledge his German extraction in public.</p>
   <p>These are the things which this paper takes into consideration when it endorses candidates of German extraction. Oscar G. Mayer is one of the candidates for trustee of the State University. He is the eldest son of Oscar F. Mayer, who is well known and beloved all over Chicago, and far beyond its limits. With his father, Oscar G. Mayer is at the head of one of the largest and most successful industrial enterprises of Chicago. From his parents he inherited good German breeding, and he has always respected it. Now he is running on the Democratic ticket for an office which does not pay any salary but, at the same time, is very important. Every German-American should consider it an honor to vote for Oscar G. Mayer.</p>
   <p>Among the candidates on the Democratic ticket are Robert M. Sweitzer, candidate for county treasurer; John E. Traeger, candidate for county commissioner, a son <span class="page-break">4</span>of the former sheriff, John Traeger, and Frank J. Kasper, a candidate for county commissioner outside of Chicago. Among the Republican candidates for county commissioner are Louis Nettelhorst, son of the deceased president of the School Board, whom the older German-Americans will remember with respect; Harry B. Hoff, son-in-law of the late recorder, Joe Haas; and William Busse. They all are on good terms with the German-American community, and for that reason should not be forgotten on election day. For the same reason, this paper recommends that its readers vote for the Democrat, George Seif, and the Republican, John J. Hoellen, as trustees of the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>The paper supports all candidates for Congress on the Democratic ticket, because President Roosevelt's economic program cannot be completed unless there is a Democratic majority in Congress. Nevertheless it recommends that its readers in the Ninth District vote for the Republican candidate, Fred A. Britten, who is a personal friend of countless German-Americans, and has always shown an understanding of their character and problems.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>One of the most important and influential authorities is the Board of Appeals. Among the candidates for this office on the Democratic ticket is the German-American Fred W. Brummel. He was first appointed to this office by the county commissioners, and has been so satisfactory that he was put up by the party organization as a candidate for the same office, and was nominated at the primary election, with a large majority. Fred Brummel is a man of spotless reputation. He is rightly considered an expert in tax matters, and he has the greatest understanding of the troubles of the small and large property owners, and is always ready to listen to their complaints. Fred Brummel has been endorsed by many prominent German-Americans, both Republicans and Democrats. All voters of German descent should cast their ballots for him.</p>
