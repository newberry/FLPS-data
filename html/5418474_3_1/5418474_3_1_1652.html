   <p>Der Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers Association) has endeavored to ascertain facts involving the candidates for the City Council. Exhaustive investigations were made concerning the former political conduct, views, and promises of the candidates for the City Council, and we have come to the conclusion that those named below are inimical to our interests and would be detrimental to our cause, if elected.</p>
   <p>We therefore request all tavernkeepers to use their influence in defeating the following candidates on election day: First Ward, Arthur Dixon; Second Ward, A. Ballard; Fourth Ward, Amos Grannis; Tenth Ward, J. E. Lawrence; Thirteenth Ward, H. W. Thompson; Sixteenth Ward, Mich. Schweisthal; Seventeenth Ward, E. P. Barrett.</p>
   <p>All tavernkeepers are herewith urgently requested to close their establishments on the day of the election, so that it may be possible to concentrate all efforts toward a well-deserved rout for our adversaries.</p>
   <p>The Association of Chicago Tavernkeepers.</p>
