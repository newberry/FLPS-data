   <p>On account of the incarceration of several Bohemians on the pretext of dynamite plotting, the Workingmen's Legal Protection League was founded for the purpose of collecting money immediately for their defense in court by luring able lawyers.</p>
   <p>As this whole affair is a planned attach on organized labor by the police, who are in the employ of capital, the league is convinced that the working class should take up arms against organized police corruption with all energy and not only ward off the blow but repay with double strength.</p>
   <p>As this matter has to be rushed with all possible speed it is necessary to extend your help as soon as possible.</p>
