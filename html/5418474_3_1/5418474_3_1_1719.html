   <p>The union of the Germans of Chicago in order to fight Puritanism and nativism attracts widespread attention. Especially great is the sympathy in Indiana where the Germans have the same fight on their hands. The Indianapolis Daily Telegraph has this to say: "The increasing rottenness in our public affairs, the guardianship imposed on the Germans, is not felt any deeper in Chicago than it is here. The union of all the Germans irrespective of their political views fills with the highest hope." The Michigan Journal says: "Since it is possible that the free minded citizens of all the states will eventually unite against the fanatics and Puritans, it is important to watch closely the Chicago movement." The Louisville Informer says: "This policy of union is practical and sensible. It is this policy which has given the fanatics victory, although they are in the minority." The Cincinnati Courier says: "The fight of the Germans of Chicago assumes constantly greater proportions. The Germans of all the United States are watching with the greatest interest the result of this strange fight."</p>
