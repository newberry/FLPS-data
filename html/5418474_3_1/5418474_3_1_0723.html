   <p>Under the auspices of the International Labor Association, several thousand persons gathered at the beach yesterday, following with great interest the effective Socialist speeches delivered there. Comrade Keegan condemned today's system of land ownership, proving that every individual has a right to benefit by the products of the land... Regarding the conditions in Hockingthal, the speaker was of the opinion, that the striking miners ought to take possession of the mines and operate them according to the association's plan and for the welfare of their families.</p>
   <p>Comrade Fielden followed with a fiery address insisting, that if he were to become convinced of the necessity of a ruler or president for the people, then the necessity of maintaining slavery would take on a different aspect. But the nation is well able to rule itself. The time has not come yet when we could change this unjust institution.</p>
   <p>Too many canons and murderous weapons are in the hands of the exploiter. Under <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the present system, justice, honesty and equality are out of the question. How much longer will these conditions go on as they are? Men, driven by hunger, will rise and rebel.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was comrade August Spies. The bible passage "Thou shalt not steal" was the text for his speech.... We have to put an end to legal stealing for it is a fact, that working people are robbed of five-eighths of their earnings. The organized gang of bandits called Government, suppresses freedom.... He pointed out through logical arguments that private property means robbery.</p>
   <p>Comrade A. R. Parsons delivered a lengthy speech attacking the injustice and absurdity of the private capitalistic system....</p>
   <p>A decision was read by George M. Sloan petitioning the governor to postpone the execution of "tramp" Jacobson until his mental condition has been established beyond doubt.</p>
