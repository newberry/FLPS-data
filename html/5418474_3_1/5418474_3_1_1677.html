   <p>We have been furnished with a copy of a circular printed in the German language, just issued by Carter H. Harrison, Democratic candidate for Congress in the Second District, in which he has appealed for German votes on the ground that his family has spent several years in Germany, and that his youngest children "speak only German." Col. Davis, the Republican candidate, is spoken of as" a high-nosed Yankee and mucker," who is Colonel of the First Regiment, and "therefore" should be voted against by the Germans.</p>
   <p>There is not a German of intelligence in the Second District who should not feel insulted at the implication that his vote is to be gained by such an appeal in behalf of this blatant humbug, and who will not prefer to be represented in Congress by a "high-nosed" Yankee rather than an inflated donkey.</p>
