   <p>The first meeting of the Socialists since their reorganization was held yesterday with Mr. Blum presiding. The question whether the Socialists shall take part and what their attitude toward the fall elections shall be was submitted to the meeting to decide upon. An animated debate ensued. All the speakers declared themselves against taking any part at the coming elections.</p>
   <p>It was proposed to advise all Socialist voters to refrain from exercising their rights at the polls, also to induce the "Arbeiter Zeitung" to comply with their wishes. This was accepted unanimously.</p>
   <p>The Agitation Committee was advised to work out an explanation of this decision specifically stating the various reasons for non-participation which shall be made public through the Arbeiter Zeitung.</p>
