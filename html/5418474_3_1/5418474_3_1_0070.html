   <p>A well attended meeting of the CLU, (Central Labor Union), was held on Saturday, Aug. 25, in Craf's Hall, 54 W. Lake Street.</p>
   <p>The Carpenter's Union, #240, started a strike-fund with a weekly per capita assessment of five cents.</p>
   <p>Carpenter's Union, #241, is against the foundation of a strike fund on account of having had bad experiences with the brotherhood.</p>
   <p>While the Tailors Progressive Union and the Saddler's Union are in favor of a strike fund, the Carriage and Coach Builders Union is against it for the reason that more and more strikes are being lost because there are too many jobless to occupy the vacancies.</p>
   
   <p>The division of labor is being more and more extended and it would be more rational to turn our attention to international labor movements than to expect any betterment out of strikes.</p>
