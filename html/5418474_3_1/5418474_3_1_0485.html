   <p>The United States is now being governed by decree. In this respect our government has followed the example of the German, a thing that many observers predicted some time ago. The purpose of the first emergency decrees in Germany was to halt the flight of capital. This flight of capital had reached such proportions that it seriously endangered the German economy. The Bruening Government, which was then in power, was forced to issue a sharp decree with regard to foreign exchange.</p>
   <p>That was the way it began, and Germany continued on this course from that time on at an accelerated rate. Long before the present Government came to power the texts of the emergency decrees filled a whole row of massive volumes. After every decree it turned out that there was a gap in it somewhere, that in certain points it was unjust or unenforceable, and then a new decree was issued which corrected, or rather, which was supposed to correct the earlier one.</p>
   
   <p>A few days ago Dr. Goebbels, one of Chancellor Hitler's most trusted followers, declared that the Government was faced with the necessity of reorganizing the economy in the direction of socialism in order to bring the country through next winter. One could easily assume that it is only logical and natural for a National Socialist regime to introduce Socialist methods into [the regulation of] economic life. This assumption would be incorrect, however. The economy would have become more socialized even if the National Socialists had not attained power. This is the natural consequence of government by emergency decree.</p>
   <p>Naturally it makes some difference what is understood by "socialism." There are countless different definitions for the word. In this case socialism is understood to be that system in which the whole economic life is under the control of the Government. In Germany they have already reached this point, and in this country we are on the right track to reach it. Minister Goebbels indicated, in the speech mentioned above, that the Government contemplated confiscating private property. In the United States private property is to persist. In the long run, however, this condition will not last.</p>
   
   <p>In March of this year the Government went off the gold standard and at the same time forbade the exportation of gold. This measure had several results, some of which were intended, and some not. In the first place, the value of the dollar dropped, which resulted in an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. The domestic price of gold fell to about two thirds of the world market price, and as a result gold mining became so unremunerative that the mines ceased operations.</p>
   <p>This the Government had naturally not intended, and in order to remedy this situation it again permitted the exportation of gold. Nevertheless, the Government does not intend to introduce a free gold market, for at that time it also directed that all gold was to be surrendered, or rather exchanged for paper money. This order it has apparently not been able to enforce, however, for it is reported from Washington that there is still three hundred million dollars' worth of gold in the hands of hoarders.</p>
   <p>Consequently the situation is this: Most citizens have given up their gold and have received paper money in exchange. The paper money is now worth about thirty per cent less than gold money. The gold hoarders still have their gold, and if they sell it abroad receive thirty per cent more for it than those who have obeyed the Government's orders. Thus they are paid a premium for defying the Government! The Government can scarcely have intended this, and in consequence must issue a further decree so that the gold hoarders will be unable under any circumstance to sell their gold abroad.</p>
   <p>Then there is another little formality that would have to be decided. The people who bought Government bonds before the Government went off the gold standard, will, when these bonds mature, receive money which is not worth so much. They will lose about thirty cents on every dollar. This, too, can hardly be the intention of the Government. It does not wish to cheat the people of their money, and it does not wish to injure those good citizens who trusted it with their money. Consequently there would have to be another emergency decree to regulate this situation. Otherwise the reputation and credit of the Government would suffer.</p>
   
   <p>The story has already became rather complex, and yet no end is in sight. The Government has not only regulated gold and money, the standard value and the exchange value, but the entire occupational activity of the people. It, too, will observe that every decree means the issuing of further decrees, and that the application of socialist methods will in the end lead inevitably to socialism. In this respect a remarkable parallel can be seen between Germany and the United States.</p>
