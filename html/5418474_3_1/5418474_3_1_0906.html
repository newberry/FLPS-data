   <p>The meeting of the German Section was held at Thuringer Halle, 58 Clybourn Ave. under the presiding officer Mr. Moller. The speaker, Comrade Vater, held a lenghty speech, which he devoted to immigration and its possible effects, on the workmen of America. He emphasized, that through immigration, the advantages for labor's emancipation, have gained ground but that we have to use our influence on the immigrants, as to class distinction, and the legislation.</p>
   <p>Thereafter, Comrades Link, Zeffers, Kuken and Bartels, discussed this subject, and agreed with Mr. Vater on every point.</p>
