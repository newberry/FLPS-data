   <p>A very important meeting of the union will take place to-morrow evening. It concerns a revision of some sections of Art. 3 of the constitution, which state the collector's duties of the president of the union.</p>
   <p>A certain party is trying to separate the collector's duties from the president's duties, in order to create a new office, that of a collector, and thereby raise the union's expenses to about $1000 a year.</p>
   
   <p>Ex-president Mulraney is the power behind this movement and hopes to fill this new job.</p>
   <p>The German members of the union should therefore be on their guard, so as not to be taken advantage of.</p>
   <p>Some union members assured our reporter, that the collection job could be reduced to a minumum and could easily be taken care of by the present president, providing that the union adheres strictly to its rules and regulations.</p>
