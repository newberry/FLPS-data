   <p>The majority of the Democratic and Independent German voters of Chicago, are for Carter Harrison, according to yesterday's general meeting. The German-Democrats are very dissatisfied with Gregier and the independents prefer Harrison, to the reputable but inexperienced Hempstead Washburne. If Carter Harrison is elected it will be chiefly on account of the support of the Germans of Chicago, and we hope that he will remember this fact after the election.</p>
   <p>The Germans do not want their reward in the form of jobs but a just and honest administration worthy of the importance of Chicago.</p>
