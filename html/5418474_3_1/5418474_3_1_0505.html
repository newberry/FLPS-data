   <p>The Industry Bill which the administration recommended as a measure to promote business has become a law. The bill was passed, 46 to 39; a scanty majority. The opposition, as has frequently been the case in recent times, was furnished chiefly by the left wing of the Democratic party and the conservative Republicans. The latter voted against the measure because they hold that the underlying principle, bureaucratic regulation of industry is wrong. The opposite viewpoint was taken by the radical Democrats. They were against the bill, because it temporarily invalidates the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which, in itself, is a bureaucratic regulation of business.</p>
   <p>In judging this law, it is necessary to put strong emphasis on the fact that it is not a permanent measure. It is an emergency bill which is to be in force for only two years. Yet it cannot be denied that it is a radical departure from that which is generally considered to be the American economic philosophy. It places industry under the control of the Government, and is similar to the German emergency laws. It can also be said that the fundamental principle of this law corresponds to the economic philosophy of Soviet Russia. It is true, there are vast and essential differences between the Russian and the new American systems; yet both have the same economic purpose.</p>
   <p>To be sure, it must not be forgotten that the principle of economic individualism has long been violated: by the railroads, for instance, the operation of which is entirely under government regulation, the Government guaranteeing the roads the necessary money to pay the interest on railroad bonds. During the administration of President Hoover, the Government tried to regulate agriculture and to raise the price of farm products. The fact that the attempt was a total failure does not alter the fact that the measure was essentially socialistic. In the case of banks, so-called public utilities, marine transportation and other lines of industry the principle of free trade has also been violated by national, state, and municipal regulations. One may say, then, that the industrial law is a further step toward a socialistic state.</p>
   <p>Of course, the administration and its followers in Congress do not want to admit this. They say it is a question of the exception proving the rule, that the law is necessitated by unusual economic conditions, and will be repealed as soon as the situation is again normal.</p>
   <p>The law has the following purposes: to reduce overproduction, to decrease working hours, to increase wages and prices, and to diminish unemployment. How the Government intends to carry out this program is not known, and everything that has been said on this topic by the advocates of the law is extremely unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>Senator Borah rightly pointed out that the Government will first have to acquaint itself with the cost of production, if it wants to increase prices and wages and reduce working hours. That in itself is impossible. The Government would need a large army of accountants to ascertain production costs in each industry. This is but one of multiple objections which can be made to the system. What industry needs, is not more, but fewer, rules.</p>
   <p>It is true that the claim is well-founded that the method of free competition, as followed heretofore, has led to unfair quotations, price-cutting, over-production, and thus, finally, to a depression of catastrophic dimensions. Still, perhaps it would have been much better to let industry itself correct these faults. The statement that the system which has been thus far followed has led us into a morass suggests that a different method must be tried, but it certainly has not been established that unlimited government control will be effective.</p>
   <p>As is the case with reference to many other laws, much depends upon enforcement. Evidently the Government intends to grant a large measure of self-regulation. If the representatives of the body which has the duty of enforcing the law refrain from taking dictatorial and arbitrary measures, if they confine their activity to giving advice and instruction, via mediation, then the law may serve to promote industry. Still, such a law is, and always will be an experiment of doubtful value.</p>
