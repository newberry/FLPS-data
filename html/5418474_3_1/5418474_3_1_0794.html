   <p>Night before last, there was a meeting held in Ernest Fehst's locality by the members of the club, who are forming to start a theatrical society.</p>
   <p>After a lecture from "Schiller's Bell," Mr. Ed. Koch attacked the following sentence: "When the nations free themselves, prosperity can never thrive."</p>
   <p>This provoked a lively debate in which many participated. The following resolution was accepted: "The present members declare themselves fully in accord with the principles of Communism."</p>
