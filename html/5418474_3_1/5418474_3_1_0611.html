   <p>A mass-meeting was held yesterday afternoon at Twelfth Street Turner Hall under the auspices of the Arbeiterbund, the International Working People's Assn., and the German Debating clubs to protest against the action of the police in raiding Greif's Hall. M. Schmidinger presided.</p>
   <p>Robt. Steiner, editor of the Arbeiter Zeitung, addressed the audience. He denounced Justice Woodman as ignorant of history as evinced by the wording of his recent decision; and said that the leading strivers for human rights are in Siberia, German prisons, on Blackwell's Island, in Joliet and Waldheim; that anarchy is not the result of the labors of any single class, but of the people; that the means of transportation should be in the hands of the government, not individuals; that when rich men visited the City Hall they were treated by the authorities as princes, while poor visitors were ignored. He denounced the raid at Greif's Hall as unwarranted and said that so long as such raids were tolerated there will be ignorant, hotheaded people, who, feeling outraged at having their rights trampled on, were liable to make violent outbreaks. Max Staller and M. Lott followed in speeches to a similar impart. All the addresses were in German.</p>
