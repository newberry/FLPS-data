   <p>The Socialists seem to prepare with unusual energy for the coming election and campaign in Spring. There was a mass-meeting yesterday afternoon at the Vorwaerts-Turner Hall, presided over by Paul Ehrmann, who opened the meeting with a speech and pointed to the fact that in 1879 the Socialistic vote was one fourth of the total-vote.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, another meeting took place at Greif's Hall, where Fritz Kalbitz, Louis Kallen and Edward Leifried made speeches.</p>
