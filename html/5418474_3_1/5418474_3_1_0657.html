   <p>The mayor's prohibition, the police-chief's general summons, the insane noise of the boodle press, all was in vain.</p>
   <p>Yesterday morning the workers of this town, with wives and children, filled the Wisconsin Central depot. This railway company truly and fully proved itself to be noble. It broke its given word by not having the special trains started from Franklin and Harrison streets, as promised, but from Polk Street.</p>
   <p>Precaution was also taken to have the most infamous asses among the employees of the railroad assigned as conductors.</p>
   <p>George Schilling, who was in charge of this celebration, introduced Robert Reitzel from Detroit as the first speaker. He extolled the merits of the Haymarket martyrs, and said among other things: "We live in the free country of America and if so much has already been taken away from us, one thing nobody has dared to deprive us of as yet - the right to bury our dead as we see fit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Who knows how long we will be able to enjoy even this privilege. who knows whether those in power in America will not soon shed blood in the cemeteries as happened in Frankfurt and Paris. Let us make use, therefore, of the right of free speech still existing on paper.</p>
   <p>"'The anarchists of Chicago,' so said a prominent American newspaper, 'have the same right to lament their dead as any other class of criminals.'</p>
   <p>"Our dead ones were accused of murder and as no guilt could be found in spite of the testimony of perjured scoundrels, that infamous law of moral responsibility was discovered, an infamous law which even in anti-socialistic Germany and militaristic Russia would not be applied.</p>
   <p>"What was the significance of the bomb-throwing of the Haymarket? A protest, a defense against violence, a defense of American constitutional rights! The real responsibility for this rests upon those long dead traitors, whose names every American pronounces with reverence."</p>
   <p>George Schilling read Parsons' letter which he wrote before his execution and which has been under seal for one year. (The public reading of this letter was eagerly listened to by all the working class.) It reads as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Cell #7, Cook County Jail,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.,</p>
   <p>Nov. 9, 1887.</p>
   <p>"To my dear, precious little children; Albert R. Parsons, Jr., and his sister, Lulu Eda Parsons!</p>
   <p>"As I write this your names bring tears to my eyes. Oh; my dear children, how your father loves you! We prove our love by living for our dear ones, but we also prove it by dying for them,if necessary.</p>
   <p>"About my life and the reasons for my unnatural death you will hear from others.</p>
   <p>"Your father has voluntarily sacrificed himself on the altar of liberty and happiness.</p>
   <p>"As inheritance I leave to you an honest name and devotion to duty. Keep these and put them into effect.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Be sincere with yourselves and you cannot be insincere with others! Be diligent, dutiful and happy!</p>
   <p>"Honor, love and obey your mother who is the greatest and noblest of all women.</p>
   <p>"My children, my dear children, I ask you to read this on every anniversary in remembrance of the one who died not only for you alone but also for children not yet born. Bless you, my darlings. Good bye.</p>
   <p>Your father."</p>
   <p>A "murderous anarchist" to be hanged by his neck until dead wrote this to his children shortly before his death! This letter will live in history as a murder indictment against the ruling class.</p>
   <p>The first train left Waldheim at four, the second at 4:30 p. m. About 5,000 men and 1,000 women and children were present. One hundred spies were sent by Bonfield, supposedly to maintain order, but really to provoke a riot, if possible. Twelve uniformed policemen kept vigil at the depot - Mr. Bonfield <span class="page-break">\5</span>apparently was afraid some one would carry it away.</p>
   <p>The detectives came along to Waldheim but were smart enough not start a quarrel. Another proof that these spies were in the cemetery is the fact that several women's purses were snatched in that throng. The police in the city tried their best to start a riot somewhere in accordance with their instructions but did not succeed.</p>
