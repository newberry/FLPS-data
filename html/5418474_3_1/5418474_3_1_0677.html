   <p>Our continent produces two kinds of donkeys, the southern and the northern. When the little South American donkeys are attacked by an enemy they form a circle with their heads inside and the hoofs outside thereby protecting themselves through common kicking. The North American asses. known as voters alias taxpayers, form their battle-lines in case of attack differently.</p>
   <p>As a rule under the leadership of a gang of sneaky, legalized and authorized robbers who chiefly want to acquire the possessions, children and achievements of these donkeys they form two lines forcing each other.</p>
   <p>One is called Republican and the other Democratic. Upon the command to go on they jump at each other like Berserks in infected with the "furor tentonicus", and kick the stuffings out of each other.</p>
   <p>When the war is over the victors fill the air with their battle-howls while the robbers divide the spoils and jobs.</p>
   
   <p>This is the difference between the South American donkey in an uncivilized condition and the North American in civilization.</p>
