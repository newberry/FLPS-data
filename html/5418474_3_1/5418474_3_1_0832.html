   <p>The Socialist Club of the Southwest side held a pleasant meeting combined with dancing. Mr. Lange presided. The main points were serious and humorous lectures and plays of every kind. The socialistic Sangerbund of the Southwest side did its full share.</p>
   <p>It seems that there no more fun and enjoyment exists anywhere than among the Socialists as they only separated in the best of spirits early in the morning.</p>
