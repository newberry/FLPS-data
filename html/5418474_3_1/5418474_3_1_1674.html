   <p>The impending city election and the assertion that the Germans are dissatisfied with the present administration and are favoring a return of Colvin's administration has moved us to send a reporter to interview a number of distinguished Germans. These interviews convinced us that the Germans are completely satisfied with the present administration. They favor the economy exercised by the present administration as well as its liberality. Some insist on the reelection of Mayor Heath while others do not care who is mayor provided he is an honest, liberal and businesslike man. As Mr. Heath has proved himself as such and as he considers the Sunday question settled once and for all, he may rely on the support of the Germans.</p>
