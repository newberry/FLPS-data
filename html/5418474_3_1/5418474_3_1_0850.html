   <p>The Northwest Side Socialists held an agitation meeting last night at which Comrade Blume presided. Comrade A. Spies gave a short speech about State Organization and its support pointing out, that its only merit is to protect the possessions of the wealthy class, therefore, it is hostile to working people.</p>
   <p>The statement that the States' service was to protect the lives and possessions of its citizens is an infamous lie; the State organization does not protect the lives of the destitute, moreover, it jeopardizes it. The right to protect private property is the main purpose of the State but under present conditions, aims directly against the lives of workers.</p>
   <p>Under the existing property laws...it would mean day dreaming to expect a common benefit for all. Labor's password should be: Down with private property! And with it shall go the State's political structure.</p>
