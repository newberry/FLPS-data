   <p>As may be recognized from reports arriving from Washington, there is a fierce battle going on behind the stage. Congress will convene in a few days, and the administration must now decide as to what program will be submitted to Congress for the sake of reviving economic activity. The program will doubtless be incorporated in the President's message. It is, as a matter of fact, not up to the administration to make the laws. In accordance with the Constitution, the President should only submit to Congress a report about conditions prevailing in the land, but this clause has but a theoretical significance. Since we have in this country a government by parties, the President is always the head of the party in power. As such, he is also responsible for the resolutions made by the members of his party in Congress. The people have long become used to holding the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>President responsible for congressional resolutions.</p>
   <p>It seems that there are far-reaching differences of opinion among the Democrats as to the course the government is going to take in the field of economic politics. Some who are inclined to have radical views are of the opinion that the measures taken until now will be not only retained, but rendered even more acute. In opposition to them is a conservative wing, which advocates a gradual reduction in economic politics prevailing. If all signs do not deceive us, this reduction is already on its way. A few weeks ago, the head of the NRA declared the latter as dead as a door nail, but he exaggerates. Yet, it cannot be denied that the blue eagle shows gradual signs of weakening in his wings.</p>
   <p>The fiercest battles will probably not be fought about the NRA, but about the relief to be given the unemployed. This relief has until now consumed enormous sums of money. If the government is now to be criticized for it, it must be borne in mind that it was not possible to let these people starve <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and, since the states and municipalities failed to do anything, the federal government could do nothing but step in and help. But the number of unemployed has not decreased considerably and now the question arises: How much longer can the government bear the cost of payments of relief money?</p>
   <p>Louis Douglas, until recently the director of the budget, resigned his office because of differences of opinion with the administration. He stated that the current fiscal year is going to close with a deficit of four billions. Douglas further emphasized that unbalanced budgets must ultimately wind up in dangerous inflation. Whether this statement is correct remains to be seen; at any rate, no one can deny that Douglas is right with his assertion that the budget is not going to be balanced for years if the administration is to continue with present methods of relief for the unemployed.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Now, Douglas recommends to appropriate no further sums for emergency works or for the RFC, and to restrict the total appropriations for unemployment relief to one and one-quarter billions. This sum is to be handed over to the states, along with a declaration that no further donations may be expected from that source. Should further relief money be necessary for the unemployed, then the states or the communities will have to provide the necessary sums. Douglas holds the view that such a policy would suffice to give industry a strong impetus so that unemployment would be speedily diminished in a natural way, as it were.</p>
   <p>It appears that the program, as advocated by the former director of the budget, found a ready ear with many Democrats. They try to persuade the administration to take a similar course. The next Congress will have to deal with the problem of a bonus for the veterans. Propaganda for this purpose has been going on for months, and it seems that Congress is going to offer the demands of the veterans no serious resistance. Whether a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>bill of this sort will meet with the consent of the President is rather doubtful. It is likely that the administration is going to submit to Congress a compromise bill granting a bonus to veterans in need, but not to the others.</p>
   <p>Such a compromise bill could not be refused passage because, through the payment of the bonus to needy veterans, relief payments to the unemployed would be correspondingly eased. It is, however, of no decisive importance as to how this problem is going to be disposed of. After all, the veterans are bound to get the bonus, and it would be quite lucky for the country if all the agitation in this respect were, once and for all, to come to a stop.</p>
   <p>The most difficult and most important problem is relief for the unemployed. In this the government has not only the budget to consider; it must also ponder the question whether and to what extent unemployment is benefited by unemployment relief. That this is actually so can no longer be denied <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>today. The administration is at crossroads. It must not grant too far-reaching influence over its decisions to theorists; it must rather direct its intentions toward an economic policy which is constructive and which promises to yield practical results.</p>
