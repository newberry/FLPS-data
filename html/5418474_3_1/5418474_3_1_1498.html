   <p>In view of the fact that Chicago is a cosmopolitan city, and that we have other nationalities living here besides the German, we believe it is our duty to call attention to the importance of the election on next Tuesday. To do this, we will publish in our Sunday issue, Westen, an appeal in English, Irish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Bohemian, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, French, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Armenian, Persian, Arabian, Egyptian, Portuguese, etc.</p>
   <p>The Republicans want to buy the election, as they did four years ago, in order to enslave the people and take away their personal liberty forever. Therefore, it is urgent for those who came here to live as free men in a free country, to join that specific party, which will protect the liberties of the people, and to vote for those men, who are striving and have the ability to liberate our country from the curse of corruption. These men are Cleveland and Altgeld, and the party is the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>We ask, therefore, that our German fellow-citizens, who desire to see Cleveland and Altgeld elected, call the attention of citizens of other nationalities <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the appeal in the Westen printed in their own languages. It appears that 95% of the German-Americans are for Cleveland and Altgeld, and by helping the others, we do our share to win the election.</p>
