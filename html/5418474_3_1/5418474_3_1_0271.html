   <p>The German bakers of the city met at Klare's Hall last evening in the interest of a reduction of the hours of labor, the abolition of the custom of bosses boarding and lodging employes, and the establishment of an "intelligence bureau", where the unemployed could register, etc. It was very late when they got together and all that was done was the discussion of the propositions presented, and the appointment of a committee to present their grievances to the bosses, the committee to report at a meeting to be held a week hence. If the demands made are not acceded to, the indications are that there will be a strike, but not until the Union has been greatly strengthened.</p>
