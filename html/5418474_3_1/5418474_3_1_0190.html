   <p>The milk strike is assuming more acute forms, and it seems that the authorities are not very much inclined to suppress violence, as their duty demands. This is a delivery strike, carried on by the farmers who are members of the Pure Milk Association. They have the right and privilege to refuse to deliver milk. On the other hand, the independent farmers also have the right to bring milk to Chicago, and if they are prevented from doing so by the striking farmers, they have claim to the full protection of the law. It is strange that the authorities who are obligated to preserve peace and security are often inactive.</p>
   <p>Heretofore the organized dairies paid the farmers $2.10 per hundred pounds for basic milk--that is, for that part of the milk which the dairies accepted daily at full price. They paid less for the rest of the milk, which they were <span class="page-break">2</span>obliged to accept by agreement. The independent dairies paid farmers a straight rate of $1.90 per hundred pounds and accepted all the milk at that price. The net income which the farmers received for their product was about the same in both cases. Perhaps the independent farmers received just a trifle more than the others.</p>
   <p>The independent dairies sold their milk at a lower price than the organized dairies demanded, partly because the poorer people were given an opportunity of calling for their milk at stores, instead of having it delivered to the individual homes, and partly because they were satisfied with a smaller profit. Now the organized dairies are trying to eliminate the competition of the independents. To attain this purpose they have employed the simple means of greatly reducing the price which they pay to farmers. Thereupon the farmers decided not only to cease delivering milk themselves, but also to prevent those farmers who do not belong to the Pure Milk Association from delivering milk to independent dairies.</p>
   <p>Thus the organized dairies have attained their object. They are so well situated, <span class="page-break">3</span>financially, that they can easily endure a long milk strike, while the independent dairies cannot. Just a few weeks ago the Federal Government tried to regulate the milk business in Chicago and vicinity, through the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. The attempt was not successful, and Secretary of Agriculture Wallace attributed the failure of the attempt to the "greed of the large dairies." He also declared that an examination of the books of these corporations showed that their profits are exorbitant. Now negotiations are under way to end the strike by a compromise, and at the same time to confer a kind of dictatorship over milk deliveries, prices, etc., upon the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>In connection with this whole affair, it is strange that the farmers are working hand in hand with the organized dairies, against which they allegedly are fighting. For, while the farmers are doing everything they possibly can to prevent the delivery of milk to Chicago, the employees of the organized dairies are constantly committing acts of violence against independent dairies. This extraordinary state of affairs can, perhaps, be explained by the statement <span class="page-break">4</span>(coming from a well-informed source) that the leaders of the farmers are in the pay of the organized dairies. [This appears to be true for] on Monday there appeared in several newspapers a notice which was supposedly signed by the striking farmers, but its origin is dubious and the wording is strangely confusing.</p>
   <p>Congressman Adolph Sabbath has stated that he will see to it that the entire delivery strike is investigated by the Federal Department of Justice. This investigation should be started immediately. Local authorities in Cook County and vicinity have forfeited the exercise of their power. As far as the milk strike is concerned, policemen and sheriffs do not exist; but it seems that the Federal authorities also have resigned in favor of the striking farmers and the deliverymen of the organized dairies. The strikers are halting automobiles, freight trains, and even mail trains. They are endangering the lives of thousands of people and are destroying hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of property. Apparently law and order have been suspended, and general anarchy is the order of the day.</p>
