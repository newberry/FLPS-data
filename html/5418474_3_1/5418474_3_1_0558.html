   <p>According to reports from Washington the evident spreading of Bolshevism in America is causing no little alarm and anxiety in administration circles and in Congress; and the Government is diligently seeking ways and means to protect the American public against the threatening danger of being poisoned by Bolshevik ideas and doctrines.</p>
   <p>"Seek and ye shall find." And: "Where there is a will, there is a way." A strong desire to fight Bolshevism appears to have developed, especially in the Senate of the United States. For, while the Cabinet (in its weekly session) spoke about the peril of Bolshevism, it took no action, save to inform the President of the situation. The Senate, on the other hand, passed a resolution empowering the Committee on Propaganda to extend its investigation to "all endeavors to spread the principles of any party which receives, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>or claims to receive, its authority from Russia, or which seeks to overthrow the Government of this nation by force, or by the destruction of life and property, or by causing a general cessation of industrial activity."</p>
   <p>It is said that the Committee will begin this investigation tomorrow by cross-examining a number of "intellectuals", some of whom were recently called "pacifists". It is also reported that in order to combat Bolshevism the Committee will insist upon the enactment of laws which will make it possible to deport foreign agitators, and to suppress subversive literature. The Committee will also propose laws to prohibit immigration for four years and to deport all interned alien enemies.</p>
   <p>This fine program reminds the thoughtful citizen of the neat little rhyme:</p>
   <p>"There, upon the roof, sits quite puzzled</p>
   <p>A graybeard, thoughtful and bamboozled."</p>
   <p>And sympathy will move the citizen to aid the good old man with good advice.</p>
   <p>This sympathy will be associated with the well-founded anxiety....that the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Senate Committee, which has the duty to fight Bolshevism, will only nourish and strengthen it. For, everything that the Committee plans to do is merely superficial and unimportant, and does not touch the source of the evil, in fact has absolutely no relation to the evil. The last statement is especially true of the proposed deportation of alien enemies. The physician who merely puts a plaster on an abscess, or merely removes the abscess by an operation and then applies a plaster to the wound, will soon find that his ministrations only accelerate the complete disintegration of the body.</p>
   <p>Thus, it appears that anxiety for the future of our country demands that the Senate Committee and the Cabinet be apprised of the necessity to stop scattering the seed of Bolshevism, to refrain from opening ever new sources of irrigation for the fatal seed; they should be informed of the necessity to plug the fountains from which Bolshevism emanates.</p>
   <p>One need not leave Washington for this purpose. The sowers of Bolshevism are <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in the Capitol, especially in the Senate. Loss of faith in the justice of our institutions and in the sincerity of the fine speeches about liberty and equality and self-determination--that is the germ from which Bolshevism springs. Mistrust and dissatisfaction are the immediate consequences. And mistrust and dissatisfaction have been fostered and are still being fostered by Congress, especially by the Senate. How? By nagging and hampering the President and casting suspicion upon his objectives; by attacking the President's plan for a league of nations and world peace. By its actions the Senate postpones and delays what our nation and all nations desire, need, and demand, namely, peace; for only when peace has been negotiated, and not until then, will it be possible for the nations to adjust themselves to changed conditions and to arrange their disordered affairs.</p>
   <p>Those who, above all others, are qualified and obligated to facilitate and accelerate the transition from war to peace, are doing all they can to hinder this transition through petty, despicable partisan politics, actuated by envy <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and malice. They cast suspicion upon the administration, cast doubt upon the aims and the ability of the administration; they nag and belittle one another, and do everything possible to destroy the last vestige of faith and loyalty of the people; they do their utmost to create the impression that the President, his Cabinet, and all the members of Congress are good-for-nothings, that they know nothing, that they cannot and will not do any good, that they do not have the welfare of the people at heart. They destroy faith in justice and truth by measures which are an insult to every conception of a fair deal, and they scoff at liberty and self-determination.</p>
   <p>According to its resolution the Senate intends to oppose everything which contributes to the overthrow of the Government. But the Senate and the House of Representatives voted for the Prohibition Amendment, which not only destroyed billions of dollars worth of property and deprived thousands of people of a living by destroying their source of income, but which also has virtually over-thrown the Government by a most brutal violation of the Constitution, upon which the Government was founded and upon which the Government heretofore has <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>rested. They have changed the Constitution from a stronghold for the protection of justice and liberty to an instrument for the commission of a grave injustice and the suppression of the people's freedom.</p>
   <p>If the Senate wishes to do something against Bolshevism, let the Senate ask the Supreme Court to declare the Prohibition Amendment unconstitutional. For it is unconstitutional. That would be a good deed done. And then if the Senate in its entirety will give full support to the President's plans for a league of nations and world peace, and would insist that peace be made as soon as possible, it will have done more to combat Bolshevism than could be accomplished by any conceivable measures for the suppression of Bolshevism.</p>
