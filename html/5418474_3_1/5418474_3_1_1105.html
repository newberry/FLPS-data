   <p>P. 8.. Yesterday afternoon a largely attended Socialist meeting was held in the West Side Turner Hall on Twelfth Street. Phillip Van Patten and Henry Stahl occupied the chair respectively for the English and German elements, and A. Glicker and J. Winner acted as English and German Secretaries. Van Patten elucidated the principles of Socialism in English for about 15 minutes, followed by Joseph Brucker, editor of the Milwaukee Socialist. He spoke on behalf of this daily, and the necessity of more perfect organization, in order that in the future they might have some influence in politics, and thus impress their peculiar features upon the people of the country. Brucker's speech was very lengthy, and contained no points that have not heretofore been given.</p>
