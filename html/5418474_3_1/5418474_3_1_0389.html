   <p>Labor Day has as usual, released a flood of eloquence. At the present time these utterances are especially worth noticing, because they show the attitude of the laboring class toward the New Deal and especailly toward the efforts of the Administration to solve the unemployment problem.</p>
   <p>In the first place, one may disregard the speeches of the politicians on this occasion, for they are campaign speeches which have no purpose other than to influence the voters for or against the Administration, in order that they will vote accordingly in the next election.</p>
   <p>William F. Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, made a speech in Wichita, Kansas, which was alarming. He declared that the country is faced with the worst winter it ever experienced. Not less than forty million will have to depend on relief. Green estimates the unemployed at around ten million, <span class="page-break">\2</span>which seems about right. According to his figures, every unemployed person has, on the average, three dependents. Hence the number of those who will need aid from public funds next winter will reach forty million. Perhaps this number is somewhat too high, but probably it corresponds fairly closely with the actual situation.</p>
   <p>Green declares it to be unthinkable that the country would decide to support such an enormous number of people--about one third of the total population--out of public funds. As a means of increasing employment, he recommends the speeding up of public works decided upon by the Federal Government and other authorities, the restoration of the Civil Works Administration, and the extension of the program to repair and modernize buildings. That the carrying out of these proposals would have beneficial effects can be clearly seen, but it will bring about no substantial reduction in the number of unemployed.</p>
   <p>Of this Green himself is convinced, because he proposes at the same time a change in the N. R. A. codes. These now provide for a maximum of forty hours of work per week; Green proposes that this maximum be reduced to thirty hours.</p>

   <p>Reuben Soderstrom, president of the Illinois Federation of Labor, goes even further. In his opinion the "revolting condition of unemployment as well as its twin sister, the deplorable makeshift relief of the unemployed," could be abolished with one stroke. He would achieve this aim by reducing the working week to three days.</p>
   <p>Both Green and Soderstrom advocate a method which is called "Arbeitsstreckung" (stretching out the work) in German. This method undoubtedly has its advantages, because it certainly is better that the people work for their livelihood, than that they receive relief. But this, too, is only a makeshift, for it does not improve economic conditions, since it does not increase the buying power of the working class as a whole. This could only come about if wages were increased proportionately at the same time. This demand is also raised by Soderstrom, for he declares: "Wages should be as high as it is possible to pay."</p>
   <p>The catch in these proposals is contained in the last sentence. If wages are raised so high that industries can no longer survive, the general situation will become even worse. Naturally, to prevent this, the Government might <span class="page-break">\4</span>increase the prices of products accordingly; but it cannot compel consumers to buy products at these higher prices, and hence we would be no nearer a solution of the problem.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note what an English labor leader, Andrew Conley, president of the British Trades Union Congress, which corresponds to the American Federation of Labor, said on this problem. In a speech before the annual convention of this organization, Conley took a definite stand against the Administration's policy of "curtailment, regulation, and control." He characterizes this policy as "economic barbarism, which leads to the sabotage of productive capacity, and to arbitrary destruction of actually existent wealth". Conley also speaks against the system of unemployment relief.</p>
   <p>When England and Germany had to carry such a heavy burden of unemployment relief that they were threatened with a collapse, everywhere in this country it was said again and again, that America would never accept a system which degraded the working class to the level of receivers of alms. Since then, however, this system has been introduced here to the widest extent--a proof <span class="page-break">\5</span>that even the most beautiful ideas have to capitulate in the face of reality. For, after all, the unemployed and their families cannot be allowed to starve. The well-meant proposals of the two American labor leaders will also be shattered on the rocks of inexorable reality.</p>
