   <p>Statesman Lawler explained to his more or less loyal henchmen yesterday how he exhausted himself for his friends while in Washington.</p>
   <p>"I was not able to make many speeches," he said, "but I saw to it that the public received political documents." By this our dear Frank means the free mailing of a tremendous quantity of waste paper to Chicago. This waste paper contains all the yarns about the tariff by the Democratic congressmen, which have been collected over quite a period of time.</p>
   <p>In ordinary business the mailing is being done by office boys but in a public household we need a representative for congress for that purpose who draws $5,000 a year plus expenses. Everybody according to his own taste!</p>
