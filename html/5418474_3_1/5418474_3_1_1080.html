   <p>A committee of the Lehr Und Wehr Verein met last night at No. 7 Clark Street. The rifles of the dreaded L. and W. reposed quietly at home; their bayonets rusted in their respective sheaths; with the L. and W. V. all was peaceful. The committee met to settle the preliminaries of a picnic to be held at Ogden's Grove Sunday, the 1st prox. They decided that beer was a prerequisite of socialistic picnics, that the old hay-market on West Randolph Street was a good place to start from, and that 10 a. m. would be about as early as they could get ready.</p>
