   <p>The article "Art and Trade" which appeared recently in this paper did not have the good fortune to meet with Mr. H. Sigel's (Milwaukee Freie Presse) approval. But the fact that the "foreign" oboe artist was not permitted to join the Union during the first six months of his residence in this country is even understood by Mr. Sigel as "not only stupid, but brutal and barbarous". But he does not believe that musicians by organizing and joining unions, descend to the level of the wage laborer. Mr. Sigel asks:</p>
   <p>"Why should intellectual workers like musicians, dramatists, teachers, physicians, scientists, writers, journalists etc. not become organized like the handicraftsmen? Do not they have at least as much reason to organize as the wage workers have? In Europe we find Artist-Societies as well as Theatre-Associations, Writer and Journalist Societies and Teacher and Musician Societies. Why is this, which is considered appropriate and even necessary in other lands of no importance here?....."</p>
   <p>Artist Societies further art only when they encourage a noble competition among artists, meaning excellent execution of their art. But if such organizations <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are here only for the purpose of forcing equal wages, regardless of the merits of the performer, then we decidely oppose such action....</p>
   <p>In addition, we reprint an excellent item from the Anzeiger des Westens which fully agrees with us:</p>
   <p>"At the time when law has barred the importation of contract workers, musicians were not included in this category, for they were considered artists. This was of course supposed to be an honor, but the New York musicians care very little for honor. The treatment accorded Mr. Thomas and his new oboeist implies that they dont wish to be artists, but players only. It is easy enough to understand why the handicraftsman fears foreign competition, but musicians, at least those who are members of good orchestras, were considered so far as artists, whose work consists principally to grasp and interpret the great composers' thoughts, talents and genius.</p>
   <p>The present stand of the Musicians' Trade Association in regard to the foreign musicians, is by far, worse than what it was under the know-nothings, who were <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>concerned only with the political rights of foreigners. The present knownothings of the Musicians' Trade Association, themselves largely immigrants, insist that the immigrant artist be deprived of a half year's livelihood....</p>
   <p>This Musicians' Trade Association compelled Mr. Theodore Thomas to pay a fine of $750. when he chose not to disappoint the audience already gathered for the concert....</p>
   <p>Is this any better than an ordinary street holdup?....</p>
