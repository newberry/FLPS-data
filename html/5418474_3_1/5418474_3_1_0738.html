   <p>Nina Van Zandt, the mad bride of an anarchist was successful at last to become last Sunday evening the lawful wife of August Spies by proxy. The "dignified" ceremony was performed by the anarchistic sympathizer Judge Engelhardt, at which Henry W. Spies acted as proxy for August Spies, his brother.</p>
   <p>The proceedings of this pretty "business," which were so successfully kept a secret, were the following: When Sheriff Matson opposed and rendered such ceremony impossible at the county jail, Nina remembered the words uttered by Mr. Matson, stressing emphatically that only the wife or blood relatives are permitted to visit the condemned men, and knowing also that a marriage by proxy is legal and fully recognized, she won Judge Engelhardt of Jefferson, the friend of anarchists, to solemnize her marriage to August Spies, through his representative.</p>
   
   <p>Saturday last, August Spies authorized his brother, Henry W. , to represent him at the ceremony, which took place at Judge Engelhardt's home in the presence of the bride's parents, the mother of August Spies, and his sister, Gretchen and brother, Ferdinand. All those present at the wedding promised to keep the ceremony secret. Although there is much rejoicing in the families of Spies and Van Zandt and, of course, of the newly weds, about the trick they played on the sheriff, many of the friends and sympathizers of the anarchists are provoked that their "comrade", August Spies, consented to an extraordinary marriage of this type.</p>
   <p>Leonard Sweet, the attorney recently acquired for the anarchists, is said to have expressed himself, that the union of Spies and Miss Van Zandt was not legal. If this wedding story is true, it proves anew that August Spies, who so frequently denounced a wedding ceremony as something ridiculous, in the anarchistic organ, has lost all sense of shame and honor, else he could not have suffered, that a man-crazy, but otherwise respectable, girl would throw her fate together with his.</p>
