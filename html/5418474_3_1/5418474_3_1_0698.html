   <p>General Sheridan, commander-in-chief of the human slaughter department of the United States is dying. Sheridan is the author of a martial law the publication of which cost the life of Parsons.</p>
   <p>The dying General was all in all not a bad person. As a mercenary in the services of some monarch he could have achieved something big. On the free platform of the republic he was not on his own ground and when he goes to heaven now we shall say: "Well done".</p>
