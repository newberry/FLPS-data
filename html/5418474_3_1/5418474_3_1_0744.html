   <p>The announcement of Liebknecht's appearance brought an immense crowd to the vorwarts Turner hall, to hear the famous "soldier of the revolution" speak. Mr. Liebknecht appeared on the platform shortly after 8 o'clock and was greeted by Dr. and Mrs. Aveling. Mr. Gustav Bartels opened the meeting "in the name of the Socialists and the entire labor population of Chicago". Mr. Wm. Kempke as chairman of the meeting introduced Messrs. John Gloy, Wm. Pflugradt, Dr. Schleyer and Mathias Schmiedinger as co-chairmen; the same honor was bestowed upon Dr. Schmidt who however was not able to be present. Messrs. J. Kruger and Schoning functioned as secretaries. Mr. Liebknecht with hardly any preliminaries explained to the audience his noted remarks against Most and the Chicago anarchists. He said, that all this is only imagination or, if anything at all, the interpretation can not be identified with anything he did say. It is my opinion that these men were not sentenced because of anarchy, but because they are considered to be the representatives of the proletariat. (Thunderous applause) And what I have said just now, is not done to affect popularity, for it is well known that neither my friends nor the criticism of my enemies have the power to influence me. (The rest of his speech was not received with much enthusiasm). He spoke of the great success the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Socialistic - Democratic party achieved in Germany through the voting system; he also mentioned the liberty movement achieved also by the Socialist-Democrats of Germany by the way of ballots. He then gave a very strange definition of the words "might" and "power", Bismarck for instance is powerful but the Socialistic - Democrats are mighty. Last Thursday's election showed clearly, what progress was made by the workingmen of this country. Many other things Mr. Liebknecht said, but none of it was a new revelation to any of us.</p>
