   <p>The endless screw is rotating more rapidly. Today wages rise, tomorrow the prices go up on foodstuffs and other necessities which man requires to make his existence a comfortable one. Many a man has asked himself: Where will the constant increase of wages and the cost of life's necessities finally lead us? Heretofore nobody has answered this question. All of our economists and educated people, as well as those who claim to have been brought up on socialism and have a ready solution for all difficulties which might arise in this future state, have failed to solve this problem. Of course, in the future state there will be no money. There every citizen, by reason of his birth, will not only be entitled to a living, but he will also be as well off financially as--well, as the President of the United States, and perhaps even more so. But, in return for that consideration he must also work. Theoretically that sounds very inviting. But who can predict whether or not the change from this beautiful dream to reality will not turn out to be as great a fiasco as the much-praised Russian Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>In the United States there is no real ground for Bolshevistic or ultra Socialistic propaganda. The "Reds" have no followers among those workers who have mastered their trade, or among the farmers in the country; for all of these, or nearly all, have deposits in banks and are not ready to give their hard-earned money to any and every good-for-nothing who, for one reason or another, has made a mess of his life. It is true, we should not "discard the child with the bathing water". Even among the poorest of the poor there are many who are in a miserable condition through no fault of their own, and are dependent upon the charity of their fellow men. And ways and means should be found to help them attain an independent existence without making them feel that the support rendered is absolute charity. However, to place all men, irrespective of the differences in the value of their productive ability, upon the same economic level, would mean to deprive men of all sense of honor and of all initiative, and thus to hinder cultural progress.</p>
   
   <p>Our social system could be changed in many respects; our social order is all but perfect. It would not hurt our Newport drones in the least, if they were made to do useful work--work which would benefit the community or the state. Nevertheless it would be hazardous to group elevator operators or street cleaners with men whose professions benefit a much greater number of people--renowned educators, expert economists, and able statesmen. Nowhere in the world is there absolute equality among men, and there never will be. Men differ from their very birth. They differ with respect to talents, and the older they grow, the more pronounced this difference becomes. But how many would place special value upon the development of their talents, if they were certain that they would enjoy the same carefree future which is the lot of the lesser gifted who have neglected their development?</p>
   <p>Meanwhile these questions have only a theoretical value. The admittedly well-meant ideas and proposals will, perhaps, never be realized. At present we are dealing with an endless screw, which makes one class of worker the most important today, and elevates another class to the same position tomorrow. The middle class is the one which suffers under the decreased buying power of money. Organized labor, through the mediation of its unions, has won a living worthy of human beings. In some instances the wage rates border on the fantastic.</p>
   <p>The middle class, which is not organized, must, in most cases, be satisfied with salaries which are totally inadequate to procure life's needs. This class suffers in the fight between labor and capital; for when capital is forced to grant labor an increase in wages, capital promptly adds the amount of the wage increase to the selling price of its goods. And the middle class, as well as the poor, must pay this price. If his financial condition does not improve, he gradually becomes poorer, and indescribable misery is finally his lot. He must move into a tenement, which has been abandoned by a better-paid worker, because he can no longer pay the high rent which is demanded by landlords in the district in which he is accustomed to live; he will no longer be able to give his children the careful and thorough education which he had intended and felt duty bound to give them; for they are obliged to go to work at an early age in order to help provide a living for the family. Just ask representatives of this class how many of their children are obliged to work after school so that they can at least purchase the clothing and shoes which they need! Accurate statistics would reveal astonishing facts.</p>
   <p>Every country needs a middle class. If the one in the United States is to be saved this must be done now--otherwise it will be crushed between the millstones of capitalism and unionism.</p>
