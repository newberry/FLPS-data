   <p>There was an important meeting of Germans in this city last evening. The body that was assembled is known as the German-American central committee and consists of delegates from the various ward organizations and other German societies in this city.</p>
   <p>About one-half of this constituencies were represented. The existence of two factions was developed at an early stage of the proceedings.</p>
   <p>One of these was headed by A. Hesing and favored consumnation of the coaliton between the Germans and the Irish which was initiated at the conference on Sunday last. The other party, led by Mr. Jussen, repudiated this combination and desired to seek an American rather than an Irish alliance. The discussion was land, long and full of wrath; but the result was the adoption of a resolution in favor of the Hesing O'Hara conspiracy</p>
