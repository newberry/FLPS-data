   <p>A meeting of the German shop butchers of the city washeld last evening after hours in Merhle's Broadway Hall, Nos. 369 and 371 State Street, for the purpose of organizing a German branch of the Butchers Union. The chair was occupied by Mr. Thomas Greif. The Chairman stated that the object of the proposed new Union was to shorten the working hours, many of the shop butchers being obliged now to work from fifteen to eighteen hours per day, also to provide a fund for the relief of members.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to report a constitution and by-laws at the next meeting, which will be duly announced. There was a good attendance, and those present went to work as though they meant to make the New Union a success.</p>
