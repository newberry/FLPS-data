   <p>In yesterday's Fackel we printed the extraordinary letter of Carter H. Harrison to Governor Fifer regarding Oscar Neebe. After the publication of this letter, which clearly proves that Grinnell himself did not believe that there was any proof against Neebe, we cannot see how it is possible for any man in this community to oppose the immediate release of Oscar Neebe any longer!</p>
   <p>We regret beyond expression the fact that Carter Harrison has by his silence permitted the sufferings of poor Neebe to last for two long years.</p>
   <p>Had Carter H. Harrison done his duty and added his influence against the enforcement of this cruel sentence, he would have been entitled to recognition. He chose instead to take a trip around the world to hobnob with European and Oriental princes with the knowledge that Neebe was suffering unjust torments. Now, after it is generally admitted that the imprisonment <span class="page-break">\2</span>of Neebe was a mistake, our Carter is willing to contribute his mite for his release.</p>
