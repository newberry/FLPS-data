   <p>The Germans are opposing the Republican ticket with a unanimity which reminds one of last year's election. The Republicans have the motto "revenge for Sedan". They have not forgotten their November 4, 1873. Like the Frenchmen they have learned nothing. They cannot forget their defeat. "Vengeance" is now their battle cry. In their blind fury they are representing a second edition of last year's mistakes.</p>
   <p>The Germans have realized that they have been insulted once more as soon as the Republican ticket became known. The Germans who at first have been flattered, have been given a kick. And what has happened to the Germans, is also true for the Scandinavians, the Poles, the French and the Irish. The foreign born does not exist for the Chicago Administration people. "America for the Americans" is their motto, but according to them naturalized Americans are not Americans. The question now is, shall the results of last fall's victory be jeopardized. The Germans answer unanimously: No.</p>
