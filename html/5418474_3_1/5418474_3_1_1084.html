   <p>The combined sections of the Socialistic Labor party held a meeting last evening at No. 7 Clark Street for the purpose of considering the advisability of allowing the Lehr und Wehr Verein to turn out armed to-morrow. Mr. Henry Stahl was elected to preside.</p>
   <p>Mr. T. J. Morgan stated that he was in receipt of a dispatch from Philip Van Patten, Secretary of the National Committee at Cincinnati, advising them not to turn out with arms Sunday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grottkan stigmatized the dispatch as an insult to the Chicago sections. The National Committee or Mr. Van Patten had no right to dictate to them in this matter. He hoped the proposition would be answered in such a manner as to teach the men at Cincinnati that the members of the party in Chicago were no school boys.</p>
   <p>It was an arrogant piece of effrontery which should be resented.</p>
