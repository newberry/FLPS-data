   <p>We announced yesterday that the German waiters had nothing to do with the strike of the American Waiters Union, nor with their demonstrations. This was published upon requests by some German waiters, who came to our main office.</p>
   <p>But now the vice-president and the secretary of the German Waiters' Union, Columbia Association, have made the following statement personally:</p>
   <p>The German waiters are in full accord with the Americans in regard to the strike; inasmuch as there are also German waiters on strike at Kern's restaurant. A demonstration has taken place under the auspices of the so-called German Waiters' Union to give moral support to the striking American waiters. The relationship between the German and the American waiters is cordial. Neither the German nor the American waiters are trying to take away the positions from one another.</p>
