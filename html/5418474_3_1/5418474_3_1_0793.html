   <p>The Socialists of the Southside held their agitation meeting last Saturday, which was well attended, for the purpose of listening to the lecture of Comrade Stapke about the "Rules of the Constitution."</p>
   <p>The reporter fulfilled his task with great cleverness and reaped much applause. The projected evening entertainment will take place on May 3, in the Bohemian Hall, cor. Portland Ave. and 25th Street.</p>
   <p>The report of the delegates was accepted, the discussion postponed until the next meeting owing to the lateness of the hour. A collection for a member of the club and the family of Stellmacher netted $3.30.</p>
   <p>After the admittance of several members, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
