   <p>T. B. Dyer, editor of the Granite Cutters Journal and an English conservative labor leader writes in one of his articles about the disharmony among the working class in the U. S.</p>
   <p>It is a pity, but everything Dyer says about the unharmonious relations among the workers in the United States is true. There is a prevailing all around mixup , a sectarianism, that becomes uncanny.</p>
   <p>Narrow minds, having forgotten common ideas in their self interest, envent new social systems and found new sects solely for the purpose of reigning over them as popes.</p>
   <p>Following the principle "divide et impera", everything is fought against that does not adhere 100% to their special doctrines.</p>
   <p>And the common enemy, the capitalist, can put his hands in his pockets and laugh at the sight of the working class warring against itself.</p>

   <p>As long as these present internal strifes continue, he does not have to move a finger. The sectarians are tending the business better for him than he ever could do.</p>
