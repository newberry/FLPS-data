   <p>The latest edition of the Saturday Evening Post has an article by Dorothy Thompson on fascism, dictatorship, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, and governmental problems in general. She starts from the premise, undoubtedly correct, that the people will always clamor for a change in the constitution as soon as things go wrong. As proof, she quotes a passage from Guglielmo Ferrero's history of Rome, wherein the latter describes the general conditions prevailing in Rome in about 100 B. C. The description fits present conditions almost to a letter, in most so-called civilized countries.</p>
   <p>The author points out that in such cases, the people will hold the democratic form of government and everything that goes with it, responsible for their troubles and that they will clamor for a dictator, or a strong man. The author then analyzes several dictators, from Caesar down to Hitler. She reveals the causes of their rise to power, and she describes their aims <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>succinctly and impartially. She also reminds us that Germany, even before Hitler, was ruled in a sort of dictatorial manner, and that even the governments of Great Britain and France have occasionally resorted to this [governmental] method in order to overcome grave internal crises, but that they invariably returned to democratic processes afterwards.</p>
   <p>Dorothy Thompson tries to prove in her article that dictatorship is unnecessary under any circumstances, and that no people have a moral right to abolish democracy. To prove this, she emphasizes the fact that in no election did Hitler's party command more than forty-four per cent of the votes cast, to which one may add the eight per cent cast by the rightists. In the author's opinion, Hitler, therefore, has no right to state that the whole people or even a [substantial] majority stood behind him. Dorothy Thompson says the same thing of Mussolini. She feels that he staged the march on Rome at a time when normal conditions had already returned and the danger of communism no longer existed. The Russian communists, who are dictators in every respect, took power when the country was completely disintegrated, and the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>bourgeois elements were unable to resist.</p>
   <p>In the course of her article, the author tries to prove that the claim of the superior efficiency of a dictatorship is unfounded, and that democracy, in spite of some undeniable shortcomings, is still the better choice. Arguments like these are grossly fallacious in that they look upon the conceptions of dictatorship and democracy as definitely fixed constitutional forms. But this assumption is not at all confirmed by actual practice. A country may be ruled as a dictatorship even though democratic institutions remain unaltered. At present the United States is governed in this manner because it is no longer a secret that Congress, during the emergency session, granted the dictatorial demands of the President. The executive branch of the government has, therefore, usurped powers which, according to the Constitution, are the prerogative of the legislative branch, and that is, without a doubt, a dictatorial procedure.</p>
   <p>It is also generally known that parliamentarism is bankrupt in this country.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Occasionally, a few members of Congress will be honest enough to admit that they do not always talk and vote according to the wishes of the majority of their constituents, but that they are constantly tyrannized by well-organized minorities. Anybody who is fairly familiar with conditions in France will admit that that country is not ruled by the cabinet that happens to be in power, but that it is primarily ruled by the officialdom, the press, high finance, and heavy industry. But France is supposed to have a parliamentary form of government.</p>
   <p>Even Dorothy Thompson admits in her article that Poland and Jugoslavia are dictatorships, although they present the aspects of democratically ruled countries to the outside world. On another point, which regards Germany alone, the author is quite wrong. She claims that, according to the Nazis, there is something in the "Teutonic soul that rebels against parliamentarism". This statement is probably not quite true, but if we said that the Germans find it particularly difficult to adapt themselves to the representative form of government, we would be more correct. They [the Germans] are staunch <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>individualists and, therefore, lack that instinct of the herd, which is indispensable for the proper functioning of parliamentarism and party politics. Whenever Dorothy Thompson writes about European conditions, her articles always merit attention because she is well informed, she has the right perspective on things, which is a prerequisite for correct judgment, and in addition to that, she has intelligence and a feeling for historical events. But in one respect she seems to entertain a naive American idea. She believes that the democratic institutions of America are better than the dictatorial ones which so many European nations have recently adopted. This opinion is untenable. Constitutions cannot be termed good or bad, better or worse. They are constantly changing, regardless of their intrinsic value or lack of it, and it seems as if nations have to accept, without protest, a new form of government when their turn in this continuously revolving circle arrives.</p>
