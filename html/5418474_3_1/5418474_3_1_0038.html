   <p>It is doubtful that it is the duty of labor unions to take care of neglected children, but it is an absolute mistake to think that to train these poor boys to become useful tradesmen, is detrimental to the unions. The labor assembly expressed the opinion that these boys so trained would constitute competition for the labor unions.</p>
   <p>It has been proved long ago, without successful reputation, that the greatest obstacle for the labor movement is not the excess number of trained workers, but to the contrary, the too great number of untrained ones.</p>
   <p>People that have no vocational training are compelled to accept most anything at any price they can get. Since they have not learned a trade, they do not recognize trade unions. They can not become members of any of these unions, because they do not understand anything and consider the labor unions as their greatest enemy.</p>

   <p>Out of the mobs of the untrained laborers come to a great extent the "Scabs." Therefore it is a shortsighted attitude of some union men, if they try to make it hard for boys to learn a trade.</p>
