   <p>Nothing to do is playing havoc among many labor organizations. Out of pure tediousness, the members start a fight among themselves or abuse absent persons, mostly co-fighters.</p>
   <p>This procedure, however, amuses reasoning on-lookers only once or twice; the third time they stay away. Then the originators kick about a weak attendance.</p>
   <p>We could name a local organization that only a year ago held impressive meetings but which folded up a few months ago because nothing was done at its meetings other than kicking and fighting.</p>
   <p>How much better it would have been to put up a present-day question for discussion or, in the absence of people who can speak publicly, read some articles out of a good book.</p>
   <p>The office of the Arbeiter Zeitung is able to furnish such books free of charge, as a loan, in such huge quantities that every Arbeiter Verein can be provided for many years. We are sorry to state that the demand, however, is very small.</p>
