   <p>The undersigned businessmen of this city recommend Dr. Ernst Schmidt for mayor, and appeal to their fellow citizens to vote for him as well as to be active in his behalf. Although we do not subscribe to every principle of the candidate's party, we shall, nevertheless, vote for him in consideration of his reputation and humanitarianism. We are convinced that, if Dr. Schmidt is elected, he will not act in the usual manner--"To the victor belong the spoils"--and that his administration will be marked by its consideration for the interests of the community, and by adherence to scrupulous honesty.</p>
   <p>In the name of 456 businessmen:</p>
   <p>Henry Fuhrman</p>
   <p>S. Hyman</p>
   <p>O. F. Schultz</p>
