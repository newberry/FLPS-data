   <p>Major Roche, Hubbard and Bonfield answered two days ago the request for an order to restrain asked by the laborers' association from Judge Tuley.</p>
   <p>This lengthy document says among other things that the laborers' union is composed of anarchists who should not be allowed to meet, as they are dangerous.</p>
   <p>The anarchists want to take their revenge on the officers who brought the murdered anarchists (Spiess, Parsons, etc.) to trial.</p>
   <p>This is their answer word for word. It is remarkable that these people finally admit having murdered those anarchists.</p>
