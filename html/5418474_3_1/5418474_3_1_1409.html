   <p>At the meeting of the German Republican Club of the 25th ward, yesterday evening, which took place, corner Roscoe Boulevard and Sheffield Avenue, it was resolved, to get in closer touch with the German Republicans of the 26th ward, in regard to the coming Spring election.</p>
   <p>This way, it is expected, to give the German politicians of Lake View not only representation in the city council, but, if possible, to secure them also a place on the general "ticket." Mr. Philip Maas reported about the success of the efforts, to obtain a better water supply. A new pump will be provided for the Lake View Station. This information was gratefully received, but attention was called to the fact, that it would be necessary first, to obtain uniformity in the size of the water pipes. They are at present of four and six inches in thickness, therefore a uniform pressure can not be obtained.</p>
