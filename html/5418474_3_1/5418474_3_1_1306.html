   <p>A banquet to honor Robert M. Sweitzer, German Democratic candidate for mayor, was given by Messrs. Karl Eitel and Emil Demme of the Bismarck Hotel in the banquet hall of their establishment. A great number of influential and prominent Germans took part in the celebration, which was arranged in order to acquaint the Democratic candidate for mayor, in an informal manner, with the most widely known representatives of all classes of the German element. Mr. Robert M. Sweitzer's address made an excellent impression on his audience. His sensible and wholesome opinions as to how a metropolis like Chicago should be governed, his earnest desire and the sincerity of his words did not fail to impress his listeners. Mr. Karl Eitel functioned as chairman at the celebration. Mr. Harry Rubens was the toastmaster and discharged his duties in his usual capable manner. The principal speakers were Mr. Rubens, Dr. Maximilian Herzog and Robert M. Sweitzer, the honor guest of the evening.</p>

   <p>Mr. Karl Eitel opened the ceremonies with a brief address, welcoming the guests on behalf of Mr. Demme and himself, and then introduced the toastmaster of the evening, Mr. Rubens. His address ran as follows:</p>
   <p>"On behalf of Mr. Demme and myself I welcome you, and thank you for your presence here. This meeting was occasioned by an excellent speech made by Mr. Nagel, cabinet member under President Taft, at a banquet of the German Club. After relating his experiences in Munich, Berlin, and other German cities, where he witnessed the German people change from peaceful pursuits into a people in arms, where he saw the spontaneous enthusiasm and willingness to make sacrifices, Mr. Nagel pointed out that it was erroneous to assume, as was frequently done, that the excellent German army constituted the greatest achievement of the German people. Germany has developed a system of civil administration which is second to none. Thousands of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>travelers from all countries are praising the superb administration of German cities. It is true that vast sums of money were spent for the development of their cities, but these expenditures turned out to be an excellent investment, thanks to an army of efficient and competent officials.</p>
   <p>"It would afford the greatest satisfaction to all German-American voters, if the City of Chicago should get an equally honest, businesslike and efficient administration during the term of office of our next mayor, Robert M. Sweitzer, who is our honored guest tonight. We have the utmost confidence in Mr. Sweitzer's honest intentions and his excellent character. Undoubtedly some of you gentlemen would say a few words to the audience. Permit me, therefore, to introduce to you the toastmaster of the evening, Mr. Harry Rubens."</p>
   <p>Rubens Warns Against Thompson</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubens emphasized, right at the beginning of his speech, that the impending election was not to decide any national political issues, but merely <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the occupancy of the office of Mayor. Which one of the two candidates was more likely to take care of things in the best and most efficient businesslike manner, and which would discharge his duties and exercise his rights as Mayor in the most liberal fashion, as is the desire of the great majority of our cosmopolitan population? The speaker had no doubt that the commercially successful and experienced candidate of German ancestry, Sweitzer, was to be preferred to an unsuccessful, unexperienced Thompson, who necessarily was steeped in Puritanical ideas by his social environment. It was charged that Sweitzer's election was sponsored by Roger Sullivan, and also that a vote for Sweitzer would be a vote for Bryan. But everybody knew that Bryan was Sullivan's deadly enemy and that a vote for Sweitzer, therefore, was rather a vote against Bryan and his policy as Secretary of State. It was charged, furthermore, that Sweitzer was eagerly supported by the Irish. In our city politics that was a decided advantage as far as problems of personal liberties were concerned. In 1873, when the city of Chicago, under the administration of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the Republican Medill was subjected to the most abominable Sunday blue laws, only a German-Irish alliance broke this Puritanical tyranny, and thanks to this alliance the city has been spared from it ever since. Otherwise, we German-Americans would have every reason right now to appreciate the Irish element in our country, because in the neutrality question, which concerns us so deeply, the Irish especially were our most reliable and courageous allies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubens then introduced Mr. Robert Sweitzer.</p>
   <p>Promises Businesslike Administration</p>
   <p>Mr. Sweitzer pointed out in his address that the city administration was in need of a reorganization, since experience had shown that something was manifestly wrong. The achievements were not in proportion with the expenditures. What the city needed was an administration along strictly businesslike principles, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the main objective of which would be to give the citizens full value received for every dollar spent. Such an administration needed a businessman at the head who had made a success of his own business, and whose concern was a guarantee that the City would get a business administration too. He saw an opportunity to make a name for himself as Mayor of Chicago and at the same time promote Chicago's welfare. It was his ambition, to prove to the city and its people, what honest intentions, well-directed efforts, common sense and practical experience could accomplish. He would not let himself be guided by political motives, but would always have the welfare of the city at heart. One of his first acts in office would be the beginning of public works and local improvements, for which the citizens had voted bonds in the amount of eleven million dollars. The conscientious and wise expenditure of this sum would not only be a boon to the community in general, but would also afford thousands of people an opportunity to earn an honest living. This would mean happiness, prosperity, and contentment for thirty or forty thousand families in the city.</p>

   <p>The concluding speech of the evening was made by Dr. Maximilian Herzog.</p>
   <p>Herzog's Address</p>
   <p>Dr. Herzog said in his speech that he had had the luck to be in Berlin during the days when the Kaiser spoke those memorable words: "I don't know parties any longer, I only know Germans." Then he had witnessed that wonderful enthusiasm and the overwhelming unity with which the German people girded for battle. Returning to the United States, he learned that the German-Americans in our country had also joined together closer than ever, and that they had expressed a spirit of unity and realized the necessity of unanimous co-operation. He hoped that the Germans in our city would back up Robert M. Sweitzer, candidate of the Democratic party, in the coming municipal elections without a dissenting vote, because his past career was a guarantee that he would make a diligent, competent, and absolutely honest mayor for the city. Coming from moderate <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>circumstances, as the son of a German immigrant, Sweitzer had worked his way up in the business world. Elected to the office-of county clerk four years ago, he had turned a deficit of twenty-five thousand dollars into a surplus of seventy-five thousand dollars, and otherwise had discharged the duties of his office in an excellent manner. His past career as a businessman, as well as a public official, justified the best hopes for his future activities. Sweitzer had been nominated for mayor as the German-American candidate by his party. It was the duty of every German-American to vote for a man like him. The German-Americans must absolutely stick together, particularly in times like the present, and any Germans who would prefer an Anglo-American candidate to a German-American one of the splendid reputation and excellent qualities of a Robert M. Sweitzer were downright traitors to the German cause. Since a German-American, against whom no objections whatever could be raised, and who had everything in his favor, happened to be a candidate, and since his party nominated him as a German-American, it was of vital necessity for the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>German element of our city to elect this man. His defeat would be a defeat, nay, a calamity for the German element, not only of our city but of the entire country, because Sweitzer's candidacy was of a significance reaching far beyond the environs of Chicago. All over the country he was looked upon as the German candidate for mayor of the second largest metropolis of the Union. His defeat would be advertised as a defeat of Germans and as an indication of weakness and insignificance by those who wished us evil. Therefore, the speaker concluded. "It is the sacred duty of every good German to vote for Robert M. Sweitzer in this election, and to promote his cause by every possible means."</p>
