   <p>About 1000 persons met last night in the "Vorwarts" Athletic Hall to commemorate the "martyrs" who were hanged on Nov. 11, 1887.</p>
   <p>Policemen were present but remained quiet and did not interfere with the speakers, although some, for instance H. Weissmann, the editor of the New York Bakers Journal, tiraded against capitalism and the state. This reminded one of their former actions.</p>
   <p>During Weissmann's speech, however, Police-inspector Hubbard and Lieutenent Gibbons, followed by a number of policemen in civil clothing, went upon the plat-form, and commanded them to raise the American flag among the red flags, which were to be seen everywhere.</p>
   <p>At first the masses hissed, but soon they submitted and the American flag was raised among the signs of the red revolution.</p>

   <p>Lucy Parsons interrupted the procedure and called out wildly: "Hang the murderer of my husband:" and, proud of her heroism, she remained quietly upon her chair.</p>
   <p>Another speaker followed Weissmann, namely, R. Reitzel, the editor of the "Poor Devils".</p>
