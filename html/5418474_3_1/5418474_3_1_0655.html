   <p>The representatives of the social Turnverein, the gymnasium teachers in particular, since they managed the festivities at the Lincoln Turnhall last Sunday, deny that the presentation of the living picture symbolized as a glorification of anarchism, and they also assert that no insult or contumely has been heaped on the American flag. The portrayal depicted a scene from the French Revolution. Whatever it may be, the display was abnoxious to many and could readily be regarded as pro-anarchist. Since Americans are very prone to ascribe all anarchistic activities to the Germans, the German clubs should refrain from such questionable conduct, as it only serves to nurture American hatred for foreigners. It is claimed that the local authorities of the district will delve into the matter.</p>
