   <p>The Staats Zeitung has the following: "In case of Garfield's election, we will have a president who can converse with his German-American fellow-citizens in their mother tongue, as well as in English. Garfield has studied the German language thoroughly and speaks it fluently.</p>
   <p>"We certainly can not be accused of German know-nothingism when we are proud that the second language of the republic will be spoken in the White House just as well as the first. Among the former presidents of the United States, there was but one who had mastered the German language to the same extent as our coming president, and he was the highly educated John Quincy Adams. At that time, an extensive knowledge of languages was of but little importance; because the number of Germans living in the United States during his presidential term (1825-1829) was but very limited. Mr. Adams' advantages for studying the German language were by far superior to those of Mr. Garfield. From childhood on, he received an excellent education at home, as well as in the best educational institutions of Europe; whereas our poor farmer, carpenter and canal-boat boy, Garfield, could only acquire his splendid education under almost insurmountable difficulties.</p>

   <p>"Excepting John Quincy Adams, no president of the United States spoke German. Martin Van Buren stuffed himself with a few German phrases for his trip through Europe in 1853-1855. James Buchanan had an opportunity to pick up a few words of Pennsylvania German in his home county, Lancaster. Our good President Hayes studied German under an Ohio country preacher, but hardly progressed any further than the usual salutation "wie gehts". But Garfield studied the language with his customary thoroughness and in conversation with his German fellow-citizens, he always prefers to speak it.</p>
