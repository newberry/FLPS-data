   <p>The German Republicans of this city met Saturday night and organized a club for the campaign of 1880.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were adopted, declaring that in the opinion of German-American Republicans, the Chicago convention should nominate for president and vice-president men of known honesty, integrity and ability; that it would be injudicious at this time to nominate Gen. U. S. Grant; and that the first choice of the German Republicans is E. B. Washburn.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were also adopted, pledging the support of the club to the nominee of the national, state and county conventions.</p>
