   <p>Any one who is not voting on Election day is not worthy of any privilege in the U.S.A.</p>
   <p>The person who would sooner work on Election day than do his duty as a voter is only helping the other parties.</p>
   <p>Do not betray yourself and listen to the capitalist newspapers, you only hurt yourself by doing so. Anybody who allows himself to be afraid of voting is a coward. Never in history has an alderman been so honest, so loyal and so considerate as our Socialist Alderman, Edelrein. Both parties Republican and Democrat have been trying in every way to defeat him. Therefore everybody should do his duty and help to re-elect him again.</p>
