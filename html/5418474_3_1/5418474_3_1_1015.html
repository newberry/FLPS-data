   <p>A large number of the Northside Socialists have already some few weeks ago, put a petition against Kaufmann, into circulation. The petition has been signed by many citizens which, Alderman Meier of the 16th Ward in the capacity, as a member of the legislative body of the state, submitted to the governor. But the influence of the politicians was strong, and the signed petition did not receive any consideration.</p>
   <p>A renewed agitation against Kaufmann took place, Democrats and Republicans, Non-Partisans and Socialists, all united in the accusation against Kaufmann.</p>
   <p>Only the German capitalistic Press as usual, has not been in accord with the citizens.</p>
   <p>Amongst other things, discrediting Kaufmann, are excess taxes paid, (for his own benefit.) A Judge against whom there is so much agitation which come from all classes of people should resign.</p>

   <p>they would provide employment for every worker; furthermore, they would see to it that no one would labor longer than six or eight hours per day; then, that all the corpulent gentlemen still living (those who had not been killed) would pay all of the taxes; and that the state (whatever that is) would confiscate the "machinery" of the "fat citizens" and operate it for the benefit of labor; and so forth.</p>
   <p>But the realization of this delightful but foolish dream can, of course, not be possible unless the communists control the entire state instead of merely the city; and, since they cannot do that, they must be satisfied with what their "Irish" and "Kentucky" bosses give them. [Translator's note: "Kentucky bosses" refers to Mayor Harrison of Chicago, who came from Kentucky, according to a previous article.]</p>
   <p>What then can they achieve? Probably the following:</p>
   <p>1) They will be given such public work as is available: street paving, sewer construction, street cleaning. This is very nice and satisfactory in as far as <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>we are concerned. All that will be required to furnish them this work is money. As the city has not enough funds it will be necessary to levy a special assessment on all properties adjoining the streets where the work is to be performed. Nothing wrong about that. But, if the City Council decides on a special assessment and the majority of the taxpayers assessed are opposed to it, then the City Council's action must be approved by the courts before the levy can be collected. The taxpayers in question might find it difficult to obtain a court decision favorable to their interests if it is to be given by Democratic judges who stick to precedents. As Judge McAllister decided that the state has no right to compel children to attend school if the parents object, so he might also declare that the city has no right to compel property owners on a certain street to put in sewers, pave the street, and so forth.</p>
   <p>Granted that the verdict favors the administration and the work is to be started (at the expense of residents whose property faces the respective streets), then it is highly probable that, for every nine Irish bums receiving a job, one German communist would be given one. No more. If the German communists are <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>given one tenth of the jobs, then that will be contrary to precedent; as a rule the Irish Democrats not only want everything in sight--but even more.</p>
   <p>2) They will be given work in the construction of new schools and bathhouses if the money can be obtained.</p>
   <p>3) The main thing is that a number of the communist leaders will receive political jobs. Of course, these cannot be "swell" jobs--the profitable positions will already have been given to the fellows from Kentucky and to the Irish; but a few jobs of low order on the police force, or in the fire department, or in the City Administration's branches may fall to the Communists. They could be appointed bridge tenders, janitors, etc. Then, also, some honorary position--a nonpaying job on the School Board, for instance, might be handed out. Harry Rubens would do well on such a job.</p>
   <p>4)....There is no fourth class of jobs for the communists in sight: We know of nothing more. The changing of the state, the elimination of "capitalistic <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>production methods", the outlawing of inheritances; the introduction of income taxes, which will take away from the "fat citizen" whatever he earns in excess of a common factory worker's pay for an eight-hour day's work; the confiscation of machinery and equipment by the State: all this nonsense is beyond the power and jurisdiction of the city. To build air castles is a harmless pleasure; but trying to realize ambitions with insufficient means is ridiculous.</p>
   <p>And for that reason one is very glad that the communists have an opportunity now to try out their schemes and find out what ones will work and what ones are nonsensical. Perhaps, they may finally reach the standpoint of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung; the latter will be perfectly satisfied if the previously enumerated goals can be attained, including the third, since the Illinois Staats-Zeitung would rather see German communists given the still available jobs, than see these places filled by Irishmen.</p>
   <p>We particularly favor public improvements, especially sewers in the neglected districts occupied by the working people. Of course, in those instances where <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>a workingman owns the house he lives in, he, in common with the "fat citizen" would have to pay for the cost of improvements in his district. We also favor more public schools and the building of bathing houses. These are all sensible suggestions which well-meaning citizens will gladly support; provided of course, that the money for these purposes is to be obtained in a legal manner.</p>
   <p>Of course, there are legal problems involved as far as the money question is concerned. According to court decisions, the city cannot advance money on future tax collections; and, as long as some "despised capitalist" does not advance cash, and as long as the city has no other means of collecting taxes than by obtaining, through court action, title to all land upon which taxes are delinquent, and which does not yield a dime--the city simply has no money.</p>
   <p>But if it is possible to change "black into white" with the aid of Democratic judges--and so eliminate the present legal obstacles and enable the city to obtain a few million dollars for public works--then we will be perfectly satisfied.</p>
   <p>If our sewer systen should be extended, more streets paved and additional lights <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>installed, then our city could support a debt of eighteen million dollars more easily than the present indebtedness of thirteen million dollars.</p>
