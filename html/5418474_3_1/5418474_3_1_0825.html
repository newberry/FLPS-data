   <p>"The Club Freiheit (Freedom) held an agitation meeting in its local at 202 E. Van Buren St. Comrade Reifschneider presided. The meeting was especially well attended. Comrade Kobitsch delivered a lecture on the subject "Can the Worker hope for any relief from serfdom through religion?"</p>
   <p>The speaker showed in a very thorough presentation how religion must give way when man begins to think independently, for knowledge is the deadly enemy of Faith--- The speaker declared that socialism is the new religion that preaches freedom, fraternity and justice and should be considered as the saviour of the worker from present day conditions; and he requested that all those present should so far as possible spread the doctrine of socialism."</p>
   <p>"The speaker earned much applause--"</p>
