   <p>Co-workers And Friends:</p>
   <p>You are all aware, that the "Union" of the Stockyard Workers, known as the "United Workmen" has been founded on January 19th. The constitution was read and accepted because of the provision that no official is enabled to cheat or perpetrate frauds. The aforementioned Union is to remain independent and will not be associated with other Unions, as many newspapers asserted. Initiation fee is $1.00 but, will be increased after April 1st. A sickness-pension fund has also been started. All co-workers who wish to assure their own welfare and create a safe human existence for themselves, should be present at the coming mass-meeting, Sunday, 3 PM. at the Freiheit Turnhalle (Liberty Turnhall) 3609-11 S. Halsted Street and join this Union, as only in organization can we achieve <span class="page-break">\2</span>salvation from the "Exploitation Class". Do you know that capitalists are thoroughly organized to decrease the workers' wages, to maintain the price of products at a high level and to subdue the small business man forever? Demonstrate next Sunday, prove that you are men, or that you already feel the slave-jacket, which has been pulled over your ears.</p>
   <p>Come ye all, old and young.</p>
