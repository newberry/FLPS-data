   <p>The communists are getting noisy again. Their defeat at the last election seems to have had very little effect upon their impudence, and they are again in the field to carry on a wordy warfare against the present state of society. Their defeat has taught them one lesson, however. They have learned that wild, incendiary speeches and tumultuous processions to the courthouse are not the means by which to increase their ranks; that, on the contrary, some of their warmest friends have left them on that account, and that a different plan has to be followed. After long deliberations, their principal leaders determined to initiate the example of their brethren in Germany, who, by a cooler and more systematic agitation among the working classes, have already succeeded in sending several representatives to parliament. These results were mainly due to the publication of daily papers, edited by able men, who not only understood how to expound the principles of Ferdinand Lasalle and Carl Marx, but who also knew how to make their papers interesting and attractive to the general reader. This example to communists of Chicago is desirous to follow, and for that purpose a meeting was called for yesterday afternoon to the place of Carl Klings, on South Market Street.</p>
   
   <p>The meeting was very well attended by representatives of every section in this city, who conducted their deliberations as enthusiastically as ever. Mr. Rubert Mueller officiated as chairman, Mr. John Simmen acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>The object of the meeting having been stated, the publication committee reported on the prosperity of the Vorbote, the present organ of the workingmen's party. It appeared that with a little support from the sections the paper will be able to pull along for awhile yet, at least. The committee also proposed the establishment of a German morning daily.</p>
   <p>The proposition was received with great applause and brought out quite a number of speakers, every one of whom commended the project.</p>
   <p>Mr. Helmerdag was the principal advocate of the enterprise. He showed that the German reading public was thoroughly disgusted with the Staats-Zeitung and the other German papers, and that these sheets were only supported for want of something better. Their conduct during the last political campaign had increased the dissatisfaction, and a more appropriate moment for the establishment of a great opposition paper could not very well be imagined.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Klings spoke in the same strain. What the German population wanted was a good morning paper, ably edited, and conducted in the interests of the community, and not only in those of the proprietors and the corrupt politicians.</p>
   <p>The proposition was finally adopted unanimously, and it was resolved to issue stock to the amount of $20,000 and to appoint a committee of seven with instructions to prepare a prospectus, and submit the same to the next meeting. Messrs. Klings, Hel-merdag, Simmen, Methua, Kelting, Winnen,and Finkensieber were elected members of that committee.</p>
   <p>A proposition was further made to celebrate the anniversary of the organization of the party (the 18th day of January) by a great festival, and to devote the proceedings to the publication fund. This motion was also carried by a unanimous vote. The arrangements for the festival were intrusted to the following committee: Messrs. Muller, Methua, and Simmen.</p>
   <p>The meeting thereupon adjourned.</p>
   <p>It is understood that the stock for the new paper will find heavy takers. A wealthy farmer by the name of J. Krueger has declared his willingness to subscribe $2,000; Mr. Robert Mueller $1,000; Mr. Simmen $500, and so on. The newspaper is to make its first appearance on the first day of February, and it is asserted that an able journalist from New York, who was prominently connected with the press of Germany, is ready to assume the editorial chair. The leaders propose to make their organ a newspaper fully equal and even superior in every respect to the Staats-Zeitung, of this city, and intend to bestow great care on the news and commercial departments.</p>
