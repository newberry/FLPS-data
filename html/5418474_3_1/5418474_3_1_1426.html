   <p>The Democrats of the Northtown intend to nominate the well known German manufacturer, Adolph Sturm, as a candidate for the Assessor's office and they hope that he will accept it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sturm without doubt would prove a very strong candidate. For the office of collectors it is intended to put up the former election commissioner Henry Schomer.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Northtown Convention will take palce Monday, March 11 at 10 o'clock A.M. in the Northside Gymnastic Hall. The primary election will be held on March 8. The German Citizen's Club of the 9th Ward will hold a massmeeting next Wednesday in Doerner's Hall corner of 14th and Throop Streets.</p>
