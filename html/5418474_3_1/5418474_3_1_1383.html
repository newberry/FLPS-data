   <p>The Executive Committee of the "United Societies for Local Independence" held its monthly meeting last night. A resolution was adopted that every member of the city council, which would side in with the Prohibitionists, will not receive any votes for re-election in Spring. Furthermore the United Societies will sponsor only candidates, who proved to be reliable friends of the United Societies in its fight against religious fanatics and enemies of personal freedom in Chicago.</p>
