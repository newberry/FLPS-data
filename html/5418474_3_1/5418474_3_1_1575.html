   <p>Forward for action! Electors! Open the battle against corruption along the whole line! Man for man, you must fight against the corrupt councils for your rights and for your honor! It is not enough to prove to the council that a shameful election fraud has been committed in the 7th Precinct against the majority of the electors, but this must be proved to the population of the whole town and to the tribunal by everybody doing his duty. The actually elected Alderman of the 14th Ward, Mr. Frank A. Stauber, can regain his seat in the town council and you will attain your rights. How can this be done? Everybody should come down Thursday evening, August 5, from 7 to 9 o'clock to No. 724 Milwaukee Avenue, (next to Stauber's business premises) and listen to what must be done to defeat fraud and bring the betrayers before the law.</p>
