   <p>The confederation of athletics considered yesterday some of the most important problems, which were scheduled to come before the conference. The discussion about the question, whether or not the confederation should take a definite stand against the anarchist movement, and which had been expected with considerable suspense, took place yesterday afternoon. It led to a long, interesting, and, for the most part, orderly debate, which ended in a victory for the conservative element. It also voted with a definite majority in favor of accepting a resolution, recommended by the delegates from Wisconsin to condemn anarchism outright.</p>
   <p>This declaration will, no doubt, remove the fatal issue, which has been used by the English Press to disparage the German element of the population, and which also has caused a serious discord among the members.</p>
