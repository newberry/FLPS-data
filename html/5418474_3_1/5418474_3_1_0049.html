   <p>In the large salon of Brand's Hall, a jovial crowd congregated to enjoy the German Waiters' Club's great annual masquerade. There were numerous original and splendid masks.</p>
   <p>The dance program which consisted of eighteen numbers, was temporarily interrupted so that dinner could be served to all participants.</p>
   <p>The bar also obtained liberal patronage, and throughout the night till the grey dawn of the approaching morning, the crowd appeared well content.</p>
