   <p>Der Wirth's Verein (tavern-keepers union) held a large meeting yesterday afternoon in the Vorwarts Turner Hall, under the auspices of John Feldkamp. Louis Schurichow proposed that 1,200 invitations be sent to the Wirth convention to be held here on September 21. The program of this convention will be regarding the aldermen of the wards and their attitude towards our business. Remember that both Cullerton and Curran, from the 6th Ward, are rather dangerous men and should not have the support of our organization.</p>
