   <p>The undersigned citizens recommend that the citizenry in general, regardless of party affiliation, vote for Wilhelm C. Seipp, candidate for city treasurer, because he is known to us as a trustworthy, honorable, reliable, and ambitious young man, who does not seek the office, but who considers it a paramount duty as well as honor to serve the community by faithfully administering the public funds entrusted to him further, we endorse him because a large party requested him to serve. The undersigned hereby pledge themselves to vote for W.C. ii on election day and to support him to the best of their ability prior to that time.....[Translator's note: The names of which there are 132, are omitted in translation.]</p>
