   <p>A clarion call of distress characteristic and significant when one considers how the patient public is given daily doses of assurance by the Fifer party managers, that our "German Brethren" would not even dream of deserting the Republicans - came to the ears of Jamieson and associates yesterday, to the very men who have vouched to save the fatherland and Fifer.</p>
   <p>The call for help came from Grundy County, home of Vice-Governor-candidate Ray, and the messenger of the ominous news was W. L. Sackett, editor of the Morris-Herald, one of the most acrid Secret Society Publications, the mouthpiece of Ray. He came as the ambassador of the terrified Grundy County Republicans to tell the State Central Committee at the Grand Pacific Hotel, that the Germans in the German Townships deliberately announce their intention of voting for the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>Everything has been tried in those localities to change their attitude, but <span class="page-break">2</span>to no avail. If nothing extra-ordinary can be accomplished, then thousands of Germans will be alienated from the Republican party. The party should send a prominent German speaker into that county, it might help a bit. Heads went into a huddle, the Republican list of German speakers was scanned, but the sought-for subject was not found, so it was agreed to telegraph an urgent request to Richard Guenther, General Consul to Mexico, temporarily sojourning at his home in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sally instantaneously towards Grundy County and talk a little German for Fifer and Ray.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Bureau.</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the week the inscription: "Central bureau of the German Democrats for Cleveland, Stevenson and Altgeld," will appear over the portals of 167 Washington St., and at these quarters lively political actions are bound to develop within the ensuing weeks. The executives of the German Central Association held a meeting yesterday, at the Metropolitan Block, and decided to rent two large rooms on the first floor, in the 167 Washington St. Bldg., contiguous to the Staats-Zeitung Bldg.</p>
   <p>Mr. Emil Karpowsky of the Staats-Zeitung was elected to the secretarial post <span class="page-break">3</span>for naturalization, registration and information on political matters, while Mr. Eugene N. Bellar, editor of the Luxemburger Unabhaengiges Wochenblatt (Luxemburger Independent Weekly) was made secretary of ward organization activities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bellar's duties will be to create German organizations in all wards which have a fair percentage of Germans and likewise in rural districts, in order to interest them in this political combat and the important questions associated with it. Mr. Karpowsky's job is to superintend the naturalization of the Germans, to see to it, that no German name shall be missing in the voting list on registration day, and to provide desired information to ward clubs, etc. The inquiries or rather, census will be conducted from house to house, in all districts, wards, and precincts where Germans live; it will be entrusted to people who are living in the neighborhood and therefore know the locality.</p>
   <p>Congressman Cable and Secretary Nelson promised, that the State and National Bureau will supply all necessary election literature to the German organization, since it has the advantage of being an independent, exclusively German managed and supported affair. The two secretaries of the Executive <span class="page-break">4</span>and Central Association, Messrs. Berblinger and Thiele, will also have their offices in the German Bureau; surely, the organization cannot complain about an insufficiency of efficient help.</p>
   <p>A committee of six, Messrs. Lieb, Haerting, Hoechster, Stern; Goldzier, and Senff, have been requested to issue a proclamation to the German people and the Central Association will give it adequate publicity in the newspapers and also print thousands of copies of it, which will be sent throughout the land. This declaration will contain an exhaustive treatise on the tariff, coinage (silver) and the school question from the Democratic standpoint; also the aspect of personal liberty, one of the tenets of which received considerable and proper attention during the recent convention, will be given extensive elucidation in this pamphlet.</p>
   <p>The German Democrats are in a fortunate position; they can discuss the two questions just as unrestrictedly as the tariff problem and are not compelled to soft pedal it by referring to it as "ancient history." They can peruse the schemes of the present, they need not unearth and quote the deeds of their fathers, 30 years ago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The "German Union" (Republican) cannot afford such an introspection. This "Call to the People" will only be signed by bona fide Germans who actually read it, - Germans, temporarily residing in Europe are barred.</p>
   <p>General Lieb will communicate with Carl Schurz, in order to induce this famous speaker to address a mass meeting.</p>
   <p>In order to admonish the Germans who have the cause at heart, we append the registration dates; time is precious.</p>
   <p>1st day - Oct. 18th</p>
   <p>2nd "- " 25th</p>
   <p>Revision "- " 29th ---</p>
   <p>Fred Forch now faces serious competition from Max Eberhardt, police court judge, who appears as a judicial candidate. That Mr. Eberhardt would be suitable timber for that office is universally conceded; he is a lawyer, a very erudite man, who can point to an exceptionally honorable past as a public official. The belief prevailed however, that he should not be <span class="page-break">6</span>nominated as he was merely a judge of the police court, but that opinion seems to have subsided now....</p>
   <p>Various Items.</p>
   <p>... Julius Goldzier will probably be endorsed by the People's Party. On Thursday evening, German-American citizens will meet at Warnecke's Hall, at Siegel and Sedgwick Streets, to organize the 22nd Ward Cleveland - Altgeld Club.</p>
   <p>The Executives of the Democratic County Central Committee have resolved to levy a 6% tax upon the total income which the candidates may derive from their official salaries, if elected.</p>
