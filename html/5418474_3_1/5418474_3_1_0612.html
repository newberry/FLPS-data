   <p>Mayor Washburne and the chief of police, McClaughry, deserve recognition and praise for their decisive action against the anarchists here, whose behavior has again become repulsive.</p>
   <p>It is indeed deplorable that the conservative English-American Press, the organ of the Democratic party, condemns the decisive measures of these Republican officials. The worst offender is, of course, the Chicago Times, under the new leadership of C. H. Harrison. Instead of remembering with sorrow and regret that, due to his continued clemency and indulgency as Mayor toward the anarchists, he promoted their cause indirectly until it culminated in the catastrophy of May 4, 1886, he still goes on, bitterly attacking the present administration, because, remembering the results of those destructive teachings on that day, they do not choose to make the same mistake as did the Harrison administration.</p>
   <p>The measures taken by the present local administration are not only just and right, but they are also humane. It is necessary to "nip in the bud" the madness of anarchism before it can contaminate the better labor-movements, and thereby weaken and poison them inwardly.</p>

   <p>Severe measures against anarchists is a protection for inexperienced and simple people and also for the radical and irritated masses, who are in danger of being induced to take violent action by their bloodthirsty leaders.</p>
   <p>Anarchism in itself can not be tolerated by any civilized society. It is aiming to destroy all social and governmental institutions, even condemning the most radical and socialistic order because they do not aim at complete lawlessness.</p>
   <p>The present local administration merits the approval of the whole civilized world, and in particular the deep gratitude of the great majority of the citizens of Chicago irrespective of party affiliation. This includes the overwhelming majority of the Democrats, who condemn C. H. Harrison's attitude just as strongly as do the Republicans and the Independents.</p>
