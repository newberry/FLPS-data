   <p>A few years ago, the Department of Labor announced its intention to take a census of the unemployed. After a few years of thinking it over, of delays and indecision, they have finally and definitely made up their minds to proceed, and their decision has been officially communicated to the eager public. As to the reason for the delay, the public is left to its own conjectures. At the head of the Department is a lady, Frances Perkins. It is the acknowledged and inalienable privilege of ladies to change their opinions, and it is likely that Frances Perkins made use of this privilege. Nothing can be said against that.</p>
   <p>The census of the unemployed is to be taken chiefly by "white-collar" people clerks, salesmen, salesladies, bookkeepers, agents, and other persons of similar occupations who, in most instances, earn their modest living honestly <span class="page-break">2</span>and by hard work, and who have been just as hard hit by the depression as their fellow workingmen who gain their daily bread by the labor of their hands. The "white-collar" people have been treated by the government like stepchildren, as far as providing them with work is concerned, and that is why it was high time that at least some of them should be given employment in the taking of the census.</p>
   <p>These good people were joyful when they heard of the proposed work; they brushed up their threadbare coats, renewed the crease in their trousers, washed the last well-preserved soft collar and hung it over the mirror, in accordance with the ancient approved method, and were prepared for the great day. Up until now the day has not arrived. The Department of Labor is not yet ready, and has given, until now, nothing but evasive answers to inquiries by the press. At last it felt a compelling urge to come out with the truth.</p>
   <p>This time, Frances Perkins is not to blame for the delay. When the decision to take the census was made, and when the money to defray the expenses <span class="page-break">3</span>was granted, the Department had to decide on the form in which the census would be taken--that is, what questions would be submitted to the unemployed. Before steps were taken to print the questionnaires, the Department turned to various other departments of the government, inquiring of them what questions they would like to ask the unemployed. It seems that Frances Perkins had heard something about the close co-operation between departments and she, for one, would not want to lag behind in the carrying out of this excellent principle.</p>
   <p>The persons who gave the answers to the questions asked by the Department of Labor were, we regret to say, professional reformers and so-called social workers. They sent in such enormous quantities of scatterbrained proposals that the Department of Labor has not yet worked through these mountains of inanities. The questions suggested by the reformers and social workers have only an extremely loose relation to the purpose of the census. They are, in fact, so remote from it that a normal person cannot conceive how people can have such harebrained ideas.</p>

   <p>One of these world reformers, for instance, suggested that the census takers should ascertain how far the home of the unemployed is from the next telephone pole. Numerous questions were in a similar vein. We must bear in mind that the suspicion that the reformer wanted to spy on the unemployed is completely unjustified. Their intentions are undoubtedly good. But they are professionally defective. They are harmless, but stupid.</p>
