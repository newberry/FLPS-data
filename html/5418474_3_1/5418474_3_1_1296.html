   <p>The final week of the election campaign for mayor, which started yesterday, sees the Republican candidate William Hale Thompson completely on the defensive, and his German Democratic opponent Robert M. Sweitzer, making victorious advances all along the line. While only eight or ten days ago it would seem as if the Republican candidate was gaining ground, the past week has brought him heavy reverses, which have had a decided effect on the German voters and caused them to rally to the support of the German candidate of the Democratic Party, Robert M. Sweitzer. The two factors, which hit the German voters like an ice-cold shower, were the report that William Hale Thompson and his campaign manager, James A. Pugh, had openly sided with England and other enemies of Germany when war broke out and, secondly, Thompson's endorsement by the Prohibitionists, who are organized in the County Voters' League. Especially the news that Thompson, and his <span class="page-break">\2</span>campaign manager, Pugh, last September had offered the English their [Pugh's] fifty thousand dollar motorboat Disturber IV, the fastest boat of its kind, for reconnaissance purposes, was felt like a slap in the face by Chicago's German element. The candidate had tried to bait the German voters by a German campaign committee and by German campaign buttons bearing the inscription:'Unser Wilhelm fuer Buergermeister' [Our William for Mayor]. Then, suddenly, came the report of his taking England's side against Germany.</p>
   <p>Liberals Are Scared Away</p>
   <p>Not any less revolting to the German voters was Thompson's indorsement by the Prohibitionists. The Republican candidate had always posed as what is called a "sport" and a liberal, and his indorsement by the enemies of liberalism was a great disappointment to those of his followers, who had expected a liberal administration from him. It was obvious that the price for the <span class="page-break">\3</span>support by the Prohibitionists had been his promise to remain either neutral in next year's decisive battle between the liberals and the enemies of all liberal movements, or to support the latter actively. This added significance to the fact that today's mayoralty campaign is merely an opening skirmish for the battle the Prohibitionists are going to wage next year with the purpose of making Chicago dry. The liberal elements were rudely awakened, as they were not yet aware of the seriousness of their situation, and it was made clear to them that with Thompson as Mayor and as protege of the Prohibitionists, next year's fight for a liberal Chicago would be infinitely harder.</p>
   <p>Thompson Mob Changes Tactics</p>
   <p>Both incidents did not fail to have their effects on the voters. That Thompson's followers were equally aware of these effects can be seen by the fact that they changed their tactics and injected a maliciousness and animosity into the campaign which have never been equalled. The religious issue, which they so <span class="page-break">\4</span>far had exploited against Sweitzer only surreptitiously, was brought out into the open yesterday. This step met with Thompson's fullest approval. Politicians yesterday declared that it may turn out to become a two-edged weapon.</p>
   <p>Sweitzer Making Headway</p>
   <p>The beginning of the final campaign week marks a rise in the chances for the German candidate for mayor, Robert M. Sweitzer. There is every indication that his Republican opponent is constantly losing ground. But regardless of how excellent Sweitzer's chances are for the moment, his campaign managers do not mean to relax their efforts. They realize that the underhanded methods of Thompson's followers, especially as far as the religious issue is concerned, could not help but score some sort of success, and that it would take earnest efforts to offset this. They will give special attention to the German voters. Although all indications point to a victory for Sweitzer, <span class="page-break">\5</span>they will keep on plugging. The campaign managers of the German candidate will try especially to make it clear to the German voters that a victory for Sweitzer would be regarded in the entire country as a victory for the "Deutschtum", his defeat a defeat for them.</p>
   <p>Thompson's Campaign Collapses</p>
   <p>"Thompson's Campaign is getting to be a smear-campaign", was the verdict of Henry Stuckart, campaign manager of Robert M. Sweitzer, as he surveyed the campaign tactics of the Republican candidate for mayor yesterday. Referring to a Thompson rally in St. Adalbert School, where religious, national, and political problems were mixed together, Stuckart pointed to the incongruity of the announcements of the campaign management of the Republican candidate with the actual state of affairs. He recalled that Republican leaders of national prominence, United States Senators and House members, had been announced as speakers for the final campaign week, but that nothing had been heard of them to date. He also pointed out that Thompson's campaign <span class="page-break">\6</span>managers had declared that businessmen of excellent reputation would come out for Thompson and that professional politicians from the camp of William Lorimer would form the nucleus of his shock troops. "We were informed", said Stuckart, "that the Republican party stood united behind Thompson. Instead, Republicans by the dozen volunteer their services for Sweitzer, claiming that every fifth Republican would vote for him. One after another the campaign lies, spread by the Thompson crowd, fall to the ground. The hypocrisy of their candidate becomes more and more obvious. As soon as the Thompson campaign was dragged into daylight it collapsed by itself".</p>
