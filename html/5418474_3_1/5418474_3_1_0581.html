   <p>The inauguration of new officials of the West Side Social Labor Society took place during the organization's last meeting, a festive ceremony at which Mr. Christian Muth, former president of the society, officiated. In his speech, Mr. Muth put special emphasis on the fact that the society's financial status was extremely discouraging when organized almost half a century ago. Nevertheless, anticipating a bright future and the goal before us, we commenced dutifully upon our task. But, since those anxious days of nearly fifty years ago, this organization has developed into one of the wealthiest societies in Chicago. This was not a mere coincidence; it was the result of honest and economic administration in conjunction with the faithful services of its officials Difficult problems and great responsibilities are now facing the newly elected president. It is our sincere wish that the newly inaugurated officials may prove themselves worthy of the confidence placed in them by members of this association. They will have a chance to evidence their sincerity as well as showing their real interest in the welfare of the organization.</p>
