   <p>Senator Lewis was elected in Chicago by a majority of 410,043 votes, and in the County districts with 56,672 votes, which proves that the results surpassed even the most optimistic prophecies of the Lewis headquarters; after which the Senator was able with a majority of 466,715 votes in Cook County, to face the results of the down-state election in confidence.</p>
   <p>In those wards, which are thickly populated with citizens of German extraction, Lewis led at a ratio of three to one; in the 39th ward, five to one. Under these circumstances the supposition is justified, that the overwhelming majority of German-American electors did not pay much attention to the argument of the Mc Cormick bait that, "No German-American should sell his soul for a glass of beer," but courageously voted for Senator Lewis.</p>
