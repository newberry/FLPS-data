   <p>Our Chicago! With emphasis on the "our". And we have good reasons to be proud of it.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago we call it as good American citizens and true sons (and daughters) of the great Germanic tribe. We say it cheerfully and proudly, because Chicago is today the most typical German-American city, and, for this very reason, also the most pro-German and progressive metropolis of the country.</p>
   <p>Do we need any proof? Why, evidences are as plentiful as sand by the seashore and as convincing as the shells of the Big Berthas [heavy German gun]! These evidences are so obvious and so familiar that anybody can recognize them, and we do not have to mention them in detail.</p>

   <p>All one has to do is to keep one's eyes and ears open, on the "L" and in the streetcars, in the stores and any other place where people gather, and one will find out pretty quick--if one didn't know it yet--what people are thinking in this American metropolis of the Middle West.</p>
   <p>You will find less anti-German sentiment here than snow on the Fourth of July, and the eastern Anglophile who would come here, perchance, to study public opinion, would hide his Anglomania in a remote corner of his heart, and apply the maxim, "when in Rome do as the Romans". A friend of Great Britain and her motley Allies may find a little consolation, here and there, by perusing the columns of the so-called world press of our city. But his pleasure will be short lived, because if he is capable of any judgment at all, he will realize in no time that woodenheadedness and density of mind are the outstanding characteristics of our English press-a typically English stupidity, the outgrowth of British megalomania. The visitor from the East will also notice that our English press is learning fast, that it is becoming more genuinely <span class="page-break">\3</span>American from day to day, and that soon it will be as American as their British heritage permits them to be--thanks to the pressure of public opinion.</p>
   <p>On the eastern seaboard things are supposed to be different. This also applies in the large eastern cities. If that is true, we feel sorry for them. That makes us doubly glad of our true Americanism, especially us German-Americans; for to be a good American means today to be also pro-German. True Americans must hope for a victory of the German arms, because America's best interests, as well as the emotional interests--so to speak--of her most valuable citizens, are threatened by the same powers against which Germany and Austria-Hungary are now fighting. A German victory will safeguard the political future of this great Republic and will make it a glorious one; it will guarantee peace for a long time to come. If all this is not yet generally understood, it is because the best elements of the American people--the German-Americans, the Scandinavian Americans, the American Irish, Poles, and Bohemians--are not represented strongly enough in the <span class="page-break">\4</span>East to exercise the same influence upon public opinion as is the case here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago! We say it with pride and gratitude. We love our city; and we should show our appreciation and do our part to make Chicago physically and commercially the envy of all other American cities. We should set an example for them. We can do that by marking the three questions on the "little ballot" with "Yes". We sons and daughters of a city-building people, we citizens of the most German city of the country, owe it to our city of Chicago, to ourselves and our children, and last but not least, to the entire German element to vote for the public improvements which, when completed, will be the inestimable value to this city.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to vote "Yes" on the bond issue for the construction of a connecting boulevard between Chicago's North and South Side, and for the widening of Michigan Avenue; to vote "Yes" for the organization of a Forest <span class="page-break">\5</span>Preserve District in Cook County; to reply "Yes" to the question of whether the County shall borrow two million dollars from the state treasury for highway construction.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago fully deserves our cheerful and unconditional co-operation.</p>
