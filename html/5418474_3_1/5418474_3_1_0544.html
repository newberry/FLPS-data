   <p>The London representative of the Chicago Daily News writes from that city: "People here are realizing more and more that Bolshevism is not what the world has known heretofore as politics, but that it is a crime in the generally accepted sense of the word." Then he transmits an explanation given by a "responsible man from Whitehall": "The peculiar danger emanating from Bolshevism consists, in my opinion, in this, that it awakens the rapacious instincts of men. It teaches its adherents to abandon the wearisome process of working and to adopt the quicker process of robbing in order to obtain what they want. A more malicious and dangerous doctrine could hardly be conceived of, for it appeals to women and men who possess little or nothing (they constitute the great majority) to consider the forceful seizure of another's property right and just. In short Bolshevism turns all accepted ideas of right and justice topsy-turvy. It <span class="page-break">2</span>declares that everything which is considered to be legal and righteous is unlawful and wrong and terms everything that is looked upon as criminal, lawful and just. Of course, the basic idea is a deception. Robbery may flourish for a time, but soon there would be nobody from whom one night rob. Then even the Bolshevists would have to concede that mankind must either work or starve. Unfortunately, however, Bolshevism, before learning this lesson, would ruin our civilization, and millions of men and women would perish in the experiment."</p>
   <p>If this definition of Bolshevism is correct, then our country and people need have no fear. American men and women cannot be won over to this type of Bolshevism just as they cannot be persuaded to advocate suicide as a means of escaping all suffering of the present and as a precaution against future disappointments and misfortunes.</p>
   <p>Americans are a working people. The nonworkers, or drones, of the so- <span class="page-break">3</span>called upper class, and the shirkers, or tramps, of the lower class are merely exceptions, and comparatively rare exceptions. The American workmen, however, know the true value of their work. They are not only unsympathetic toward Bolshevism, but are also sworn enemies of Bolshevistic tenets. Organized labor of American, and the American labor movement strive toward improvement, and not toward destruction, toward progress and not toward retrogression, to which the Bolshevist experiment must lead, since it depends upon destruction. American labor looks to the future; it envisions better working conditions, better working hours, higher wages, and better adjustments. It looks upon the past, upon the road which it has traveled during the last decades, and notes that it has made great progress.</p>
   <p>It notices that it has advanced far, especially during the last ten years, without resorting to bloody battles or making sacrifices. And the way ahead is just as level and good when compared with the road already traveled; the future is like a shady lane which invites one to take a <span class="page-break">4</span>pleasant stroll. Will labor depart from this security and follow the will-o-the-wisp of Bolshevism?....</p>
   <p>Indeed it will not! Never! For labor knows better. It knows that work is the mother of success. Labor has won great success by working, and knows that future success may be attained by continuing upon the old road and not only avoiding, but also fighting, everything that savors of revolution and tends to disturb the very advantageous situation.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism is strange to American labor, especially organized labor. American labor movement does not engender Bolshevism. Moreover, in its own interest, it must oppose Bolshevism and everything which makes Bolsheviki. It makes war on exploitation and upon injustice in the social and political life of the nation, upon corruption and class favoritism, laws favoring certain classes and coercive laws. Labor opposes prohibition--must oppose it. For the judgment pronounced upon Bolshevism in <span class="page-break">5</span>the discussion above may be applied also to prohibition.</p>
   <p>While Bolshevism advocates the forceable seizure of other people's property, prohibition demands the illegal destruction of other people's property; prohibition prescribes that hundreds of thousands be deprived of their property, their work, their opportunity for gainful employment, and their personal liberty. So Bolshevism and prohibition are closely related. Prohibition, too, turns accepted conceptions of law and justice topsy-turvy. If our country tolerates prohibition, it is not very far from Bolshevism. For prohibition must beget rebels, rioters, revolutionaries, Bolsheviki, because it is opposed to right and justice and will nullify the basic laws of our country.</p>
