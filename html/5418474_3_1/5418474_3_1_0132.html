   <p>I. W. W. Convention</p>
   <p>Yesterday the city council voiced the opinion that meetings and conventions of the Industrial Workers of the World should not be permitted in Chicago. Alderman W. P. Steffen introduced a proposal ordering the mayor and the chief of police to report Wednesday to the police committee on the Industrial Workers of the World convention which is in session, and to disperse it as soon as an unlawful act is noticed. Steffen declared that it is a shame to permit such meetings in Chicago, which had previously suffered enough on account of meetings of notorious elements. There was strong opposition to his proposal. Aldermen Cullerton, Coughlin, L.B. Anderson, Schwartz, and Armitage stated that the whole matter should be disposed of by the committee. Thereupon Steffen's proposal was amended, and the council went on record as being against allowing the Industrial Workers of the World to hold meetings in Chicago.</p>
