   <p>The North Chicago Rolling Mill Company closed its plant yesterday with no expectation of reopening at any definite time.</p>
   <p>The close-out affected about 1,500 workers while about 300 have the privilege of cleaning the plant and keeping up with necessary repairs.</p>
   <p>The reason for shutting down is given as lack of incoming orders but at the same time the present political situation is brought into the lime-light to exert pressure on the supporters of free trade and play into the hands of the protective tariff adherents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It is the same old method which has always proved effective and is the cheapest for the exploiting class.</p>
   <p>The workers are simply told to vote for the protective tariff if they want to have any chance of reemployment and there is no other choice for them after having been out of work for some time.</p>
