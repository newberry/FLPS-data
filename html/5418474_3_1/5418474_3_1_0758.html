   <p>Co-workers! Once more we wish your attention. For years the "Lehr and Wehr Society" has endeavored to establish a closer contact with labor with a special purpose. to arm and thus enable them to resist and be victorious in shaking off the rule of the upper classes. Let us look at conditions as they are:</p>
   <p>The state of things at present are hopeless with worse to be expected in the future. Decrease in wages, enforced shorter working day and dismissals are daily reports. Suffering, despair and crime are the natural outcome of such conditions. Are we going to remain calm in the face of all this? We are a free nation--if the word "Republic" can be identified with the conception of "Freedom".</p>
   <p>The "free people" of Hookingthale give us a vivid picture of our much praised "freedom". When these "free people" refused to die a starvation death at work, then police and militia were dispatched to the place to show these "free people" with clubs and fire arms the difference between reality and illusion. But the citizens of Hocking Valley have a healthy conception; the lesson learned brought about the setting of mines afire, the destruction of railroad bridges and the night attack of Murray city which are unmistakable evidences.</p>
   
   <p>Can you workers of Chicago learn a lesson like that? Will you find it necessary to confront an armed enemy fully equipped? Or must a Hooking Valley with all of its brutality befall us first? We are not far from it. Chicago is supposed to have 35,000 unemployed with an additional 1800 from the rolling mills.--The city council resolved that 300 more clubs nightsticks should be added to the police...</p>
   <p>What is the meaning of this? It means--Hooking Valley! Workers, are you armed with revolvers? The city council knows what it is doing. The memory of eleven years ago, when the communists with 25,000 unemployed people marched onto the City Hall, is lasting. Neither did the City Council forget the relief riot of '77. Therefore the additional clubs. ... In the years of 1878-79 when the "Lehr and Wehr Society" grew so powerfully, we had years of bitter misery behind us, and the people never-the-less found it possible to acquire arms and to join our society; the driving power came of course from the wonderful effect of the bludgeon that then had broken a few dozen skull. Is it necessary that such experience should be repeated?</p>
   <p>We have little hope that our words of warning will find a willing ear, therefore the club will be brought into action again... Information about joining us can be obtained at the assembly-rooms of the "Lehr and Wehr Society".</p>
