   <p>The Group "Fraternity" (Briderlichkeit) held night before last in Lunke's Hall, corner Clybourn and Fullerton Avenues, its regular business meeting. Comrade Schmidt presided. Comrades Muller and Heger were appointed as Delegates to the General Committee. After finishing routine business, Comrade Schwab gave a short report about the origin of the local groups and the foundation and progress of the "International Workers' Association".</p>
   <p>Owing to the lateness of the hour, and as nobody was inclined to participate in debates, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
