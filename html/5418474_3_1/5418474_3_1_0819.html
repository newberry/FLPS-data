   <p>The Club "Vorwarts" (Forward) held its regular meeting yesterday evening. Comrade Neudek spoke about the events of the week. He pointed to the in-creased activities of the Russian Nihilists also of the Vienna Socialists. He declared that the assassinations of the Russian Bloodhounds and the Vienna Police spies were justified. In this country the mass discharges of the workingmen and the continuous reductions of wages must convince the workingmen, that the social system of today is very unjust and must be destroyed.</p>
   <p>The terrible mine disasters like the one in Colorado can only be attributed to the greed of the Capitalists, because they neglected the necessary precautionary measures for the sake of saving money.</p>
   <p>Comrade Neudek was elected a member of the committee of arrangements for the Commune festival.</p>
