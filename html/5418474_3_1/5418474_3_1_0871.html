Comrade Winnen held a lengthy speech on this theme, explaining that Nihilism is the consequence of Russian conditions. Of course the time has not come to adopt Russian agitation methods in America.</p>
   <p>The aims of the Russian Socialists are identical with those of other nations. Anarchism aims for the abolition of laws and absolute freedom for every individual; this is of course an impossibility. He spoke of the Anarchist manifesto, read at the Lyons trial, but very difficult for the average worker to understand. Socialism aims for orderly conditions and unity of the people. A debate followed the speech, in which opinions differed.</p>
