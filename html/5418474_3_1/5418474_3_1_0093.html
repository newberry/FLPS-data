   <p>We have often published items about the German bakers, who have good reasons to be dissatisfied with conditions prevailing in their trade. We append a statement from their committee which explains clearly the demands of the recently organized union.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned, in complying with the Chicago Bakers' Helpers' Union, herewith enclose a copy of the organization's resolutions. We should appreciate it very much if you would send an acknowledgement to the address given below.</p>
   <p>"The Bakers' Helpers' Union has resolved to eliminate the two outstanding evils in the trade; excessively long working hours and boarding at the employer's house. We therefore ask you that you notify your employees as soon as possible that you will discontinue boarding your help, and that you will pay them four dollars per week additional so that the men may obtain room and board elsewhere at their own expense.</p>
   <p>"This would eliminate all complaints from this source. By adopting this policy <span class="page-break">2</span>(as the English speaking bakers have done) the fair employers will avoid being placed in the same category with their inhuman competitors and will not suffer public disapproval. This request may be objected to by many employers, and if it is, that will be definite evidence that a reform is urgently needed.</p>
   <p>"It cannot be denied that there are ignorant and brutal bakery owners whose short comings cast a stigma on others. Particularly the better class of employers, those who are fair should discontinue the old system and with the help of the union compel their competitors to follow suit; that is the only way to avoid public disapproval.</p>
   <p>"Those bakers to whom this criticism does not apply do not make anything by boarding their help and can therefore well afford to discontinue the Practice. However, in the case of those who profit by furnishing room and board to their employees the complaints of the workers are justified. There can be no halfway measures. Therefore, let us do away with this room-and-board business altogether. Fair pay for fair work is a proper labor relationship.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Besides the reasonable demand detailed above the union also asks for the establishment of a twelve-hour day. Such a schedule can be adopted anywhere without loss to the business. This last request is surely so obviously well justified that no sensible, broad-minded employer will demur to it. We therefore ask that you inform us promptly about your decision in the matter, and if we do not hear from you by the sixteenth of this month, then we shall take it for granted that you abide by the demands of the union.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"The Labor Committee of the Chicago Bakers' Helpers' Union:</p>
   <p>George Christ</p>
