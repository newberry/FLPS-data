   <p>As an American citizen I protest most emphatically against the sentence imposed upon the anarchists, and here are the reasons why: First of all, it is to be considered the result of a cowardly court, fearing the existing prejudice and therefore, trying to please capital. It is a violent act committed against the public's right of attending meetings and the right of free speech. (So far unknown in this country) It is a dangerous case of precedence with disregard for the American system of government. This is not a local case, but is a disgrace involving the whole nation. Any one except the monopolist is aware of the danger which threatens the masses as a result of the court's decision. The newly adopted laws by the Illinois Legislature, deprive the citizens of their right to express themselves freely. The brazen interference of the police at public meetings, must not be suffered. The nation has to wake up and put a stop to this. Not one of the sentenced men can be justly accused of having committed the crime.</p>
