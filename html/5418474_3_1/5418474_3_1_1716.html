   <p>In a letter by the well-known Herman Raster written to the Staats-Zeitung, from Vienna, the writer, after announcing that the main issue of the coming local election in Chicago should be opposition to the temperance fanatics says that: "I repeat once more, in relation to the local election, what has been known as my opinion, that we must with waving flags and drums beating, march over to the Democrats."</p>
   <p>From this, and from previous utterances of the same impart from Mr. Hesaing it seems incontestable" Barkis is willing", but while there can be no doubt that the German" Barkis is willing" the question now occurs as to the willing-ness of the Democrats to receive this Teutonic bridegroom. Next to Horace Greeley, German writers and speakers have been the most obuside cowardly, and false in their treatment of Democrats. Now, however, when they need assistance in doing some dirty work, which their own party has refused to aid them in doing they boldly announce their intention of securing assistance from Democrats.</p>

   <p>No, Messieurs Germans! We think not. We think that when you commence your march, with flags flying and drums beating, to the Democratic camp, the nature of your reception will depend upon the motive of your going. If you go to seek an honorable alliance, for the accomplishment of a patriotic purpose, you will receive a hearty reception; but if you unfurl your flags, and set your drummers to beating time, and march over for the purpose solely of securing co-operation in the cause of indecency and immorality, you will probably find that you are charging an enemy in place of making into the camp of a friend. This announcement is unspeakably insolent. It does not stop for a moment to question whether or not democratic are willing to receive them. With true Hesing like arrogance, it is an assumption that it is only necessary to announce that the beer-party and the anti-Sunday party is coming, in order to secure a cordial welcome. Nor do these German leaders ameliorate the character of the transaction by announcing that they are going over to the Democrats in order to aid the latter; but they announce openly that they are going in order that the latter may aid them.</p>

   <p>Refused aid by their own party, they fancy that democrats will be anxiously willing to embark in the crusade for unlimited beer and no Sabath.</p>
   <p>It ought to be understood that there is no democrats party in the matters involved in the coming local elections. There are just two parties; the party of law and order and the party of unlimited whisky and no Sabbath. We fancy that when the cohorts of Gambrinus, headed by generals Raster and Hesaing, unfurl their flags, and beat their drums, and essay to march into the Democratic stronghold, they will find that no such place exists; and if such a place should be found, we are entirely certain that the visiting cohorts will be received with double-shot guns.</p>
