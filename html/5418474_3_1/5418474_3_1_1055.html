   <p>The Socialist [party] convention was held at Uhlich's hall yesterday. Every member in good standing was entitled to a vote. About three hundred party members were present, among them several women.</p>
   <p>Organizer Morgan nominated Samuel Goldwater for chairman, and he was elected unanimously. The organizers of the various party sections were nominated as vice-chairmen.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Ehrhardt and Korth were nominated as secretaries.</p>
   <p>Organizer Morgan read a lengthy statement with respect to the platform for the coming election; the platform was adopted after a short debate.....</p>
   <p>Before proceeding with the nominations, Morgan read a communication signed by R. J. Smith, requesting the organizer [Morgan] to propose to the convention that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>A. M. Wright be nominated for mayor. This request provoked considerable mirth, and was tabled.</p>
   <p>Stahl made a motion that the propagandists of the party should always mention the party publications at mass meetings in order to increase their circulation. As a result of Morgan's motion, it was decided to help the Trade and Labor Council obtain five thousand copies of the legislative labor committee's report.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed that assent to the various motions be indicated merely by lifting the right hand, and, to facilitate this voting method, the hall was divided into ten sections, one person being designated to count the votes in each. This plan proved to be exceedingly practical.</p>
   <p>Various sections advocated G.Schilling,John McAuliffe, and Dr. E. Schmidt as candidates for mayor. Doubts arose as to whether Dr. Schmidt had been a member for a full year, When this question was asked Comrade Lyser declared that Dr.Schmidt had been a member for the past fifteen months.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Several of the members advocated Alderman Stauber as a candidate for mayor, which proposal was received with gratifying acclaim; but Stauber declined the honor, as he did not wish to interfere with the nomination of the best man.</p>
   <p>Representative Meier recommended Dr. Schmidt, and Ehrhardt declared that Dr. Schmidt accepted the nomination.</p>
   <p>Then followed the vote: Schilling polled 44; Schmidt, 210; and McAuliffe, 20 votes. Dr. Schmidt's nomination was then made unanimous, and the result was jubilantly received.</p>
   <p>A. O. Bishop, Henry Stein, Frank Stauber, Warner, and Sullivan were nominated as candidates for the office of city treasurer. Bishop withdrew in favor of Stein. One of the members warned the assembly against selecting Germans only, and said men of other nationalities must also be considered. Morgan replied, and several agreed with him, that the party should not take cognizance of nationalities. Stahl was of the opinion that it would be poor politics not to consider existing <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>prejudices. Comrade [Paul] Grottkau, speaking in German, advised the assembly to bear the Americans in mind [when making nominations].</p>
   <p>The result of the vote was: Stein, 27; Stauber, 169; Warner, 52; and Sullivan, 24. Thus Frank Stauber was nominated for treasurer. The nomination was made unanimous.</p>
   <p>Henry Stahl and Benjamin Sibley were nominated for the office of city clerk. As Stahl declined, Sibley obtained the nomination amid great acclaim.</p>
   <p>When nominations for city attorney were considered, it became apparent that the party did not have in its membership a lawyer capable of holding this office, and, therefore, Morgan recommended that someone not a Socialist be selected, provided the national central body should sanction the move.</p>
   <p>Bishop protested against nominating anyone who did not belong to the party. The office, he declared, required only a sensible man, and many lawyers of sound judgment were in the party ranks; that the present city attorney had anything but legal <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>knowledge, and had attained office through political connections rather than ability: that many party members were better qualified than he.</p>
   <p>One elderly comrade declared that the party had better dissolve than admit that no one of its numbers was capable of being city attorney; that the Socialists were not interested in legal trickery; that they demanded only honesty.</p>
   <p>Jeffers suggested that it would be preferable to make no nomination for this office than to choose a candidate who was not a party member.</p>
   <p>Sibley supported Morgan's motion and declared that even the most able cannot be lawyers when they lack the necessary knowledge. Ehrhardt agreed.</p>
   <p>A comrade from the North Side protested energetically against violating, in any manner, the party's constitution. Since the party had no lawyer capable of being city attorney, he argued it would be preferable to make no nomination for this office.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Stahl, after a prolonged speech, nominated Harry Rubens for city attorney, adding that he was not a party member, but that he was a thoroughly reliable Socialist, and, if elected, would be of considerable value to the party.</p>
   <p>It was resolved, by a vote of 144 to 126, to make a nomination. Morgan supported the candidacy of Rubens; the latter had been offered the Democratic nomination, but had declined. He had shown willingness, however, to be on the Socialist ticket.</p>
   <p>Bishop nominated Charles Gottschalck; Beesley seconded the nomination because of Gottschalck's party membership. Thorsmarck asserted that it was perilous to nominate anyone not a party member.</p>
   <p>Harry Rubens, who was present, was given an opportunity to address the assembly. He expressed his satisfaction that the Socialists, by having had this debate, had proved themselves thinking citizens; and he declared, in order to promote party harmony, that he--as a good Socialist--preferred to withdraw in favor of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>the young and capable lawyer who had also been nominated.</p>
   <p>Morgan retorted that he hoped the party would not support any candidate rather than come to grief by choosing someone he considered incapable.</p>
   <p>Gottschalck, in deference to Morgan's uncomplimentary opinion of him, withdrew.</p>
   <p>Stahl nominated Harry Rubens once more, and Stauber gave a detailed account of the lawyer's activities in behalf of the party.</p>
   <p>Gottschalck was nominated again, and then someone in the hall addressed him:</p>
   <p>"Say, Gottschalck, do you know me?"</p>
   <p>Gottschalck, somewhat embarrassed, replied, "Probably."</p>
   <p>The stranger continued, "Just look at me well. You cheated me out of a dollar <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and a half; and, if you tricked me then you will also cheat others."</p>
   <p>Great confusion prevailed after that, and Rubens was given 177 votes; Gottschalck, 54. Rubens was thus nominated city attorney.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen were nominated for aldermen:</p>
