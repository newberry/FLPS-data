   <p>The German Saddlers Union proposed in its meeting a short time ago the founding of a professional school for saddlers during winter time.</p>
   <p>It is a fact when agitating against the sub-contract system that the English saddlers reproach the German for not being able to dress. In order to meet this reproach the school will be founded and the handling and tricks taught which are most important.</p>
   <p>Every expert will confirm that a well placed stitch or correctly laid fold on a gig saddle does wonders and gives an entirely different appearance. Besides it is hoped to use this school as a means for agitation.</p>
