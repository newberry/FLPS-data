   <p>Mr. March, Chief of the General Staff, reports that arrangements have been made to transport 300,000 of our soldiers from Europe to America every month beginning in April, and that during the month of February no fewer than 785,000 officers and men are to be discharged from training camps in our country.</p>
   <p>That is to say, within the next six months or so nearly two million workers who are now doing military service will be free to compete for the opportunity to work and earn a living.</p>
   <p>This outlook is a cause of no little worry for many people. They point to the fact that, even at this early date, the supply of man power greatly exceeds the demand in many areas; that, as a result, many of the young men who have been discharged from military service are still without employment; that <span class="page-break">\2</span>the discharged soldiers and other war workers are meeting with great difficulties in their search for opportunities to obtain gainful employment. They portray the future in extremely dark colors and predict most unpleasant happenings unless energetic measures are immediately taken to employ the forces that are at liberty now and those that will be free from military duty in the near future. They insist that many other things be done to allay the ever-increasing dissatisfaction. Fortunately, there are some who do not join in such ominous croaking. Appearing before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor yesterday, Senator Lewis branded these prophesies of evil as "false and unjustified". Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis F. Post declared that, following soon upon a short period of reconstruction, an era of prosperity will set in such as has never been experienced, and that opportunites for well-paid work will present themselves to everybody who wants to work. On the other hand, all of the Republican senators who were present portrayed the immediate future in very dark colors; but, though the greater number of Republicans are pessimists, not all Republicans are wont <span class="page-break">\3</span>to look at the dark side of everything.</p>
   <p>There actually is some cause for apprehension. Even under the most favorable circumstances, even if the returning soldiers would be willing to avail themselves of any and every opportunity to work, it would not be possible for industry, business, and commerce to absorb the suddenly released armies of men, unless special measures were taken. And as matters stand, in view of the fact that many of the young men who are returning home are not inclined to accept "low", hard work, but will demand "something better" because they are conscious of having performed their patriotic duty, it appears to be absolutely necessary to make special efforts to facilitate reconstruction in order to avert serious disturbances. The only question is, What can be done?</p>
   <p>Work, opportunity to earn a living, must be supplied. That is the general and natural answer to the question of what is to be done. And the state and the city are taking steps to remedy the situation by planning and beginning <span class="page-break">\4</span>public work wherever and whenever it is possible to do so. When there is no opportunity to work in city or state, the authorities must create such opportunity. For it is not feasible to permit returning soldiers to sell shoestrings in the streets, or to beg, or to lounge around in army camps because there is no work for them to do. "Nor will a bit of unsolicited charity and pretty speeches suffice," as a prominent labor leader remarked yesterday. Those people (the returning soldiers) need work.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the discharged soldiers must have work, must have an opportunity to earn a living. We must not offer them charity. For each act of charity would insult the strong among them, and decrease the waning strength of the weak, and thus do great damage to the whole social body. Those who are willing to work do not want, and do not need, charity, and those who shirk work would only be confirmed in their dislike for work if charity or any kind of gift--which would only be another form of charity--were tendered them. These lazy people would gain the impression that whatever was given them was not charity, but only a small payment on the debt of gratitude which the nation owes them, and that they are entitled to even more--in short, that it is the duty of the state and of society to support them <span class="page-break">\5</span>permanently.</p>
   <p>It is proper to give alms to those who are in need and who will not be harmed thereby; to help those who are unable to help themselves; to provide in abundant measure for the sick and the crippled. But to present all soldiers, without discrimination, with a gift of money--we should not even think of it!</p>
