   <p>The Typographia had declared jointly in favor of the radical socialistic candidate, A. R. Parsons. All members of this trade will not only vote for our candidate Parsons, but will also agitate for his election in larger circles as much as they are able. A. R. Parsons had already been won for the cause of Socialism at a time, when the opposing candidate was still a full Republican. A. R. Parsons has suffered hunger and want for his convictions and is an independent character, who will not be taken in tow by other persons to be guided to other goals.</p>
   <p>The workman's cause needs men, independent men, perserving men, since perseverance in our great cause alone, will insure our future success.</p>
