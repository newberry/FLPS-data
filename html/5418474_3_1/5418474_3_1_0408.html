   <p>Only once in the last 74 years, in 1922, has unemployment among the Germans in Chicago been so serious as at present, according to the latest reports of the German Society. Over 3,000 people have applied for work at the office of the German Society, but only 72 could be given employment. Wages are reduced considerably, and many employers only supply food and shelter, but no wages at all.</p>
   <p>Next to unemployment, illness and lack of fuel were the principal motives of those seeking help. The Society supported 49 families with 159 children, as well as 21 single persons, among them five women to whom were furnished advice and help. Shelter was secured for 129, and meals for 144 persons. Coal was delivered to 14 families, and hospital care and medicine were given to 28 people. For these charitable expenses the German Society used $773.00.</p>
