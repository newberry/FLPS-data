   <p>Before the National Recovery Act had become very old, or the forty-hour week had been established in every part of the country, the American Federation of Labor, at its last annual convention, declared itself in favor of a thirty-hour week. While this action was far-reaching in its scope, it was by no means intended as mere propaganda to gain the established quota of twenty-five million new members, but from the very beginning the idea was set forth as a goal that should be attained. No sooner had Congress begun its work this month, than the American Federation of Labor appeared with its demand, and its representatives at Washington are working with might and main, forging the iron while it is hot. The House Committee on Labor Issues will consider the problem, and thus Congress may be confronted with one more task.</p>
   <p>Of course, if one gives the matter only superficial consideration, it appears <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that Congress will legalize the thirty-hour week by an appropriate act. However, if one studies the situation more closely, some quite serious objections appear on the surface. One need have no great knowledge of economics to be able to imagine that a thirty-hour week cannot easily be introduced schematically. A literal application would involve detrimental consequences for many branches of business, because they would be financially unable to operate under a thirty-hour week, since they are sustaining losses even under the forty-hour week. For according to tentative plans, not only the working time is to be decreased by ten hours per week, which would mean a decrease in production, but the present daily wage rate is to be maintained. That would increase production costs in no small degree, and would make the operation of small and medium establishments unprofitable, and force many of them to close their doors. Thus the thirty-hour week would not have the effect which its sponsors intend it should have; moreover, it would have just the opposite of the intended effect; it would increase unemployment, instead of diminishing it.</p>
   <p>And so many people are inclined to agree with Senator Wagner, of New York, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Chairman of the Labor Board, who has given his official opinion on the matter. He is opposed to enacting a thirty-hour law, and recommends that it be introduced gradually through our code authorities who could serve as the best source of advice for their branch of industry, since the various branches of industry are represented in their code office by very able men. These men, all experts in their line, would not be so apt to make mistakes, for they are well informed on all details pertaining to their particular branch. It is to be expected that they would classify industry and would permit those establishments that would be forced to suspend business under the thirty-hour law to retain the present work schedule, whereas the act desired by the American Federation of Labor would hardly sanction such exceptions. So it is a matter of adapting a desirable fundamental innovation to existing economic conditions prevailing in our country, which could easily be ruined by the schematic application of dead formulas.</p>
   <p>Is is not yet determined, what kind of an act will be adopted. It would <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>be better for our economic life, if our Government would confine itself to such experiments as are considered absolutely necessary, for conditions are too grave to make unnecessary experiments, and there is danger that the rabbit that is used for experimental purposes will die. And it will be the task of the more circumspect representatives in Washington, who have not been deprived of their sense of economic realities by the events of the past year, to see that this does not happen.</p>
