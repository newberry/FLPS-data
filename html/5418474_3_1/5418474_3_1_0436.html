   <p>Cadi Lyon rendered a service yesterday to society. He sent half a dozen Italian beggars to the Bridewell for 50 days because they were guilty of such an enormous hunger that they raided the garbage cans of some buildings owned by rich people.</p>
   <p>Well, for 50 days society is protected against these six potential hunger revolutionaries. But what shall become of the remaining 49,994 jobless on Chicago?</p>
   <p>The Bridewell and all the other jails are not big enough to hold those who occasionally have to pilfer from garbage cans in order to satisfy their hunger.</p>
   <p>Will not those six Italians face starvation again once they are dismissed from the Bridewell? Or does Cadi Lyon mean that they should devour each other? (Cadi: An Arabian word, meaning judge.)</p>
