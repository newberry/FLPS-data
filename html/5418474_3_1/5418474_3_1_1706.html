   <p>The following is an excerpt from a recent issue of the Chicago Evening Journal:</p>
   <p>"Recently Mr. [A. C.] Hesing, the leader of the Germans in the West, made a speech in which he stated that the Republicans would lose the Illinois election next fall as a result of having watered paper money. Since the time of this statement, President Grant's veto has taken all the wind out of Mr. Hesing's sails. And in order to be consistent, Mr. Hesing would have to predict a great victory for the Republicans in Illinois."</p>
   <p>The Albany Evening Journal, The Nation, and the New York World are rejoicing because of the address which Mr. Hesing made before the Illinois State Republican Committee. These papers assume that he was the leader of an anti-Republican movement last fall. This assumption is based either on ignorance or upon a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>willful disregard of the truth. The election held last fall was not a party battle. Republicans and Democrats alike cast aside all party considerations. Colvin's election to the mayoralty was no more a defeat of the Republican party than it was a defeat of the clergymen of Chicago; indeed, not even as much, for the churches took sides in the matter, while the political parties as such were strictly neutral."</p>
   <p>An Englishman once said that one has to drill a hole in the head of either a German or a Scot before the point of a joke can enter. We wish to point out that it is likewise necessary to drill a hole into the skull of an American political partisan to make him understand that a person who has been a leader in a political party can sever all relations with that party for all times.</p>
   <p>The Illinois State Republican Committee would not believe that Mr. Hesing wished to have nothing further to do with their party, and they virtually pulled him into their meeting by the collar. And there he explained as well as could have been done in any tongue, that he wanted to have no future <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>dealings with the party that had so ruthlessly trampled upon its solemn vows. One would think that would have been sufficiently explicit. If one gives another a slap in the face, or a kick in the pants, such treatment should be sufficient to convince him that "friendly days" are past. However, it seems that this method does not convince an American politician. He merely laughs it off and says: "He doesn't mean that. He will come around again."</p>
   <p>However, Germans are of a different pattern. They make resolutions only after careful deliberation, and consequently are much slower in acting than Americans; for the latter are wholly governed by mood or fashion, whereas once a Teuton makes a decision he abides by it. That is true with reference to the case in question. What Mr. Hesing told the Illinois State Republican Committee is nothing but the honest opinion of those Germans, without whose votes the Republican party was and will be only a minority party in Cook County and Chicago. Chicago was the stronghold of the Republican party in the Northwest, not because the English-speaking members of the party constitute a majority of voters, but because Chicago's Germans faithfully supported the Republican ticket. This <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>support was highly pleasing to the English-speaking Republicans; but at the first opportunity which the latter had to comply with the just demands of the Germans, they retreated--retreated cowardly.</p>
   <p>"They were neutral," says the Evening Journal. That is a very mild expression. It would have been more correct to have said that they slunk back into their hiding place. They kept to their hideouts and were just as willing to acclaim the Puritan preachers who called the Germans "damned German infidels"--in case the "law-and-order" party had won--as they were to kowtow to the Germans--in case the "Dutch" were victorious. They came crawling at dusk to assure us privately that they shared the opinions of "their German friends," but that they could not declare their friendship publicly because of "due consideration" for preachers, for women, or for neighbors; and then they crept back into their holes as furtively as they had left them, and laughed to themselves about the way they had humbugged the "dumb Dutchmen".</p>
   <p>However, those "Dutchmen" were not as "dumb" as the gentlemen thought. After <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>listening to all the insincere protestations of friendship they learned to despise the cowards who thought they could deceive the "dumb Dutchmen" so easily.</p>
   <p>Thus, the election last fall was a settlement of affairs between the English-speaking and the German-speaking Republicans. The latter were aware that the former were deserting them, although the English would have been only too willing to share in the victory, had the "dumb Dutchmen" achieved one. Since that time the English-speaking Republicans have learned that they did not constitute a majority without the Germans, but that the Germans and the Irishmen could win any election. The primary objective of the English-speaking Republicans has been the separation of the Germans from the Irish, and the Germans' reunion with the Republican party. That is why they invited Mr. Hesing to the meeting of the State Republican Committee, and that is why the Committee submitted to the tongue-lashing which it received from Mr. Hesing; but their endeavors were in vain. Both Mr. Hesing and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung are through with the Republican party.</p>

   <p>And the veto of President Grant does not alter matters. The President's act evoked cheers from those German Republicans who were serious about the national platform of the Republican party. They are happy because in 1872 their votes helped to put a man in the White House who refused to become an infamous traitor to the sacred pledges of the Republican party; but they are not likely to forget that an overwhelming majority of English-speaking Republicans were guilty of cowardly disloyalty to the principles of the Republican party; but they are not likely to forget that an overwhelming majority of English-speaking Republican were guilty of cowardly disloyalty to the principles of the Republican party and had expressed great joy over the performance of an act which the Republican platforms of 1868 and 1872 termed "a crime against the nation". The German-speaking Republicans will be less likely to forget that the Republican party in the state of Illinois was closely allied to those members of our National Assembly who were leaders in the paper-money swindle. The German-speaking Republicans of Chicago and Cook County will always advocate and defend those principles for which they joined the Republican party; but since the majority of the English-speaking members of the Republican party have abandoned, yea, even repudiated, those principles, we "dumb Dutchmen" absolutely refuse to have anything to do with the Republican party. <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>We hope that the gentlemen understand us "dumb Dutchmen". If they do not, we shall be glad to be more explicit.</p>
