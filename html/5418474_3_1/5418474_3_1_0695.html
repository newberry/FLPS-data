   <p>A petition was dealt with during the C. L. U. meeting yesterday in which the Workingmen's Educational organization stated that the Arbeiter Zeitung was not radical enough in its representation of the working-class.</p>
   <p>These clubs therefore rented one page on each issue of the Freiheit, contracting fifteen hundred issues pro week, and asked the C. L. U. for financial aid.</p>
   <p>After a lively discussion the demand was rejected on the grounds that it was a competitive matter between two newspapers.</p>
