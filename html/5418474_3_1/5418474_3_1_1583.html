   <p>Among the delegates of the Republican Party of Illinois chosen at Springfield by Logan to the Republican National Convention - there are no Germans.</p>
   <p>As alternates, Logan let in two, - Baumgarten, of Cook County, and Pfeifer, of St. Clair. Nor did Logan allow any Germans on the State Central Committee, which has charge of the campaign. Among the Presidential Electors selected by Logan there is but one German who can be called a representative German only to the extent that he represents one by the name of George Schnieder. It's true that Logan was graciously pleased to allow the nomination of a German for State Treasurer perhaps because he, like Grant, was a third-term man. And another born in Germany, but who came here as a child, - Mr. Sweigert, - is nominated for Auditor. But this does not compensate for the exclusion by Logan of the Germans of Illinois from the National Convention of the Republican Party, and from cooperation in the shaping of the future history of the country. In one respect this exclusion is a great honor for the Germans, Logan has <span class="page-break">\2</span>evidently become convinced that there are no Logan slaves among the Germans.</p>
