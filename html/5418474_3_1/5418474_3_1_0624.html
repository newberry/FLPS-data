   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the Socialists at the Waverly Hall, Comrade Cahan spoke on Darwin and Socialism. Mr. Cahan expressed himself by saying that Mr. Darwin was a Socialist; not only that, but was unaware of it himself.</p>
   <p>Speaking for almost an hour, he criticized the Social Political System. Next Sunday will be an open forum discussion of Socialists at the Vorwaerts Turnhall.</p>
