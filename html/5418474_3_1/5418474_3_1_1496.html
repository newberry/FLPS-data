   <p>A large number of veterans of the Civil War and of the German-French War of 1870 assembled last night in the North Side Turner Hall to come to a decision as to what attitude to take toward W. Vocke, the candidate for congress.</p>
   <p>A. Erbe was elected chairman, and Dr. Bluthardt, secretary. The chairman then stated that he thought it unnecessary to enthuse the veterans especially in order to elect Mr. Vocke, since there can be no doubt in their minds, when the choice is between Mr. Vocke and Mr. Goldzier.</p>
   <p>In a stirring and brief address, A. Georg described Vocke's brilliant career and asserted that his election is beyond a shadow of doubt.</p>
   <p>"It would be", he continued, " a calamity for the Germans, if it were possible that such a man as Vocke, who has been known for 35 years as a man of merit and honor, could be defeated by Goldzier, a man who is only known by his name, and that only for a few years. If such a thing could happen, he would despair <span class="page-break">\2</span>indeed of the intelligence of the Germans"...</p>
   <p>Dr. Bluthardt and others expressed similar opinions ... A committee was appointed to draw up the resolutions, the following of which were accepted:</p>
   <p>"As we are convinced that our comrade and fellow-citizen, W. Vocke, is especially capable to be a member of Congress, and that he as such would not only be an honor to the citizens of the fourth district of Illinois, but also to all German-Americans of the whole United States.... and:</p>
   <p>"As we are convinced that it is the distinct duty of the Civil War veterans, and the veterans of the German-French War to make his election absolutely certain, and to grant him the opportunity to serve the country with his brilliant capacities and excellent knowledge;</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved, therefore, to give W. Vocke our votes gladly, and to do our best to persuade our friends and neighbors of the 4th district to do the same on election day."</p>
