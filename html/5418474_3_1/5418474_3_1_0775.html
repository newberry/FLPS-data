   <p>Southside: A well attended agitation meeting at which Comrade Nothdurft presided, was held last Saturday by the Socialists of the Southside. Comrade Muller held a lecture on the subject: "The Demoralizing Influences of the Catholic Religion." The lecture contained many interesting data for the listeners, and gave occasion for an animated discussion, during which the fullest approval was expressed to the reviewer. Two invitations from the Groups "Freiheit" and "Bridgeport" were received, and the Comrades were requested to participate in as large number as possible.</p>
