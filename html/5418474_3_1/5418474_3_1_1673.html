   <p>Previous to the Presidential election of last year, numerous so-called "Tilden - and - Reform" Clubs were organized among the Germans of Chicago,- a fact that was very forcibly demonstrated when the votes were counted, and it became apparent how serious the German exodus from the Republican ranks really was. To make this defection permanent has been the anxious desire of the local Democratic leaders, but the German Republicans who voted for Tilden under the belief that they were voting for Reform evidently have no intention of joining the Democratic organization for good. A convention of delegates from the clubs was held last evening with the object of committing them to the support of the Democratic ticket at the city and town elections; but the scheme failed entirely, the convention voting to defer action until both parties have nominated their candidates. When the tickets are in the field the Germans will vote for the best men, and, as the best men are quite certain to be the Republican nominees, there is little doubt on which side the German support will be found.</p>
