   <p>The events in San Francisco should serve as a warning to professional agitators and misleaders of the people. From the beginning of the great strike, it was asserted that Communists, led by foreigners, contributed most to make the situation more acute. Now from circles connected with the American Federation of Labor, whose unions took part in the strike, the complaint is made that its conservative members are pushed aside by young Communist agitators. The Communists, it is alleged, have taken over the leadership in a few unions and have agitated for the strike. It is significant that at the head of the general committee of strikers stands an alien, an Australian.</p>
   <p>It is by no means anything new for Communist elements, who seem to be familiar with one aim, i. e., the spreading of discontent among the members of the unions and distrust among the workers and employers, have pervaded the unions. They order the members of their union to secede to show them what powerful fellows they are, but they rarely achieve anything tangible by this action. Most frequently it ends with the exhaustion of the union treasury and with the loss, by members of the union, of many days' or weeks' wages. This constitutes a loss which is difficult to make up even if they receive a few more pennies as a result of the walkout. But the agitators themselves receive a salary which equals, or even surpasses, that of a judge. They lay claim to that salary even while the members of their union are earning nothing. They certainly suffer no want.</p>
   <p>Of course, today there are secretaries of unions who are satisfied with a scanty income and whose main concern is the well-being of the union members. But in large cities, too many of the first-mentioned class are in evidence. Those Red agitators, with whom downright criminals sometimes associate, seem to be at fault for all the events which occurred in San Francisco before the attempt to block the shipment of foodstuffs. There is some truth in the statement that the American people are known to have the patience of sheep. Those who do not know this will sometimes express surprise at the tolerance exercised in cases of patent abuses. But this patience does not go beyond a certain limit. If advantage is taken of it, then woe betide the offenders! Prohibition was a grave test for the people, and toward the end there were distinct omens that the accumulated patience reached the point of exhaustion. Had the situation lasted a little longer, the people would undoubtedly have taken matters into their own hands. They did that, as a matter of fact, on many previous occasions and they generally got what they went after.</p>
   <p>The attempt by the Communist agitators to prevent foodstuffs from reaching the city, their determination to starve the population in an effort to achieve their particular aims or merely to bring proof of the government's weakness, quickly roused citizens to action. The Westerner is not yet very distant from the time of the pioneers who used to be their own policemen for the protection of their own persons and properties. He is now just as able, when urged by necessity, to revive these times of primitive defense against enemies of society. When the situation threatened to become perilous for the public, for the law-abiding citizenry, gangs of vigilantes emerged suddenly, as though coming from a subterranean shaft. Without any help from the police, they raided all Communist dens, destroying some of them. This was, of course, against the law. Only the police or those authorized by the government have a right to intervene. Who is interested in right or wrong if something much greater is at stake? Did Adolf Hitler ask questions when he ordered conspirators within and without his party to be shot to prevent a civil war which was believed to be imminent? He is now praised more than ever as the savior of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>The same motives guided the vigilantes in San Francisco. So it was shown that the agitators could not take to their heels quickly enough, however much they had just recently fired the courage of the strikers. The Reds ran from the vigilantes, and the latter had to flee from the police just as quickly, for the police were right behind them to protect the lives and the property of the frightened agitators. In most cases the police came too late, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Everytime they made their appearance, the damage had already been done and the perpetrators were beyond the hills and out of reach. Subsequent arrests were seldom made, for the people, the citizens of San Francisco, are on the side of the vigilantes, and the authorities know where the wind blows.</p>
   <p>For the Communists and Bolsheviks of American or Russian descent, the reappearance of the vigilantes means the handwriting on the wall: "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin!" In good German this means, "Do not try to be like mice, for the cat will catch you!"</p>
