   <p>Nutzhorn's Hall was the place of the meeting. William Bluhm was elected President and Comrade Kobitzsch, Secretary. Comrade Spies was first speaker addressing the assembly in English. He tried to center its attention on the increasing poverty of the people and the accumulation of wealth by a comparatively few.</p>
   <p>Labor is always cheated. The duty on imports protects the factory owners, but not the workers. If the duty paid on imports of iron were distributed among the workers of this industry, everyone would receive an annual income of $10,000. But as conditions are at present, this money goes into the pockets of manufacturers. The ruling class will never recognize labor's rights freely, therefore we have to resort to force. We have to organize! Comrade Michel Schwab, the next speaker pointed out that nothing can be expected from our legislative authorities. If it ever happens that a law with a friendly attitude towards labor is introduced it would be only with the intention of misleading the people. Comrade Schwab spoke then of mining inspection.</p>
   <p>He also said that the social question can be solved only by force. Organizing is therefore of the utmost importance in order to bring about a state of things where nobody would have to suffer or to starve any more: the Communist State!</p>
