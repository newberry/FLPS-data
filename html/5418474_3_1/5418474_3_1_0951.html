   <p>All those who are in a position to house one or more delegates, are requested to notify the undersigned. By this, we only mean Socialist delegates, and as they are mostly workingmen (and therefore poor), the local Section considers it its duty, to see to it that their stay in the city should cost them as little as possible.</p>
   <p>Trusting that many will be willing to accommodate the visitors,</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Henry C. Meyer,</p>
   <p>c/o Arbeiter Zeitung,</p>
   <p>87 Fifth Avenue,</p>
