   <p>There is not a single German, among the representatives of the Republican party of Illinois, selected by Logan for the Republican National Convention in Springfield. Only as deputies has Logan admitted two Germans (Baumgarten of Cook County and Pfeifer of St. Clair County). Neither has Logan taken any Germans for the State Central Committee, created to conduct the election campaign. Among the presidential electors appointed by Logan there is only one German who can be called a German representative, because he really represents a German named George Schneider [himself].</p>
   <p>It is true that Logan has graciously permitted the appointment of a German for the office of treasurer, probably because that gentleman, like Grant, is a "third termer". Another man, who was born in Germany but came over here when he was a child, Mr. Swigart, has been appointed auditor. But all this does not make up for the fact that Logan has kept, or is trying to keep, the Germans of Illinois out of the National Convention of the Republican party, <span class="page-break">2</span>and from taking an active part in shaping the destiny of our Country.</p>
   <p>In one respect the Germans should feel greatly honored by this exclusion. Logan is obviously convinced that there are no Logan bootlickers among the Germans.</p>
