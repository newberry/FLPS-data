   <p>All coppersmiths of Chicago should consider it their duty to join our Union, which was founded on June 5, and do their utmost to help make this enterprise a success. So far, about thirty members have joined, and the following officers were elected:</p>
   <p>Clais Feadin, President</p>
   <p>Richard Lies, Vice President</p>
   <p>Gustav A. Fehr, Secretary</p>
   <p>It is important, that no one should fail to attend Saturday evening at 54 W. Lake Street in Zepp's Hall, because the principal work, reading of the Constitution and the acceptance of same, will be the order of the day. It is, therefore, desirable that everybody should be present, to participate in the debate of the different paragraphs.</p>
