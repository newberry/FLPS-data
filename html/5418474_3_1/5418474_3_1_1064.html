   <p>The meeting of mechanics and blacksmiths at Folz's Hall yesterday afternoon, called for the purpose of perfecting a union of those trades, turned out to be a regular Socialist affair. There were present about two dozen Socialists and about a half a dozen blacksmiths and mechanics. A Mr. Cederburg presided over the meeting, and a Mr. Krix acted as Secretary.</p>
   <p>The proceedings consisted of a lengthy speech in German by Paul Grottkau, editor of the Arbeiter Zeitung, who tried to show that the only solution of workingmen lay in the formation of trade unions. He advocated very elaborately the desirability of a law to make eight hours' work a legal day's labor. Without such a law, he claimed, the workingmen would be compelled to continue to work as slaves for the capitalists.</p>
