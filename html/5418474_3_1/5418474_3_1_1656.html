   <p>The Republicans as well as the Democrats admit that the Socialists can obtain 10,000 votes; the latter count on 12,000. It appears quite certain--since both of the major parties concede that number--that Doctor Ernst Schmidt [Socialist candidate for mayor of Chicago], will be given a considerable number of votes from people he knows personally, or those who know him as a physician. On the Southwest Side, particularly, many people favor his candidacy, although this class of our citizens is not inclined to be socialist in principle. They are people who are oblivious of the fact that he cannot be elected and that the vote cast for the man is virtually thrown away.</p>
