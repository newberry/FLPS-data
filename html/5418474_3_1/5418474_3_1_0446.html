   <p>Much lung power and printer's ink have been devoted lately to warnings about the "red danger" in the American schools, which is claimed to have reached an acute stage and to have become a national problem. The open fight against this danger is praised as heroism and in one section of the press, always rates big headlines. If Communist activities in American schools are examined a little more closely, they really seem more harmless than the bold front-line fighters against the "red danger" are willing to admit. There is probably a considerable number of American professors who are friendly to communism in theory, and who recruit supporters of the gospel of the "reds" among their students; but this still does not present any danger for the democratic form of government such as this country has, for only a minority of the young people attend the colleges and universities, and only a minority <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of that minority becomes infected with communism. Even if the political leaders of the future come from academic ranks, it still does not follow that politicians infected with communism are revolutionists, for after they have gotten into politics they usually change their attitude when they realize that the Federal Constitution is a strong bulwark against any radical upheaval, and that only a coup d'etat could circumvent it and bring about the introduction of a communist system in America.</p>
   <p>In their present form, Communist activities in American schools are not really dangerous, but they might become so if the Government allowed things to take their course and was content officially to deny the existence of communism and to allow growing children to remain in ignorance of the true character of communism, instead of giving them the necessary spiritual armor to protect them on their journey through life, so as to induce them to reject communism because of conviction and not because of fear. This is all the more necessary because the Communist propaganda in this country is adapted very shrewdly to the psychology of its intended victims. Circulars are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>distributed, for instance, which say: "Does the American Government give every citizen free dental treatment? No. But the Soviet Union does." Another circular says: "In Russia every school child gets a warm lunch free, but this is not true in America."</p>
   <p>However simple these catchwords may appear, they have their effect. Millions of people in America cannot afford dental care, and millions of school children are without sufficient food. It is no wonder that these millions of people hanker after the fleshpots of a Soviet Union.</p>
   <p>The explanation of the true character of communism should begin, not in the universities, but in the elementary schools. While they are growing up children should learn that in Russia a small minority--which is continually growing smaller--of party politicians rules arbitrarily over the overwhelming majority of the Russian people; that personal liberty and personal rights do not exist in a communist state; that there is no freedom of worship; that family life, the greatest safeguard of a sound government, has been destroyed; <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that children are not supposed to know a family home, and hence are brought up almost entirely by the State. Let the children be taught, while they are still in school, that Communist rule means the arbitrary rule of a minority, and that the most sacred possession of mankind would be trampled upon if the Communists ever gained control in America. If children were given this explanation it would be an invaluable service to the country, for to the youth belongs the future.</p>
   <p>Knowledge is power. If school children are taught the true meaning of communism, the coming generations will not fall victims so easily at election time to the honeyed siren songs of the countless political charlatans who invariably turn up when they think the time is ripe for them to work themselves into the favor of the electorate. For a people that is unenlightened this is the real danger, that some day a man will enter the White House who, before his election, has promised to make every American a king, but who, after his election, turns the people into submissive slaves. This danger <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>can best be averted if an explanation of communism is included in the curriculum of every school. Then every would-be leader would have to retreat into the upper reaches of his own political fantasies, for an enlightened people is barren soil for Communist propaganda, but a fertile field for democratic freedom.</p>
