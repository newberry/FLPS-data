   <p>The Socialist movement is on the ascendant. Large crowds attending meetings, etc, are an indication that they want to put a stop for the almost unbearable conditions. Comrade Winnen was appointed Chairman at this meeting and comrades Scholz, Schwab and Migalanda, Secretaries. First speaker was comrade Spies addressing the audience in English.</p>
   <p>He said:- "The fundamental idea on which Society was built was to protect every member belonging to this Society, and thereby promoting the general welfare. In the course of years, this has changed. The primitive beginning of civilization changed to a system which deprives the masses of their rights while a comperative few took possession of land and of means needed for production. The worker is the prey of the exploiter with no consideration shown him. He gave a short sketch of the dreadful disaster in Braidwood denouncing the company for lack of responsibility and neglect</p>

   <p>It can not be expected that these conditions will change, unless the exploited and deprived worker himself puts a stop to it.</p>
   <p>A relief from unemployment can be obtained only by introducing a shorter working day, abolishing child labor and by the exclusion of women workers to a large extent. The radical cure for unemployment is the removal of the system of exploitation and to see to it that the parasites work, unless they prefer to starve to death. It is necessary for every worker to join an organization, which spells power.</p>
   <p>I. Resolutions:-Considering that class opposition is becoming more intense in America and the so-called freedom of the workers becomes more of an illusion as time goes on and,-</p>
   <p>II. Considering that the ruling capitalist class deals death through starvation, when unjustly discharging the worker and committing other crimes, when they neglect to afford the worker the simplest precautions to protect his life and,-</p>
   <p>III. Considering that labor has nothing to look forward to but oppression, while those oppressors are quite concerned about their mules, as the dreadful catastrophe at Braidwood proved again, it has been decided to urge <span class="page-break">\3</span>labor to organize and overthrow the capitalist system installing a new and just one which would give the worker his well earned compensation.</p>
