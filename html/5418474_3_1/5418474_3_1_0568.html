   <p>As developments on the eastern and western war fronts progress, the position of the Germans in the United States becomes more and more difficult. Where emotions gain the upper hand, logical reasoning will drop by the wayside. In the present conflict of nations, neutral countries judge exclusively according to their sentiments. The motives are hundredfold, and we cannot even approximate the leading ones. Nor would it matter much to know and explain all of them. The causes of this war may be this or that, but one thing we know for sure: They dictate only in rare instances the attitudes which people have toward the great powers that are now locked in deadly combat. Even if the Germans had not "devastated" Belgium, the Americans would harbor a profound suspicion toward them just the same. The conquest of Belgium only lent their hatred an aura of justification. On the other hand, if England had outmaneuvered Germany, had reached the Rhine in record time and given battle to the Germans, hardly any American newspaper would have concealed its satisfaction over the violation of neutrality [by the British]. Is there anyone naive enough to believe that the Americans, now anti-German, would have directed their sympathies toward Germany in that case? Americans could have found enough valid reasons to show a little sympathy for the Germans. The annexation of Kiaochow and several small islands in the Pacific [by Japan] should have been sufficient to arouse American sympathies, not to mention the brutal fact that the whole world had taken up arms against Germany. But what's the use?</p>
   <p>Let us not indulge in illusions!</p>
   <p>We can believe the English novelist and author, Arnold Bennett, when he says that seventy-five per cent of the Anglo-American public are considered "allies" by the English, and that their emotions are constantly being whipped up by the propaganda word "Belgium". It would be hard to prove the accuracy of this percentage, but deep in his heart the American cultivates the "bonds of racial unity" and these sentiments will last as long as he lives. No resolutions or speeches will ever change that. Let us be fair and grant those Anglo-Saxons the same privilege which we ourselves would demand.</p>
   <p>The Germans would harbor the same feelings for their own people, even if the latter were in the wrong. They would simply be incapable of recognizing that wrong! Nor could Latins, Slavs, or Anglo-Saxons perceive any fault with their own nationalities. If mankind should ever reach the level of judging things from a loftier vantage point, divorced from the influence of nationalistic emotions, then the millenium would indeed be with us! That life on earth would also become very boresome, should not worry us today. There was a good reason to put heaven some place in the great beyond: the founders of religions knew that "there never could be heaven on earth."</p>
   
   <p>All we can do under prevailing circumstances is to let everyone have his own opinion and not attempt to correct him unless somebody else's rights are involved. We Germans should prove by our actions that we are looking at things from a higher plane than the platform of nationalistic aspirations, otherwise it would ill behoove us to call ourselves "the nation of philosophers". Even at that we would still remain partial enough, because we could never extirpate from our minds our individual national pride. But since this also holds true of other nations, things will remain in balance. We must always remember that there is no such a thing as an absolutely impartial judge, and there never will be. Nor are there two human beings who so closely resemble each other that you could not tell one from the other. The Germans who have become citizens of this country have renounced their allegiance to their former sovereign. But they were never asked to renounce their German mind, their Volkstum [racial heritage], and their native sentiments, because these are spiritual values which one cannot take off like wearing apparel. The oath of allegiance to this Republic cannot be construed to mean that one must abide by the dictates of a political party or a temporary national trend of public opinion. The oath of allegiance merely compels us--and with sensible people no compulsion would be necessary anyway--to observe the laws of the land.. Germans do not balk at that. They regard law and order as progress, as the moral obligation of an organized human society. In this respect they excel all other nations. They do not need any compulsion to be adjusted to civilized life.</p>
   <p>If the American way of thinking remains foreign to the majority of Germans over here, it is the fault of that way of thinking. Regardless of how satisfied Americans may be with their own institutions, to the Germans they seem immature and primitive. The Government, from the President down to the tiniest county administration, is identical with the party in power, and, in turn, the party is the Government. This is not the fault of the Government, the county administration, or that particular party. Circumstances make for this condition. The entire American governmental structure is based on the party system. That is why no administration can ever rise above party politics. This fundamental evil breeds all other evils. It starts with the president and his party, which are praised because of "the bumper crop we had this year," and it winds up in Kankakee County, where potatoes grew to gigantic proportions because "the Republicans were in power then". The most widely read newspapers in the country blame the Democratic party for the "bad times we are having". When the Republicans are in power, then they are responsible, depending on whether the times happen to be "good" or "bad". "Although that man does not belong to my party, I nevertheless must agree with him on this point." We hear this kind of remark so often that it alone would prove how the "proud citizens" are prone to regard everything from a purely partisan point of view. Now, is it the fault of the Germans if they occasionally find this type of "Americanism" somewhat ridiculous? Of course there are Germans who unconsciously fall into the same habit, as a defense mechanism, so to speak. They don't realize that they are doing the opposite of what they should do in the interest of this Republic. It is inevitable that Germans, too, must belong to some party, and if they like to get caught in this quagmire of muddled thinking, all they have to do is emulate the native Americans and let all their actions be dictated by party politics. If, on the other hand, there is still a spark of the German spirit left in them, they will endeavor to solve cultural problems without the prompting and persuasion of some political quack or demagogue, and to help make this Republic a truly civilized nation. Their education and their number warrant this German co-operation in national affairs. More than that, because of their citizenship and oath of allegiance, they are even obligated to co-operate. But it takes tact and knowledge! Both will be available if encouraged and cultivated.</p>
   <p>These are thoughts which, to judge by the hundreds of "voices from the people," express the desires and ideas of a large section of the population.</p>
