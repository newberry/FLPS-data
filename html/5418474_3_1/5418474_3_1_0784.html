   <p>The Group "Vorwarts" (Forward) held yesterday evening at 120 Wells Street, a well attended agitation meeting. Comrade Manke presided. According to the order of the day, Comrade Fricke lectured about Mexico. Considering that he lived there for several years, he was in a position to give a true picture about the country, its population and the conditions of the working classes. The lecture was very interesting and was well received. After this, Comrade Miller held a "political weekly review" which was supplemented by several comrades.</p>
