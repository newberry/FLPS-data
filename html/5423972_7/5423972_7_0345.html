   <p>Last Monday a meeting of all painters of the city of Chicago was held at the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fishkind thanked the painters of Chicago for their noble undertaking, that of painting the Hebrew Institute gratis.</p>
   <p>The meeting was conducted to the satisfaction of the officers. An offer of eighty-five days of work for the Institute was the high light of this meeting.</p>
   <p>The Painters' Aid Society has taken a very active part in this movement and it is to be hoped that the undertaking will be a success.</p>
   <p>A committee was sent out to obtain necessary materials. Work will begin in the near future.</p>
   
   <p>All those who wish to make contributions of time or materials should contact Mr. Lipson at 254 Washburn Avenue, or Mr. Morgolis at 587 W. 13th Street.</p>
