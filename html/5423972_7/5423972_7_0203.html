   <p>Last Sunday evening, at the banquet given in honor of Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, president of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, it was formally announced that the institution's name had been changed to the Jewish People's Institute. Dr. Emil G. Hirsch and Julius Rosenwald spoke in favor of the change. The latter at that time gave one hundred thousand dollars toward the one million dollar building fund of the Institute and its branches, which it plans to organize in various parts of the city. None of the directors of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, who were present at the banquet, spoke against this plan. Even Mr. N. D. Kaplan, who always stood adamant against any change of name, remained silent this time, and, therefore, one can say with certainty that the new name has been adopted.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewish People's Institute means just as much as the Chicago Hebrew <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Institute meant. The chief and only difference in the two names is that the word Hebrew is missing. The word Hebrew is no longer favored by the German Jews or the native born American Jews. There was a time when they insisted upon the term Hebrew rather than Jewish. They flooded the editorial offices of the English newspapers with requests that the newspapers, in their columns, should call them Hebrews, instead of Jews. The anti-Semitic gentiles, who always try to make fun of the Jews, began to picture the Hebrew as a man who always wears a derby over his ears, which, when knocked down, falls way down over his face, making him a comic, mirth-provoking sight. The German-or American-born Jew began to be ashamed of the word Hebrew and sought refuge in the word Jew.</p>
   <p>It is a matter of utter indifference to our brothers in Eastern Europe whether they are called Hebrews or Jews. They know that they are persecuted, hated, made fun of, not because they are known by either of these two names, but because they are Jews. When Mr. Kaplan and others opposed the change in the name of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, it was only because the Jewish public in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>this and other cities were accustomed to that name, and because the name had become a symbol for them.</p>
   <p>But what is a name? Nothing. The main thing is--what is done under the name. There is no doubt that a great deal will be done under the new name of the Institute. Mr. Philip Seman, the capable superintendent of the Institute, characterized the work in the following brief and expressive words: "to form social centers where children and adults shall be able to spend their free time in the gymnasium, classes in English, orchestras, entertainments, and many other forms of recreation".</p>
   <p>This is not enough, gentlemen of the Institute. As Dr. Hirsch says: "The Institute will become a Jewish center only when it embraces Jewish culture and the Jewish religion". This is worth fighting for and Mr. Kaplan can start to organize his forces for that purpose.</p>
