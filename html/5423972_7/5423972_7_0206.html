   <p>A campaign to raise $1,000,000 for recreational, educational and social activities was launched by the Chicago Hebrew Institute at a banquet in the Standard Club.</p>
   <p>There are 100,000 Jews in the Lawndale District, and 75,000 Jews on the Northwest Side with no social or educational activities of a practical character, today.</p>
   <p>A survey will be made to determine the needs in the communities, and branches will be established in the thickly populated districts of the city.</p>
   <p>Julius Rosenwald subscribed $100,000 to the fund. Nearly 800 persons gathered for the banquet, and it was voted to change the name of the Chicago Hebrew Institute to the Jewish People's Institute of Chicago.</p>
