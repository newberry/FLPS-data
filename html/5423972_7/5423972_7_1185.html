   <p>It is bad enough that American Jewry, which is divided into three camps, namely: the German Jews and their temples, the workers and their trade unions, and the Orthodox Jews and their synagogues, speak three different languages. But when nationally minded Jews pretend to ignore the [need for] mutual understanding, then the situation becomes deplorable as well as ridiculous. It is, perhaps, difficult for an altruistic Zionist to understand a Poale Zionist because the socialist paraphernalia is strange to the altruistic Zionist. But the various attitudes to religious problems should not be a barrier between Zionist and Poale Zionist to the extent that they would refuse to try to understand each other, and to work together. We consider the inimical relationship between the Mizrachi and the Zionist organization simply scandalous. We do not wish, at present, to express an opinion as to who is to blame for this inimical relationship, which makes it almost impossible for both groups to work harmoniously. But the situation itself is scandalous.</p>
   
   <p>The Zionist organization in America decided to launch a campaign for ten million dollars, and the campaign is already under way in many cities. The Mizrachi also decided upon a two million dollar drive, which has already begun. Both organizations seek financial assistance for the same goal--Palestine. In principle, the same [thing] is desired by both--a homeland for the Jewish people. The Mizrachi even adds to this program, a homeland founded on the Torah. The Mizrachi is justified in making this addition and the Zionist Congress conceded this right by granting autonomy to the Mizrachi. This addition to the general Zionist program should not, under any circumstances, stand as an obstacle in the path of peaceful co-operation in every field of Zionist endeavor. Nevertheless, no peace exists between the two Zionist organizations. The aim of both is identical, yet in attaining this aim, each employs tactics which are distinctly different from the other's. This is a ridiculous and at the same time, a tragic situation. From this strife in our own ranks, no good can come, and the greatest sufferer will be Palestine. The Jewish public, to whom both appeal for the same purpose, will be in a dilemma: it may refuse assistance to either of the two organizations, or it may not give as much as it would have if a mutual appeal had been made.</p>
   
   <p>Our readers are familiar with the stand of the Courier apropos the Zionist drive for ten million dollars. We have expressed our opinion as follows: it is necessary either to undertake a drive for at least fifty million dollars, in order to begin the great constructive work in Palestine, or to inaugurate a three million dollar drive, just to continue the present work in Palestine. To our way of thinking, ten million dollars, is neither here nor there. But, the Zionist organization has decided upon a ten million dollar drive, and every Jew to whom the cause of Palestine is dear, must help to make the drive a success. Yet, that success is doubtful, if the two Zionist groups are torn apart and do not work in harmony.</p>
   <p>We do not know how the drive is progressing in other cities, or what the public's reaction is to the double appeal of the Zionist and the Mizrachi organizations. But as far as Chicago is concerned, we do know that a double appeal will do more harm than good, both financially and morally. In Chicago, every effort must be made to get both groups to work together. The Jewish public of Chicago knows very well by now that the only valuable and constructive relief work is to build a home for our people in Palestine, and knowing this, it is prepared to contribute liberally to the cause of Palestine on the condition that unity shall be the first step toward a successful Zionist drive in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We appeal to both groups to make peace at the eleventh hour; we urge them not to approach the public with two separate appeals, because such an action will harm them both and because Palestine will suffer by it. We want to say to both groups that if they will work in harmony, the Jewish press will do everything in its power to help make the drive a success, but if the two groups each go their own way, then the Jewish press is powerless to do anything for either group, because it cannot interfere in a "brotherly fight"--it must remain neutral. Neither of the groups can expect the drive to be successful without the assistance of the Jewish press in Chicago, because the success of any drive depends largely upon the aid given it by the press.</p>
   <p>We appeal to both parties--Make peace! Work together! Do not issue separate appeals and do not confuse the public! Do not create a situation in which the Jewish press will be unable to help either of you, but try to work together with the press in issuing a clear appeal to the public so that the latter will respond to it at once.</p>
   <p>We are aware that the president of the Zionist organization is Judge Julian Mack of Chicago. As the highest official of the Zionist organization, and as an experienced judge, it seems as though he would have no difficulty in bringing peace between both Zionist groups. Will he do it?</p>
