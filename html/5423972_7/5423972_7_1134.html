   <p>Attention Countrymen and Friends of Rodomishel:</p>
   <p>You have now the best opportunity to help your brothers and sisters in Rodomishel. They must not freeze this Winter. The New York Relief made arrangements with Dr. Dubrawski from Soviet Russia to send clothes to Rodomishel in three week periods. Get your bundles ready for this Sunday. A committee will visit every house of our countrymen, to collect all the bundles. See to it that the clothes you are sending to your sisters and brothers are thoroughly required and cleaned. On the occasion of the wedding of Deborah Stienberg's daughter a sum of $78.00 was raised for Rodomishelier Relief.</p>
