   <p>The Jewish Shelter Home is at 1214 S. Turner Avenue. The dining room comprising almost an entire floor, with many windows, is kept immaculately clean and well ventilated.</p>
   <p>It is like a parlor in one's own home, always ready to welcome company. Long tables extending from one end of the room to the other, and covered with snow white crisp linen and shining brass candlesticks decorate the centers of the tables, with the blue and red flames of the candles adding cheerfulness and giving a homelike atmosphere.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>There is a reverent air, as if every object in the room were singing praises to the Sabbath Bride. One feels here the spirit of a loving mother who has worked hard, all day long scrubbing, cleaning, cooking, baking, and preparing everything for her beloved family and for guests who will soon come with her husband from the synagogue to enjoy the Sabbath Feast.</p>
   <p>The doors open and multitudes of guests arrive. They are of all ages, old people with blurred eyes and yellow wrinkled faces; middle-aged men, husky but with worried faces and sad eyes; youths with rosy cheeks and bright sparkling eyes. Here is a melting pot of human color and thought, including orthodox Jews with silver white beards, and side locks, still adhering to the old European customs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>One by one they take their seats. The more pious Jews sit at the head of the table and chant the old familiar tune "Peace Unto Thee," with which all the good angels and kind human sentiments are invited into the Jewish home to protect the peaceful Sabbath and to guard - God forbid - against calamities.</p>
   <p>An elderly Jew with a long snow white beard, and dressed in a satin robe, recites the blessings on a beaker of red sparkling wine, and the company joins in the answer, "Amen!"</p>
   <p>After the blessings the feast begins. Huge portions of Gefilte Fish are dished out in the kitchen by an elderly woman with a kind and motherly face, and elderly and middle aged men assist her in theserving.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The guests enjoy the fish tremendously. Their faces become brighter after they have eaten the first course. They start to converse among themselves. A young man in a work shirt tells his neighbor that he just came from Philadelphia to look for work, having heard that conditions were much better here than there. Having been in Chicago for three weeks he has already spent the little money he had and, he said, if it were not for the Shelter Home he would starve.</p>
   <p>Another man relates his troubles. He has been a resident of Chicago for twenty years. Even in the days of plenty, he was unable to make a living for himself and his family. Everything went topsy turvy with him. He believes in luck but he never had any. Now his wife is very ill and the doctor has said she may not last very long. He has ordered her to go to the hospital, but she refuses on account of their two children.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>He comes here to get a meal for himself and sometimes for his family. There are also a few Gentile guests who enjoy especially the Gefilte Fish. They are much pleased with Jewish hospitality.</p>
   <p>One middle aged Gentile with a suntanned face and blue eyes tells his story. He came here from Texas where he was a cow boy. His employers liked him very much but when they sold their ranch, the new boss fired him and hired younger help. He has wandered about the streets of Chicago looking for work, but in vain. A mere coincidence brought him here tonight. This is the first time in his life that he has eaten a Jewish meal on a Jewish holiday.</p>
   <p>The administration of the Shelter Home and Mr. Riss, the president, adhere to the old Talmudic saying, "We should feed the poor Jews together with the poor Gentiles, regarldess of nationality and creed, to establish friendship and peace."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Near the Gentile sits a Jew, dressed in a soiled, shabby and discolored satin robe, who wears side locks and a Van Dyke beard and on his head is a black velvet derby, wrinkled and soiled.</p>
   <p>This Jew came, a short time ago, from Poland. He is the author of a Rabbinical dissertation dealing with various laws of the Talmud.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago to sell his work but no one will buy it. The only place where he is treated with respect is at the Shelter Home.</p>
   <p>Between the courses, songs are chanted by the more religious Jews. They tell charming tales of Sabbath rest, of a home of plenty, of fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers, of happiness and hope.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>An elderly Jew with a thin flute-like voice comes every Saturday to entertain the guests. He is a social worker living in the neighborhood. He and another Jew are the choir leaders here.</p>
   <p>When the singing is in full swing, golden brown chicken soup with noodles is served, followed by huge portions of roast beef and luscious carrots cooked in sugar and fat (called zimes) and then comes dessert.</p>
   <p>The Gentile guests are thrilled and astonished that people should sing as they eat. They perhaps thank that Jews are a funny people. After the first shift finishes, the tables are cleared and the second shift is served. About 75 guests are fed on Friday night and Saturday dinner, and on holidays and week-days a much higher number.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The second floor is the dormitory. This room is remarkably clean. The sheets and pillow cases are sparkling white. The dormitory accommodates about 40 people and very often in an emergency, beds are prepared on the floor. There is also a dormitory for women. Since the free kitchen on Roosevelt Road closed the number of poor has increased considerably, and the administration of the Shelter Home is confronted with hard problems.</p>
   <p>The income of this institution formerly came from donations and dues given principally by the working class and small merchants. But since the economic crisis the former supporters are able to contribute hardly anything.</p>
   <p>The number of guests has increased but not the income. The expenses have tripled. The sincere and devoted workers of the home are worried about the present situation and are asking the old poet's question: "From where will come my aid?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Early in the evening, many of the guests go down to the basement which serves as a library. The basement is well ventilated and nicely furnished. The more fortunate ones, those who remain for the night, sit there and read. The others go out in the darkness of the night and look for a place to sleep.</p>
