   <p>A workroom, where girls and women may be given employment during the winter, will soon be established at W. 12th and S. Halsted streets by fifteen Jewish charity societies. A public nursery is now conducted at the same locality, and the workroom will be operated in connection with it, thus providing a haven for children while their mothers are engaged in their work. The workroom is non-sectarian and is designed to give employment to unskilled labor.</p>
