   <p>Today is a holiday in Chicago; it is a day of great Social and historical significance for the local Jewish radical-nationalist circles. The intelligent and sensitive Jewish workers of Chicago will demonstrate today, in a practical way, their solidarity with the historically significant work of the Jewish workers in Palestine, who are helping to build a new life and a better Jewish Society there.</p>
   <p>At ten o'clock this morning, at the Douglas Park Auditorium, a conference will be held of representatives of unions and other organizations. This conference will inaugurate the campaign in Chicago for the great proletarian undertaking of "A Jewish Workers' Bank In Palestine". We hope that the conference will be successful, and that the Jewish workers of Chicago will help their comrades who are engaged in productive, self-sacrificing labor in their new home; we hope <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that they will release the productive work of the Palestinian workers from dependence upon philanthropic support and supervision, and will help them to realize their proletarian-nationalist ideals on a new soil by their financial contributions.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that many Jewish unions, Workmen's Circle branches, as well as Poale Zion, Ziere Zion, and other radical-nationalist organizations, have elected delegates who will all take part in this conference. Berel Katzenelensohn, the leader of the Palestine Workers' Delegation, and Dr. Judah Leb Magnes, the well-known Jewish Social worker and speaker, came here from prises of the Jewish workers in Palestine. These enterprises require the financial support, not only of the workers, but also of those well-to-do Jews, who feel themselves to be Jews, and want to see a prosperous Palestine.</p>
   <p>The initiative of the local workers, with regard to this great Palestinian enterprise, will be shown tonight at the conference, at eight o'clock. There <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>will be a mass meeting at the Ashland Auditorium, where both guests, Katzenelensohn and Magnes, as well as the well-known journalist, Kritchmar-Israeli, will appeal to the Jewish masses to help the Palestine workers in their undertaking. There will be a musical program, in which the artists, Joseph Chernievsky, Madame L. Cherniavsky, Victor Young, and others will participate.</p>
   <p>Jewish workers and Jews! Come to the mass meeting tonight at the Ashland Auditorium! Come and help a great and Sacred undertaking!</p>
   <p>Jewish workers, Zionists, and all those who feel themselves to be Jews! See that you are there. Those who find it impossible to attend, are also expected to do their duty. The Palestine Workers' Bank, as has been announced many times in the Courier, faces great and important tasks. It wants to take over government contracts for public work. It also wants to take over private contracts. In this way, it will be able to give employment to thousands of workers. The <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Palestine workers' Bank, which is a co-operative workers' bank (a legal institution, established according to the laws of the local government), will make possible the creation of new co-operative businesses and co-operative farms.</p>
   <p>The Palestine Workers' Bank has the approval of the World Zionist Organization, and of other small, conservative Jewish organizations. Dr. Arthur Ruppin is at the head of this enterprise, and he is a good guarantee for its success.</p>
   <p>In his report to the annual meeting of the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities, held at the Hotel La Salle last Thursday night, Max Shulman, the financial secretary of the Federation, touched upon the question of Jewish education in Chicago. He said that when the Federation was founded here, it was expected to become a clearing house for the Jewish community life, and, therefore, a few Talmud Torahs became a part of the Federation. "But," added Mr. Shulman, "We see now that the Jewish educational problem is a much greater one than we thought; that the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Federation has to maintain more than a few Talmud Torahs." Mr. Shulman proposed, therefore, that just as the Federation seeks to take care of all the old people and all the orphans, it should also seek to take care of all those who need a Jewish education--it should maintain more Talmud Torahs than it has up to now.</p>
   <p>This is a timely proposal and it should be supported by all those who wish the Federation well, and who wish to see our youth, the children of Orthodox Jews, receive a Jewish education.</p>
   <p>It is not a good plan to separate the Talmud Torah from the Federation. If the Talmud Torahs are separated from the Federation, the Federation will be crippled because the Orthodox Jews are interested no only in giving food to the hungry, but also in strengthening Judaism, in strengthening the concept of Judaism, in seeing that the Jewish traditions are maintained, so that Jews and Judaism may continue to exist.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>What kind of an interest can the Orthodox Jews, the Jews who belong to fraternal lodges, and Jews who have not yet become Reform Jews, show in the Federation, when that organization is interested only in food, and does not care about the spirit? We are more than sure that those Jews will lose a great deal of their interest in the Federation, when it becomes merely a food-provider. We can imagine what this will mean: the Federation will not have sufficient funds, and its amalgamation with the Associated [Jewish Charities] will become more difficult.</p>
   <p>There is only one way in which the Federation can be strengthened, and the time required for its impending merger with the South Side organization shortened, and that is to show the supporters of the Federation, the Orthodox Jews, that "charity" is interpreted in the full sense of the word--"justice". There cannot be any justice among the Jews if they permit their children to grow up uneducated. There cannot be any justice among the Jews if they waste time in fighting various propositions, in fighting for a plan that is both impractical and harmful.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>We cannot, we must not, establish a state within a state. We cannot create a separate body to collect money for education. We do not have the strength and we do not have the philanthropists. It will be much easier to persuade the present contributors to the Federation to give more money, and then the organization will be able to take care of all the Talmud Torahs.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Orthodox Jews of Chicago will be more satisfied when our two charity organizations unite.</p>
