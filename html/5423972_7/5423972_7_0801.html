   <p>The Independent Sisters of Charity, an organization that has been in existence for many years and which does important work in the field of charity--this year it distributed over five thousand dollars--was the first to respond to the appeal for Ma-oth Hitim [Translator's note: Practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy]. The organization sent in a check for fifty dollars for this purpose. The most active workers of this organization are: Mrs. J. Oberman, Mrs. P. Pritikin, Mrs. Fanny Goldfein, Mrs. Shuman and Mrs. Rewa Shekman.</p>
