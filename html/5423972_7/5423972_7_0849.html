   <p>The "Association for the Incurably Sick Jews" in Oak Forest has become affiliated with the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities. The six thousand dollars which the Association has contributed annually for the maintenance of a [kosher] kitchen and a social center at the institution, will be contributed, from now on, by the central charity organization.</p>
   <p>Several meetings were held by committees representing both organizations before it was decided that the Association should become a part of the Federation. The committee representing the Federation consisted of Judge Joseph B. David, Judge Harry M. Fisher, Rabbi Saul Silber, John Rissman and Max Grossman. The committee for the Association consisted of Paul Rissman, B. Morris, H. M. Barnett, Mrs. Benjamin, Adolph Cohen, and Martin Edelstein.</p>
