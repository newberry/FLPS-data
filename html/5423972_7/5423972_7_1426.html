   <p>Sunday, after the holiday of Shavuoth [Pentecost], young Jewish girls will go out to sell flowers in order to increase the income of the Jewish National Fund. We learn that this year twice as many Zion's daughters have heeded the call of the Zionist Organization as volunteered in previous years as saleswomen. This is a good sign for the National Fund and still a better one for the Zionist Movement. The enthusiasm of the Jewish youth for the National Fund can be applauded, therefore,with real satisfaction by all Jews.</p>
