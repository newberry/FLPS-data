   <p>The relief conference of the Jewish Kehiloth and [other] organizations of seven middle western states, which opens this morning in Chicago, promises to become the most important conference of this type that has ever been held. Mr. B. Horwich is to act as chairman. The present relief conference is not only stronger in numbers, it is also better organized, better planned and has a fixed organizational purpose, which it is striving to attain. Considering the preparations that have been made, and the clarity of the program which the conference is undertaking, it should become a milestone in the history of Jewish relief work in America.</p>
   <p>Many people believe that Chicago and the Middle West have reached their maximum in relief work, and that they cannot collect any more than was collected last year. This belief is absolutely groundless. The truth is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that when the organization improves sufficiently, Chicago alone will be able to treble its quota for relief--and when we speak of Chicago, we naturally think of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago. The Jewish middle class of Chicago, which is in very good economic circumstances, has not done nearly enough for our unfortunate brothers and sisters across the sea. Orthodox Chicago alone can give a half-million dollars annually for relief, without even feeling it, and if, at present, it is giving only one third of that which it can and must give, it is because the organization is inadequate, and because the whole relief work of Chicago's bureau rests upon three or four individuals.</p>
   <p>When you attend a meeting of the Joint Relief Committee, you will always find the same individuals present. Time and time again, you will find B. Horwich, S. J. Rosenblatt, Rabbi Saul Silber, and Isadore Liederman there. We know that one swallow maketh not summer, neither do three swallows. In order for Chicago to attain the maximum in relief work, it is necessary that there be thirty [active workers], instead of the four mentioned above.</p>

   <p>Perhaps the conference won't be able to gain new forces for relief work, but it can strengthen the old forces and improve the organization. Since the relief conference consists of delegates from seven states, all the reforms which the conference will inaugurate to enlarge and strengthen the relief work, will be of great importance not only to Chicago, but to the entire Middle West. This alone justifies the calling of the conference.</p>
   <p>But the present relief conference has another great organizational and political purpose. It is attempting, once and for all, to centralize the relief work in the Middle West and to take the central authority away from New York. The National headquarters must remain in New York, but the Middle West must have a certain amount of autonomy and liberty of action. It cannot be entirely dependent upon New York for each step it wants to undertake. When it is wholly dependent upon New York, it has no influence upon the latter. But if it were more or less autonomous, it could have a great influence upon New York, and could help to decide how, and in what spirit, the money should be distributed. If the Middle West had its rightful and deserved influence <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>upon New York, then the entire relief administration of Poland would be different. Other commissioners would be sent there and the money would be distributed differently. The question, therefore, is debatable as to what is more important: to distribute bread among the hungry, or to support Talmud Torahs and Yeshivoth in order that the young generation of Polish Jews shall not grow up completely ignorant. Yet there can be no doubt that not even one cent of the relief monies should be spent for radical schools.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish radicals in America want to support radical schools in Poland, let them make a collection among their friends for this purpose. The few cents which the poor worker of America gives for relief, is given to secure bread for the hungry and not for radical schools which are loaded with dynamite beneath their Jewish foundation. When Jews of the Middle West, who are conservatively inclined, have their rightful influence upon New York, then the looting of the relief treasury by the radicals, will stop. It is, therefore, important that the Jews of the Middle West should become organized as <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>a unit in the relief work, and that is what the present conference is striving for. It's motto is: more money from the Middle West for relief, and more influence upon New York.</p>
