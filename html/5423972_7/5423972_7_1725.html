   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I have a new proposition to make, and that is: To advise our reformed Jews to stop being ashamed of our orthodox Jews, and if they will really do so, we shall accept their proposal for their support of the Home for the Aged, and the Orphan Home, and the latter will cease running affairs, and in this way, the Jews in Chicago wouldn't be played in a disagreeable position.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>S. K.</p>
