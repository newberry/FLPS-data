   <p>Kind-Hearted Folks.</p>
   <p>Persons who last Thursday were present at the meeting of the Bread for the Hungry Society, in order to distribute bread for needy families for Sabbath, have gathered a definite impression of a part of our Jewish philanthropists in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Israel Lansky and Mr. Ben Ettelson, both well known citizens in Chicago, who give charity at all times, were greatly interested in the distribution of food to needy families, and gave $150.00, out of their own pockets, to be distributed among the poor Jewish women, who came there for help.</p>
