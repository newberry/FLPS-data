   <p>Last night, at a fish dinner at the Standard Club, a campaign was launched to raise $250,000 and to increase old and collect new subscriptions for the Jewish Charities of Chicago. Those who attended the dinner pledged $40,000. The chairman of the evening, who is also chairman of the campaign, was Sol Klein. He explained the purpose of the gathering and urged those present to pledge $40,000 immediately in order to supply funds to twenty-seven [charitable] institutions, including the Mt. Sinai Hospital, which has become affiliated with the central charity organization.</p>
   <p>Stirring appeals were also made by Judge Henry Horner, Julius Rosenwald, Judge Harry M. Fisher, and Abel Davis. More than one hundred teams will canvass the city to gather new, and increase old subscriptions.</p>
