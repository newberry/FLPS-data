   <p>The special meeting of subscribers to the fund for the Home was held last Monday night at the Standard Club, and was well attended. The drafted by-laws, as already adopted by the Directors, were presented and, with a few minor changes, adopted.</p>
   <p>Among the more important features of these by-laws are the following:</p>
   <p>The name is "Home for Aged Jews, of Chicago."</p>
   <p>The membership is divided into three classes: Life members, patrons and members. The payment of $500 entitles one to a life membership; patrons pay $25 annually, and members $10 annually. The payment of dues will commence with January, 1892.</p>
   <p>The management and administration of affairs will be vested in a Board of Directors composed of sixteen gentlemen and nine ladies, who will have full charge and control of all business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Directors will elect from among their own number the regular officers of the organization.</p>
   <p>An Executive Committee will have general supervision of the Home, make the rules and regulations, and have power to accept or reject all applicants for admission. A Visiting Committee of ladies will make it a duty to inspect the Home each week.</p>
   <p>The articles bearing on applications are as follows:</p>
   <p>Applications for admission to the "Home" must be in writing, according to the form adopted by the board of directors, giving the birth-place and age of the applicant, stating whether male or female, single or married, widower or widow.

The <span class="page-break">3</span>application shall thereupon, be referred to the Executive Committee, or, in extraordinary cases, to a special committee to be appointed by the President, and all applications, except in extraordinary cases, shall be acted upon at the expiration of one month from the receipt of such applications, and the committee acting thereon shall report in writing at the next following meeting of the Board of Directors. Such a report shall show a full investigation of the merits of the applicant with the committee's reasons for the admission or rejection of the applicant. Before admission to the "Home" every applicant must be examined by one of its physicians.
