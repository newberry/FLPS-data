   <p>The Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities is without a doubt the mother of all Orthodox Jewish Charitable organizations. It feeds all [charitable] institutions. The healthier and stronger the mother is the better attention can she give her children, so that they should not lack anything that they are in need of. If the mother is wealthy, she can supply her children with luxuries and more comforts.</p>
   <p>The Federation, as a mother, should also realize that all institutions are her children. A poor child is as much a child as is a rich one. A sickly child having a physical defect should get the same attention as does a strong, healthy child. On the other hand, a devoted mother will share more attention to her weaker child and will help him more.</p>
   <p>According to reports, the Federation is at present financially embarrassed.</p>

   <p>We do not wish to delve into the question as to why the Federation is worse off now than it was a year ago at this time. This can probably be attributed to the bad times in general, or possibly the change in management is responsible. Whatever the reason may be, it is nevertheless a fact that the Federation is now in debt. Enough money is not coming in to cover the expenses of the institutions. The result is that the various institutions do not receive the requisite sums on time, and it is but natural that at the regular meetings of the respective institutions, the various Boards of Directors are confronted with the question of what to do in case the mother becomes poverty-stricken.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that the well-to-do institutions, which have reserve funds, do not fear an impending crisis so much. The real small institutions, whose expenses only amount to a couple of hundred dollars a month, and which always resort to beggary, are but little concerned with the future. But let us take for instance an institution like the Marks Nathan Orphanage, which must provide for 250 orphans. It hasn't a cent in its treasury nor has it received any money from the Federation for expenses for the month of January, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>notwithstanding the fact that we are so far advanced in March. Is it then a wonder why the question of finances is discussed at a meeting of the Board of Directors, where a director or two propose various plans as how to safeguard themselves against desperate visitations?</p>
   <p>In such an event it should therefore not be regarded as a royal insult by the officers of the Federation, who have determined to appoint a committee to "investigate" this "royal insult" and give this institution a lesson so that the directors will not have the arrogance to speak about this matter again.</p>
   <p>The Federation is a mother, not a King, Czar, or Kaiser. The desire to punish for such a wrong can only lead to unfriendly relationships between the Federation and the institutions. The Federation has no "subjects," and there is no reason why such a committee need be appointed. If it is appointed, it should not investigate anything.</p>
