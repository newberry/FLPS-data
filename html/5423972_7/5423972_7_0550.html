   <p>The annual banquet and meeting of the Chicago Jewish Charities will take place on Sunday evening, January 27, at the Hotel La Salle. The banquet will begin at six-thirty. Those who cannot be present at the banquet, are invited to attend the meeting, which will begin at eight o'clock at the same place. There will be no collection speech, as is the usual custom at such meetings. This meeting will be, however, a signal for the [opening of the] campaign to raise the funds necessary to run this central charity organization. There are subscribers who are behind [in their pledges], there are people who are not subscribers, and there are the regular subscribers--they all have to open their hearts and pocketbooks and give generously to charity. All have to be reminded of the sacred duty they have of providing for our poor, sick, lonely, and helpless widows and orphans, our old men and old women. You will be called upon to do your share of this noble work.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Jewish Charities provide funds to the following institutions: two hospitals, two old people's homes, two orphan homes, Winfield Sanitarium, Chicago Consumptive Relief Society, Home Finding Society, Social Service Bureau, Jewish Free Employment Bureau, Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society, and the Jewish department at Oak Forest. The Chicago Jewish Charities also contribute to the support of some of our educational institutions. Its annual budget is about one million two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, which sum must be raised.</p>
   <p>Make all your arrangements to be present at the meeting on Sunday evening, January 27, at the Hotel La Salle. You will find there the most prominent, active, and respected Jewish men and women of our community. You will hear reports on the work of the Chicago Jewish Charities. You will help to elect directors for each of the above-mentioned institutions which are affiliated with the central charity organization, and which receive from it funds for their maintenance.</p>
