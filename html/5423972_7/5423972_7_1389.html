   <p>(Special to the Courier), New York, June 13: One hundred and nine delegates, representing fifty-three units in different cities, came to the first joint convention of the Red Moggen David (Shield of David--six-pointed Jewish star). The New York unit, which was the first one organized, now numbers 1,500 members; the Chicago unit, headed by Dr. Celia Davis, now numbers 1,000 members; and the Philadelphia unit numbers 500.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, at the opening of the convention, Mrs. Ruskin, the organizer of the Red Moggen David, told of the work of this organization. She said that hitherto its work consisted of supplying the [Jewish] legionnaires with kits, sweaters, and food, before they left for Windsor, Canada. The plan to send nurses to Palestine has been temporarily abandoned.</p>
   <p>At first the Red Moggen David intended to join the Red Cross. However, since <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Hadassah has been officially recognized by the government, the Red Moggen David has united with this Zionist women's organization which has been supplying the Jews of Palestine with medicine and other necessities over a long period of time.</p>
   <p>Dr. Elsberg, president of the Jewish Legion organization, caused quite an uproar when he stated that the Zionists were planning to take the legionnaire movement under their supervision. The sentiment was against the Zionist plan.</p>
