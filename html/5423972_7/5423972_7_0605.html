   <p>Few Jews are familiar with the fact that in 1934, England will have to give Palestine to the majority of its population at that time. If the majority are Jews, Palestine will have a Jewish government; if the Arabs constitute the majority, then Palestine will have an Arabian government, and the Arabs will do what they please. They will have the power to close the doors of the country. They will have control of the whole government machinery, which will make it difficult for us because we will constitute a large minority. Experience has long taught us that a small majority in a country persecutes a large minority more than a large majority a small minority.</p>
   <p>Thirteen years hence, we must have a Jewish majority in Palestine, or we will not be able to have Palestine as a Jewish homeland. The sort of government that Palestine is to have in 1934 depends upon us American Jews. If we do our duty to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] and if we see to it that at least twenty-five thousand Jews emigrate, then Palestine will have a Jewish majority thirteen years hence; otherwise, Palestine will remain for all time an Arabian country.</p>
   <p>Today there are 130,000 Jews in Palestine. The present Jewish immigration to Palestine is small. It does not exceed ten thousand Jews a year. If the Keren Hayesod had an income of at least six million dollars a year, we would be able to send [a good many] more halutzim into the land, and we would be able to make them economically independent in a very short time. With its present income, the Keren Hayesod can rehabilitate only a few thousand halutzim a year in Palestine, and this is not enough to establish, in thirteen years, a Jewish majority in the country.</p>
   <p>At present there are 400,000 Arabs in Palestine; forty or fifty thousand of them are Christians and constitute the real opponents [to Jewish immigration]. The Mohammedan Arabs do not increase; on the contrary, they are decreasing because the rich effendis are selling their land and are emigrating to Syria. The Arabian middle class is also emigrating--if not by the thousands, then by the hundreds. In the course of the next ten years, at least 40,000 Arabs will have emigrated from Palestine. During the next ten years, we must send 250,000 Jews into Palestine, and in the following three years, an additional seventy-five thousand. If we do that, we shall have a Jewish population of close to one-half million in Palestine in 1934. The Jews in Palestine multiply much faster than the Arabs. The death rate among Jewish children in Palestine is a good deal smaller than among the Arabs because of the unsanitary living conditions of the Arabs.</p>
   <p>We can easily send three hundred thousand Jews into Palestine in the next ten or twelve years. There are no obstacles involved, other than financial difficulties. The sum required to establish a Jewish majority in Palestine is not so large that we will be unable to raise it.</p>
   <p>It all depends upon what we Jews in America do. The Jews in Europe are doing everything they possibly can. If Lodz and Warsaw contribute a half million dollars to the Keren Hayesod, they give more than their share because Chicago's contribution is the same. If Lodz and Warsaw can raise one-half million dollars, Chicago ought to raise ten million.</p>
   <p>America must be the center of this work. If America raises five million dollars for the Keren Hayesod in the next ten years, we will be able to rehabilitate three or three hundred and fifty thousand Jews in the next ten years--and in 1934, Palestine will have a Jewish majority and a Jewish government.</p>
   <p>Remember that Palestine must have a Jewish majority thirteen years from now--or we won't have Palestine.</p>
