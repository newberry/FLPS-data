   <p>We owe thanks to the well-known Chicago wholesale grocery firm, Grossfeld and Roe, because they have undertaken to send kosher food products to the unfortunate Jewish families in Poland and the other war countries.</p>
   <p>It would be impossible to describe in words the dire necessity of rescuing from starvation the millions of Jews in those areas. Little children, women and older people are dying of hunger. It is simply impossible to secure food, even money cannot buy it; that which can be gotten, costs so much that the hungry Jews cannot afford to buy it.</p>
   <p>A popular and reliable grocery firm--which has been known in Chicago as a responsible business house for a quarter of a century--has undertaken the responsibility of sending food to the needy. This means that you may be absolutely certain of its safe delivery, especially when the firm fully guarantees prompt delivery, or refund of your money.</p>
