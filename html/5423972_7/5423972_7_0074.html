   <p>Orthodox Jews of Chicago united in the greatest social event in six years in Jewish circles by the charity ball held for the benefit of the Orthodox home for the aged at the Coliseum, last evening. More than 4,000 persons were in the big hall when the grand march started at 11 P. M. and $5,000 was cleared to assist the annual expenses of the institution. Not since the great ball of the "United Hebrew Charities" has such a largely attended function taken place in Jewish society.</p>
   <p>Given Each Year</p>
   <p>An entertainment for the benefit of the "Beth Mosher Zkeinam Orthodox Home" for the aged is given annually. The yearly expenses of the institution amount to $15,000, and its regular income from membership dues is not more than $10,000. In order to provide for the deficit and establish a sinking fund the committee, each year, appeals to the Jews of the city to support some social undertaking.</p>
   <p>A bazaar, which continued for ten days and netted the institution more than $21,000, was held in the Coliseum last year. A dance, which was held at the Auditorium and was one of the social events of the season, provided for the home in 1903.</p>
   <p>This year when the project of the ball was first mentioned the promise was made, that should it prove a success it would hereafter be the annual means of assisting the home.</p>
