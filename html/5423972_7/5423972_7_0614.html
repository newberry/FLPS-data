   <p>In Hungary the weekly salary of a rabbi is from one to two thousand crowns. In American money, this is about seventy-five cents. Out of this thousand or two thousand crowns, the rabbi must provide for his family. We can readily imagine how his family lives. In Hungary, a pair of phylacteries costs twenty thousand crowns, and if a rabbi has a son who is about to be bar mitzvah, he [the rabbi] and his family must suffer the pangs of hunger in order to be able to purchase a pair of phylacteries for their son.</p>
   <p>In Poland the weekly salary of a rabbi of a small town is from five to twenty thousand marks a week; now just imagine how much a rabbi of a small town in Poland has to deny himself before he can buy shoes for himself and his family. In Poland a pound of bread costs a thousand marks, and if the rabbi happens to <span class="page-break">\2</span>be a father of five or six children, we can readily understand how much bread he can buy for his children.</p>
   <p>How do the rabbi of the small towns in Poland live? Sometimes they do not have enough food; sometimes they long for a piece of bread; sometimes the Central Relief Committee helps them. The fact remains, however, that there is an abundance of bread, and we ought to see to it that they get bread.</p>
   <p>The conditions of the theological seminaries in Russia, Galicia, Poland, and Hungary are no better. The students go hungry. The heads of the theological seminaries are in need, although they try to provide for the students. The entire Orthodox world of learning in Eastern Europe is in need.</p>
   <p>In view of these circumstances, something should and must be done for the rabbis, theological students, and officials of Eastern European communities. True, the official relief work has practically ended, but we can help these <span class="page-break">\3</span>impoverished Jews, who represent the spirit of our people, without an official relief organization. We can raise money and send them that money in an honest, old-fashioned way--i. e., we can send money to those who are in need without any administrative apparatus. With ten or fifteen thousand dollars, we can rescue not only many suffering individuals, but also many institutions, Talmud Torahs, and theological seminaries.</p>
   <p>Our radical groups do everything within their power to raise money for the radical institutions of Eastern and Central Europe. Unfortunately, the Orthodox Jews in America do not organize such activities and do not think of what may happen to the Conservative Jews in Eastern and Central Europe, if they are cut off from their source of livelihood.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to raise millions to help the Orthodox institutions in Europe. We can help them with a mere trifle because, after all, a million Polish marks amount to twenty American dollars. In Poland, however, a million <span class="page-break">\4</span>marks is a huge sum of money. At the present time, a great deal can be accomplished in Poland if we have three hundred million Polish marks--and it is not difficult for us to raise three or four hundred million [Polish] marks to carry the Eastern European Jews through their present crisis.</p>
   <p>The official relief work is over, but relief work must go on. The condition of the Jews in Eastern and Central Europe is no better than what it was a year or two ago. We have become accustomed to their distress, and we have become a bit indifferent to the martyrdom of our people abroad. This does not free us, however, from the duty to help as much as we can. For psychological and political reasons, we cannot organize any more large relief drives, but we must still do our duty--and the Chicago rabbinate will tell you, in the near future, what your duty is.</p>
