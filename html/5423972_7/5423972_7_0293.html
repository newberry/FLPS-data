   <p>The annual meeting of the Chicago Hebrew Institute was held yesterday in the large hall of the Institute. Over 250 members were present listening to the different reports of the officers and of the fourteen elected directors.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened with a half dollar supper which was served under the supervision of Miss Bertha Yarmolinsky. Soon after supper Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the president of the Institute, opened up the regular meeting, introducing Mr. Max Kolio, who made a few special remarks in reference to the good work accomplished by the Institute. Mrs. Julius Stone, the secretary of the Institute, presented her report in which she related her activities and work for the Institute. In conclusion of her report, she thanked the Daily Jewish Courier for its assistance with the <span class="page-break">\2</span>publicity through its worthy columns. Mr. B. J. Schieff, the financial secretary, reported a balance of $3,000.00 on hand in the treasury. Dr. Joseph Pidot, the superintendent, read his report which no doubt is a document that shows all activities of the Institute, and it also shows the popularity of the Doctor among the masses of the Jewish public. Each and every one of the activities undertaken, turned out to be a success. The Hebrew Institute, is a Jewish institution which takes in all classes of Jews. He reports seven English classes in the Institute in which there are four hundred and forty-seven students. Of course not all of them come at one time, but these students come and go at different times during the day and evening.</p>

   <p>THE KINDERGARTEN.</p>
   <p>Thirty-two children come to the Kindergarten of the Chicago Hebrew Institute every day during the summer months. During the winter months, 122 children came to the kindergarten every day, and we had to employ two extra teachers.</p>
   <p>THE TRADE SCHOOL.</p>
   <p>The importance of the trade school is mainly for the benefit of the Jewish immigrant, however, the trade school is intended for the masses as well. The establishment of the trade school is one of the most important undertakings of the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>THE SEWING CLASSES.</p>
   <p>Eighty-one children are taking sewing lessons in our sewing classes. This year, the sewing instructions have been very progressive, the attendance is most regular, and the work is improving rapidly.</p>
   <p>SABBATH AND HEBREW CLASSES.</p>
   <p>One hundred and eighty-six children attend our Hebrew school which is under the supervision of Rabbi Morris Levin. It has five different classes. The classes are being conducted five days a week and the progress of this school is wonderful. The Sabbath School is divided into seven classes, two days in the week, Saturday and Sunday, and it is visited by five hundred children, who are outstanding in the Jewish community. They have their Sabbath and Holiday services in the synagogue of the Institute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>THE SCHOOL OF DRAMA.</p>
   <p>Forty-six pupils attend the dramatic school, who have amateur plays supervised by the Dramatic Club of the Institute. These plays are usually very good and it is quite inspiring to hundreds of people who see these plays. On account of the stage not being fire-proof, the plays are such that the scenery will not have to be changed.</p>
   <p>CONCERTS.</p>
   <p>Last summer the Institute experimented with concerts on the Institute grounds for which they charged ten cents admission, but on account of the free concerts in many parks of the city, it turned out to be a failure. However, during the winter months the concerts were quite successful. They held these concerts in the hall of the Institute and the house was always packed to its capacity. The number of concerts <span class="page-break">\6</span>last winter were only twelve, but next winter we expect to have our concerts regularly every Sunday.</p>
   <p>LIBRARY.</p>
   <p>Our library, which is a branch of the Public Library, regrets to state that it cannot possibly accommodate all the children who come to read, our space for this project is limited. Although our library is one of the smallest branches in the city, the clientele of readers is the largest.</p>
   <p>Men, women and children have made 130,044 calls registering books during the past year. This does not include the number that could not have been accommodated, due to the lack of space in our reading room.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>PLAY ROOM.</p>
   <p>Two hundred and fifty small Jewish children visited the play room every day during the last year. They have lots of different playthings in the play room in which they spend their time playing with the different toys which is furnished by the Institute. The officers of the Institute are constantly thinking how great it would be for the Institute to be in position to have two or three additional play rooms for the children.</p>
   <p>THE INSTITUTE GROUNDS.</p>
   <p>The beautiful spacious grounds of the Hebrew Institute which consists of six acres are provided with all kinds of boy's and girl's play-things, such as a gymnasium, a tennis court, a race track, baseball field, handball court, a vegetable garden for the children, a Kindergarten, <span class="page-break">\8</span>a pavilion for a children's rest room, special swings, fountains, etc., which draws big crowds to this play ground. This is the main reason why the grounds are filled all summer with children, for it is really a children's paradise. Sixty thousand, two hundred and sixty-nine (60,269) children and about eighteen thousand (18,000) adults visited the play grounds last year.</p>
   <p>OUR GYMNASIUM.</p>
   <p>Five hundred and twelve (512) persons are registered in the regular class work of our gymnasium. This work was excellent and 200 per cent more visited the gymnasium this year than last. The membership is continually increasing and it looks very much like a new gymnasium room will have to be built very soon.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>CLUBS AND SOCIETIES.</p>
   <p>Forty-seven (47) different societies have held six hundred and fifty (650) meetings in the Hebrew Institute and it has become a common occurrence and it is taken for granted, that when a society thinks of something important to do, all it has to do, is to apply to the Hebrew Institute and it will furnish them ample room for any meeting or gathering.</p>
   <p>The Immigrants Protective League, the Jewish Agricultural Aid Society, and the Immigration Committee of the Jewish Women Organizations have their regular offices in the Hebrew Institute. National Jewish, as well as American holidays are celebrated with parades and very often these celebrations have to be repeated two or three times to satisfy the large public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Lectures on all subjects are always in progress, on such subjects as general education, history, social activities, etc. These lectures are delivered in both languages, Jewish and English. For some of these lectures a charge of ten cents is made, but most of them are free.</p>
   <p>THE CIVIC BUREAU.</p>
   <p>During the year a bureau was established for the purpose of assisting immigrants in getting their citizen naturalization papers. Two hundred and fifty (250) immigrants, through this bureau have received their naturalization papers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>THE DANCING CLASSES.</p>
   <p>Our dancing classes proved to be very successful and as large as the hall is, it is entirely too small to accommodate the large attendance. The reputation of the Hebrew Institute stands so high and is considered to be so outstanding, that every Jewish mother encourages her children to take dancing lessons at the Hebrew Institute. The Institute takes great pride in selecting the very best dancing teachers obtainable. It spares no expense in employing the best, and with all their liberality they still were able to make a profit of $250.00 in the dancing school. Other activities at the Institute are such as an Essay Club, a public pool room, and a piano school. All these activities are well patronized.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>The directors of the Institute who were elected for a term of three years are as follows:- Israel Koven, Abel Davis, I. B. Lipson, Jacob M. Loeb, Alford Meyer, Samuel Philipson, Benjamin F. Rubel, A. L. Stone, Mrs. Julius Stone, Dr. I. A. Fishkin, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch and Dr. A. B. Yudelson. Mr. Hugo Hartman was elected for one year only.</p>
