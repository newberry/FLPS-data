   <p>Our United Charities, better known as the "Jewish Charities of Chicago," an amalgamation of the Associated and the Federated [Charities], now appeals to the local Jewish public to contribute the sum of $250,000 as the first installment on the $1,300,000 which will be necessary this year to cover the deficit of the twenty-seven [charitable] institutions, including the Mt. Sinai Hospital, in our city. The appeal was issued Monday evening and in the last three days, $150,000 in subscriptions has been pledged. There is no doubt that the appeal will be a success and the entire sum will be raised by April 1.</p>
   <p>In this campaign, the workers of the United Charities have only one-fifth of the names of former subscribers who were listed in the books of the Associated or Federated. In order to raise the required sum, they will not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>only have to reach the rest of the former donors, but will also have to find new subscribers. The prospects for doing so are very favorable.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that there are about three hundred thousand Jews in Chicago which means approximately sixty thousand Jewish families. If we deduct ten thousand whose income is derived from a weekly wage, and six thousand who are dependent on charity, we have a remainder of forty-four thousand families who are middle class and big businessmen, and do not depend on weekly wage earnings.</p>
   <p>The names of all the heads of the forty-four thousand families are not in the books of the United Charities. The books contain scarcely fifteen thousand names. This situation should not exist. There is no reason why a large proportion of those who are able to give, do not fulfill their duty to their less fortunate brothers in our community. We must reach them [the forty-four thousand families], and if they all give as they should, we will be able to accomplish a great deal. The United Charities won't have to make so many <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>drives, and a large burden will be lifted from a minority of Jews. If everyone of the nonparticipants does his duty and gives as much as he should give, many new improvements can be made in our community.</p>
   <p>We need more Talmud Torahs; we need more hospitals--one on the West Side and one on the Northwest Side. We need more dispensaries. The day and night nurseries should be a part of the United Charities. We need [social] centers for our young people. A greater number of poor Jewish children should be taken out into the country during the summer. We should be liberal with those who seek our aid. We should set aside a fund for Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy], and should abolish all individual forms of begging and charitable organizations, which are parasites upon the public. Charity should be given to one central treasury from which it should be distributed.</p>
   <p>The task of enrolling every Jew [as a subscriber to the United Charities] in Chicago, who has made no contribution, but is able to, is a difficult one.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>It may take a year or two; it may be an expensive project, but it will be worth it. The results will be significant and desirable.</p>
   <p>We believe that it is pertinent to list here the institutions maintained by the central treasury of our charities:</p>
   <p>The Jewish Social Service Bureau is the general welfare agency in our community. The Bureau gives aid to poor Jewish families. Some families are given weekly allowances and others are given the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves so that they will not have to seek charity. The Bureau also extends legal aid, if necessary. About 8,000 individuals were given financial assistance last year by this organization.</p>
   <p>The Marks Nathan Orphan Home on Albany Avenue and the orphanage on Drexel Boulevard are supported by the Charities. There are 320 children in the former and 215 in the latter. Orphans are taken care of in these institutions and their well-being is provided for after they leave these institutions.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The Jewish Home-Finding Society took care of 1,200 children last year. More than 800 were maintained in various homes and boarding houses, while others lived with their relatives.</p>
   <p>The records of Michael Reese Hospital show that 8, 347 patients were admitted last year, who were given treatment over a period of 115,527 days. Almost forty-four per cent received medical treatment free of charge. Many poor patients were also given private rooms.</p>
   <p>Three thousand and eight hundred Jewish men and women made 7,300 visits to the Michael Reese Dispensary last year, and the Dispensary doctors made 2,300 visits to patients in their homes.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Winfield Tuberculosis Sanitarium is taking care of 110 patients, one-half of whom do not pay any hospital fees.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Consumptive Relief Society provides milk, eggs, and other necessities <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>to tubercular patients in their homes.</p>
   <p>In the Home for the Aged on Albany Avenue, there are 115 men and women; in addition, there are twenty-five inmates who lie completely helpless in the hospital there. In the Home for the Aged on 62nd Street there are seventy men and women.</p>
   <p>The Aid Association provides for the comfort and spiritual needs of the 200 incurable Jews in Oak Forest.</p>
   <p>Jewish children receive religious instruction in Talmud Torahs and in the [Hebrew] Theological College.</p>
   <p>There is an employment bureau which secures positions for Jewish men and women.</p>
   <p>The Industrial Workshops operate a factory for blind Jews and also maintain shops where sewing and carpet weaving are taught. Volunteers sell the products of these shops. The sales amounted to $59,000 for the year 1922.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The Hebrew Sheltering Home on Morgan Street provides needy itinerants with food and sleeping quarters.</p>
   <p>The Women's Loan Association made loans amounting to $20,000 in the past year. Loans of not more than $100 were extended to those who were in need of them.</p>
   <p>The Research Bureau is making a survey of the community's needs.</p>
   <p>We have no report on the Mt. Sinai Hospital before us. Up to now, the Hospital has functioned independently, under the supervision of a small group of people. The Mt. Sinai Hospital does not have enough beds to accommodate all the needy. Now that it has been admitted into the Chicago Jewish Charities, it will either be enlarged at its present location, or another building will be erected at another location. The Mt. Sinai Hospital will thus become a hospital for the whole Jewish community, instead of the enterprise of a small group.</p>
   <p>Aid to other institutions is given by the Jewish Charities of Chicago--a policy <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>which brings honor to the Jewish community of this city. May each one of you, who can afford to give, earn his portion of honor deservedly.</p>
   <p>Tender-hearted Jews are asked to give some attention to the small drives now being made for Ma-oth Hitim. About $10,000 is needed for Ma-oth Hitim this year in our city. Ma-oth Hitim! This is one of the most sacred traditions in Jewish philanthropic life. At all times and in all countries, Jews have held this sort of charity as sacred.</p>
   <p>Every poor Jew in Chicago who wishes to observe Passover should receive not only mazoth and flour, but also money for groceries and other necessities. Let us welcome the Ma-oth Hitim Committees. Let us contribute as liberally and as generously as we possibly can.</p>
   <p>Today is the last day that the office of the Joint Relief Committee, 720 West Roosevelt Road, will accept money to be sent to cities in Russia to aid the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Jews there celebrate Passover. All Russian countrymen societies are urged to take advantage of the last opportunity to send money to their compatriots.</p>
