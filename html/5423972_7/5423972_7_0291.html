   <p>At the last meeting of the directors of the Hebrew Institute, it was announced that Dr. Morris Levin, rabbi of People's Synagogue, turned down the agreement, which was extended to him by the Hebrew Institute, in order that he might be able to continue his work as rabbi and principal of the Hebrew school.</p>
   <p>Dr. Rabbi Levin, refused to renew the contract and declared that he does not find a large enough field, in Chicago to do the work which he would like to do. Being nationalistically inclined he finds the Zionist movement too weak to absorb his energies; the Hebrew school, to which he devoted his entire energy, can not fulfill his aims, because <span class="page-break">2</span>the Jews of Chicago still are not permanent residents. Most of them move around, and therefore a small number of students were able to attend the Hebrew school during the three years of its existence. The synagogue in the Hebrew Institute, also, does not stand upon a strong foundation. The transformation from a synagogue on Sabbath into a dance hall on Sunday does not jibe with his ideas, and therefore, he has determined to go to New York, where he will encounter a broader field for his activities.</p>
