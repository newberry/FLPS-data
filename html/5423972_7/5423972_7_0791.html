   <p>Last Rosh Hashanah eve, a group of Chicago civic workers gathered at the office of the Chicago Zionists to consider the question of an appeal for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. The representatives of the relief organization argued that since the relief drive is to begin shortly after the holidays, it would be no more than just that the appeal should be made for the relief drive and not for the Keren Hayesod. After a brief discussion of the question, it was decided that on Resh Hashanah and Yom Kipur an appeal should be made for the relief drive, but that on the coming Passover an appeal should be made for the Keren Hayesod alone.</p>
   <p>The Chicago synagogues have thus assumed an obligation which they must now fulfill. On the last day of Passover an appeal must be made in behalf of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Keren Hayesod because this has been promised to the Keren Hayesod, and because, in Chicago, the Keren Hayesod is continuing the drive it began with the help of the synagogues. The synagogues have shown their interest in the Keren Hayesod by raising, as a body, a respectable sum of money and turning it over to the Keren Hayesod. Now they have to finish what they have begun. Upon their work depends the final success of the Keren Hayesod drive in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The present Keren Hayesod drive in Chicago aims to raise two hundred thousand dollars in cash. About eighty thousand dollars has already been raised which is, relatively speaking, a large sum, when one considers that the number of volunteers and Zionist workers is very small. If the appeal for the Keren Hayesod on the last day of Passover brings in another thirty or forty thousand dollars, then we can hope that with the collection of the installment for the second year, plus continued intensive work during the remaining months of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>year, it will be possible to reach the sum of two hundred thousand dollars. Chicago will then contribute the small quota which it should. If the synagogues do not do their duty, then it is unlikely that Chicago will raise its small quota. The entire Keren Hayesod work in Chicago will be endangered.</p>
   <p>It is true that the synagogues have already done something for the Keren Hayesod. It is also true that most of the money that has been collected up to now has come from the Orthodox Jews. However, one should remember that there are in Chicago one hundred and ten Orthodox synagogues with a membership of seven to eight thousand, and that the number of subscribers to the Keren Hayesod is only eight hundred. One can thus see readily that at the most, only ten per cent of the synagogue Jews of Chicago have participated in the Keren Hayesod Campaign. What about the other ninety per cent? Even if we should assume that fifty per cent of the synagogue Jews cannot give anything at all because the times are hard or they are poor, there still remains forty per cent that can and must give. If ten per cent of all the synagogue Jews of <span class="page-break">\4</span>Chicago could give fifty thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod--the other thirty thousand dollars came in from various sources--why shouldn't forty per cent give another fifty thousand dollars? We say that they can give, that they must give, and that they will give if they are approached in the right way, and the situation is explained to them.</p>
   <p>The only comforting aspect of the present Keren Hayesod drive is the unanimous declaration of the volunteers that only one out of every hundred Jews refuses to give something. All who are approached for contributions, give. Some give more, some less, but everybody gives.</p>
   <p>The problem of how to reach all the synagogue Jews cannot easily be solved during the year, but on the holidays that problem can easily be solved, in a more or less satisfactory manner. Most of the synagogue Jews can be found in the synagogue on a holiday, particularly just before kadish [prayer for the dead] is recited. An appeal made in all Orthodox synagogues of Chicago just before kadish, will not fail to bring results. There may be no thousand-dollar contributions, but there probably will be hundred-dollar ones, and these can <span class="page-break">\5</span>be easily collected right after the holidays.</p>
   <p>Up to now we thought that the Hebrew Theological College would be the only obstacle to an appeal for the Keren Hayesod, to be made in the synagogues on the last day of Passover. The Hebrew Theological College needs money and has needed money. Now that we have succeeded in convincing the synagogues that they must help the Hebrew Theological College as a body, and many synagogues have already done so, and almost all the synagogues will do so, this obstacle has been removed. Now it is the duty of all the synagogues to make an appeal for the Keren Hayesod on the last day of Passover because upon this appeal depends the success of the entire drive.</p>
   <p>We hope that all the synagogues of Chicago will do their duty on the last day of Passover; that they will fulfill the promise they made last Rosh Hashanah eve; that on this last day of Passover they will do everything that is necessary to make the Keren Hayesod drive a success.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>This will also show the opponents of Orthodoxy that the Orthodox synagogues are the driving force in the life of our people in Chicago.</p>
