   <p>"The American relief work, which is no longer so urgent in several European countries, must not be stopped in Russia, where $1,500,000 is needed for the reconstruction of Jewish institutions."</p>
   <p>With these words, Dr. Bogan began his interview yesterday with a representative of the Courier. The writer of these lines met the representative of the Joint Distribution Committee, who recently returned from Russia, in the Plymouth Court headquarters of the $2,500,000 drive, which is under the chairmanship of Jacob M. Loeb.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bogan went on saying that "it must be understood that the Joint Distribution Committee is not the only relief institution for the rehabilitation of Jewish lives in Russia. The large part of the relief work is being carried out, on a large <span class="page-break">\2</span>scale, by the Soviet Government itself and with its own financial means. Like the Alliance of Ukranian Jews and other organizations, we are partly helping the Russian government in its colossal work to reconstruct the Jewish institutions.</p>
