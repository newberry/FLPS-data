   <p>The campaign of the junk dealers to buy junk only with Red Cross stamps is already in full swing. And the rag and junk peddlers who have not yet supplied themselves with stamps will do well for themselves and for their country if they can do so immediately.</p>
   <p>Children can be of great help in this campaign, though we must remember that junk peddlers are forbidden to buy junk from children. But the children can see to it that their parents receive no money for their junk, only Red Cross stamps. And the children who will bring cards with two dollars worth of Red Cross stamps will receive, as a gift, a Red Cross honor button.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let each one help in this campaign. Let every junk peddler supply himself with Red Cross stamps. Let every housewife sell her junk for these stamps only. And children should strive conscientiously to obtain this honor button.</p>
