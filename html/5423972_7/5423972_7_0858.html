   <p>In Vitebsk the "Jewish" Bolshevik teachers decided to disclaim Saturday as the day of rest and proclaimed Sunday as the Sabbath. The Jewish press throughout the world, particularly in America, became bitterly incensed as a result of this edict. I can easily understand the excitement of the Jewish press in Europe, but I cannot understand the excitement of the Jewish press in America. Why can't the Bolsheviki do what the Reform rabbis have done? Haven't we plenty of Reform temples in America that are closed on Saturday and open on Sunday?</p>
   <p>Now that so much is being said about establishing order in the M'shulochim [agents representing foreign charity organizations and theological seminaries] business, let us not forget that we have a type of collector who is, in many respects, worse than the fake M'shuloch. The M'shuloch collects money for a foreign institution. The collector collects either for a noble charity institution or for a Jewish nationalistic institution in America. At times he collects for an institution and gives half of his collection to the institution, and at other times, he pockets his entire collection. Among these collectors there are as many fakers as there are among the M'shulochim--and it is no more than right that the committee, which intends to establish order in the M'shulochim business, should also keep an eye on these collectors--many of whom rob the public.</p>
