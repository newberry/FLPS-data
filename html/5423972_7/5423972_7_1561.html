   <p>A meeting was held yesterday by the Jewish women's clubs at the Stratford Hotel where plans were put under way for a strong campaign for a large fund in Chicago for the war sufferers in Europe.</p>
   <p>This women's organization works hand in hand with the Chicago Relief Committee - and much is expected from these Jewish women who are always active in social work. The committee will be supplied with official receipt books, and we are warning the public not to give money to any one without securing an official receipt.</p>
