   <p>According to the officers of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, a new building to cost about $200,000 will be erected this summer to replace the one which was almost destroyed by fire Tuesday morning.</p>
   <p>The fire damage is estimated at $100,000. A considerable part of the loss represents the selling value of the large library and various religious relics. The building contained a valuable collection of paintings and one of the best Hebrew libraries in the country. It also contained a sub-station of the public library, with about 2,000 books.</p>
