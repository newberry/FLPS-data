   <p>Yesterday, shortly after the Courier announced that the War Trade Board in Washington had officially permitted the local Joint Relief office to transport old clothes for the war-suffering Jews in Russia, a stream of men and women, with bundles under their arms, began to arrive at the Joint Relief office 932 West Twelfth Street.</p>
   <p>The Joint Relief office, under normal conditions, would have dispatched trucks for the collection of old clothes and shoes but, on account of the present influenza epidemic, this is prohibited by the health department.</p>
   <p>The goodhearted men and women who have old clothes to give away for their suffering brothers and sisters will, therefore, have to make their own arrangements about delivering the bundles.</p>
   
   <p>The old clothes collected by the Joint Relief several months ago, together with the old clothes which are now being brought to the office, must leave Chicago on October 16. Therefore, only a few days are left for the Chicago Jews to fulfill their duty toward the Jewish war victims in Russia.</p>
   <p>Give an old suit or overcoat that can be easily fixed, to help a suffering Jew in Russia. The winter is approaching and the cold there is severe.</p>
   <p>Every Chicago Jew can help a Jew in Russia to keep warm during the cold weather. Here, an old garment has no value, but there, in Russia, it is very valuable, because that old suit or overcoat can and will save a Jewish life.</p>
