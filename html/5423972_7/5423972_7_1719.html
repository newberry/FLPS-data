   <p>We Assist Poor Expectant Nothers.</p>
   <p>The Independent Sisters of Charity, the only Jewish society who assists poor expectant mothers, are going to give the 7th annual ball on Saturday evening, Dec. 2nd, at the Illinois Hall, Ogden av. and Madison st. According to the weather prophets, we anticipate a very severe winter. Therefore we appeal to every right thinking person to help us make this ball a success, so that we will be able to help the poor expectant mothers, as we have done for the last six years.</p>
   <p>We also appeal to the Presidents of the different Lodges and Societies, to give our interviewing committees a hearing and to buy as many tickets as possible. Aside from the great good that you will be doing for this holy cause, you will also be entertained immensely that evening at this most enjoyable ball.</p>
   <p>Thanking you in advance. The Arrangement Committee. Bessie Benjamin, Chairman.</p>
