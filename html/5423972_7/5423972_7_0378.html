   <p>In the progress of civilization, the Russian Jew in America kept pace with the times. Since his transition from a land of persecution to the land of liberty, with the given opportunities that a free country affords, he readily adjusted himself to his new surroundings.</p>
   <p>In his desire to show self-reliance and initiative, he has tried to solve the problem of his American existence, and has prepared himself to take up the more soul-satisfying pursuits open to the politically and intellectually acclimated citizen.</p>
   <p>In every field of endeavor he has progressed, and as the Jew is nothing if not charitable, his activity in the field of philanthropic endeavor is correspondingly marked. With the name of immigration from Russia, various relief societies have been founded by him and many charitable institutions have come into existence through the efforts of various groups in the community. Each group took special pride in its own creation and devoted all its energies to it, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the exclusion of all other institutions. In fact, the rapid increase in the number of institutions became threatening to their future development and efficiency.</p>
   <p>The greatest hindrance to progress and usefulness was the faulty method of collecting funds. "Red Handkerchief Charity" was harmful, as it was undignified, both to the giver and the recipient". In soliciting funds from the public, the well-to-do and the poor working-man alike, gave a nickel a week and the institutions and all of them suffered for want of funds. A greater harm was the fact that the managing boards were forced to give up their entire energy and time to raise funds, while the intrinsic value of the respective institutions was neglected.</p>
   <p>No less a menace was the system of ticket-selling for bazaars, entertainments, balls, etc. The constant clamor for money, produced among the giving public an aversion for such charity, and among the workers a sense of rivalry operating to deprecate the importance and needs of a sister organization, and to exaggerate their own value and superiority. Each board grew to consider its <span class="page-break">\3</span>institution alone to be the rightful heir to the birthright of Israel's charity. With his improved conditions, the Russian Jew found that the time was ripe for a change from the antiquated way of collecting and dispensing his charities; time brought men whose unshaken confidence in the Jewish community spurred them on to concerted action to save their resources for constructive work, to prevent waste and duplication, and to devote all energies to the welfare of those who need them and whom they want to benefit.</p>
   <p>A plan committee for the federation of the orthodox charities was formed and gradually it grew to larger proportions. The movement met with unanimous approval from the public, and when the announcement was made that the Federation of Orthodox Jewish Charities was called into being, the public welcomed the idea and the welcome was substantiated by subscriptions to the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The Federation will finance the following twelve institutions:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
