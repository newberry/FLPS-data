   <p>Chicago is opening up a first class Hebrew immigrant shelter home. This institution was recently organized and is being financed by the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities, which expects to donate about $4,000 annually to its upkeep. The Federation realized, that something must be done in the way of providing a home or homes for the many immigrants who come here from Russia stranded.</p>
   <p>Several hundred refugees who escaped the Russian fire, at present in Japan, will arrive in Seattle in a few days, and a great number of them who will come from there to Chicago will be out on the street if shelter is not <span class="page-break">2</span>provided for them. These immigrants are some of the best children of our Jewish nation. We must by all means provide homes and food for them when they arrive. This home for immigrants is to be located in the large building of the Jewish Aid Society, 1336 S. Morgan Street. This society has with great pride provided the space for the new home and the Federation donated $2,500 to this worthy cause. The Hebrew immigrant shelter home is one of the many institutions connected with the Federation. At a meeting last Sunday the Federation had its annual election of officers, resulting in the election of a number of very prominent Jews.</p>
