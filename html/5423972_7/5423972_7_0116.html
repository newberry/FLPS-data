   <p>A gift of $50,000 was donated to this city for the erection of a home for the Aged and Infirm Israelites. The open hearted doner is Mr. A Slimmer of Vaerly, Iowa. The check was placed in the hands of Messrs. Rosenbaum Bros. with the condition that an equal amount be raised in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A number of our leading citizens immediately interested themselves in the matter and in a short time $30,000 was raised. It is expected that the balance of the sum will be raised within the next two weeks.</p>
