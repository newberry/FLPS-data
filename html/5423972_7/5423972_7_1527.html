   <p>Chicago Jewry Unites in Behalf of Sacred Relief Work to Save Jewish Lives.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's relief conference turned out to be a gigantic success and lots of practical plans were adopted for the work of raising relief funds on a large scale in all parts of Chicago for suffering Jews in the warring countries.</p>
   <p>Disregarding the bitter cold, exactly at the appointed time, the large assembly hall of the Hebrew Institute was filled with the delegates, welfare workers, and other Jews who have taken an interest in the relief work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The delegates remained at their places, as though glued to their seats, all during the proceedings. Practically every denomination of the large Jewish community was represented at the conference. The orthodox and the conservatives worked hand-in-hand for the common aim - relief for the millions of Jewish sufferers, - and the object of the conference was attained. Chicago Jews have awakened to the fact, due to their fate or destiny, they have shouldered a big debt which must be paid at once. This united effort of all denominations of Chicago's Jewish community, has been brought about by each and every Jewish individual, with the great nation's blessings, obligating himself to do his duty. So, with this before us, we are assured of great results.</p>
   <p>The work of the conference began exactly 12:30 p. m. G. Sultan, chairman of the conference committee, opened the meeting, explaining the important aim. According to responses to the roll-call, the earnestness of all Chicago Jews is great.</p>

   <p>After a friendly speech by Rabbi Saul Silber, the audience listened to last year's report of the work accomplished by the West Side Relief Committee. At the conference, over 500 delegates were present, who represented nearly all the synagogues, lodges, societies and many different relief organizations. Mr. Bernard Hurwich, chairman of the relief committee, in his report, showed, where in the course of last year $93,000 was collected on the West Side. This amount includes the $55,000 collected for needy Jews in Palestine. The speaker, then, described to the audience the horrible living conditions of the Jews in Russia, and he insisted, that no one in the hall should leave until he had contributed something for the relief of his nation.</p>

   <p>The Honorable Adolph J. Sabath, our Jewish congressman, was introduced, as the most important guest at the conference. He was greeted by the audience with great applause, and strict attention was given to every word he had to say. "The long past history of the Jews," the Congressman started his address, "stretches out like a long endless chain, with all sorts of misery and torture. Jews, for centuries, have had something to mourn about. But never before has their misfortune been like it is at the present time, and never before, has the Jewish nation needed relief like they do now. So you Jews of Chicago must do your duty, and do so at the earliest moment.</p>
   <p>"As a representative of the Chicago organized Jewry, I appeal to you to get busy. You must by all means, unite your forces, and work harmoniously for this noble cause. Do not leave it to the other fellow to do this work. All business men, as well as ordinary working people, must work <span class="page-break">5</span>hand-in-hand and show the world, what the Chicago Jewish community can accomplish for their nation at this critical moment."</p>
   <p>The Congressman spoke in reference to the proclamation of President Wilson, setting aside the 27th of January as the Jewish People's Relief Day.</p>
   <p>"I, on my part, will do all that is in my power," he concluded. And to you, appointed representatives of the Jewish people, I appeal, to always show, as you have in the past, that the Jews of Chicago have the deepest sympathy, for our nation in its present plight, and we hope to do all we possibly can to heal the wounds and relieve the pain."</p>
   <p>Judge Harry Fisher, chairman of the Scope and Plans committee, presented plans of additional activities for the West Side, which were unanimously adopted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In the course of the last seven months, through the Jewish Courier, $12,000 has been collected for the war stricken Jews in Europe. Mr. M. P. Ginsberg, publisher of the Courier, submitted a report of the fund collected to the chairman, Mr. Hurwich, who read it to the conference. This fund was turned over to Mr. Samuel Phillipson, West Side treasurer for this relief organization.</p>
   <p>The Courier will from day to day publish reports on the noble work of supplying relief to our Jewish sisters and brothers. We hope that this present world War will soon end, and our nation, through peace, will b egin a new fortunate epoch and peaceful existence.</p>

   <p>The assemblage stood with bowed heads, while Cantor Milkowsky chanted Jewish memorial hymns, for the Jewish martyrs who lost their lives in this war.</p>
   <p>Dr. Shmaryohu Levin, in closing the conference expressed assurance, that from today on, our Chicago Jews with their energetic work will do their part, in raising funds for Jewish war sufferers, and will show other cities an example of their good work.</p>
