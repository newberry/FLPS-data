   <p>Many prominent Jewish business men, captains of industry, successful professional men, and a large number of Jewish women were present.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by the president, Mr. Becker. He was greeted with a storming applause and showed great pleasure in opening the meeting. He began by stating that this is the 14th annual meeting of the Associated Jewish Charities, and since he has been president, succeeding Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the Associated Charities has made wonderful progress in all its branches. It has collected $520,000 and that is $79,000 more than last year. Mr. Becker also stated that this year's collections needed to be larger, as all the charity institutions were calling on us for additional help for their needs were larger than usual.</p>

   <p>It was all due to the generosity of our philanthropist, Mr. Julius Rosenwald, that we were able to raise this great sum for the charity fund, as he donated $20,000 on the condition that we raise $500,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sulzberger, the honored guest, spoke on the brotherhood of man, emphasizing to the audience their duties to their fellow-man who is in need.</p>
