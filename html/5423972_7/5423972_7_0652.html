   <p>All modern nations have adopted the maxim that the majority rules, but the Jews have not yet adopted this principle. Among the Jews, the minority rules, rather than the majority. Of the four million Jews in America, at least three million of them are from Eastern Europe, and have Eastern European traditions; and yet, American Jewry is led, and often misled, by Western European Jews, i. e., by Jews who have Western European traditions. If the difference between the Western and the Eastern European Jew were not so striking, it would not be so bad. But the Jew whose traditions are those of Western Europe, has very different ideals and a very different outlook on Jewish life than the Eastern European Jew. Therefore, when the Western European Jew dominates the Eastern European Jew, the latter's ideals and aspirations must be submerged.</p>

   <p>If American Jewry, which is made up of both Eastern and Western European Jews, were led by the majority, or by representatives of the majority, the Jewish people would have a different countenance. All the differences and the inconsistencies in modern Jewish life would not exist, and the life of our people in all countries would be less contradictory than it is today. The relief work would have a different appearance and the situation in Palestine would be different; but as the Jews in America have not yet adopted the maxim that the majority should rule, the condition of the Jews is abnormal, even where other racial elements do not interfere. Not only are our internal conditions abnormal--they are often tragi-comic and ridiculous. Because American Jewry is led by a minority, its whole position on Jewish problems becomes false.</p>
   <p>At present what are the chief problems of the Jewish people? The chief problems are the rehabilitation of Jewish life in Eastern Europe and the rebuilding of Palestine. Every Jew who has any Jewish sentiment, understands this. But what is the position of the leaders of the minority on <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>these immediate Jewish problems? It appears to them that the work of rehabilitating Jewish life in the countries of the Diaspora has been completed, and the question of rebuilding Palestine no longer exists. Either they do not have enough Jewish feeling to understand this question, or they do not want to understand it because they refuse to dismiss an old and long-shattered dream: the dream of assimilation.</p>
   <p>It would, however, be the greatest tragedy in history if a people were to suffer and perhaps perish because a small group of people had neither the courage to understand the problems of the people they were leading, nor the courage to dismiss a spurious ideal and an idle dream.</p>
   <p>In the minds of the leaders of the Jews in America the situation of our people presents itself thus: The war is over, peace reigns over the world; all the problems which affected us during the war have either disappeared or else life itself will solve them. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the Jews of Eastern and Central Europe obtained <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>their "rights". Theoretically, they are completely emancipated, and they themselves will fight for actual emancipation. If they are emancipated, they have but one task, viz., to emancipate themselves from Judaism and to follow the identical path that the Western European Jews have taken. If they take this path, they will no longer need Palestine because their present native countries will become their Zion and their Jerusalem. Since they expect the same results from the emancipation of the Eastern European Jews as was true of the Western European Jews, our leaders in America consider the whole Palestine question as nonexistent and artificial.</p>
   <p>In a moment when we stand at the threshold of liberation, in a moment when we must concentrate all of our energy on the rebuilding of Palestine, the leaders of the economically and politically powerful group of Jews--the leaders of American Jewry--are busy with the building of palatial homes for nurses, and with similar unimportant work. They care nothing about the vital question which fate has placed before us. Not for a long time <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>has our history recorded such a ridiculous and tragi-comic situation in our life.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish masses in America were the same today as they were twenty or thirty years ago, a group of poor immigrants, a poor colony of workers, peddlers, and small storekeepers, the situation would not be so tragicomic, because a group of economically weak people can do nothing, even if they are numerically strong. But today the Jewish masses are not what they were twenty or thirty years ago. The change in the economic status of the Eastern European Jews is amazing. Today there are multimillionaires among the American Jews of Eastern European origin. Among them there are a large number of intellectuals and influential people.....And if they surrender leadership to the minority of Western European Jews, it indicates weakness; they show neither moral nor intellectual strength.</p>
   <p>We have only one answer to the question of whether American Jewry will do its duty to Palestine. As long as the assimilated minority [Reform Jews] <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>runs the business of the nationalistically inclined majority, American Jewry will be unable to do its duty to Palestine. Until this abnormal condition in the life of American Jewry is erased, until the representatives of the majority take over control, the American Jews will be in no position to do their duty to the Jewish people in the countries of the Diaspora and in Palestine.</p>
