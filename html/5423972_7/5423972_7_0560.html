   <p>The $2,500,000 drive launched in Chicago in behalf of the Jewish Charities is now over. The amount of money raised exceeds the quota. The volunteers have gone over the top.</p>
   <p>A remarkable achievement, this, for which Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, chairman of the drive, deserves the gratitude of us all. Mr. Loeb's marvelous energy, his influence, his faith in the Jewish masses, and the latter's favorable disposition to the issue and trust in his leadership brought about the success of the campaign. The money raised will be used to establish and improve several important institutions of the city, but not that alone. There will be permanent monuments as well of the enterprise and will of the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
   <p>All honor to whom honor is due--to Mr. Loeb and his co-workers in the Drive.</p>
