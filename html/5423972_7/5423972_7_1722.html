   <p>On the North West Side is a society composed of over one-thousand members known as the Gomel Chesed Shel Emeth. It provides suitable burials for poor Jews and assists the bereaved families.</p>
   <p>At the last regular meeting, a committee was appointed to purchase a hearse for the society, since which meeting, we understand that a beautiful hearse, amounting to $2,000, was purchased. The hearse will be used exclusively for the society.</p>
   <p>The Gomel Chesed Shel Emeth has a very large and beautiful cemetery at Waldheim.</p>
