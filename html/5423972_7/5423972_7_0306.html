   <p>It is an old Jewish custom to donate the money gathered in the synagogues during the reading of the portion Vayera (and he appeared) to the Jewish needy. This year, more than ever before, it is an absolute necessity, because of the extremely cold weather, for all synagogues of Chicago to take heed and do everything possible to help the needy by contributing to the Hachnosas Orchim Society [society which shelters the poor and the stranger].</p>
   <p>It is needless to explain what the Hachnosas Orchim Society is doing for the poor, Jewish people in this city. This organization is always welcoming the poor, naked, unfortunate, and hungry people to the Hachnosas Orchim Home--especially when the weather is cold. So far no person has been turned away from the Shelter Home; but it seems as though we shall probably be short of funds this year to continue this charitable work. We, therefore, take <span class="page-break">\2</span>this opportunity to notify all the synagogues of Chicago to get busy immediately and raise the necessary funds for the upkeep of this worthy Home. You are the only ones who kept this Home for the poor in the cold winters in the past, and we expect your help in the future.</p>
