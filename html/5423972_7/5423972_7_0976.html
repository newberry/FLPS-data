   <p>On another page of today's Courier we print a telegram from New York, which states that the leaders of the relief work in New York, Mr. Louis Marshall, Mr. Nathan Strauss, and Mr. Charles Brown, who is a director of the fourteen million dollar relief drive, have appealed to the representatives of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago to postpone their drive until the relief campaign in Chicago is over; should the representatives of Mount Sinai Hospital go on with their drive, they would not do their own drive any good, and would harm the relief drive.</p>
   <p>In our editorial a few weeks ago, we pointed out that the fact that both drives are taking place at the same time creates a very unpleasant situation for the two philanthropic groups, and that the best solution would be a conference of both groups to arrive at some understanding. Unfortunately, this conference did not take place because certain politicians want to make capital out of this collision.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Now the situation is even more unpleasant than before. The relief workers have made all the necessary preparations for the drive and so have the workers of Mount Sinai Hospital. The wheels of both organizations are turning around and it would not be so easy to stop them now. Just the same, we cannot go on with both drives taking place at the same time. A collision must be avoided, because otherwise both drives may end in catastrophe.</p>
   <p>We can only appeal once more to the representatives of both groups to come at once to an understanding, and that is possible only through a conference.</p>
