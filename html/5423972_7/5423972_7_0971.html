   <p>The Chicago-Jewish community can be proud of the fact that it has been chosen as the testing ground of American-Jewish philanthropy. The fourteen-million dollar drive for our war and pogrom victims on the other side of the ocean will open in Chicago next Tuesday with a magnificent banquet at the Black-stone Hotel. Chicago will provide the test for the success of the drive; if the drive is successful in Chicago then it will also be successful in the entire Middle West, and it is then assured of success in all parts of the country. They know in the East and in the West that Chicago is the greatest philanthropic center of the country, and the way the Chicago Jews respond to an appeal is a source of inspiration and spiritual gratification to all the other great Jewish communities in the country.</p>
