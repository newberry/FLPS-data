   <p>For the seventh time, the rabbis of Chicago have summoned to a Din Torah (rabbinical trial) the persons who are now planning to erect a new shelter home. Last night at the closing session, the rabbis decided to turn the whole matter over to the Jewish people of Chicago. Let them judge.</p>
   <p>At each session, the individuals who are sponsoring the erection of the new shelter home, made new proposals and sent new committees. But at the meeting which was held last Monday evening, they promised to attend last night's meeting, prepared for the Din Torah, and to accept whatever decision the Beth Din (rabbinical court) would render.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's meeting, Rabbi Simon Album made his appearance. Mr. Tvery and Mr. Goldstien were on the committee for the new shelter home. As soon as Rabbi Album entered, he took the floor and reviewed the whole case, making new proposals. It had previously been agreed that the matter was not to be prolonged, but Rabbi Album ignored this decision, and simply insulted any rabbi who dared to dissent. He refused to permit the dissenting rabbis to speak. When the chairman announced that a decision would be reached, Rabbi Album, together with Rabbis Astrakhan and Cohen, left immediately.</p>
   <p>When the clamor had subsided, the question was again taken up. Rabbi Saul Silber virtually pleaded with the people who contemplate building a new shelter home, to consider the Jewish public's money, and not to waste it. Then Rabbi Silber said, "Why do we need two shelter homes when we haven't enough inmates to fill the modern and beautiful shelter home we have on Monroe Street. Perpetuate your name in a noble undertaking. We need a Talmud Torah. (Hebrew school). Thousands of Jewish children grow up without religion. Build a Talmud Torah instead, and help to preserve the most beautiful gift of the Jews--the Torah. Help to bring up a generation of Jews." His words, however, aroused little sympathy among the representatives of the new shelter home.</p>
   
   <p>In conclusion the rabbis decided to make the following statement to the general Jewish public:</p>
   <p>Whereas, We have assembled seven times in order to listen to the arguments for the construction of another shelter home in Chicago; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, The people who represent another shelter home have made many promises, and have failed to keep them; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Their object has been to gain time and not to answer the just demands of the rabbis at the Beth Din; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we, the rabbis of Chicago, deliver the entire matter over into the hands of our great community, to decide whether there shall be another shelter home in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We resolve, further, to call a mass meeting for this Wednesday evening, at which shall be present all rabbis and delegates of all synagogues to hear the reports of everything that has been transacted thus far, and then to render a decision. In the meantime, we ask the Jewish public to refrain from contributing to this building fund.</p>
   <p>The following rabbis approved this statement: Abraham Goldenson, Jacob Levinson, Saul Silber, Rubenstein, Shochet and Kaplan.</p>
