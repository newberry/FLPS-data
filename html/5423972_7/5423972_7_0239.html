   <p>We have as yet not been able to look after the camping facilities for boys under our own direction entirely, and we have therefore co-operated with the Young Men's Jewish Charities to the extent that we have registered all of the boys that were accommodated at their camp, arranged for their medical examination and had them assembled at the Institute prior to their leaving for camp.</p>
   <p>The camp this year, was known as Camp Harring, and it accommodated 533 boys distributed through five periods beginning with June 28, and the last group leaving August 24.</p>
