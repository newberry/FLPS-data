   <p>The leaders and members of the United [Jewish] Charities will gather tonight at an annual meeting. A report will be given on the activities of the first year since the amalgamation; it has been a successful year financially as well as otherwise. Some progress has been made spiritually and morally. Today, the leaders of the United Jewish Charities understand that they are not only directors of a philanthropic organization but also representatives of a Jewish Community, and as such, it is their duty to take care of Jewish education in Chicago. I do not have the slightest doubt that Jewish education in Chicago will see better days than it has ever seen before.</p>
   <p>However, this is true as far as the education of the young Orthodox generation is concerned, but what about the education of the young Reform <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>generation? Do the Reform Jews still believe that the Sunday school is the correct Jewish educational institution?</p>
