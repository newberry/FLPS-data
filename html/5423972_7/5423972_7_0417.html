   <p>The fifth annual meeting of the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth of Chicago was held last Thursday evening. Rabbi Ephraim Epstein was chairman, and many rabbis and communal leaders were present.</p>
   <p>Samuel A. Broida, who audited the books of the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth for the year ending August 24, 1933, reported total income of $11,068.91, of which $4,624.16 was in individual contributions and the balance from congregations, with $116.66 being the balance at the beginning of the year. Ten thousand, nine hundred ninety-eight dollars and eighteen cents ($10,998.18) was the total income, $9,925 being sent to 30 Yeshivoth, and the balance on hand being $70.73, the remainder going to incidental expenses. Mr. Broida pointed out that while income had dropped $600 for the year, the amount sent to the Yeshivoth, which numbered 30 as against 24 the year previous, was only $178 less.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, chairman of the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth for the past two years, refused the chairmanship for the coming year and was given a vote of thanks for his splendid past work.</p>
   <p>The new officers of the Vaad Ha'Yeshivoth for the coming year are Rabbi Ezriel Epstein, chairman; Rabbi Moses Kahn, A. M. Goldberg, Wolf P. Cohen, William Forber and B. M. Miller, vice chairman; Rabbi H. Olschwang, recording secretary; Samuel A. Broida, financial secretary, and Samuel Levin, treasurer Rabbi Menhaem B. Sacks was re-elected executive director by a unanimous vote, and was accorded a vote of thanks for his devoted efforts.</p>
   
   <p>Resolutions were adopted by the Vaad Ha 'Yeshivoth pledging itself to strenuous efforts for the fifth annual campaign of the Vaad Ha' Yeshivoth; to see that every Chicago synagogue makes an appeal for the Vaad during the high holidays; to appoint committees to visit prospective donors; to acquaint the general public with the work of the Vaad Ha' Yeshivoth, which aids in the support of 30 Yeshivoths in Europe and Palestine in a systematic way, instead of the tremendously expensive solicitors ordinarily sent there; and to urge the public that since the survival of the Yeshivoth is absolutely necessary to Jewish culture, and since a single donation fulfills one's obligation to 30 rabbinical academies, to give as much as possible.</p>
