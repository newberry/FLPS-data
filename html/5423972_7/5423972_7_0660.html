   <p>The committee appointed at a meeting of rabbis and laymen to investigate the activities of the collectors of foreign Jewish charities have published in the Courier a list of institutions in Palestine and the Diaspora, which, in its opinion, are worthy of support and should be supported. But this list is not a complete one. All in all, there must be at least from twenty-five to thirty foreign Jewish charities appealing to American Jews for support, and each and every one of the major charity organizations in Palestine and in the countries of the Diaspora, has an emissary or collector in Chicago. In many instances, the collectors work on their own hook, collect as much as they can, remit to the institutions as much as they want to, pocket the rest, and get away with it. In some instances, they work under the supervision of a certain Gabai [trustee] or set of Gabais, and the money collected by them is transmitted to its destination not by <span class="page-break">\2</span>the collectors themselves but by the Gabais, yet the Gabais can only vouch for the money that is sent away, but not for the money that is collected by the emissaries. There are also collectors here who solicit funds for fake institutions, and, of course, keep the money for themselves. But even in the best of cases, a good part of the money given to these collectors is wasted either because the commissions taken by the collectors are too exorbitant (as a rule fifty per cent, and in some other cases seventy-five per cent) or because the collectors do not keep books and do not know how much they have collected, how much commission they are entitled to, etc.</p>
   <p>We figure that the collectors in Chicago, representing foreign Jewish charities, send away annually to their institutions from ten to fifteen thousand dollars, but they collect at least from forty to fifty thousand dollars. Now is it necessary for each and every one of these institutions to have a special collector in Chicago? Cannot three or four institutions have one collector, and thus do away with the duplication of work and effort <span class="page-break">\3</span>and the exorbitant commissions, and is it necessary to have collectors in Chicago at all for these institutions? Cannot the Orthodox Jews in Chicago affiliate all these collecting agencies and organize the collections in such a manner that the middlemen between the institutions and the donor disappear?</p>
   <p>Of course it can be done, and it should be done. The institutions abroad will profit from it and the Chicago Jews will also. The latter will have to give less, while the institutions will actually get more.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, propose that a committee to investigate all the collectors be established by a Federation of Foreign Charities, that the collections thus be organized and that all the moneys to the various institutions be transmitted on the basis of what they have received from the collectors in the year of 1922. There are scores of wealthy Jews in Chicago who never give a cent for these institutions because they do not trust the collectors. They would give liberally if there would be a responsible <span class="page-break">\4</span>agency to collect the moneys and to transmit them directly to the institutions, without deducting any commissions. We believe that we can find in Chicago from one thousand to fifteen hundred Orthodox Jews to subscribe from five to twenty-five dollars a year to foreign Jewish charities. If the committee will assure them that by subscribing an annual sum to these charities they will be relieved of their duties to give to collectors, they will surely do so, and in disposing of the question in such a manner, Chicago Jewry will render a great service to the needy institutions deserving of support, and will eliminate a great deal of fake charity and fake collectors.</p>
   <p>The system of boxes and box collections will also be done away with. There is only one box which should be in every Jewish home and that is the National Fund box.</p>
   <p>If rabbis and laymen, representing the Chicago Jewish community, are really anxious to serve the needy institutions abroad, whether they be <span class="page-break">\5</span>philanthropic or educational in nature, and if they are really anxious to do away with fake charity, let them establish a central agency in Chicago for the collection of funds for all these institutions. In short, let them establish a sort of Federated Foreign Jewish Charities, and thus bring order out of the present chaos.</p>
