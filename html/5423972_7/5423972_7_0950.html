   <p>Over five hundred of the most prominent and well-to-do Jews of Chicago, workers in the drive to raise the local quota of two million dollars for our war-suffering brothers and sisters across the ocean, learned last night what it means to be hungry, what it means to sit at bare tables, in a dreary, sad and semidark room. Mr. Jacob M. Leob, the energetic chairman of the drive, had called them to attend a banquet at the Drake Hotel, and they all came, as one man, ready for a "rally", ready to eat a fine meal and expecting to hear some "after-dinner speeches."</p>
   <p>The magnificent banquet hall of the luxurious hotel on North Michigan Avenue had never before had such a dreary atmosphere as it had last night. There were no tablecloths on the tables. Instead of being illuminated by gorgeous candelabra and beautiful electric lamps, the hall was illuminated by candlelight. There was nothing to eat because nothing was served. Everyone, including <span class="page-break">\2</span>millionaires (Mr. Julius Rosenwald was among them), went hungry. The people heard of Jewish woe, Jewish torture and suffering. The people signed, moaned, and many of them wept. They went home hungry, but fortified with a resolution to work with greater zeal for the success of the drive in behalf of those on the other side of the ocean, who cannot go hungry any more because they have no strength, because they are sick and need immediate help.</p>
   <p>"To feed so many people here", said Mr. Loob, "would cost us a few thousand dollars. This would have been a crime that cried to heaven. To eat a fine meal in this hotel, while there, on the other side of the ocean, are so many Jews who are hungry, would mean that we do not consider ourselves human beings, that we are separating ourselves from the Jewish people and their God. Let us rather give the money that a banquet would have cost us to those unfortunate human beings."</p>
   <p>"You certainly expected to eat good food here," said Judge Fisher, "but you <span class="page-break">\3</span>will have to be disappointed. Maybe this is the first time in your life that you have ever attended a banquet and gone hungry. You ought to know that we have many, many Jewish men, women and children in Eastern Europe who are hungry and who die of diseases caused by hunger. You ought to know that this awful condition has prevailed for a number of years. You ought to be hungry for a while so that you can understand what it means to be hungry for a long, long time."</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald said: "The Jews of Eastern Europe, who must have our help, are not beggars. They are, like you and I, respectable people. Many of them were bankers, businessmen, professionals, and representatives of various other vocations. They never begged. They never dreamed that a time would come when they would have to ask someone for help. Now they are stretching their hands out to us, and we must not turn our backs on them. We must give, give and give."</p>
   <p>Charles Rubens then made a poignant appeal to the workers. So did Samuel N.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Deutsch, Sol Klein, James Becker, and General Abel Davis. General Davis said: "You now have the opportunity to convert many Jews (who do not like to be known as such) into better Jews and better human beings. Go to them, speak to them, explain to them what a calamity has befallen a large part of our people. Explain to them that if we here do not help, nobody else will."</p>
   <p>For a few hours the guests were hungry and listened to the appeals. Many of them declared that within the next few days, they would come to the relief headquarters, in the Westminster building, and would bring with them reports of large subscriptions.</p>
   <p>The test was a good one, the workers came through it very well, and the food-less banquet came to an end.</p>
   <p>The headquarters of the Chicago Jewish Relief Committee are at 110 South Dearborn Street, and contributions can be sent there.</p>
