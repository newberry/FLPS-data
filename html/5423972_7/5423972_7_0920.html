   <p>Financial and economic depression--the two striking features of the year 1921. They have affected to a greater or lesser extent everyone who is engaged in business, but fortunately they have not affected our communal and philanthropic fabric. Glancing through the annual reports of our various communal institutions, we must admit that a whole lot of good work has been done during the bad year 1921. The Federated Charities have done well, the combined relief committees in bringing the relief drive to a successful end have done well, the Marks Nathan Jewish Orphan Home, under the able leadership of Mr. Charles I. Herron, has done splendid work, and so has the Home For The Aged, the two Jewish Day Nurseries, the Society for Incurable Jews in Oak Forest, etc, etc. Chicago Jewry has indeed every reason to be proud of its philanthropic accomplishments during the bad year of 1921, and it is gratifying to learn that the country at large is giving due credit to Chicago Jewry for its splendid <span class="page-break">2</span>philanthropic work. Only the other day the New York Jewish press, reporting on the Conference of the relief workers in New York, stated that on this Conference the accomplishments of Chicago Jewry in the field of relief work during the year 1921 was a source of inspiration to every one present. Chicago gave forty per cent more than its quota.</p>
   <p>The local charities have also been successful in their work during the last year, although not to such an extent as the combined relief organizations. They have accomplished enough to give a good account of themselves and to take a just pride in their achievements. An illuminating and inspiring example of the great things done in the field of local charities during the last year is the Marks Nathan Jewish Orphan Home. Its president, Mr. Charles I. Herron says in his annual report concerning the finances of his institution: "We must truthfully say that never has the Home been in such splendid condition as it is today. We began the year 1921 with an indebtedness of almost $33,000; we close it with an indebtedness of less than $2000. We have thus <span class="page-break">3</span>paid off during the past year indebtedness amounting to over $30,000. The deficit of the general fund at the beginning of 1921 was $12,406; at the beginning of 1922 it is only $463. The deficit of the building fund at the beginning of 1921 was in the neighborhood of $22,000, and at the beginning of 1922 it is only $1,265. Our building is free from all encumbrances, our endowment is over $20,000 as compared with $17,400 at the beginning of 1921, and all we owe in the world over and above accounts receivable is the sum of $1,783. Such a record stamps the year of 1921 as a banner year. It shows what can be done when we make up our minds to battle with indebtedness until it ceases to trouble us".</p>
   <p>We know that at the next meeting of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities a satisfactory financial report will be submitted to the members. The $100,000 drive of the Federated, under the direction of Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt was a surprising success, considering the general economic and financial depression by which every one connected in business was affected. It is also <span class="page-break">4</span>worth while mentioning that the Mount Sinai Kosher Hospital, thanks to the untiring efforts of its president, Mr. A. Kurtzon and the able Board of Directors, has also done good work during the year, in the field of finances. If not for the relief drive, which caused the leaders of the Mount Sinai Hospital to postpone the quarter of a million drive, the campaign would have been a thorough success, because much was done in the way of organizing the drive, $100,000 in subscriptions had been secured.</p>
   <p>All this would go to indicate that Chicago Jewish philanthropists have gone from good to better during the last year, and this is the more surprising since the last year is remembered by every one as a bad year from a financial point of view. Chicago Jewry is now conscious of the fact that it is ahead of every Jewish community in the States in matters philanthropic, and to retain this leadership, of which it may well be proud, it will continue breaking records in the future too.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Chicago Jewry is more generous and more liberal than any other Jewish community in the States, and it has a better set of conscientious and industrious communal workers and philanthropic leaders than the other Jewish communities in America. This explains the trememdous success of Chicago Jewry in the field of philanthrophy during the "bad" year 1921.</p>
