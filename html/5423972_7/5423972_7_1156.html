   <p>Friends: Unexpectedly, there arrived five letters to our members from the Relief Committee. The letters were written with tears of blood by the small remaining number of orphans and widows asking the happy ones in America to help them as quickly as possible. A special meeting has been called for Monday, July 7th, at 6 P. M. sharp.</p>
