   <p>The activity of the Zionist delegation, in and around New York, is very productive. Wherever the delegation goes, it is given a royal reception because everywhere in the East, the Jews understand what the Zionist delegation wants and how much it should be given. The Jewish communities of Philadelphia, Boston, New Jersey, and so on, welcomed Sokolow and his associates with the same enthusiasm with which they welcomed Weitzman, Einstein and Ussishkin last summer. At once, they collected large sums of money for the Keren Hayesod and they promised to raise large sums in the future. In all the Jewish communities of the South, West and Middle West--with the exception of Chicago--great preparations have been made to welcome the Zionist delegation, but nothing has been done in Chicago. It is true that a few people, who are active in Karen Hayesod work in Chicago, are <span class="page-break">\2</span>planning a meeting; they would like to do something, but neither the classes nor the masses show any sign of enthusiasm, nor do they indicate even the slightest activity for the great and noble cause. All America is excited about the Zionist delegation, about the Keren Hayesod, about the work in Palestine, but Chicago is silent. Not a finger is lifted in Chicago. There is not even any talk about the necessity of doing something for the Zionist delegation.</p>
   <p>Is Chicago a forlorn city?</p>
   <p>The Jewish community in Philadelphia is very badly organized--we might say that it is disorganized--and it is known all over America as the "dead community". There are over two hundred thousand Jews in Philadelphia, but Judaism is asleep in Philadelphia. The Jewish life in Philadelphia may be compared to the Dead Sea; no rain, no movement, a chasm--nothing. In this sleepy Philadelphia, one hundred thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod was collected in half an hour, including forty thousand dollars in cash, <span class="page-break">\3</span>on the spot. When Weitzman and Ussishkin came to Chicago and spoke to thousands of Jews and met the leaders of the city at a magnificent banquet, the rich and affluent ones, six thousand dollars in cash was collected--the rest were pledges.</p>
   <p>Is Chicago an abandoned city?</p>
   <p>Milwaukee is a small Jewish community in comparison to Chicago--there are only twenty thousand Jews there. Not all the Milwaukee Jews are rich nor are they well-to-do. The small Jewish community in Milwaukee has many poor Jews, and many Jews who struggle hard in order to earn a living. This small Jewish community in Milwaukee has collected, within a very short time, seventy thousand (I repeat, seventy thousand) dollars in cash, for the Keren Hayesod. The Keren Hayesod workers of Chicago have been struggling, for the past six months, to collect the pledges made here to the Keren Hayesod during Weitzman's visit. After all their efforts, supplemented by meetings, and [the exhortations of] the newspapers, as well as private individuals, fifty <span class="page-break">\4</span>thousand dollars (I repeat, fifty thousand) was collected. Chicago is the second largest Jewish community in America, the second largest Jewish community in the world, a rich and well-to-do Jewish community of three hundred thousand Jews--and fifty thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod was collected during six months.</p>
   <p>Is Chicago a forlorn city?</p>
   <p>Chicago has great and beautiful institutions of all kinds, and Chicago takes care of its institutions in an honorable and worthy way. The leaders of the Home for the Aged have only to say a word, and thousands of dollars come in; the leaders of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home need only to give a wink, and large sums of money come in for the institution. Even many smallar and insignificant institutions in Chicago are maintained respectably, which gives the Chicago Jews a good name. But the same philanthropic and rich Jews of Chicago give, within a period of six months, only fifty thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod, which must build Palestine, which must <span class="page-break">\5</span>give work to tens of thousands of Haluzim who are saving the Jewish people, and are laying the foundation for a brilliant Jewish future.</p>
   <p>Is Chicago an abandoned city?</p>
   <p>Sokolow and his associates are coming to Chicago soon. If Milwaukee has given seventy thousand dollars, in cash, for the Keren Hayesod, then Chicago should give at least seven hundred thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod. There should be, in Chicago, at least five hundred citizens who would be willing to give from five hundred to five thousand dollars. Where are they? What are their names? Where do they live? Up to now, we haven't seen even fifty citizens of Chicago who would be ready to dig deep into their pockets, and to give from five hundred to five thousand dollars. In Chicago, there are twelve hundred contributors to the Keren Hayesod and included in this twelve hundred are all the well-known Chicago philanthropists and social workers. But how about the remaining two hundred and ninety-eight thousand, eight hundred Jews in Chicago? Have they no <span class="page-break">\6</span>duties at all to the Jewish people, to Palestine? Are they dead to the Keren Hayesod? Is Chicago a forlorn city?</p>
   <p>This question cannot be answered by a few Keren Hayesod workers, or by a few devoted social workers of Chicago. This question can be answered only by a widespread public action, but this public action must be awakened to its duty--otherwise the visit here of Mr. Sokolow and his associates will be in vain. The whole Jewish world is asking whether Jewish Chicago is an abandoned city; only Jewish Chicago can properly answer that question.</p>
