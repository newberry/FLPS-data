   <p>A special Kovner Relief meeting will be held Sunday Nov. 28 at 2 p.m. at the Lawndale Hall, Room 2, 3437 Ogden Ave. This meeting is called for those to do their last and best work for the ball which the Kovner relief has organized for Saturday, Dec. 4 in Douglas Park Auditorium. Every Jew must participate in the sacred work, which is carried on by the Kovner Relief, in order to help our unfortunate brothers and sisters, who are in need.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to describe the agony which our Kovner country men are undergoing especially now, when the Poles are staring to enter Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>A country man, of Vilkomir, province of Kovno, who witnessed a great deal of chaos, forwarded the letter to a good friend in Chicago, informing him that he does not understand the reason why the Kovner country men of Chicago remain silent and why they do nothing to combat starvation and chaos of their destitute fellow country men from Kovno and Slabotka.
