   <p>Paris. (Received in Chicago, June 27)--Justice Louis D. Brandeis, in the company of Mr. De Haas and other prominent English Zionists, arrived here today.</p>
   <p>To my question: How did Zion fare in the Peace Conference, Mr. Brandeis answered that the Palestinian program was adopted in its entirety just as the Zionist Organization had expected.</p>
   <p>Justice Brandeis, by the way, mentioned that Chicago has not fulfilled its duty to the Goulah (Redemption) Fund this year.</p>
   <p>Here in Paris it is reported that about fifty thousand Jews lost their lives in the Ukraine.</p>
