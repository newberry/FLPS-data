   <p>To the Honorable President, and Board of Directors of the Home For Aged Jews:</p>
   <p>At our last annual report, the number of inmates to the home was twenty two. From twenty eight applications received during the past year, twenty three were admitted, one of which was reconsidered and five were rejected. Of the twenty two who entered, seventeen were admitted free, one paid $150 above admission fee, two, part thereof, one stipulated the sum of $500 to be paid after death, and one pays $30 quarterly in liue of admission fee.</p>
   <p>Of the total number of forty four inmates at the home the past year, we deplore the death of three. One inmate left the home of his own accord and two were dismissed for cause, so there are at present thirty nine inmates domiciled at the home, seventeen male, and twenty two female, their ages ranging as follows: Between fifty and seventy, sixteen; seventy and eighty, seventeen; eighty and ninety, five; over ninety, one.</p>
   
   <p>Religious services, entirely in keeping with the views of our orthodox inmates, have been held regularly in the chapel ably conducted by one of our inmates.</p>
