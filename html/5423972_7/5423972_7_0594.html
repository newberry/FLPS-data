   <p>The American Society for the Advancement of the Hebrew University, recently organized in Chicago, promises to become an important factor in local Zionism and a guide for other American cities.</p>
   <p>Every cultivated Jew, whether or not he believes in Zionism in its various aspects, must be stirred by the project of establishing a university in Palestine, which will draw to it the best Jewish minds of the world and which will serve to stimulate Jewish scholarly accomplishment under its own identity.</p>
   <p>The membership of the society is limited to university graduates and those who have married such. There are enough Jewish university men and women in Chicago from which to recruit sufficient members for not only the A. S. A. H. U., but a dozen more like it. To our university men and women, who want to do something definite for the Jewish cause but who yet have held off, we suggest as an ideal medium, the American Society for the Advancement of the Hebrew University.</p>
