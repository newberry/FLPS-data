   <p>All branches of the Relief Volunteers have united to do more active work in order to raise more relief for the war-suffering Jews. The volunteers will now carry on this work on a large scale and will stand in close relationship to one another. Each branch will carry on the work independently, but all branches will meet together at intervals and discuss the relief work, which is under the supervision of the West Side Relief Committee.</p>
