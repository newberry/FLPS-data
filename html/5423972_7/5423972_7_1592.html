   <p>The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Hebrew Sheltering Home has been just celebrated in New York. The Jews of New York rejoiced in the existence of their institution, which has served for 25 years as the first lodgement where hundreds of thousands of immigrant Jews have found repose after a tiresome journey; where hundreds of thousands of the unfortunate, forlorn and despondent Jewish immigrants, have been provided with sleeping quarters for their first night after setting foot on American shores. The Hebrew Sheltering Home protects the immigrants against the dangers which they are likely to face in a new land where everything is strange and different from what they are accustomed to in their native countries.</p>
   <p>Like a faithful and devoted mother, the Hebrew Sheltering Home protected and safeguarded every Jewish immigrant; supplied him with meals and sleeping <span class="page-break">2</span>quarters; located his relatives and friends in case they, themselves, failed to inquire, and above all, set watch over him, lest he be left in the lurch. In doing this, the Hebrew Sheltering Home became more than what might have been expected; it became a balm in Gilead for the unfortunate Jewish immigrants. It alleviated the sufferings and abated the tears of the Jewish immigrants detained in Ellis Island, through immediate relief and sound counsel, things which the Hebrew Sheltering Home proffers to everyone.</p>
   <p>Yet there is a lot of sadness attached to this anniversary if we stop to think that, in spite of this institution's 25-year activity, during which human tears were shed aplenty and a vast multitude of sighs came from the hearts of Jewish immigrants, these sufferings still continue and the plight of our immigrants becomes worse than ever, and immigration more painful. It is when we think of this that sadness does creep into the jubilee.</p>
   <p>And while the Jews of New York, look proudly at the beautiful edifice of the <span class="page-break">3</span>Hebrew Sheltering Home, there are hundreds of Jewish immigrants waiting for permission to enter. This makes our eyes shed tears. The anniversary is shrouded by the fate of the next Jewish immigrants.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Sheltering Home shows the insecurity of the Jew, who must consume his best faculties in supporting a Hebrew Sheltering Home. This reveals our helplessness and loneliness, but we can't help congratulating such a Jewish community as will do its best to reduce this loneliness and helplessness.</p>
