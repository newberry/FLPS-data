   <p>The Proscurover Country men will have a Tag Day this Sunday. Nov. 28. It will be expected that all the Jews of Chicago, will respond whole heartily to the appeal for assistance for the most unfortunate state in Ukrania which has had one of the most horrible massacres.</p>
   <p>The Proscurover Relief Committee asks all country men of Poscurov and vicinity to come, Saturday evening, Nov. 27, in Getherwoods Hall Taylor and Marshfield Ave. and to enlist as a volunteer.</p>
   <p>We must have at least, two hundred couples in order to make this tag day a success.</p>
