   <p>We know what the men of Chicago have done for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], but we do not know what the women have done. Up to now, they have not had a chance to do anything. They were not asked to do anything, nor did they take upon themselves the initiative. Now they have been given some work to do--to sell "sacrifice bonds" at twenty-five dollars per bond.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish woman who is not poverty-stricken, can buy a sacrifice bond for twenty-five dollars. There should be about five thousand such women in Chicago. Of course, the rich women can buy sacrifice bonds of fifty, one hundred, or five hundred dollars. The men should contribute to the Keren Hayesod; the women should buy sacrifice bonds.</p>
   <p>The Jewish women of Chicago now have an opportunity to show the men what <span class="page-break">\2</span>they, the women, can accomplish. My heart tells me that the women will show themselves more enterprising than the men. The men will talk and the women will buy sacrifice bonds because Jewish women are accustomed to making sacrifices.</p>
