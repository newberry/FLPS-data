   <p>Gentlemen: I have the honor of presenting to you a summary of our committee's activities for the year 1921. This duty is assigned to me because I, as acting chairman during Mr. [B.] Horwich's visit to Europe, supervised the work of this committee, and am, therefore, quite familiar with all that has transpired.</p>
   <p>The outlook for relief work, beginning 1921, was very dark indeed, due to the prevailing business depression, but it never occurred to us to slacken the work in behalf of this cause. In fact we accelerated our efforts. For the first time since the outbreak of the World War, the true state of affairs in the Ukraine and Soviet Russia became public. The curtain rose on a tragedy of Jewish life in those lands; scenes revealed horrors beyond imagination; miserable conditions never before paralled. The heart-breaking tragedy of it all is indescribable. The determination to alleviate this suffering and to better conditions, served to bind us all the more firmly to the work we had already undertaken.</p>
   <p>In order to formulate plans for the work to be accomplished, the Seventh Annual Convention of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee and Middle Western Bureau was called for February 20, 1921. Four hundred delegates from thirty out-of-town affiliated communities, forty-five congregations, and fifty-nine lodges were represented.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, Mr. B. Horwich, our chairman, returned in time to participate in the convention, and related to us his observations of conditions in Europe. The insight and the wonderfully real descriptive passages of his report spurred the convention on to great enthusiasm in carrying on the work of relief.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Abram Raen Chapiro, the Chief Rabbi of Kovno, confirmed Mr. Horwich's report and praised the efficiency and the efficacy of the relief work done by the Central Relief Committee in the war-stricken areas of Europe.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm and determination manifested by the delegates forecasted the resulting success of the year's work.</p>
   <p>I will now proceed to give you an account of some of the activities of the year.</p>
   <p>On March 11th, a circular letter appealing for funds wherewith to supply our brethren with matzoh flour in time for Pesach was sent broadcast throughout the city and the results obtained were good beyond expectation.</p>
   <p>As in previous years, the matzoh bakers and dealers of the city co-operated with us by inducing their customers to purchase Relief Stamps, which netted a fair revenue. The sale of Relief Stamps was further increased this year by the sacramental wine dealers, headed by Mr. S. Zevin, who employed the same methods as the matzoh dealers.</p>
   <p>On April 1st, Messrs. Horwich, [S.] Neveleff, and myself, went to New York City to confer with the Central Relief Committee relative to broadening the scope of the Middle western Bureau. We were given authority to proceed with any arrangement we may wish to make regarding the expansion of the work of the Middle western Bureau throughout the Middle West and West. We also had a conference with the Joint Distribution Committee with regard to the prospective drive for the adoption of war orphans, and also familiarized ourselves with the financial adoption plan for war orphans. It was decided that a drive for the war-orphan adoption be inaugurated in Chicago by our committee, after the completion of the national fourteen-million-dollar drive.</p>
   <p>The Achron Shel Pesach Campaign in the congregations then was launched and the results achieved were most gratifying. The success of this drive was due in a large measure to the splendid efforts of the rabbis of Chicago who at all times are ready to render unstinted service. The following must also be mentioned as deserving of thanks and praise for their services rendered by making appeals at various synagogues during this campaign: Leonard Grossman, I. Brook, B. H. Bregstone, K. Steinberg, Max Horshak, Meyer Abrams, Max Shulman, S. B. Komaiko, P. P. Sachs, A. Patenkin, J. Miller.</p>
   <p>Through the efforts of three members of our committee, Dr. George Sultan and Messrs. Charles Bonus, and I. Shapiro, we have succeeded in getting revenue from the association of Jewish cemeteries of the Forest Park district. This income is derived from contributions made in response to the El Malarachomim. To date we have received $1,000 and we hope that the committee in charge will put forth every effort to further this project.</p>
   <p>During the summer months, affairs and meetings were arranged at the various summer resorts, such as Benton Harbor, South Haven, Mr. Clemens, Ottawa Beach. The proceeds derived therefrom were most gratifying.</p>
   <p>As a fitting climax to our activities, the Yomim Neroim Appeal in the congregations of Chicago resulted in the pledging of $110,000. Of this sum $50,000 has already been received at our office. In mentioning this activity, I cannot refrain from thanking the officers of the Keren Hayesod for their consideration in delaying their own campaign which was scheduled for that period so as not to interfere with the campaign for funds for war relief.</p>
   <p>I am sure the committee will appreciate the difficulties attending the collection of money at such a time and will realize the stupendous efforts that had to be put forth by our rabbis and speakers, in raising the above amount.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen who assisted us in the Achron Shel Pesach Appeal again assisted us in this Yomim Neroim Campaign, and in addition to these, we wish to make mention of the following, to whom also, thanks and praise are due: Judge H. M. Fisher, Judge Hugo Pam, Judge Joseph B. David, J. Merensky, P. Seman, Professor S. A. Hoffman, P. Levinson, J. L. Fox, J. Savitsky.</p>
   <p>Our work was not limited to Chicago alone, but as always, we operated the seven middle western states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska. From the financial report you will note the extent of our accomplishments in this field.</p>
   <p>In September, a national conference of the American Relief Committee was held in Chicago, in which we were asked to participate. It was agreed that a fourteen-million-dollar drive is to be launched throughout the United States from September, 1921, to March, 1922, and although we were ready to lend whatever co-operation possible to further this wonderful work, we nevertheless, thought that since the drive was really under the direct supervision of the American Relief Committee, the Central Relief Committee would as a result suffer consequently the cultural work, which is solely being undertaken by the Central Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>With this in view, Mr. Keveleff and I went to New York and conferred with the Joint Distribution Committee with regard to arriving at some agreement that twenty per cent of the total receipts of the campaign should be credited to the Central Relief Committee, of which thrity-three per cent is to be expended for cultural work. It is my great pleasure to inform you that we were successful in securing such an agreement which enables us to continue the cultural program as heretofore.</p>
   <p>At the opening of the Chicago campaign held December 5th, I presented in behalf of our committee, a check for $100,000 representing Chicago Orthodox Jewry's contribution. The applause I received upon presenting this check, I knew was not intended as a personal tribute, but applied to those hundreds and thousands of Chicago Jews who had given to their limit, even though some of the contributions were only of one dollar.</p>
   <p>Our work in this Chicago drive will be recognized to the extent that we are to receive half a million dollars of the $1,800,000 dollars raised here, which will be given over to us shortly, to forward to the Central Relief Committee. That we are fully deserving of the twenty per cent of the total receipts of the campaign is evident, for we are taking an active part in the national campaign as well as in the Chicago campaign, by furnishing the national committee with efficient organizers and speakers. Among those who serve in this capacity, we may mention: Judge H. M. Fisher, Max Korshak, S. Neveleff, and H. Steinberg. In this connection I may mention that Mr. Neveleff is assigned to speak in Milwaukee and Sheboygan.</p>
   <p>You undoubtedly realize that due to the national campaign, which has combed the land, this office will have to relinquish some of its collecting activities. But continued existence is justified by the fact that we are not merely a collecting agency, but a very potent aid to Chicago and middle western Jewry in rendering social service in all matters pertaining to European relief.</p>
   <p>To day this social service includes:</p>
   <p>1. An American Relief Administration Food Remittance Bureau, in existence since November 9, 1921. To date, 1,600 remittances have been sent, aggregating $22,00.</p>
   
   <p>2. An Information Bureau, which renders information and advice regarding communications between American and European relatives and aids in preparing the necessary affidavits which have to be submitted in Europe to the American Consul for visa on passports.</p>
   <p>3. A branch of the War Orphans Bureau of New York, which endeavors to reunite children in Europe with their relatives in this country. Through our efforts, a number of European children have recently joined their relatives in Chicago.</p>
   <p>4. A Personal Service Department, which renders aid in the many miscellaneous cases which come up.</p>
   <p>The primary object of our committee is to be of service at all times to the public in rendering relief to European relatives, and I can truthfully say that we are fulfilling our mission. We function as a real relief committee, desiring to do real work. Our chairman, Mr. Horwich, also being aware of this, cabled to us, while on his last trip to Europe, asking our aid in behalf of a number of Ukrainian refugees who were facing expulsion from the country, which practically meant death to them. Immediately upon receipt of this cable, a special meeting was held, and without further hesitation it was decided that $5,000 be forwarded at once. We felt justly rewarded for this action when we learned that we saved these people and relieved much suffering.</p>
   <p>I am most happy to have Mr. Horwich back with us and feel certain that with our captain again at the helm of the relief ship, the task confronting us, which is even greater than in previous years, will be shouldered and best results obtained.</p>
