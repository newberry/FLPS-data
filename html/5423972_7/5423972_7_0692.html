   <p>What right have the Chicago rabbis to authorize agents [persons who collect money for local or foreign charitable institutions and theological seminaries] whom they do not know, and what right have the laymen, among the Chicago Jewry, to accept the office of treasurer for this or that agent, if they have no information regarding the activity and efficiency of the institution the agent represents? If the rabbis and laymen in Chicago investigated the agents a little more carefully, less of the money contributed by Jews would go to waste.</p>
   <p>There is a man in this city at the present time, who is trying to get money from everybody for what he claims is a Zionist Orphanage in Palestine. Max Shulman inquired at the Palestinian Department of the American Zionist Organization as to whether it knew anything about the existence of such an institution--and the answer was no. Nevertheless, this man still has the effrontery to approach Zionists and extract checks from them for this dubious institution.</p>

   <p>Is it not time that the Chicago jews put an end to such a scandalous situation?</p>
