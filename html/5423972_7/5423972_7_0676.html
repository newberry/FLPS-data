   <p>An attempt has finally been made to create some order in the M'shulochim [collectors for charitable institutions and theological seminaries] business, at a meeting which was held Monday evening in the Hebrew Theological College. The meeting was well attended by prominent laymen and rabbis, as well as officials of various foreign institutions of charity. Following a long and heated discussion of the entire question, it was decided to appoint a temporary committee of fifteen, which is to be known as the Control Committee for Foreign Charities. This committee will have control over the M'shulochim. No M'shuloch will be able to collect money unless he has credentials from the committee. He must also carry stamps issued by the committee. If you give a M'shuloch a quarter or half a dollar, he must give <span class="page-break">2</span>you a quarter or half dollar's worth of stamps, and in this way, the committee will know how much money the M'shuloch collects in the course of a day or week. If you wish to give the M'Shuloch a check, the check should be made out to the treasurer of the committee. The treasurer's name will be announced Thursday morning. You will soon become familiar with all details of the administration of the committee. In the meantime, do not give any money to any M'shuloch until the committee announces the new setup.</p>
   <p>I believe that every group of people is entitled to its political representation. If a group of people is socialistically inclined, it should have socialist representation. Theoretically, the comrades accept this principle, but in practice the Chicago comrades are seeking at the present time to obtain political representation in the City Hall for the ward that is the center of Jewish activity--the Twenty-fourth Ward. Should the comrade who is a candidate from this ward accidentally creep into the City Council, he <span class="page-break">3</span>will have to be the spokesman for the Jewish Orthodoxy of Chicago, and it is obvious what this will lead to. But what do you think will be the result? Either a Republican or Democratic candidate will be elected, and the comrade who is a candidate will keep on running, because the majority of Jews in that ward are Jews and not comrades.</p>
