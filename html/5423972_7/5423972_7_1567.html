R. Lasker, Second-Vice President; B. J. Schiff, Treasurer; and Max Schulman, Secretary.</p>
   <p>The President immediately appointed a Budget Committee to work out budgets for every institution connected with the Federation.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silver suggested that the yearly subscription price shall not be the same to those who cannot afford to pay large sums yearly, making it possible for them to belong to the Federation.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Schulman, the secretary, will in the near future send out lists with names of all the new directors, to every institution.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting adjourned, Mr. Israel Cohen, one of the new directors, announced that he is now raising his yearly subscription from $200 to $500.</p>
