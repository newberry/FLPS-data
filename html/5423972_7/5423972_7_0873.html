   <p>The meeting of the Keren Hayesod Committee of one hundred has taken place and has elected a new administrative and a new executive committee to carry on the work. The accomplishments of the meeting itself was a fair example of what Chicago Jewry can do for the Keren Hayesod if it makes up its mind to do anything at all. Most of the members of the Committee of one hundred have already paid their own pledges made during the presence of Dr. Weitzmann in Chicago, and a great many of them have already secured most of the pledges from their friends for the Keren Hayesod, but still this handful of people have underwritten Thursday evening the sum of forty-two thousand dollars to be presented to Nachum Sokolow upon his arrival here, together with other forthcoming funds. These forty-two thousand dollars must be collected in cold cash before Sokolow's arrival, and we are sure not only will this sum be collected, but that many of the underwriters will go over the top.</p>
   <p>A group consisting of B. Horwich, Samuel Phillipson, and Rabbi Saul Silber has undertaken to raise five thousand dollars. These three gentlemen can raise ten, if they make up their minds to do it. Rabbi Silber, B. Horwich, and Samuel Phillipson, have only to devote two or three days of their time to the raising of funds to secure a much larger sum than they have undertaken to collect. The same holds good of another group consisting of Judge Joseph Shulman, Mr. Paul Rottenberg, and Mr. S. B. Komaiko, who have underwritten four thousand dollars. Judge Shulman can single-handedly raise ten, and Paul Rottenberg and S. B. Komaiko are not cripples either. They can also raise substantial sums. If these three princes of the "shnorrers" make up their minds that a sum of ten thousand dollars must be raised, before the arrival of Sokolow, then one may take it for granted that it will be raised. But they have preferred to be moderate in their pledges--perhaps with the object of giving Chicago Jewry a pleasant surprise when Sokolow comes to Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>We say it is our sincere belief that the handful of people that have attended the Thursday meeting at the Morrison Hotel can raise not forty-two thousand dollars, but one hundred thousand dollars. This handful of people, however, do not yet represent Chicago Jewry, although many of them are recognized and beloved leaders of the community. There are three hundred thousand Jews in Chicago, and Chicago is not the worst Jewish community in the world. Chicago is not a Sodom. Out of three hundred thousand Jews, five hundred or one thousand will be found to be willing to work for the Keren Hayesod, and every one of the volunteers can bring in some money, from one hundred to five hundred dollars or more. And if this force will be well organized, there is no reason why Chicago Jewry should not be able to raise the sum of at least a quarter of a million dollars before Sokolow arrives, and present the great leader a quarter of a million dollar check.</p>
   <p>It is thus up to the new administration and the new executive committee to put things in motion and make them going [sic]. We guess that the administrative committee of the Chicago Keren Hayesod will elect Mr. B. Horwich as its chairman, and it will be up to Mr. Horwich, who is an experienced and able public worker, to show what he can do. We believe Mr. Horwich can do a whole lot. We believe that he can make the Keren Hayesod movement in Chicago a going and paying concern, but we also believe that he can do it only on one condition, and this condition is: Give up diplomacy, give up attempts at reconciliation of the ex-leaders with the new leaders of the American Zionist organization, give up side issues, forget personalities, and work for the Keren Hayesod. If Mr. Horwich will do it, and will concentrate all his energies on the Keren Hayesod, he will make it go, otherwise it will be a failure. Mr. Horwich has a good committee to work with. He can have the expert advice of such an able Zionist worker as Max Shulman, and can have the enthusiasm, idealism, and ability to raise funds, of Judge Schulman, and the enthusiasm and ability of the other administrative committee, and of course the assistance and help of the executive. They are all ready to serve loyally and be at the command of the leader, if the leader is ready to do the commanding with one object in view: Get vast sums for the Keren Hayesod, and nothing else.</p>
   
   <p>The responsibility for the success of the Keren Hayesod movement in Chicago, the responsibility for the reception to be extended to Mr. Sokolow and his associates in Chicago, rest now entirely on the administrative and executive committees that have been elected on the Thursday meeting, and especially on the heads of these two committees, who are to show the way to their colleagues, and serve as guides. They must show what they can accomplish within the next four weeks, and if they can put it over us, they will be very successful in their great mission. Then they will redeem the honor of Chicago Jewry and will help substantially in the rebuilding of the country of our forefathers and of our children.</p>
