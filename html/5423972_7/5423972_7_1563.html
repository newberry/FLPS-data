   <p>At a meeting last night of the children, of various classes in the Hebrew Institute - the Jewish children evinced that the present world war found sympathy in their young hearts for the groans and troubles in all corners of the world. The children determined to submit a pure and simple protest against war. A "peace week" will be arranged for this purpose, during which time the children will raise a fund to help their little sisters and brothers - -in the war stricken countries.</p>
   
   <p>This is a Noble Decision.</p>
   <p>This will not be done by children of the Hebrew Institute classes alone, but they will organize, for this purpose, all the Jewish children of Chicago as well as all the Talmud Torahs Sabbath and Sunday schools, also National Radical and Folk schools, etc.</p>
   <p>When the organization work is completed, the children will work out plans for the "Peace and Relief Week.!'</p>
