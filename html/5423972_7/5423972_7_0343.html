   <p>Today Dr. Bluestein is arriving in Chicago. He is the former Superintendent of the New York Educational Alliance. The purpose of his arrival is the taking over of the directorship of the Chicago Hebrew Institute. Dr. Bluestein's task is not an easy one. The Hebrew Institute is a colossal undertaking. The financial aspect of the institution will have to be so arranged as to supply the essential foundation for extensive moral activity for which Chicago is not as yet accustomed. It is, therefore, so important to Chicago, that they are able to secure Dr. Bluestein, for the Hebrew Institute and for Chicago. A better man for this institution, could not be discovered. The years Dr. Bluestein has spent at the New York Educational Alliance, have given him the practical experience in addition to his natural talents, of which Chicago Jews will be the beneficiaries. From New York Dr. Bluestein is bringing the good wishes of all classes of Jews. Let us hope that Chicago Jews will respect Dr. Bluestein and will help him make the plans of work for the great Jewish institution a reality - - The Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
