   <p>It was also arranged at the meeting that the convention committee should meet at four o'clock on Thursday at the office of Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt to formulate final plans for the organization of the seven western states.</p>
   
   <p>At the meeting it was also announced that about two hundred cases of clothing will soon be shipped to Poland via Danzig. The clothing is being collected and packed under the supervision of a committee composed of B. Horwich, S. Rosenblatt and B. J. Bronstein.</p>
