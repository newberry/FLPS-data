   <p>At a dinner and meeting held last night in the Ashland Club House, plans were drawn up for a campaign, to be undertaken immediately, to raise $25,000 for the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities, and to obtain new subscribers in order to cover the deficit. More than one hundred well-known Jewish welfare workers were present at the dinner, and inspiring talks were delivered by Julius Rosenwald and Rabbi Saul Silber.</p>
   <p>The speakers pointed out that the budget of the Federation amounted to $110,000, and only $80,000 had thus far been collected. The balance must, therefore, be raised so that the Federation can continue its work.</p>
   <p>This campaign will be conducted by a "special army" of which Mr. A. S. Ray is to be "commander-in-chief". He has already divided the army into groups under the guidance of captains, who, together with their companies, will campaign in various districts of the city.</p>
