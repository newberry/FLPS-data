   <p>A substation for collecting old clothes for the benefit of Jewish war-victims has been opened on the South Side. It is expected that this will result in more clothes being gathered in this neighborhood.</p>
   <p>The station is located in wolf's Mattress Factory, 1500 West 47th Street, corner Laflin Street. Mrs. H. Wolf has promised Mr. Edward Shulman, administrator of the Campaign for Old Clothes, and Miss Lillian Rossman, chairman of the South Side War Service Committee, not only to place part of her factory at their disposal for old clothes, but has also promised that her husband would send out trucks and men. These will collect the bundles that the good-hearted housewives of the South Side and Englewood will give for the suffering Jews in the war-torn countries.</p>
   <p>This noble deed of Mrs. Wolf will certainly inspire her sisters (fellow nationals) to give as many of their old clothes as they can for the benefit of the unfortunate Jews in Europe.</p>
