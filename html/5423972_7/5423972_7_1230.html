   <p>The Tag Day, for the benefit of the Proskurov program victims, was a success. It the volunteers would have responded in greater numbers, the relief would have appropiated, at least, $5,000. Although the relief has a net profit of approximately $1,000.</p>
   <p>The Proskurov Relief, thanks the Jewry of Chicago, through the courtesy of the Forward, that helped materialize this Tag Day into success.</p>
