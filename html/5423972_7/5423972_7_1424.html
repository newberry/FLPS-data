   <p>Don't discard your old clothes or shoes. They can be made very useful if you give them to the suffering Jews in the war countries, where these articles cannot be obtained even for money.</p>
   <p>The Relief Office has considered this problem at some of its meetings and decided to issue an appeal to the great Jewish masses not to discard their old shoes and clothes, but to keep them and notify the Special Office which the Joint Relief Committee has opened at 932 West 12th Street. A special messenger will be sent after the bundle.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows about the high cost of clothes and shoes in Russia, and everyone knows that they cannot be obtained even for money. Something must be done about it in order that Jewish war victims should not walk about naked or barefooted. The Relief Committee has decided, therefore, to collect old shoes and clothes, which are to be found in every home, renovate and ship them to the war countries for the naked and barefooted Jewish women, children, young and old men.</p>

   <p>Who could refuse to give his old clothes to a war victim? The person willing to give away his old suit or shoes hardly misses anything, yet by so doing he will accomplish much. He will give a suffering Jew a suit to cover his bones and a pair of shoes for his swollen feet.</p>
   <p>The Relief Office is therefore certain that every Chicago Jew, and particularly every housewife will respond generously to the appeal of the Relief Office and begin at once to save old clothes and shoes.</p>
   <p>The young attorney, Edward Shulman, brother of the well-known Zionist and civic leader, Max Shulman, was appointed administrator of this work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edward Shulman has already perfected all the plans and is prepared to send out trucks to gather the bundles, sort, clean and mend them for shipment across.</p>
   <p>For this reason no one should discard his old clothes. Pack them in bundles and donate them to the Jewish war victims.</p>
