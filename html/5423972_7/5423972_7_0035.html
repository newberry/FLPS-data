   <p>Fifty years ago Isaac Cohn emigrated from Russian Poland to the United States. Soon afterward his wife and children also came. They made their home in Chicago's ghetto. Mrs. Cohn died about twenty-five years ago. Her husband left their young children with some kindhearted people and moved to the country. He boarded with a farmer named Hintz, who lived three miles from Burlington, Wisconsin. The amount paid for room and meals and feed for Cohn's horse was twelve dollars per month. Although the sum he paid was small, he was treated like a member of the family.</p>
   <p>He bought and sold jewelry, furniture, and calves. Being of a thrifty nature, he kept a savings account in the Burlington Bank. In recent years Miss Ida Meinhardt had charge of his bank account.</p>
   <p>Last October Mrs. Hintz died. As a result of the necessary rearrangement of the household Cohn was asked to pay thirty dollars per month, especially since he was subject to frequent attacks of epilepsy and required much care. Cohn wrote to his married daughter, who lived in Columbus, Ohio, and she gladly offered him a home. On the way to Columbus he suffered an epileptic attack in the railroad station at Chicago. He was taken to the home of Rabbi Albach, who lived on the West Side. Cohn told the rabbi of his plans, and informed him that he was worth sixteen thousand dollars. Thereupon Rabbi Albach allegedly explained that Cohn, who was ninety-one years old, could also find a pleasant place to pass the remaining years of his life at the old people's home located on North Crawford Avenue, which is operated by orthodox Jews.</p>
   <p>Cohn was convinced that this old people's home would be a good place in which to live, but he refused to surrender his entire fortune to the home as all applicants are required to do. As a compromise he offered to bequeath fifteen thousand dollars to the institution. The vice-president of the home, Attorney Lasker, was not satisfied with the offer, it is said, and Cohn then gave the home ten thousand dollars in notes which had been thoroughly examined by Miss Meinhardt. Nevertheless, a will was drawn up, and the home was made a beneficiary. One thousand dollars was bequeathed to Rabbi Albach's congregation and a like sum to a Jewish institution in Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>However, an attorney, engaged by Cohn's relatives, has started suit in probate court to have a guardian appointed for Cohn. The case was opened yesterday in Judge Horner's court.</p>
