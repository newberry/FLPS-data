   <p>The Women's Aid, which has been in existence for nearly three years, during which time it has done faithful work among the poor in the section of the West Side to which its field of labor is confined, has changed its methods and its name. Hereafter it will be known as the Women's Aid Loan Association. Its purpose will be to loan small sums of money, without interest, to deserving poor, and enable them to procure a better start in life. The loan is to be repaid at the rate of one-twentieth part each week.</p>
