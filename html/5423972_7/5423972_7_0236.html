   <p>Lawndale Civic Center.</p>
   <p>If you wish to discover the social standard of any particular nationality, investigate the National Institutions to which the people have given birth. If you are interested in the development of the people of the Lawndale district, investigate its institutions, which so well display the spiritual tendencies of the Jewish population living in the Douglas Park district. What type of institution does one find in the neighborhood around which the Jewish people group themselves? There are synagogues which act as a focus for the Jewish orthodox; there are semi-reform temples where the young folks of the wealthier class are to be found; there are card clubs, which are the first concern of the idlers, who play cards at night and conduct capitalistic politics during the day. The necessity for a new institution around which people of intelligence could focus was observed several years ago by several young men and women.</p>
   <p>Thus was created the Lawndale Civic Center, a purely cultural and social institution <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which does not bear the stamp of philanthropy, but is a real center, maintained by the dues paid by the membership of the L. C. C. Its ability to unite the various elements of Jewry for the center's support, is the best proof of its social necessity.</p>
   <p>The L. C. C. is highly esteemed as an institution for cultural and social progress. Throughout the city the L. C. C. is famous for its accomplishments. The rich, erudite, and instructive lectures are given weekly by competent personalities, under the direction of the center. The steady attendants wait impatiently for the Wednesday lectures.</p>
   <p>The classes in Jewish literature are led by K. Urman. The classes in English literature are led by W. S. Richardson. Jewish history is taught by the capable Prof. of History, Wolach. The L. C. C. is a credit to the Lawndale district.</p>

   <p>The L. C. C. has had a large financial growth in the past four years. This has enabled them to move into the beautiful building of the Lawndale Club.</p>
   <p>The L. C. C. has proven so successful in its cultural activity that those who formerly whiled away their time with card playing are now studying History and Philosophy.</p>
   <p>Under the direction of the L. C. C. the Jewish masses will have a more pleasant place in which to spend their time. In addition to the above mentioned activities, the L. C. C. is conducting classes in French and Modern Drama and a Current Event class is being held every Friday evening, in which a general discussion of the political occurrences of the day is held. These discussions enrich the minds of the visitors.</p>
