   <p>Today is Flower Day of the National Fund. Hundreds of Jewish daughters will be on the streets of Chicago with flowers in their hands, and will greet you in the name of mother Zion. They will offer you a flower and beseech you to remember Zion. Zion needs you now more than ever, and we need Zion now more than ever before to rise from the ruins and become again, as it once was, the home of the Jewish nation. We must do everything to bring Zion back to its former glory, when we were a nation equal with other nations. In this work of reconstruction every Jew, rich or poor, young or old, must participate.</p>
   <p>Palestine is the only country, open to the persecuted Jews of Eastern Europe. America will soon close its doors to all immigrants, and where then will the unfortunate and tortured Jews of Eastern Europe turn? Whither will they flee?</p>
   <p>They can only wander to Palestine, and Palestine cannot receive them so long as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>we are not providing for the country to enable her to receive a large number of immigrants. The aim of the National Fund is to prepare Palestine; for a mass immigration, to obtain land, build homes, and establish industries, etc.</p>
   <p>Every cent given to the Jewish daughters of Chicago for the National Fund goes to Palestine; every cent helps to build the country, and helps in the building of a home for our people.</p>
   <p>When a Jewish daughter meets you today on the street and brings you a Zion greeting with a flower in her hand, respond to that greeting to the best of your ability and prove that you are a sincere Jew.</p>
   <p>It seems that the doors of America will soon be closed for a year to all immigrants. What this means to the millions of unfortunate, hungry, and tortured Jews of Eastern Europe can be readily understood.</p>
   <p>But very few realize what this means to the Jews of America. It means a spiritual blockade of American Jewry. Until now, American Jewry has imported <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>its spiritual material from Europe; scientists, authors, poets, artists, Rabbis, well-learned men and sages. Our whole spiritual life in America depends upon what Europe has given us, and now we are suddenly cut off from our spiritual well, so far for a year, and later--God knows for how long!</p>
   <p>When a group of people is cut off from import-material or spiritual--it means a blockade. For the next year the Jewish spirit in America will be blockaded, and the result of any long blockade is well known: hunger and misery.</p>
   <p>The other elements in America of European origin like the Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans, etc. will suffer only materially from the restriction of immigration, while we will suffer both materially and spiritually, because our center of gravity is America and their center of gravity is the old country. Therefore, to us, the restriction of immigration is equivalent to a blockade.</p>
