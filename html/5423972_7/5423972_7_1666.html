   <p>The cold wind that blew with such force over the city yesterday prevented much activity for the Federation. Not all the committees assigned to the Lawndale district appeared for action. Only ten committees worked, but, they appropriated subscriptions for $1,000 for the Federation.</p>
   <p>At a meeting yesterday evening, a permanent Lawndale committee of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities was organized. It will have its headquarters in the Marks Nathan Orphan Home building. Also, a permanent secretary was elected who will work in the office daily. The duties of the committee consist of getting subscribers and collecting subscriptions in this Jewish district.</p>

   <p>The officers elected are: Charles Mitchell, chairman; L. Lerman, 1st vice-president; B. Schwartz, second vice-president; and H. Misner, secretary. Their district covers the territory from 12th Street to 18th Street and from Albany Avenue to 40th Avenue.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the committee will be held at Mr. Charles Mitchell's home. The acceptance of more members living in that district will be in order.</p>
