   <p>The Jewis orphans of the Ukraine would not ordinarily be regarded as fortunate because of their tragic lot but it can be truly said that they are fortunate to have a man like Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, acting chairman of the Chicago War Relief Committee take up their cause as he is doing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenblatt is determined that five hundred orphans shall be adopted by Chicago Jewish families and Mr. Rosenblatt knows just where they are going to be placed when they get here. The families have been found who are ready to do this act of mercy and humanity and thereby save the good name of the Chicago Jewish Community.</p>
   <p>The trouble is with the immigration laws but it is expected that this difficulty will be overcome in view of the fact that the restrictions that exist on immgration, do not apply to children under the age of 12.</p>

   <p>When in addition to the age consideration, it is recalled how mighty an appeal the cause of the opphans upon all, It is not to be expected that Uncle Sam will put obstacles in the way of this humanitarian effort that Mr. Rosenblatt and his associates are working so hard to carry to a successful conclusion.</p>
