   <p>At an annual meeting of the Chicago branch of Haias (shelter for Jews) held a few days ago, Mr. John L. Bernstein, president of the society, explained the excellent work this great institution does for immigrants and their relatives. He showed through statistics the great work done by the main body of the society throughout the country, saying that last year, three million dollars was sent to Europe through the Haias, thus saving the American Jews $600,000, which would have been the cost had this amount been sent through any other source.</p>
   <p>In his annual report, Mr. Kopeland, president of the Chicago branch, gave a general survey of the work of the local organizations for the last year, which was one of the most successful in the history of the organization.</p>

   <p>Over sixteen thousand cases were treated with utmost care and attention. Hundreds of immigrants were met at the depots, and told how to continue their travels; over six thousand affidavits were filled and sent from Ellis Island to Europe; and hundreds were assisted in filling out citizen papers. About fourteen thousand were given food and shelter in the Haias, and over $159,000 was sent to relatives of thousands of immigrants in Europe.</p>
   <p>Gifts were presented to the president and his wife; also to Morris Tower, chairman of the house committee, as tokens of appreciation for their good work in the Chicago branch.</p>
   <p>About seventy-five guests were present at this annual meeting and banquet, where arrangements to form a women's auxiliary were completed.</p>
