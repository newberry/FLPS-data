   <p>Today is Judgment Day for the Chicago Orthodoxy. The Orthodox Jews of Chicago will have to prove this evening whether they are sincere in their prayer "Let our eyes behold Thy return to Zion". Tonight they will have to prove whether they realize their duty as Orthodox Jews and whether they are a force in the Jewish life of Chicago.</p>
   <p>For the first time in the history of the Orthodoxy of Chicago, the [Orthodox] synagogue representatives will participate in a great undertaking as a united body. If the representatives of the Chicago Orthodoxy are successful today in their undertaking, if they are able to prove that they are a power in Chicago--organizationally, morally, and financially--then from tomorrow on, a new chapter in the history of Chicago Orthodoxy will begin. The present Association of Synagogue Presidents will develop into a solid and mighty <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organization, and the foundation for a United Orthodoxy in Chicago will be laid.</p>
   <p>It will be a new Jewish Chicago, a responsible and organized Chicago. The spirit of indifference will disappear, the spirit of irresponsibility will disappear, and the Orthodox Jews of Chicago will begin to have faith in their own forces and will embark upon great and productive work.</p>
   <p>This is what every serious-minded, thinking Orthodox Jew in Chicago should understand. Chicago Orthodoxy has, today, a great opportunity to become a power, to become an organized force, and if it neglects this opportunity, if it does not carry through today's undertaking with great success--a success so great that people will speak about it and of which we may be proud--then it has exposed, before the world, its weakness and its helplessness.</p>
   <p>Today's undertaking is for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Organization], which is by itself the greatest undertaking in Jewish history; it is the greatest problem that our people have to solve today. The Zionist leaders are watching with anxious eyes the movement of the Orthodoxy, the action of the Orthodox Jews, the response of the Orthodox Jews to the Keren Hayesod. If they respond generously to the appeal of the Keren Hayesod, then they will accomplish two things as the same time: they will help to build our homeland and to save our people in Eastern Europe from destruction, and by doing that, they, themselves, will become a power, the greatest power in modern Jewish life.</p>
   <p>If they do not do what our Zionist leaders expect them to do, then they will ruin our people in Eastern Europe, they will ruin our work in Palestine, and they will ruin themselves, politically and morally.</p>
   <p>If the Orthodoxy doesn't make its greatest effort for the Keren Hayesod today, then who will? The Jewish Socialists? The followers of Reform Judaism? The indifferent Jews who live by the slogan, "eat, drink, and be merry for <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>tomorrow we die"?</p>
   <p>Just as the Orthodoxy is the pillar of Jewry in the lands of the Diaspora, so it is the last and only hope of our people who want to be redeemed from the Diaspora. Today both suffer--our people in Eastern Europe and the Jewish Orthodoxy in America. Our people in Eastern Europe seek redemption and the Orthodoxy in America seeks strength to continue to live and work effectively. The Orthodoxy may be saved by the Keren Hayesod and the Keren Hayesod may be saved by the Orthodoxy, if its representatives have sufficient intelligence to understand [the need of] the present moment, and if they have sufficient energy and strength to utilize the great opportunity to help save Zion, and by so doing, be saved.</p>
   <p>What will the representatives of Chicago Orthodoxy do tonight? They cannot come to the banquet empty-handed. The minimum that they should raise tonight for the Keren Hayesod is thirty thousand dollars in cash. There are in Chicago over a hundred Orthodox synagogues with a membership of six or seven thousand. Such a group of organized Jews, most of whom belong to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the middle class must give not less than thirty thousand dollars if it wants to be respected. The purpose for which the money is given is such that the organized Chicago Orthodoxy cannot, under any circumstances, give less. It often happens in Chicago that a few members of a synagogue will come together and raise ten thousand dollars in one evening for their synagogue. If this is possible, then all the Chicago synagogues can give thirty thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>At this moment it is not entirely clear what the rabbis and the synagogue presidents have done to make tonight's undertaking a success. If the representatives of the Chicago Orthodoxy should today--at the eleventh hour--make an earnest effort to visit their members, and to explain to them what is at stake and what their duty is at the present fateful moment, then they can still assure the success of their undertaking.</p>
   <p>We appeal to the representatives of the Orthodoxy in Chicago in the name of the honor and the future of the Chicago Orthodoxy--go out and do your duty! Help build our land and help save the Orthodoxy in Chicago.</p>
