   <p>From letters which have been received recently from the Ukraine and other regions, it is obvious that the Jewish situation there has taken a turn for the worse. For the last five years, the Ukraine has been the caldron of Jewish sorrow. The many political upheavals and endless pogroms have brought despair upon the Jews there. Hundreds of thousands of orphans and widows, countless numbers of sick and infirm, victims of persecution, go about barefoot, naked, and hungry, and their plight is extremely critical. Circumstances will probably force them to celebrate the Passover at empty tables, and who knows, perhaps with chomatz [leaven bread], during Passover. Saddened and despairing, they will drench their barren tables with their tears. Will we permit this to happen? No, certainly not.</p>
   <p>Throughout Jewish history, mazoth have been the silent witness of both Jewish tribulation and Jewish compassion. Silently, this "humble bread" speaks of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the blood accusations, of pogroms, of the horrors that we have endured in the Diaspora. At the same time, it speaks of Jewish brotherhood, compassion, and charity. Before the Jew would bake his mazoth, he would give Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy]. At the Seder table he would cry out," Let all those who are hungry come in and eat."</p>
   <p>Chicago Jews, sons of compassion! The United Rabbinate appeals to you in this moment of despair; may the mazoth be the witness of our aid to our unfortunate brethren. Remember to purchase mazoth which carry relief stamps. May these stamps serve as the seal of Jewish compassion. Instead of the enemies of Israel desecrating our mazoth with their blood accusations, let us adorn it with the seal of charity, the symbol of the Jewish character--aid to the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>The United Rabbinate of Chicago,</p>
   <p>Rabbi Judah L. Gordon, president,</p>
   <p>Rabbi Eliezar R. Mishkin, secretary.</p>
