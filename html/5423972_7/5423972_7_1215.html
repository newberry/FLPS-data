   <p>The Zionist organization of America will soon issue an appeal to American Jewry asking the sum of ten million dollars to prepare Palestine for the anticipated Jewish emigration. Ten million dollars is quite a sum of money, but divided equally among three million Jews it amounts to only three dollars and thirty-three cents per person. That, it seems, should not be difficult to obtain. The war relief was collected much more; yet there is confusion in the Zionist camp, a feeling of desperation. Many Zionist leaders have no confidence in their own ability to rouse the Jewish masses to the point of giving, and they have no hope that the Jewish masses will respond. This doubt is often expressed by the Zionist leaders.</p>
   <p>No one can doubt that the sum of ten million dollars is necessary. Never in the history of the Jewish Diaspora have so many millions of Jews been in such <span class="page-break">2</span>dire need of a home as they are now; never in our history since the destruction of the Temple, has Palestine had a more brilliant outlook for its restoration as a Jewish homeland than at the present moment. Then, whence does the fear arise that the Jews of America--the most fortunate Jews in the world--will not answer Zion's appeal?</p>
   <p>The fear is present because the majority of Zionist leaders, who should be the leaders of the masses, lack imagination as well as knowledge of the present Jewish situation in the different countries. They can no longer rouse the masses with eloquence and oratory as they could before the war.</p>
   <p>When one approaches a Jew nowadays to speak to him about the glory of an independent Jewish nation in a country of its own, and of the request of Mother Zion for assistance, the reply of that Jew is that now is not the proper time to speak of a homeland in Palestine; he must think about his near ones and dear <span class="page-break">3</span>ones in the war countries who are condemned to a life of misery and starvation. It is not for us to enter into a controversy at this time as to whether such a plea is justified or not. Nevertheless the plea remains, and many of our Zionist leaders also find it much easier to make an appeal for the "mothers and infants starving of hunger". They receive more applause and more dollars.</p>
   <p>In spite of everything, a person with common sense and an ounce of brains realizes that millions of people must have security and a home to be able to exist in the world, and the problem of a homeland for the Jewish people, therefore, is of greater importance than a loaf of bread for the present.</p>
   <p>We still hear Zionist speeches with lame phrases about the benevolence and beauty of regaining Palestine; we hear of the "fig tree and the grapevine" and the "milk and honey". One seldom hears a Zionist speech emphasizing the Jewish misery of the present moment which makes Palestine attractive to the Jew.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>For no matter where he is, he cannot remain there. He has no other place to go because the world is closed to him.</p>
   <p>It is true that for the smug, satisfied, and comfortable Jew in America such a condition is hard to visualize. Therein lies the work of the Zionist leaders and propagandists--to bring the facts before the eyes of the American Jew in order to stir his heart. Let American Jews become aware of the fact that on all the roads leading from all of the Eastern European countries there are groups of hungry, half-starved, desperate Jews, on their way to Palestine.</p>
   <p>Palestine,however, is still closed; it is still in the possession of the British military, as a "hostile territory". Yet the groups of desperate Jews are flocking there in the hope that soon--soon Palestine will be opened, permitting them to enter. Some of them have actually succeeded in entering.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>These groups of Jews are being driven not by enthusiasm for Zion, but by bitter want, destitution, and the conviction that there is no hope for them in the countries from which they have come. These groups of Jews were the first to succeed in escaping ahead of the hundreds of thousands who are now trying to emigrate, but who are unable to leave the countries that persecute them.</p>
   <p>Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the other countries of Eastern Europe--none of them hold any hope for a Jewish future, at any rate, not during the present generation. A gigantic and horrible expulsion is taking place in the world today compared with which all previous expulsions of the Middle Ages seem to be mere child's play. The only difference is that the present expulsion was not decreed by a ruler, but was brought on by slaughter, pogroms, and boycotts.</p>
   <p>When you compare the horrible question: "Whither shall the unfortunate go?" to the question: "What shall they eat?", the latter loses its significance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Of what value can a meal be to a person sentenced to death?</p>
   <p>The appeal which the Zionists should make nowadays to the public must be based upon facts and should read approximately as follows:</p>
   <p>"Know ye, Jews of America, that hundreds of thousands of your unfortunate brethren have started on their way to Palestine. They must go and there is no other place for them to go!</p>
   <p>"Know ye, Jews of America, that millions of Jews are waiting for the first opportunity to seek a home in Palestine, because it is the only place on the face of the earth that is willing to accept them!</p>
   <p>"The preparation of Palestine is now pending and you must see it through! Should you fail to respond, then the blood of your brethren will cry out to you from the accursed earth of the countries that persecute them. Your conscience <span class="page-break">7</span>will not rest and the Christian world will point its finger at you as a heartless people who failed their brethren!</p>
   <p>"The march to Palestine has already started. We must prevent famine and pestilence in Palestine for the sake of the emigrant Jewish masses!"</p>
   <p>When this has been made clear to the Jewish public, then the raising of ten million dollars will not be difficult.</p>
