   <p>A great patriotic mass meeting of all Jewish peddlers will be held at one o'clock today in Netherwood Hall, Marshfield Avenue and Taylor Street. This meeting has been arranged by the Citizens' Protective Association. At this meeting, plans will be discussed regarding the ways in which every Jewish peddler can help the government win the war. The good work done by the junk and rag peddlers for the Red Cross is known to all. Similar activities will now be urged upon all the peddlers.</p>
   <p>The plan is a simple one. The peddlers will buy Red Cross Stamps at cost price and with them will pay the housewives for the goods that they buy (from the housewives). The Red Cross Stamps are accepted as cash. It costs the peddler nothing, but the Red Cross benefits by it greatly. helping the Red Cross is the same as helping the government.</p>
   <p>Therefore let no peddler fail to attend today's meeting; help formulate these <span class="page-break">2</span>plans, and at the same time hear well-known speakers discuss our patriotic duties.</p>
