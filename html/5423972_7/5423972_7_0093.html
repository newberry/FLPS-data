   <p>The moral development of a people manifests itself in its care for the aged who, after a long and hard struggle, have become weak and need support.</p>
   <p>A people that reverently takes care of its aged, that cherishes and protects them, does more to bring to a realization the ideal of genuine humanitarianism than do all its treasures of knowledge and industry.</p>
   <p>These were the sentiments expressed by Mr. M. Rosenbaum, the first and present president of the Home for the Aged Jews, in his first annual report. These were the sentiments that served as the original stimulus for this grand undertaking, which now stands before us, completed, and in all its splendor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The first contribution for the erection of the Home for Aged Jews came from Abram Slimmer. On April 6, 1891, the men who signed the first bonds elected the first Board of Directors. They then proceeded with the incorporation and the drafting of statutes and by-laws which were later accepted at a meeting on May 4, 1891, in the hall of the Standard Club.</p>
   <p>The directors then purchased a suitable piece of property at 62nd Street and Drexel Boulevard....including the cost of examination of title, etc., the total cost was $35,988.58. Every cent of it, as well as the cost of erecting the building, was paid long ago.</p>
   <p>The building committee then engaged an architect, Mr. S. B. Eisendrath. In the early part of May 1892, the first shovel of dirt was removed to make way for the foundation; and today exactly one year later, the building stands completed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>For several hours, the assembled people, among whom were members of the best Jewish families, went through the building, expressing admiration. At 3 o'clock, the visitors assembled on the third floor, and soon the hall was filled to the last seat.</p>
   <p>The speakers for the occasion were seated on the platform. After entertainment by a well-trained, talented quartet from the Sinai Temple congregation, Bernhard Cahn gave a brief address; and then turned over the keys of the building to the president, M. Rosenbaum, and thus to the Society of the Home for Aged Jews as well.</p>
   <p>President Rosenbaum accepted the keys and replied as follows: "Members of the Home for Aged Jews, ladies and gentlemen: The Board of Directors greets you <span class="page-break">4</span>and welcomes you with gladness and gratitude. We are deeply grateful to all who have contributed to this great cause. This home has been erected for those whose spring and summer of life are behind them, and whose winter shall be made warm and bright by love, tender care, and protection. As we dedicate this beautiful home, a review of its history is proper and fitting."</p>
   <p>The speaker then gave a brief sketch of the history of the home. A large stone tablet in the main hall on the first floor bears the following inscription in golden letters; "Abraham Slimmer, Founder of This Home." In his review, the speaker pointed out that the institution was founded for aged Jews only, and to confirm his statement he read two letters from the benefactor, Mr. Slimmer. "According to these writings," the president continued, "Mr. Slimmer donated the sum of $50,000 with the stipulation that a <span class="page-break">5</span>like amount be contributed by the citizens of Chicago, and further that the Home for Aged Jews shall ever remain an independent institution and never become consolidated with another one.</p>
   <p>"We accepted these conditions and went ahead with courage and determination. It was not difficult to collect the required sum, inasmuch as Mrs. E. Frank alone pledged $10,000 and others as much as $5000.</p>
   <p>Seldom have the efforts for founding a charitable institution resulted in so rapid a success. Many such institutions are encumbered with debts at the time of their dedication, but this one is free of debt at its completion. Only the united efforts of all could accomplish this."</p>
