   <p>Orthodox Jewish Chicago responded generously yesterday to the appeals of the rabbis for a public fast day as a protest against the persecution of Judaism in Bolshevik Russia and the Ukraine. The synagogues were crowded with worshipers, particularly at the afternoon services when special fast-day prayers were said. All the rabbis spoke on the significance of this special fast day.</p>
   <p>A fair sum of money was collected by the synagogues from the eighteen cents "ransom" money, which those who were unable to fast, were required to pay.</p>
   <p>The Congregation Tiphereth Zion, on the Northwest Side, had a large crowd. Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon of Lomza [Poland], who not long ago became the rabbi of this synagogue, delivered a poignant speech which deeply moved the large <span class="page-break">2</span>audience that came to hear him. Over one hundred dollars was collected.</p>
   <p>Sixty-five dollars was collected at the Congregation Knesseth Israel, where Rabbi B. Z. Margolin spoke.</p>
   <p>The money collected will go to an organization called the "Help the Torah Association," the purpose of which is to support the Jewish clergy in the countries ruined by the war.</p>
   <p>A committee of rabbis has been formed from the Help the Torah Association, to which all the money should be turned over. Rabbi B. Z. Margolin of 1301 North Rockwell Street is president, and Rabbi Saul Silber is treasurer of this committee.</p>
