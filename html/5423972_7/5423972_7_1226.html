   <p>The Chicago Union of Rumanian Jews at a meeting yesterday in the Douglas Park Auditorium elected J. Leibner of the Courier as their delegate to the convention of the United Rumanian Jewish Associations which will be held in New York on the first of February.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leibner, who is a native of Rumania, is well acquainted with the political and economic condition of that country. He was elected unanimously to represent Chicago's Rumanian Jews at the convention in New York which will be the most important of any ever held by the Rumanian Jewish organizations in the United States. It will be the first convention of the combined two bodies (Federation of Rumanian Jews and American Union of Rumanian Jews) which not long ago competed in the field of charity. From now on however they will work together as one national body for the benefit of the Jews of Rumania.</p>

   <p>The New York convention, at which Mr. Leibner will represent Chicago, will discuss important plans regarding both political and economic relief for the Jews of Rumania. It is expected that the convention will elect a committee which will leave for Rumania to take over the relief work in the homeland.</p>
