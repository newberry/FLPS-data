   <p>Every Belodzercuer Countryman must know that our delegate Mr. M. Paul is approaching his destination to our old country town. The sum of money that we provided until now is not sufficient even for a start. The need is too great, for us to remain quiet and in good humor. Provide more help for our sisters and brothers.</p>
   <p>The Belodzercuer Relief Society has arranged a concert dance and package party for Sunday afternoon November 21st in Lawndale Hall 3475 Ogden Avenue. Remember all of you must be there with your friends.</p>
