   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I read in last Sunday's Courier, about the proposal made by the Hebrew Charities regarding a grant of several thousand dollars to the Home for the Aged and the Orphan Home, if both homes will cease running their annual affairs. I am of the opinion that the above named institutions should accept the proposal. It is a known fact that an annual affair given by any of these orthodox institutions, involves a lot of work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The friends of the institutions have to work mighty hard for months, they require an investment of several thousands of dollars, and many other troubles, and, in the end, the profit is so small that it does not pay to run such an affair.</p>
   <p>I agree that it is not nice to pull every one by his coat-tail, and to beg him to buy a ticket for these affairs. Those who do buy a ticket or two, think that they have contributed enough for the institutions, and, for that reason, refuse to contribute any more money. We have to find out who are and who are not the friends of the Homes? Let each one contribute something annually for the Homes, and, in the future, we wouldn't have to run affairs to support our two institutions. When efforts would be exerted to raise the donations, instead of working for the affairs, we would be able to put the Homes on a sound foundation. When we would scrutinize the list of contributors for the Homes, more closely, we would see that they are able to give much more than they are giving at present.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>B. Hurwitz</p>
