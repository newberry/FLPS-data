   <p>The Lawndale District is considered as the most beautiful and well situated Jewish district in the whole world. Neither Berlin nor Paris, neither London, nor New York, possesses such beautiful Jewish districts as the one of Lawndale District.</p>
   <p>It would be unjust to designate this district as a "Jewish Ghetto," because this is often understood to mean a narrow, segregated, overcrowded and impoverished district where a poor class of Jews dwell in poverty and in filth, and live on the fruits of each other's efforts; where life is bitten by the tooth of annihilation, and an obscuring dark cloud <span class="page-break">2</span>droops overhead, and tears flow over the bitter anxiety and horrible conditions.</p>
   <p>The expanding Jewish Lawndale District is of a different character entirely. It is beautiful and free. The entire district is covered with grass and trees. The Jews walk about proudly, appreciating the blessings of America.....</p>
   <p>If the Lawndale District should ever find it necessary to adopt a Jewish name, we would name it Tel Aviv, after the new Jewish colony recently established in Palestine, near Jaffe, by the Zionists, which is lauded by the Jewish poets and idolized by all who have been there at any time. Yes, the Lawndale District is the Tel Aviv of the Chicago Jewry, because the Jews have built it with their own hands - a fact which is recognized by all.</p>

   <p>This Jewish district is young, but from day to day it is developing. Various Jewish institutions are being built there; and whenever we pass by the magnificent Douglas Boulevard our hearts soar with pride to witness among the beautiful homes, the large synagogue, and we can hardly refrain from crying out "How well-off we Jews are by having such a good and comfortable dwelling place in the second largest city of America!"</p>
   <p>There is hardly anything good that does not have its foul characteristics. And whoever is not merely satisfied with outside appearance but also seeks the essence of a thing, is by that alone not yet completely satisfied. He feels that many things are still lacking there in order to complete the Jewish life. It is just like seeing a well-dressed, handsome young man who is more eager to be neatly attired than to study; who derives many pleasures out of life, but does not strive for a future. We hereby wish to discuss the things which the Lawndale District lacks, i. e., the many changes to be made and improvements to be introduced.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is true that the synagogues alone do not suffice to satisfy all spiritual needs of the Jewish populace of that particular district. Unless something is done for the spiritual needs of the young Jewish generation of that district, the hard work which was put into it, will have been wasted and instead of giving pleasure, it will, in due time, cause us vexation.</p>
   <p>The older generation has created centers, viz., the synagogues. But did they ever stop to think about the sad phenomenon of that district, that our Jewish youth has created centers for itself in the pool rooms where it is being degraded, corrupted, and ruined? A father must not be self-centered, but should consider the welfare of his children. The parents and more settled Jewish generation of that district, prominent civic leaders, must also drop the selfishness of catering to themselves, and devote <span class="page-break">5</span>more time and energy to the younger generation, which is being reared without Torah (Jewish law) and respect, and which does not have the slightest conception of Judaism. We hear so many sermons, from our rabbis, about the traditions of the Jewish people, about the greatness of our Torah, but why should we not ask: What will become of our Torah when no one will be capable of studying it? What will happen to our Jewish ideals, if no one will practice them?</p>
   <p>We feel proud of our Jewish studies, of our Jewish characteristics. We believe that they are the finest, most beautiful in the world, but does our Jewish youth apprehend them? Our civic leaders must erect a Beth-Am (People's House) there to attract the Jewish youth, where they can spend leisure time, where they can become better acquainted with the finer side of Judaism.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>There is, among us, an institution bearing a Jewish cultural character, the Shochri Sfas Aver (Hebrew Literary Society) and also vereins of a Jewish social character, all of which are encountering difficulty in supporting themselves. But if they would unite under one leadership in such a People's House, they would be of great advantage to that district. Modern Talmud Torahs, which would rear the children in a spirit of pure Judaism, should also be constructed there.</p>
   <p>An institution like the Jewish Play House would become a spiritual center not only for Lawndale District, but for the entire Chicago Jewry. From all points of the city, Jews would come there to enjoy themselves in a Jewish environment, where the older generation would mingle with the youth and work in harmony for the future of the American Jewry.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The material means for such a People's House would be easily procured in the Lawndale District, because the Jews there are well-off and they would be interested in becoming permanent patrons of such an institution. The important thing now is to form a committee of prominent men of the district to establish organizations to overtake the work. A living spirit must be transplanted into the Lawndale District. It must be cared for and safeguarded by the Jews of that district. Gorgeous flowers of Judaism must be planted and the men who perform the task will go down in history as having accomplished the greatest Jewish national project in Lawndale District.</p>
