   <p>My friend, S. B. Komaiko, laid a piece of paper on my desk. This paper is one of the greatest human documents that I have ever seen because it reflects a great Jewish soul.</p>
   <p>An old man, Harry A. Fishkin, who was beloved by all the Jews of Chicago, particularly by the Zionists, has left the following will:</p>
   <p>"I, H. A. Fishkin, leave my fortune-- the result of a life's work--of $235 to be distributed as follows:</p>
   <p>"To the Keren Hayesod, $100; to the National Fund, $25; to the war sufferers, $25; to the Daughters of Zion Infant Home, $25; to the Congregation Tiphereth Zion, $25; to the__Synagogue [name not legible], $10."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Old Mr. Fishkin wanted to leave something for other institutions, but he did not have anything else. The few cents that he had he divided among organizations which he, an experienced community worker, considered the most important. He thought the Keren Hayesod was the most important undertaking of our times. You may be sure that old Fishkin wanted to leave one hundred thousand dollars rather than one hundred dollars to the Keren Hayesod. Fortune, however, did not smile upon him during his lifetime and he died a poor man materially, but with the soul of a spiritual aristocrat. Just imagine what would happen if a few Jewish millionaires followed the footsteps of old Fishkin! The worries of the Jewish people would be over; and within a short time, we would be a nation among other nations.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, souls like Fishkin's are not reincarnated in millionaires.</p>
