   <p>The report of Doctor Hyman Davis yesterday noon at the Anshe Knesses Israel Shul (synagogue) concerning the condition of our sisters and brothers in Eastern Europe, where he visited as an agent of the American Red Cross, wrung tears from the large audience of men and women. When Chazen Kalman Kleinovitch chanted the memorial prayer, crying could even be heard.</p>
   <p>It was understood that no appeals for money for war victims would be made. And so it was. But the audience was too deeply touched. Mr. H. M. Barnett emptied all his pockets and cast the "change" on the platform. Mr. Makel Rosenberg threw a wad of wrapped paper money which amounted to sixty dollars. Larger and smaller sums also fell on the platform.</p>
   <p>"I have seen," related Doctor Davis, "great misery in Germany and Austria and friendlessness among Jews and non-Jews. I, as a Red Cross messenger, treated all alike. But, let me tell you of the plight I witnessed of Jews in Poland, Galicia, and Russia.</p>
   <p>"Poland today is a large country. It is estimated that it has about three and a half million Jews. Do you know how these Jews live? A life of despair and death. They hardly appear to be alive, simply shadows, starved, thin, sickly, facing death constantly and praying that it will come to put an end to their misery.</p>
   <p>"This was in Warsaw. A heavy snow had just fallen. The air was terrifically cold. In this weather I saw Jewish children running barefoot for lack of shoes, scantily clothed, seeking bread or a place to warm themselves. Their parents, many are dead from hunger or disease; some we encountered insane, wandering in the roads. The loss of mind being due to wretchedness, misery and hunger.</p>
   <p>"On the way to Pinsk, passing on macadamized roads, through forests, everywhere I saw Jews wandering aimlessly. They live on the barks of the trees and become wild at the sight of a traveler. Many have lost their speech; others have no strength even to beg.</p>
   <p>"Oh! How horrible their condition is; in the friendless Jewish homes, in the streets, on the highways. But even worse is the situation in the hospitals. Patients lie for days without food, without bread or milk, because these foodstuffs are not given free.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis then produced a piece of the bread eaten in Poland: a small per cent black flour, the rest straw and ground wood. He brought this bread right from Poland and those who saw it shuddered.</p>
   <p>"Yes, this food is eaten in Poland," he cried. "Some have not even this. They die of hunger and illnesses related to hunger."</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis told of a Jew in Brest Litovsk who, on discovering his identity, approached him and asked: "Doctor, help me!" When asked how he could be helped, the unfortunate answered: "Give me some poison; I wish to poison my wife and myself. Why live, when there is nothing to live for !"</p>
   
   <p>"They suffer," Dr. Davis continued, "from the miseries and horrors of war. They suffer because there is no work. They live in holes, in dugouts, and in the houses still standing, two and three families together.</p>
   <p>"Countless Jews in Poland and Galicia, rich men at one time, beg and fall in the streets from hunger, since there is no one left from whom to beg. Of the poor, many were easy victims. Those that remained are the wanderers I mentioned previously. I visited synagogues and Hebrew schools. My dear God, what I have seen there I shall never forget: Jews lying on the floor sick with typhus, small-pox and other malignant diseases."</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis explained that the only hope of these unfortunates is the Jews of America. He questioned if anyone could remain so indifferent, after hearing of their plight, as not to send what they could to help them, the unfortunates, heal their diseases and sustain their lives.</p>
   <p>It was at this part of the address that the donations were thrown. The climax of this heartrending occasion reached its peak when the chairman, N. D. Kaplan, called upon Chazen Kalmen Kleinovitch, who pronounced with great fervor the memorial service.</p>
   
   <p>Besides Dr. Davis, there spoke comrade Aphraim Epstein, who had introduced the guest speaker as one of the finest Jews in Chicago and as the man who, through his correspondence from Warsaw to the Courier, made it possible for tens of thousands of dollars to be gathered here for war victims.</p>
   <p>The meeting was arranged by the Joint Relief Committee, with Mr. J. S. Rosenblat as chairman. The Committee's purpose has been accomplished; they have acquainted Chicago Jews with the situation in Poland and Galicia.</p>
