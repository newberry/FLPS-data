   <p>Dedication of the Kindergarten</p>
   <p>All the necessary preparations for the opening of the [Jewish] kindergarten and the Jewish Day Nursery on the Northwest Side have been completed. And this Sunday, June 23, at 2 P. M., the dedication of this very important [Jewish] institution in Chicago--of particular importance to the Northwest Side--will be celebrated with great pomp and ceremony. To the B'Noth Zion Mizrochi [Daughters of Zion] belongs the credit for the tireless effort that was finally crowned with success.</p>
   <p>The celebration will begin at exactly two o'clock at the Sabin School. The program will begin with a prayer by Rabbi Rosenbloom, followed by the Marks Nathan Home band, which will play the "Star-Spangled Banner"; then <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the president will deliver an address explaining why such an institution is necessary, and describing the existing evils which caused a great many women to become interested in the work of creating a day nursery and a kindergarten. The speech will be followed by "Hatikvah" ["The Hope"--Jewish National Anthem], played by the band. Other speakers will be: Rabbi Saul Silber, Dr. Albert B. Yudelson, Dr. Israel Elfenbein, Judge Hugo Pam, Judge Harry M. Fisher, Attorney Louis Rieger, and others.</p>
   <p>After the speeches the march will begin from the Sabin School to the kindergarten. The line of march will be as follows: on Hirsch Street to Irving Avenue, to Potomac Avenue, to Leavitt Street, to Evergreen Avenue, to Robey Street, and on Robey Street to the institution at 1441 Wicker Park Avenue. There the appropriate ceremonies will be held. In addition to the beautiful, typically Jewish program that has been prepared, arrangements have also been made to serve refreshments.</p>
