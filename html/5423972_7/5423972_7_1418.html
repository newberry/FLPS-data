   <p>Flower Day was a great success. The Jewish masses cheerfully bought flowers from the pretty Jewish girls and in this manner supported the Zionist movement. At the mass meeting last evening at the Hebrew Institute, it was announced that the sale of flowers passed the $3,500 mark, which is almost double the amount of last year.</p>
   <p>The girls who sold flowers at the corner of 12th Street and Blue Island Avenue said that the Irish members of the big church in that neighborhood were their best customers. When told that the entire profit is for the Zionist cause, not a single Irishman failed to buy a flower.</p>
