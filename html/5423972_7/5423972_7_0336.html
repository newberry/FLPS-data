   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute has the honor of housing within its walls the Jewish Cultural Society. This society has moved there, and brought along some of the finest Jewish elements in the city. They are the banner carriers of Jewish culture in the Middle West. If a few more of the large Jewish societies would move to the Hebrew Institute then that institution could be truly regarded as the spiritual and cultural center for Jews in Chicago.</p>
