   <p>The Young Peoples Sokolow Club benefit performance that was given for the Los Angeles Sanitarium, April 3, 1923, at Gartner's Theatre, has brought in a clear profit of $192.50. We extend our appreciation for the good work of this club and the committee. We hope that this club will continue its good in helping the unfortunates.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Jewish Consumptive Relief Association of California.</p>
