   <p>At a well-attended meeting of rabbis, synagogue presidents, and prominent citizens, which was held last night at the Hebrew Theological College, the whole matter of the M'sholochim [agents collecting money for charitable institutions and theological seminaries] was discussed. At this meeting, the evils and frauds committed by irresponsible M'sholochim were denounced. After a long and heated debate, it was unanimously decided that a committee of fifteen, consisting of four rabbis and eleven laymen, should take over the full responsibility for the M'shulochim business. The committee will hand out stamps, and no M'shuloch will be allowed to collect money without a stamp from the committee. A temporary committee has been appointed to work out the details of the plan, and they will report at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting endorsed the drive for the building of the Daughters of Zion Nursery on the Northwest Side.</p>
