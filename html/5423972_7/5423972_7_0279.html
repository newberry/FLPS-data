   <p>Dr. J. Pidot, superintendent of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, wonders, in an article entitled "Again" in the Chicago Hebrew Institute Observer, why we must continually be insisting that the Chicago Hebrew Institute is not a charity organization.</p>
   <p>The honored superintendent feels that it is the opinion of a large majority that the institute is a charity institution supported by our wealthy German brethren for the benefit of the poor Russian Jews, regardless of the fact that a charge is attached to everything, and that anyone desirous of receiving the benefits of the institution must pay therefor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is true that those benefiting from the institution do not pay as much as they would have to pay if the institute were a private enterprise, but the able superintendent declares that the Chicago University and the Young Men's Christian Association are identical institutions. Both institutions, like the Chicago Hebrew Institute, have a large deficit each year which must be covered by wealthy people who do not benefit themselves from the institution and yet it will enter no one's mind to say that the University of Chicago and the Young Men's Christian Association are charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>Among those attending the two latter institutions there are very wealthy people and should they be told that they are accepting charity, they would feel greatly insulted; however, it is different with the Chicago Hebrew Institute. Many stand at a distance and do not take advantage of the institute's activities because they think that they are not justified to benefit by charity when they can pay.</p>

   <p>The Dr. asks: "What is the reason for this? Wherein does the difference lie?" and attempts to answer these questions by stating that the difference lies in the objectives of the institutions......The University of Chicago for all classes, equally rich and poor come together to procure something that they can not get elsewhere; no one is too great to feel ashamed for participating in the activities of the Y. M. C. A. The Chicago Hebrew Institute is destined only for those who cannot help themselves and who benefit from the various activities carried on there. Consequently it creates the impression of being a charity institution, although rich and poor, people from all walks of life, participate in the activities of the institute.</p>
   <p>But despite all proof, the Jewish public remain under the impression that the spirit of charity enshrouds the institute. The Jewish public considers this to be so without reason, and the instinct of the great masses has a certain justification......It is not the fault of the superintendent who understands the spirit of such an institution and who strives to conduct it as it should be conducted; the directors <span class="page-break">4</span>are really guilty in this matter.</p>
   <p>The directorate consists of people who are not mutually related to one another; it is somewhat like an arbitration directorate. They form a sort of melting pot but the metals in the pot are such that they can never fuse; Dr. Emil G. Hirsch with his colleague rabbis, Mr. Max Klea and those who share his opinion, Mr. Max Shulman and those who think like him. And many others, fail to arbitrate their differing opinions and work at cross purposes. The result is that things are done in the institute from which no one profits. Nevertheless, they are being done and the masses think that the donors, by giving charity, approve of these acts.</p>
   <p>This is the real reason; herein lies the difference between the institute and the University of Chicago.</p>
