   <p>More than three hundred men and women, representatives of all the Orthodox synagogues of Chicago, and all the rabbis of Chicago were present last night at the magnificent banquet given by the Chicago Orthodoxy at the Leibus Hall, in honor of the Zionist delegation, Nahum Sokolow, Colonel Peterson, and Dr. Alexander Goldstein. The guests greeted the great Zionist leader, statesman, and writer, Nahum Sokolow, with tremendous applause and with the strains of the song Hatikuah ("The Hope"--Jewish national anthem).</p>
   <p>The Zionist leader, in a brilliant speech, pointed out to the audience the necessity of building Palestine, and the duties of the Orthodox Jews to Zionism. The (material) result of Mr. Sokolow's appeal was twenty-two thousand dollars in cash and fifty thousand dollars in pledges. The Tifereth Zion Synagogue gave a check for five thousand dollars; Atereth Israel (Synagogue)--two thousand dollars; Vilna Synagogue--fifteen hundred <span class="page-break">2</span>dollars; (Congregation Anshe) Kneseth Israel--thirteen hundred dollars. The presidents also pledged themselves to tax every member ten dollars a year for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of the World Zionist Organization].</p>
