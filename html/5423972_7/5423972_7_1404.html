   <p>Tonight at 8 P.M., the Red Moggen David will hold a very important meeting. (At this meeting) a report will be given of last Sunday's undertaking, and plans for a new great enterprise will be worked out. [Translator's note: Forbidden by their religion to wear a cross insignia, a medical unit of Jews was formed similar to the Red Cross, and this unit wore a red Jewish (hexagonal) star, instead of the Red Cross.]</p>
