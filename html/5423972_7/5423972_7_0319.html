   <p>The Miriam Club was organized in July 1905. Its purpose is to furnish a home to self-supporting girls at the least possible expense. It is now located at 434 Bowen Ave. When the Club was organized, it started with four girls. In less than three months the number increased to twenty, and at present there are forty girls living at the Miriam Club. The officers are Mrs. Joseph Fish, President, Mrs. David Frank, Recording Secretary, and Mrs. Meyer Moss, Treasurer.</p>
