   <p>A moving and impressive scene took place yesterday at the Union Station when twelve Jewish children, war suffers, accompanied by Mr. Hyman Podolsky, the representative of the Wasilkower Relief Committee of Chicago, arrived.</p>
   <p>A few hundred people, members of the Wasilkower Relief and relatives of the children, gathered at the station to meet the newcomers. When the friends and relatives met the worn-out, hungry little immigrants, they burst into tears. Many men and women became hysterical, caught the unfortunate children in their arms and began to weep loudly. The children, who recognized their friends and relatives, ran to them crying bitterly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Podolsky, who was fortunate enough to bring these children home, received a warm, hearty welcome. He was surrounded at once by hundreds of people who showered him with flowers. Many people put their arms around him and kissed him. After the children left, in the company of their parents and relatives, the delegation joyfully carried Mr. Podolsky out on their shoulders, and took him to his home at 1321 North Artesian Avenue.</p>
   <p>A representative of the Courier, who was at the depot to meet the little war-sufferers, was the first to greet the delegate and to commend him for fulfilling the important task with which he was intrusted.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. S. Budesh, superintendent of the Shelter House on Morgan Street, was also present at the depot.</p>
   <p>Mr. Podolsky also brought with him seventeen orphans whom he left in New York. The Shelter House there had found their relatives for them in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
   
   <p>About a year ago Mr. Podolsky was sent by his Society to his native city. During the time he was there he did important relief work. He distributed there thousands of dollars that his Society had sent him in the meantime, and he helped many families to come over here. Mr. Podolsky will remain here only a few weeks; then he will go back to the Ukraine to continue his important work.</p>
   <p>The Wasilkower Society is arranging a banquet for him this Friday evening, and next Sunday evening they are planning a big mass meeting, where he will deliver to his countrymen and friends here a personal message from across the seas.</p>
