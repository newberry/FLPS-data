   <p>The sum of $2,736,629.75 was raised in the charity drive, which was brought to a close yesterday in high spirits at headquarters, 237 Plymouth Court. The $2,500,000 goal was exceeded. "One hundred thousand dollars more is expected from Chicago businessmen who are now on the road," said the chairman of the drive, Jacob M. Loeb.</p>
   <p>This is the greatest sum of money that was ever raised in Chicago in such a short time for the purpose of local charity. It is also the greatest sum of money hitherto collected for Jewish charity in any city in America, including New York.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loeb was heartily congratulated when he announced the great collection.</p>

   <p>In behalf of his committee Mr. Loeb expressed gratitude to the Jewish Courier for its encouragement and moral support of the drive for Jewish charity in Chicago.</p>
