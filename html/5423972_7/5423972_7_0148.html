   <p>My Work as Counsellor at Camp Chi</p>
   <p>"This paper, the purpose of which is to inform, cannot help but be one of personal reaction also, for the essence or topic of the paper is camp and everything that goes with it; Nature, in the outdoors and in human beings, young and imbued with the will to live. As a counsellor at Camp Chi, the character of my work has been, though of a varied nature or because of its varied nature, very interesting to me and very informational. As to my main specific and individual activities, they included, beading, story hour and assemblies.</p>
   <p>"Beading is the teaching of pattern weaving by means of the Apache bead-work loom, and various colored beads which allow for originality of color and pattern design. I took charge of the beading work at camp for four weeks and during that time had two separate groups to instruct and guide. The first consisted of about thirty-six girls who came with no knowledge of how to bead. But they were eager and willing, and at the end of the two weeks at least 75 per cent of them had two bands to show for the effort they had exerted. In the second group several had had experience with the beadwork, and as a consequence the work progressed rapidly. The results of these two weeks were indeed encouraging and satisfactory. Many original, vividly--colored beaded bands which had taken much work and detailed effort were finished for exhibition.</p>
   <p>"Story Hour. The term story hour is hardly expressive or explanatory of what actually took place during the time devoted to the said period. Story hour should be called Jewish story hour, since it was really the study of Jewish life. It was in no way limited to Jewish history. The young and intelligent girls who entered and remained in the class for the two week period, were so imbued with the desire to know that one could not side-step the varied vital questions about Jewish people and their contacts which arose in these live questioning groups. The work we covered during these class periods may be classified into several groups falling under the following heads: Informational and Recreational. In line with the informational was the study of Jewish history from such books as Manual for Teaching Biblical History, by Eugene Kohen; A Book of Jewish Thoughts, selected and arranged by Dr. J. H. Hertz; by--Paths in Hebraic Bookland, by Israel Abrahams, and A Thousand Years of Jewish History, by Maurice H. Kane. Current events concerning Palestine and the new Jewish movements were also studied through personal knowledge and helped along by means of the Palestine Geographer, several numbers of the Jewish Youth, The Young Judean, and other Current Magazines. With regard to the recreational aspects of the study hour, it remains to be said that this side became necessary when some stimuli were needed to encourage and lead the group. This usually took farm in games centered about Biblical characters or places and, at times, songs.</p>
   <p>"Linked closely to the story hour, or, to be very accurate, the immediate growth of the story hour, were the Saturday morning assemblies which fell to my lot to prepare and take charge of during my six weeks' stay at camp. The Saturday assemblies at Chi are really the most Jewish element in the routine of the camp, both in that which is presented and the thought behind it. The various plays, tableaux, poems or songs which form the service were prepared by the girls in the Story Hour Classes. Some of the playlets which we presented are Marches in the Sun, The Burden of His Race, and Near Sinai. Several poems by Jannie Sampter and Israel Zangwill were read. Besides the above mentioned specific contributions from the story hour, the assemblies consisted of the singing in chorus of En Kelohenu, Odon, Olam, and Hatikovoh.</p>
   <p>"The duties which were at times partly mine and which helped to fill in my time at camp were located in such varied fields as post offices, boat patrols, relieving, for example, in raffia wearing, and so on. My duties as office clerk were just what the term implies--taking charge of selling of stamps and stationery to the campers. Boat patrolling, since it was divided among all the counsellors, was my particular duty only twice a week. It meant patrolling on the lake when the campers were in the water. As to O.D., one can hardly itemize the details with which it is connected. It just consists in being officer of the day for the camp, in ringing the bells for setups, meals, sports, classes, and, finally, bedtime.</p>
   <p>"Another of the duties of the counsellor at camps is the taking charge of stunt night, which is usually the singing of several songs and the giving of stunts by a few cabins. The stunts are prepared by the cabins, with perhaps a suggestion from one of the counsellors. Occasionally the counsellors would also present a stunt--a take-off from some opera, or perhaps an operetta, or the like.</p>
   <p>"All in all, as a general summary of my work as counsellor at Camp Chi, I may frankly say that the six weeks I spent here were six weeks of receiving instructive and constructive training as well as that of giving instruction. Working in a highly organized and carefully detailed system in which work and fun each had its share. I obtained the discipline and feeling of interdependence which is so difficult to obtain otherwise. The spirit of the girls at Camp Chi their willingness to co-operate and work, their feeling of oneness and responsibility for everyone else at camp, and the leadership of the Director, has been marvelous inspiration and I am sure that in at least some ways I will be the better for it."</p>
