   <p>This year was a year in which we were forced to issue one "proclamation" after another in behalf of the unfortunate war sufferers in Europe.</p>
   <p>Whether the Jews of Chicago have responded to these appeals and requests as they should have is not the question before us. But as a result of having raised money for those unfortunate souls in the European Hades, we have failed to remind Chicago Jewry of its moral obligation to its own "home", the Federation (United Charities) which was founded in Chicago a few years ago by the orthodox Jews.</p>
   <p>As is known, every [charitable] institution was formerly a "world in itself", having no relationship with other such institutions. Large sums of money would go to collectors with whom donors were not particularly satisfied. Chaos prevailed generally within the social work among Jews, [a situation] which was not a great honor to our city.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>From out of the chaos existing within the "charity world", the Federation came into existence just as the world took form from out of chaos. The Federation abolished the system of individual collectors; it established order in the disbursement of city Charity; in general, it became a "clearing house" for all charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>As an organization which was the product of a progressive period, the Federation had many obstacles in its path when it was first organized, [obstacles] which were brushed aside. The greatest obstacle at the beginning was the denunciation with which the Federation was met, as is the case with every new feat or accomplishment made in any field.</p>
   <p>At the very outset, the Federation faced the question of whether it could demolish the old system and then set up one whereby all [charitable] institutions under its supervision would be regulated. The Federation proved that this was possible and valid. Most of its work, if given the necessary support, was crowned with success. The saying, "we must always adopt new methods <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and divorce ourselves from old ones," has been appropriately illustrated by the Federation. Many reforms were made for the benefit of both the [charitable] institutions and the donors.</p>
   <p>In order to maintain the supply of steam for a ship so that it can run its course without interruption, the fire must not be permitted to die out. The ship cannot be run merely by a captain and his crew all standing on deck, directing the course by compass alone. But men must also be stationed below deck in the engine room to feed the boiler constantly with coal so as to keep the fire aflame, in order to provide the supply of steam.</p>
   <p>The same can be said about the maintenance of the Federation. It is not enough that the Federation is run by experienced and trustworthy officers who direct it in such a way that it is an honor to our city. It also requires many, many supporters who should contribute the maintenance of the Federation, so that it may continue its course unhampered. The Jews of Chicago should bear in mind that through the Federation, the following institutions are <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>maintained: The Marks Nathan Orphanage, an institution where orphans receive a home and acquire a good education in both Judaism and Americanism; the Waller Street and Northwest Side Talmud Torah [Hebrew School]; the Home For The Aged; the Hebrew Sheltering Home; the West Side Ladies Society; Free Burial Society, and the Theological Seminary. Without these institutions a city cannot function properly. They put the rich--those who do not need charity--under a moral obligation to support them through the Federation.</p>
   <p>We should not forget that if we neglect the Federation we have no compassion for the orphans; we do not care for the poor and oppressed who, punished by fate, must ask for our mercy; without giving them any attention we allow Jewish children to grow up with neither Torah [study of Jewish law] nor respect. Among Jews, giving charity is not a privilege, but a duty. To us charity does not mean almsgiving but rather doing justice--justice to oneself and to those who depend on one.</p>
   <p>There is a point in Midrash [agadic and homiletic commentary to the Bible] <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>which demands, not requests, that we help the poor. Rabbi Ebin interprets this passage in Midrash as meaning that God will cast his vengeance upon those who refuse to aid the poor. It is written in Psalms, "Blessed is he that considereth the poor".</p>
   <p>This shows how charity is interpreted in Jewish literature. Thus, we have no right to turn down those who are forced to come to us. It is our duty to help them as much as we possibly can. There is a saying among us that "charity begins at home". We are obligated to help the poor in our city even more than the poor remote from us. The poor at home are worthier. Therefore, you should help the Federation now. It is in need of your help.</p>
