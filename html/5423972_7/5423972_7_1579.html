   <p>In his report to the Executive Committee of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities and to the Presidents of the organizations affiliated with the Federated, Mr. B. Horwitz, president of the Federation, enumerated the reasons why this organization finds itself in what its opponents call a crisis.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Horwitz, the reasons for this crisis are as follow:</p>
   <p>1. The load placed upon the united institutions soared from $7,500 a month last year to $13,000 a month this year.</p>
   <p>2. The business depression has forced many subscribers to postpone the fulfillment of their pledges until such time in the future as conditions will improve.</p>
   <p>3. A small clique of cruel trouble-makers and scandalmongers, whose sole object has been to create trouble, discontent and scandals, has obstructed the progress of the Federation.</p>
   <p>4. The directors of the Federation, as well as the directors of individual institutions, have paid little attention to the carrying out of the Federation's task.</p>
   
   <p>Despite our respect for the opinion of the president of the Federation, we must say that he is taking the effect for the cause. All four reasons adduced by Horwitz are merely the effect of one cause, and as long as this cause exists, its effect will be present.</p>
   <p>The main reason why the Federation suffers so much, is because the officers of the Federation are not sure of their own power. They are still under the impression that the Federation is a subservient body which lives by the grace of the affiliated institutions. The Executive Committee of the Federation consists of directors of various charitable institutions, whose purpose is to protect the interests of their respective institutions. If one member of the Executive Committee thinks that not enough honor is bestowed upon "his" institution, he then sees to it that "his" Board of Directors become indifferent; that the "patriots"of "his" institution stick with the trouble-makers and scandalmongers; that "his" subscribers begin complaining about hard times, and that expenses increase.</p>
   <p>The directors of the various institutions sense this particular weakness of the Federation and take advantage of it by "sandbagging" it and by constantly threatening it with desertion and disruption. The Budget Committee consists of representatives from the various institutions. Whenever the budgets are computed, then a series of "you watch me and I'll watch you" begins. Should the representative of the Marks Nathan Orphanage not question the expenses of the Home for the Aged, the representative of the Home for the Aged will find no fault with the expenses of the orphanage. But should the representative of the hospital declare that it is simply an onslaught on public funds, they [the other representatives] unite against the hospital, they align with trouble-makers and scandalmongers and on the following day accuse the hospital of having committed some infamous act.</p>
   <p>The Federation is now going through, on a small scale, what the United States went through on a large scale in the Civil War period, when each state separately thought it could destroy the Federal Government. What the Federation should do is to call the bluff of the brazen-faced institutions and let one of them declare itself independent. Then it won't be long before this particular "independent institution" will become a "South Carolina."</p>
   <p>We sympathize with the president of the Federation. We know how unpleasant and boring it is to listen to the arrogant speeches of the various directors of the affiliated institutions, whose entire ingenuity consists of prattling and contracting debts for the Jewish Community in Chicago. We know exactly how he feels when a superintendent of an institution tells him that he must pay double the market price for beans, because "he must supply the best beans." But as long as the president of the Federation will not grip the management with an iron hand, and with the battle cry "The Federation above everything," and will not drive the squanderers of public money from the Federation, so long will the Federation be in hot water and thereby suffer.</p>
   <p>Let the Federation reorganize morally. The members of the Executive Committee must withdraw from the directorship of individual institutions. They should be Federation people, not institution people. The members of the Budget Committee should not consist of representatives of these institutions, but of the Jewish community in Chicago. The sanction of expenses for each institution should be in line with the income, as economical as possible.</p>
   <p>If the directors of the various institutions want to think that an injustice is being inflicted upon them by prohibiting them to spend lavishly, then let them declare their independence and appeal directly to the public at large. The sooner they will do this, the quicker will they learn that the public is with the Federation and not with them.</p>
   <p>The masses, as well as the ordinary directors of the Federation, will always respond to the call of the president of the Federation. As in Lincoln's time, when the nation responded to the call for war in order to save the Union, so will the Jewish community in Chicago respond by crying out, "We are coming, Father Horwitz, with our money bags full, $200,000 strong."</p>
   <p>The Federation needs a Lincoln in its midst. And Mr. Horwitz, you can be one. Do not misunderstand effects for causes.</p>
