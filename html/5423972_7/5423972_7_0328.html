   <p>Hebrew Institute remains in Annex.</p>
   <p>$10,000 will be spent to improve the remaining structure. The burned structure will be completely dismantled. This decision was reached at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Chicago Hebrew Institute last night. The directors also approved a budget of $16,000 to finance all the activities of the Institute for the coming year.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the Institute should provide proper facilities for a Hebrew Library to house the contribution of books by Mr. Rosen. The Hebrew Society will then be responsible for purchasing of new Hebrew books as they are published.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved to retain the land upon which the old building stood and to build a new and more beautiful structure, as soon as the necessary capital could be raised.</p>
