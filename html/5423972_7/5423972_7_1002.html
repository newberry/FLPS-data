   <p>Today is Julius Rosenwald Day. The captains and colonels of the $100,000 drive for the Orthodox Federated Charities will go out today to plead for our orphans and aged, for our sick and poor, not only in the name of these victims of fate, but also in the name of the greatest Jewish philanthropist living, in the name of Julius Rosenwald, who is the honorary chairman of the Federated, and whose philanthropic deeds are a source of inspiration to Jews and Gentiles alike. There is not a man in who community, whether Jew or Gentile, whether a believer or a disbeliever, who is not proud of the fact that Julius Rosenwald is a Chicagoan, because Julius Rosenwald is a source of inspiration to all, and as far as a citizen can be a moral asset to the community, he is the greatest moral asset to our community. He is a Jew of whom we can all be proud, no matter whether we always agree with his views or not. He is one of those rare men whose motives cannot be questioned, because they are pure and they are good, and because Julius Rosenwald is the greatest moral asset to the community, and because <span class="page-break">2</span>every Jew in Chicago is proud of this great philanthropist, the Julius Rosenwald day will certainly be productive of results. The name of the man carries weight with every Jew, here as elsewhere, and appealing for the sick and the poor must yield fruit.</p>
   <p>To us Jews, Julius Rosenwald is more than a philanthropist. There are many Jewish philanthropist in this world. There are many Jews in this city and other cities who are charitable and liberal, but there is only one Julius Rosenwald in Chicago and all over America because he is everybody's brother. To give money for charity is one thing, and to give it in a spirit of true brotherhood is another thing. To be conscious and mindful of one's duties to the poor and the sick, the orphans and the aged, is one thing, and to have a great heart and a great soul and to believe in the brotherhood of men and practice it, is another thing. Mr. Rosenwald believes in the brotherhood of men, and practices it too. When we say that Mr. Rosenwald is everybody's brother, we do not use a figure of speech, but we describe a reality. All those who have the honor and privilege to come in touch Julius Rosenwald personally, will testify <span class="page-break">3</span>to his wonderful humaneness, and to his great philanthropic instinct. A man may learn to give, but men like Rosenwald are not made but born. True Philanthropy is not a product of environment or education or tradition, but it is innate, and Julius Rosenwald is the very embodiment of true philanthropy. He would be a true philanthropist even if he were not a rich man, because it is not the giving of money alone which makes man a philanthropist. He would be a true philanthropist even if he were a poor man, just as Raphael, the great painter of the Renaissance would still be a great painter even if he were born without hands. We all respect and admire this great Jew for his great qualities of heart and mind, and not for the giving alone. We will never forget that it was Julius Rosenwald who has vitalized the Jewish relief work in America, by giving the lump sum of one million dollars as his contribution to the ten million dollar campaign in 1917. If the American Jews have been able to collect in the neighborhood of fifty million dollars in the last six years, it is mainly owing to the part Mr. Julius Rosenwald played in this great philanthropic drama. Visualizing the great problems arising out of the war with remarkable quickness, are understanding the nature of the task with which the <span class="page-break">4</span>American Jews would be confronted, he made up his mind to set a philanthropic example and to teach the American Jews how to give. And we admit he was a wonderful teacher. He taught the American Jews how to give, and if American Jewry is today imbued with a spirit of philanthropy, we have to thank Mr. Rosenwald for it.</p>
   <p>We hope that no Jew in Chicago will turn down a solicitor of the $100,000 drive of the Federated on this Julius Rosenwald day, because the only way how to express our heartfelt gratitude to this simple and still great man, who is everybody's brother, is to show that we have taken a lesson from him.</p>
