   <p>At a meeting of the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home and Hospital, 1138 North Leavitt Street, a plan has been completed for a twelve-day campaign to raise $165,000 in order to build two new wings to the present hospital, which is much too small to accommodate the number of patients who apply for treatment.</p>
   <p>The hospital is located in the heart of the Jewish district on the Northwest side and accepts patients regardless of race or creed. The hospital owns one hundred beds, and many [of them] are occupied by sick Jews. Therefore, the hospital trusts that the Jews will co-operate in this campaign.</p>
