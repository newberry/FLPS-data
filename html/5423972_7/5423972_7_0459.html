   <p>Chicago Jews responded to the call for aid from their stricken brethren in Europe with a check for $250,000 at the United Jewish Campaign Conference at the Standard Club. Six prominent Jewish leaders are the donors. They are Jacob Loeb, Julius Rosenwald, Samuel Deutsch, Sol Kline, James Davis and William Hersch. Their donation is the first of $7,000,000 that the four hundred delegates to the conference pledged themselves to collect by December 31, 1928 in order to carry on the work across the sea.</p>
