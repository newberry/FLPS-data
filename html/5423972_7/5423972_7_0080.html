A parade of more than 200 carriages, five tally-hos, four omnibuses and many automobiles participated.</p>
   <p>Rabbi A. S. Broude delivered a prayer of his own composition. Mr. D. Shapiro, master of ceremonies, gave a short address of welcome. He was followed by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mr. Israel Cowen, director of the Jewish Home for the Aged on Drexel Boulevard, and also represented Mayor Harrison. He said: "To see this large gathering is a pleasant surprise to me. It is a proof that the Jewish population of Chicago has become aware of the necessity of a home for the elderly and ailing Jews. But the work has only begun, the problems which you face are many. Nevertheless, judging by the inspiration of this great audience, the realization of your ambition is assured already....A mass choir of about 500 children participated in the musical program....before the conclusion of the ceremonies $820 was raised toward the construction of the home.</p>
