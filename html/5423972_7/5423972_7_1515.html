   <p>All preparations were made last Sunday for a massmeeting to take place Sunday, March 5, 2 P.M., at the Educational Alliance, 1243 N. Wood Street. We hope that all children, without exception, will participate in this meeting, where plans for our tag day, to be held on Purim Sunday, March 19, will be arranged.</p>
   <p>Come, American youth, and help your suffering little brothers who stretch out their hands for help. Come and help your own flesh and blood. Join our conference and do something for the tag day. Do your duty on tag day, for by doing so you will send your Purim present to the unfortunate children across the ocean.</p>
   <p>Bear in mind, time is short and a lot of work is to be done. So now, will you refuse to lend a helping hand?</p>
   <p>We believe that all children feel just as we do, and they will come in large numbers to attend this meeting and participate in exchanging gifts of the children and for the children.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Joshua Spector</p>
   <p>Harold Karagadshi</p>
