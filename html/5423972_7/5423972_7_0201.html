   <p>Camp Wooster financed and conducted by the Young Men's Jewish Charities, after a number of years of camp experience on rented property, has this year established a permanent camp, fully and adequately equipped with mess-hall, kitchen, plumbing and other camp necessaries. It is considered one of the finest camps of its kind in the State.</p>
   <p>Although the camp, because of its additional equipment was in a position to take care of a great many more boys than they were able to in previous years, nevertheless, many boys were disappointed because of lack of room. This same fact holds true in connection with Camp Wauconda and Camp Chi.</p>
