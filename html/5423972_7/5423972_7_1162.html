   <p>The Zionist leaders in Chicago held a meeting last night in the Crystal Room of the Sherman Hotel and elected an executive committee to supervise the campaign for one million dollars which is to be raised here for the ten-million-dollar Restoration Fund.</p>
   <p>The election took place under the chairmanship of Judge Julian W. Mack, president of the American Zionist Organization, who in his address stated:</p>
   <p>"The time to awaken Jewish nationalism among the Jewish masses is past, as is the time when it was necessary to explain to the Jews the importance of having a home in Palestine. Our only discussion now should concern the rebuilding and preparation of Palestine for the Jews. Talk alone will not suffice, we must also provide funds. The money must not come from our ranks alone, but from non-Jews as well. We must appeal for funds everywhere because the rebuilding of Palestine concerns all of mankind."</p>

   <p>Judge Mack's words did not fail to make the desired impression; all those present offered to work for the Palestine Restoration Fund, which will open here on Passover. The opening appeal will be made by rabbis in all the synagogues.</p>
