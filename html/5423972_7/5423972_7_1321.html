   <p>The tag day for the "Ezeroth Olilem Veunkim" (Infants' Aid), the united organization of the Boneth Zion Day Nursery and the Motherless Infants' Home, brought in $2,183.76. Taking into consideration the fact that seven other organizations also had a tag day last Monday, the result is very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Half of this sum was given to the Day Nursery, the other half was deposited for the Home.</p>
   <p>Sunday, the Motherless Infants' Home will have a space in the carnival on Sixteenth Street. Its proceeds will go for the Home.</p>
