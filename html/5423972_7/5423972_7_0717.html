   <p>Students of the Hebrew Theological Seminary in Slobotka [a town in Lithuania, famous for its theological seminary] are still striking for more bread. The strike is naturally, a demonstration to attract the attention of World Jewry to the deplorable condition in which the theological college finds itself. It stands to reason that if the theological students in Slobotka are suffering the pangs of hunger, then the students in Telz and other Jewish centers in Lithuania are likewise suffering the pangs of hunger. And if the need in all theological seminaries is so great, their existence is in danger. Everybody can easily imagine what the destruction of the theological seminaries in Lithuania will mean to all of Eastern European Jewry. The only group of Jews in the world who can save the Lithuanian seminaries from extinction, are the Orthodox Jews in America. The Jewish groups in Europe who still have somewhat of an understanding of the importance of theological seminaries are the Jews <span class="page-break">\2</span>in Germany and Hungary, and these two very important Orthodox groups in Central Europe are, at present, so economically ruined that instead of helping others, they themselves need foreign relief.</p>
   <p>The seminaries in Lithuania cannot expect any kind of help from Europe at present, and if the Orthodox Jews in America do not come to their aid, all the theological seminaries in Lithuania will soon be closed.</p>
   <p>Upon the Orthodox Jews in America lies a great responsibility, and if they do not take energetic steps to save the theological colleges in Lithuania, they alone will be guilty of the consequences.</p>
   <p>The first thing that must be done to alleviate the need is to collect immediately fifty million marks for first aid. In America, fifty million marks is a small sum of money, only one thousand dollars, but in Lithuania, fifty million marks is a great deal of money. The immediate need can be alleviated with fifty million marks. As soon as the immediate need is checked, a conference made up <span class="page-break">\3</span>of rabbis and civic leaders should be called, to consider ways and means of creating a permanent source of revenue for these seminaries. We believe that the Orthodox Jews in America are rich enough and kind enough to take over the responsibility of providing for the existence of these seminaries until the crisis is over. But first of all, we must send first aid--we must send fifty million marks at once. In Chicago there is a nucleus of an organization for this purpose. Mr. Lillienthal is the treasurer of this organization and it is the duty of Mr. Lillienthal and his colleagues to call together a group of social workers for the purpose of raising the above-mentioned sum immediately. There is not a poor Jew in Chicago who will refuse to give a small contribution for this noble purpose. It is only a matter of work and of organization. There can be no excuse for not raising and forwarding this first aid to Slobotka. Each day that is lost, places the existence of the seminaries in Lithuania in still greater danger.</p>
   <p>Begin the work at once. Later it will be too late.</p>
