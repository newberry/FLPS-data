   <p>A Half-Day's Wages!</p>
   <p>This is the appeal issued by the Relief Conference for Soviet Russia after its meeting yesterday. Each worker of Chicago, who wishes to help the starving of Russia, is ordered to contribute a half-day's wages. Others, who are in business, should give more, but certainly no less than a half-day's wages.</p>
