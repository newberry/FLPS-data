   <p>Chicago Jews were big-hearted in promises this last Passover for the Relief Fund for the war suffering Jews, and all that is asked now is that they shouldn't be faint-hearted in paying their donations.</p>
   <p>There is a relief committee in Poland that distributes food bought with the Relief Fund money that was contributed by Chicago and other Jews. One of the commissioners, Mr. B. Hurvitch, notifies us that, in order to carry on the work successfully, there must be more money.</p>
   <p>Pay your obligations, that the Jews in Poland, Lithuania, Galicia, and other countries, will suffer less hunger for one day at least. The following list speaks for itself:</p>
