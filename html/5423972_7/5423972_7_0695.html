   <p>During the past few weeks, Chicago has been simply overrun with agents [collectors for charitable and other institutions], honest and dishonest, and the dishonest ones are extorting money from everyone. We believe that the time has come to put an end to this misappropriation of the hard-earned money of Chicago Jews. A city like Chicago should be able to control these agents. Unfortunately, no one has any control over the situation.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago an agent, whose integrity is doubtful, was not permitted to speak in two synagogues unless he became recognized as a legitimate agent, and this he failed to do. Many of these dishonest agents do not even ask money of the synagogues, lest they be asked embarrassing questions. Instead of soliciting the synagogues, they employ assistants to canvass from house to house. They take as much as they can get, from a nickel up. In many cases they obtain money because they are hard to get rid of. Nobody knows what <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>becomes of the money. They themselves admit that they take fifty per cent commission besides their expenses. What happens to the other fifty per cent, after they deduct their expenses? We do not believe that the institution which they represent sees more than ten per cent of the money these agents collect. In some cases, the institutions do not receive anything, simply because they exist only on paper. Thus, the Chicago Jewry contributes annually not merely thousands, but tens of thousands of dollars to fake charities from which no one but a few swindlers benefit.</p>
   <p>This cannot go on any longer. Something must be done to put an end to this deplorable situation. Not only do large sums of money go to waste each year, but [what is more] those institutions that are actually in need and that commission reliable agents, suffer horribly from this deplorable situation. The public, knowing that there is no control over the agents, treats everybody the same, the honest and the dishonest, and the result is that institutions which we should, and must, support, do not receive the necessary attention.</p>

   <p>We can establish order in this field of charity if we adopt a responsible and sympathetic attitude toward the situation. Most agents that approach us represent either theological seminaries or Palestinian institutions. So far as the theological seminaries are concerned, we now have in Chicago a central organization that is interested in the Torah. We refer to the board of directors of the Hebrew Theological College. Let this organization establish a committee whose task it shall be to control the activity of the agents representing foreign theological seminaries. No agent representing a seminary should be permitted to collect money in this city unless the committee is convinced that the institution which he represents is a legitimate one, and that he is actually authorized to solicit funds for it. Every agent should be required to give the committee an exact accounting of his work each week. The money that he collects must be given to the committee. To us this appears to be the only way that we can guarantee that the money which is collected in Chicago for theological seminaries actually reaches the right place. When the public realizes that the agents representing seminaries are under supervision, the agents will receive better <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>treatment, and the legitimate seminaries will receive a great deal more money from Chicago than they do now.</p>
   <p>The other category consists of agents who come to Chicago to collect money for Palestinian institutions. These agents must be placed under the control of a committee composed of leaders of the Mizrachi [Orthodox wing of the Zionist organization] and rabbis, and no agent of a Palestinian institution should be permitted to collect money in this city without the consent of this committee. The remittance of the money must be handled by the committee, not by the agent. The agent is no more than an agent, i. e., his business is to collect the money and to get paid for his work. Nothing else is any concern of his.</p>
   <p>No one can claim that this plan is not feasible. If the rabbis and prominent leaders of the Chicago Jewry are in earnest about this matter, these two committees can be organized overnight. It is needless to say that the Courier will help these committees carry through their tasks, by which the legitimate <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>institutions and the city of Chicago will profit. First of all, the treasurers whom the various agents have selected and who do not have the power to control these agents, must resign from office in order that no agent can claim that he is not subject to the authority of the control committee because he is under the control of a treasurer.</p>
   <p>We beg the rabbis and the prominent men of the Jewish community to take up this matter, because the present state of affairs is harmful to both the Jewish community and the legitimate institutions; it only enables a few swindlers to grow fat at the expense of the public. In a city like Chicago, definite order must prevail in the field of foreign charities, just as definite order must prevail in the field of local charities. We must do no less for our foreign charities than we do for our local charities.</p>
