   <p>The spirit of self-betterment has entered into the ranks of the West Side Jews. A number of young men gathered together. Each subscribed a little sum as the foundation for a fund and a charter was secured, and thus the Chicago Hebrew Institute was organized.</p>
   <p>The objects of the Institute, as stated in the charter, are the promotion of education, moral, and physical culture, and civic training, and the social advancement of the Jewish residents of the city of Chicago. For those purposes the institution will maintain and conduct schools, libraries, laboratories, reading, class and club rooms, gymnasium, music and lecture halls, and acquire such lands and erect such buildings as may be required for the accomplishment of its purposes.</p>
   <p>A large sum of money is necessary for the erection of this institute, which is to be raised by popular subscription. Shares, at one dollar each, are being sold, thus enabling every man, woman, and child to actively participate in the realization of this undertaking.</p>
