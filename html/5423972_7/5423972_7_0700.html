   <p>Submitted at the annual meeting of the Chicago Branch H. I. A. S., January 31, 1923. To the officers and directors of the Chicago Branch and the National Organization, H. I. A. S., and the officers and directors of the Jewish Charities of Chicago:</p>
   <p>With the completion of another year of service as president of the Chicago Branch of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society of America, it becomes my official task to present to you a statement of what has been accomplished by our joint efforts in our field of work during the past year, and to call to your attention important matters affecting our work during the coming year.</p>
   <p>I can summarize our past year's work in general in no better way than to say that in some respects we have gone forward, while in other very important respects we have stood still.</p>
   <p>As we stand at the portal of a new year in our work, with traditional Jewish modesty and high aspiration, we are more concerned with what we have failed to do during the past year than with what we succeeded in doing. We might if we wanted to glance over our shortcomings and say "Dayem"--"We have done good work"--but if we were to say so, it would mean that we are satisfied with something less than our best, which, of course, we are not. Rather we prefer to say "Chotonu"--"We have sinned"--for we want earnestly to know what our faults and weaknesses are, in order that we may correct them, and do our work with the greatest efficiency and the truest helpfulness. To paint a glowing picture of the past year's work, whether it is true or not, may satisfy our conceit, but it does not advance our work. We have to ask ourselves, first of all, "What is our work?" and then, "How have we done it?"</p>
   <p>It is most unfortunate that we are generally regarded in the community merely as a sheltering agency. For this work we have been allowed annually a certain sum by the Federated Orthodox Charities, which has now been merged in the Jewish Charities of Chicago. As a matter of fact, our sheltering work is the lesser part of the work we do. Our main work is our immigrant service. We are an important link in the chain of a world organization, which for a number of years has been ministering in a most devoted and substantial way to the suffering masses of our people, in matters of life and death. We are, therefore, more than a merely local organization in the Jewish community, affiliated with the local organized Jewish charities, and attending only to local needs. We are part and parcel of the national H. I. A. S. organization, with which we stand on the firing line for our people. As such, the national H. I. A. S. organization has a right to look to us for help so that it shall be able to go on doing its blessed and needed work throughout the world, and we cannot fail it when it calls upon us for help. But we have failed the H. I. A. S. national organization during the past year, and that is why I repeat, we are compelled as we assemble in annual meeting, to say "Chotonu", we have sinned!</p>
   <p>Let me give you the facts that justify this statement. Having in mind our inescapable duty to our national organization as well as to our local shelter needs, I pointed out in my annual report a year ago, that the support we have been receiving from the Federated--$10,000 a year--is but a fractional part of what we need. This is not my personal opinion alone. We all agreed we ought to have more than the amount allowed us by the Federated, and one of the very first things we did at the beginning of the past year was to take the matter up with the Federated, with a view to secure an increased allowance. A year has gone by, and we are no further ahead than we were a year ago! During the past year, our national organization has been confronted with a crisis and its very existence has been at stake, and is still at stake. We, in Chicago, have had to stand idly by while our great mother organization has been hovering between life and death. The national organization implored us to start a campaign for $50,000 in Chicago for H. I. A. S. work, but, owing to our affiliation with the Federated, we could not initiate such a campaign without first making efforts to secure the Federated's sanction. This was neither given nor declined. Nothing came of our efforts. Toward the end of the year, Mr. Isidore Hirshfield, one of our national directorate, on his way from New York to California to launch a H. I. A. S. campaign on the Pacific coast, at our request stopped off in Chicago for several days, and personally took up the matter of proper support for H. I. A. S. in Chicago with the heads of the local organized charities. Mr. Hirshfield took the advanced position that our national organization desires to co-operate to the fullest degree, with local charities' federations wherever they exist, rather than to raise the funds it needs for its work, independently. In a formal communication addressed to the heads of our local organized charities, Mr. Hirshfield asked that for the coming year the sum of $40,000 be set aside in the local charities' budget for the H. I. A. S., and $50,000 for the Emergency Fund Drive, the directors of the Chicago Branch undertaking to see that the greater part of the sum thus set aside, shall be raised by them in the community, at the time of the holding of the general charities drive. Thus, a separate H. I. A. S. campaign would be avoided.</p>
   <p>To my great disappointment, nothing has been done in this matter. Two months have passed and we have yet to receive an acknowledgement of the receipt of Mr. Hirshfield's letter. We are, therefore, "up in the air". We have a right to ask the local charities' heads to let us know what they think about our proposal. If they favor it, we want to make plans without delay so as to do our part in the coming united charities' drive. If they do not favor setting aside the sum asked for by Mr. Hirshfield to enable us to help our national organization in its general work as well as to do our local emmigrant and sheltering work, they should at least not withhold their endorsement of a campaign for H. I. A. S. conducted in the community by ourselves, so that without further delay we can get our campaign under way, and [can] raise at the earliest date possible, the amount the national organization is looking to us to raise for it in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This matter cannot be deferred any longer. It has been put off too long already. We must do something and as soon as possible. I earnestly submit this matter to your immediate attention, and hope a way will be found to meet the situation honorably and harmoniously, to the satisfaction of all.</p>
   <p>While we have made no progress during the past year in the pressing matter of launching a campaign in Chicago for the national H. I. A. S. organization, we have attended to our immigrant work in a most gratifying way. Our office during the past year was busily engaged without letup, in attending to the various needs of all who applied to us for help. Our office force was taxed to the limit giving interviews, making out affidavits, forwarding money, locating relatives, sending telegrams, inserting notices in the papers for information regarding relations in this country, and in various ways, in which we render intimate personal service to all who come to us, not in vain, for aid.</p>
   <p>We transmitted to Europe through our office last year, for the use of needy relatives abroad, the sum of over $200,000. This money was transmitted without a penny of cost to the senders, and was paid in American dollars, not in depreciated European money, to recipients abroad.</p>
   <p>We handled 18,500 separate inquiries, involving bringing immigrants to this country from Soviet Russia, Latvia, Poland, and Rumania; locating relatives in this country, furnishing transportation and giving immediate assistance wherever needed; meeting immigrants at the depots and directing them to their destinations or providing for their shelter and comfort, etc.</p>
   
   <p>Our office filled out 11,599 affidavits for the use of European emigrant officials, 1,588 affidavits for American immigration officials, 1,167 being for Ellis Island and 421 for Washington.</p>
   <p>We personally met 503 persons at the various depots, transferring them to other depots, directing them to their destinations beyond Chicago, and providing food and shelter to all in need of such.</p>
   <p>Every case we handled had its own special, and often trying, features but we gave the fullest attention to each, not resting until all that could be done was done. One case in particular stands out among the rest during the past year, in which our timely aid prevented a great injustice from being done. This case throws light upon some of the inner, as well as outer difficulties confronting some of our immigrants. After being in this country for a short time, a young immigrant and his wife were denounced by his own older brother living in Chicago, as Bolsheviks, and they were, as a result, about to be deported, when, upon their appeal to us, we intervened in their behalf, secured their release under bond while we could look fully into the case, and finally satisfied the authorities that the charge was untrue, and was made because of a family difficulty of long standing, that had been intensified since the landing in this country of these young immigrants. This one case required no end of work until it was disposed of. Such a case shows clearly that we help not only those against whom a cruel world shuts its doors and heart, but those also against whom the hands of their own flesh and blood are raised.</p>
   <p>Several reports, each much longer than this, could be filled with dramatic incidents in our daily work. The Jewish and non-Jewish press, too, is filled with the most touching stories of distress, softened and relieved by the tender heart and healing hand of H. I. A. S. Thousands of households bless the H. I. A. S. for what it has meant to them and done for them.</p>
   <p>This, not the mere provision of lodgings and meals to needy transients, is our main work. This is our task--ministering to the driven, the harnessed [harassed?] and exploited in the household of Israel! who is there so small of soul as to say that this blessed and urgent work can be done with a pittance?</p>
   
   <p>Who is so lacking in true humanity as to say that it is not our duty to acquaint Chicago Jewry with the needs of H. I. A. S. and give it the opportunity to show how it desires to help meet those needs?</p>
   <p>In our sheltering work, to which the community properly looks to us for efficient effort, we have again demonstrated that a shelter can be conducted in such a way as to be a credit to the community in the fullest sense of the word. We have provided a place to which those in need of shelter can come, that is clean throughout, and hospitable. It would be better to call our shelter a first-class hotel for dependent transients. It is as far removed from the old-style shelters as day is from night.</p>
   <p>To our great disappointment, we find efforts still out forth by private persons to operate shelters on their own account without responsibility to anyone. There is room in the Chicago Jewish Community for only one official shelter which has a rightful claim upon the full support of the community. We are prepared to take care of all shelter needs in the community and to see that those needs are met in the most efficient as well as the most economical way. Private shelters run by a little group that alone knows how much money is raised and what disposition is made of it, besides diverting funds that are needed for legitimate and authorized sheltering effort, and to the shelter burden on the community. They encourage a vagrant type instead of building up self-respect and a spirit of personal pride and independence. If they made efforts to deal with the shelter problem in an enlightened and constructively remedial way, there would be some excuse for them, but this is the farthest from their minds.</p>
   <p>In one important respect, our shelter work is in need of improvement to which we must give our attention without delay. Often we find the female transients, especially among the self-respecting immigrants who come to us for help, are in need of shelter. We are at present equipped only to care for male transients. Accordingly our plans for the coming year must provide for accommodations for female transients in quarters apart from these provided for male transients. This involves the remodeling of our building. The first steps in this direction, that is, the drawing of architects' plans, have already been taken, and we are hopeful that before the present year has advanced very far, we shall be equipped to take proper care of all female as well as wale transients applying to us for shelter.</p>
   
   <p>With the further installation of the proper disinfecting apparatus and some other needed improvements, such as painting the building throughout, we shall be equipped with sheltering facilities second to none anywhere.</p>
   <p>During the past year we gave shelter to 1,015 separate individuals, to whom we served over 14,000 meals. The shelter was attended to, with the utmost fidelity and efficiency, by our superintendent, Mr. Max Horowitz, and his wife, in addition to the former's heavy duties with the Immigrant Aid. Credit is also due for the success of our shelter work to our able and devoted house chairman, Mr. Morris Tower, who, as before set an example of fidelity to duty to all directors and chairmen, supervising the details of our shelter work with the most painstaking and intelligent attention. He is indeed a tower of strength in our work.</p>
   <p>It is when we have competent and conscientious chairmen, and an alert and active board of directors that takes a close personal interest in every aspect of our work, attends meetings regularly and discharges faithfully committee assignments, that we alone can do our work the way it ought to be done. The work cannot be left to one man or to a few; it must be shared by all.</p>
   <p>Fortunately we start this year with a board of directors that gives promise of serving in this spirit and manner. We have new blood on our board that gives indications of vitalizing our efforts in every respect. We bid our new directors a most hearty welcome among us, making no distinctions between the newer and the older members of the board. None will be overlooked in opportunities to serve. In view of the great problems before us during the coming year, we need an especially able and active board of directors and I am confident that we now have such a board.</p>
   <p>We need also a large and active Women's Auxiliary, and a Junior Auxiliary, too. Such bodies are of great help. When, for any purpose, workers are needed, they are available, and from their ranks come good material for future directors.</p>
   <p>Let us go at our work the coming year as we have never before gone at it. Let us not sit back and hold back. Let us realize what we have to do, and do it, each to the fullest of his ability. Let us remember that we are not a minor institution in the community because we conduct a shelter, but that we represent H. I. A. S. in Chicago, H. I. A. S. that helps the suffering and the wandering in Israel, H. I. A. S. that reunites the sundered, and rescues from the grave the faltering, H. I. A. S. that spells hope and home, intervention and interest, attention and assistance, shelter and security to countless numbers of our people, lashed by a cruel fate and driven mercilessly from place to place, from land to land. Let us feel anew the full dignity and immeasurable worth of our work, and bend every effort to see that the work is done by all of us without any exception, with the greatest zeal and the greastest helpfulness.</p>
