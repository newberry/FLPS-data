   <p>Tuesday night there was a meeting of the young people who desire to raise funds to purchase the old structure housing the Marks Nathan Orphan Home. A permanent organization was provided for, and officers were elected. Membership is composed of 75 young people of the age of 20 or over.</p>
   <p>At the same time there was a meeting of the presidents of North-West Side Synagogues, to effect the same purpose. A proposal was made that a circular letter be sent to all Jewish North-West Side organizations to get their moral and financial support. A proposal was made to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the young people. This, I am sure would be a very impractical plan. The structure will be used by both young and old and both should be responsible for its existence. We hope the first proposal will be carried through and that the necessary funds be raised so that the structure can be utilized as soon as possible for its intended activities. We are sure that the structure and its new activities will be a lasting credit to the community.</p>
