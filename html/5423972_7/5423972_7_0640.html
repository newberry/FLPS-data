   <p>In his address before the presidents of the Orthodox synagogues some two months ago, Dr. Shmarya Levin suggested that the synagogues should raise a quarter of a million dollars for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. Those who are familiar with the achievements of the synagogues in the past will probably say that Dr. Shmarya Levin was overestimating the financial resources of the Orthodox Jewish community of Chicago. It is our belief, however, that the synagogues could raise vast sums for the Keren Hayesod if they were properly organized as individual bodies, and if they would make up their mind to carry out a certain program of work. There are, by this time, nine thousand Orthodox Jewish families in Chicago affiliated with the hundred and sixty Orthodox synagogues. These nine thousand Jewish families represent the economic backbone of the Orthodox community. Nor are they indifferent to the woes and sorrows of our people.</p>

   <p>Those Jews in Chicago who consider it worth while to be affiliated with the synagogue, are as a rule serious-minded Jews and they could be made to give money for the Keren Hayesod. Among these nine thousand Jewish families in Chicago, affiliated with the synagogues, are a number of very rich people. The average Orthodox Jew in Chicago who is a member of a synagogue is by no means a poor man, for the really poor cannot afford to carry the burden of membership to the synagogue, and, therefore, it stands to reason that there is a possibility of raising vast sums of money from among the Orthodox Jews in Chicago for the Keren Hayesod. Some of the synagogues having a wealthy membership could raise as much as fifteen to twenty thousand dollars each, and the poorest and smallest synagogue could raise from five hundred to one thousand dollars. Now we must bear in mind that there are some one hundred and sixty synagogues in the city of Chicago, and there are in each and every synagogue a few active Zionists. We, therefore, believe that Dr. Shmarya Levin did not exaggerate the financial possibilities and resources of the Chicago Orthodox Jewry, and that his suggestion that the synagogues raise a quarter of a million dollars for the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Keren Hayesod is at least debatable. They may not raise a quarter of a million dollars the first year, but if properly organized for the purpose, they could raise at least one hundred thousand dollars this year, and more in the years to come.</p>
   <p>The only way to enable the synagogues to raise a substantial quota for the Keren Hayesod is to organize them in the proper way and make them do things. If left to themselves, they will do nothing, or next to nothing. But if pressure will be brought to bear on them, they will do things. They will organize committees, teams, and squads, for the purpose of soliciting and collecting moneys, and they will succeed in collecting a substantial sum of money in the course of the campaign to begin March the twenty-first.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the various Orthodox synagogues in conference assembled, have decided to participate in the campaign of the Keren Hayesod and to do their utmost for the Keren Hayesod. A committee of fifteen presidents of the largest synagogues has been appointed to work out the plans of a campaign <span class="page-break">\4</span>and if this committee does good work, as we hope it will, there is no reason why the representatives of the Chicago Orthodox Jewry should not be in a position to hand over to Dr. Weizmann, at the reception to be accorded to him by the synagogues, a substantial check for the Keren Hayesod. It is the duty of the presidents to line up at least ten well-to-do members of their organizations and to persuade them to give substantial amounts for the Keren Hayesod. In addition, each and every synagogue should take upon itself to raise a certain quota, say from a thousand to five thousand dollars. They all can raise a certain quota if they will go to work in a spirit of earnestness and idealism. The rabbis, of course, too, must be drawn into the work, and we hope that they will be only too glad to serve.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the committee to start work right away. In about a month, Dr. Weizmann will be in town, and everything must be done before his arrival. The bulk of the work should be done and must be done before Dr. Weizmann will come to Chicago. The leaders of the synagogues must understand that if they will not come to the aid of the Keren Hayesod, the campaign will be a failure, <span class="page-break">\5</span>for the Keren Hayesod cannot appeal to the radicals and cannot appeal to the Reformers. It can only appeal to the Orthodox Jews, and if the Orthodox Jews will not help build Palestine, who will?</p>
