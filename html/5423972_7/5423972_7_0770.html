   <p>We appeal to every sensitive Jew to help the poor, lonely, and needy Jews who come to Chicago. Help us to make our tag day a success. Our tag day is next Sunday, August 27. Everyone who knows the meaning of pity and brotherliness knows how important the work that we are doing is. Everyone understands the comfort a lonely stranger receives from being able so enter a Shelter House; it gives his courage and strength to help himself.</p>
   <p>We need volunteers to help us on tag day, so that we can pay off our mortgage and begin to build a larger home. We urge our members to come and take boxes, and help us to make the tag day a success.</p>
   <p>In the name of the committee, we wish to thank you in advance for your help.</p>
