   <p>The Chicago Jewish Committee for Palestinian Welfare came into existence two years ago for the purpose of helping to establish a system of district nursing in Palestine. Because of the unspeakable conditions now prevailing there as a result of the war, the Chicago Committee was obliged to abandon its plan, and devote its entire energy and funds towards immediate relief. Mrs. Albert H. Loeb is the honorary president of the committee.</p>
