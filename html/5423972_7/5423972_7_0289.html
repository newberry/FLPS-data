   <p>It is pitiful to see how parents are killing themselves to raise their children as Jews, and the children can not even read Hebrew. Our daughters, the future Jewish mothers, will know nothing about Judaism. The Hebrew language is being forgotten. Our great forefathers and our ancient prophets are unknown to our children. Even the origin of our holidays are unknown to our children.</p>

   <p>The Yabneh Institute, which will be opened Saturday, July 4, will consist of one Hebrew school for boys, through which, we guarantee that the children will have a clear conception of the Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, Hagiographia) and will know a great deal of Jewish history; a large library, where anybody will be welcome to read about Jewish matters in any language; a Sabbath school where Jewish girls will learn to read, write, and speak Hebrew; lectures for adults and children on Jewish history and Judaism in general; a glee club; and chiefly, a large, beautiful, and modern synagogue for services and study. A noted cantor, in cooperation with the glee club will officiate the services. All are welcome to attend the synagogue services. All Jews are welcome to join this noble institute at the rate of $3 per year.</p>
