   <p>A great mass meeting and concert took place last night at Congregation Anshe Sholom, Polk Street and Ashland Boulevard. A large crowd gathered, despite the bad weather, to listen to the concert given by the well-known Cantor Moses Shane, with a choir and a symphony orchestra under the direction of Jacob Shaeffer. They also came to listen to the message to Chicago Jews from the great Jewish leader, Nahum Sokolow.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sokolow, in a long and impressive speech, analyzed the whole political situation with regard to Zionism. He also gave a historical review as regards the recognition of the Jewish people as a nation. [Translator's note: Mr. Sokolow's speech has not been translated because its contents do not fall within the scope of this project.] After Mr. Sokolow's speech, Rabbi Saul Silber made an appeal for the Keren Hayesod [Jewish National Fund]. Mr. Joseph Weil was chairman.</p>

   <p>The Sokolow campaign is now in full swing in Chicago. Teams that were organized last Saturday night at a meeting in the La Salle Hotel, under the chairmanship of Mr. B. Horwich, are now canvassing the entire city to collect subscriptions for the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>The local administrative committee of the Keren Hayesod, of which Mr. B. Horwich is president, Judge Joseph Shulman, vice-president, Samuel Phillip-son, treasurer, Fred Lubin, financial secretary, and Isidore Liederman, recording secretary, feels that the Zionist leader, Nahum Sokolow, must not leave Chicago without a big check for the Keren Hayesod. That is the reason for the campaign now being conducted in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the Chicago Jews will fulfill their duty to the Jewish nation and that they will welcome the volunteers with open arms, and will give them their checks for this important fund.</p>
