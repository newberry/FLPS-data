   <p>Mrs. J. B. Malkes, head of the committee to aid the unemployed workers, met with her committee yesterday and decided to rent a place where meals can be distributed among the unemployed.</p>
   <p>It is the opinion of the committee that the free restaurant should not bear the earmarks of mendicancy, and a price was, therefore, fixed for every meal. The customers need not pay the cashier, but instead deposit the price for the meal in a cash box which will be locked. The committee will open the box every evening and remove the monies they find.</p>
   <p>Today the unemployed will still receive their meals in Yavneh Institute, as in the past.</p>
   <p>The unemployed workers are becoming very alarmed about the slow work of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>committee. They cannot understand why it should take so long to find a location for the restaurant.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, a portion of the unemployed workers assembled in Workmen's Hall, 12th and Waller Sts., and heard several speakers of the International Propaganda Group, protest against the "burlesque politicians who speak in behalf of labor." The International Propaganda Group has the "real remedy for the unemployed" and their sound advice is: "Defy anybody who wishes to reduce your status to that of a beggar."</p>
   <p>The meeting was well attended by detectives, police, and reporters. One person was arrested, and taken to the Maxwell Street station, for distributing leaflets.</p>
   <p>Captain Storen discharged "the great revolutionist," who was a short, frail Jew. But he confiscated the leaflets addressed "to all unemployed" and signed by the "International Propaganda Group."</p>
