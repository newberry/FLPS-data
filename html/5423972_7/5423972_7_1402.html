   <p>Those that pledged donations for the Redemption Fund last Pentecost, at the Memorial Services, are asked to pay their pledges at the synagogues where they attended services.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Commission in Palestine has notified us that it is in need of money. Therefore, do not withhold any longer the holy money that you have promised for Zion.</p>
   <p>The presidents (of the synagogues) and the rabbis are asked to remind the public of this situation in their synagogues. And the collected sums, together with the names of the donors, should be sent to the Zionist Bureau, 1212 Ashland Block.</p>
