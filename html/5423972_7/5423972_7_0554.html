   <p>The Jews of Chicago should get ready to contribute to the treasury of the Chicago Jewish Charities the sum of money it needs to go on with its work, now that we are through with the various tag days, big and little drives, in behalf of this or that organization, of this or that institution. During the coming year, the Chicago Jewish Charities will need more money because its management intends to spend much more than seventy thousand dollars for Jewish education. Mr. James Davis is responsible for the statement that the Chicago Jewish Charities will do what is right for the religious education of the Jewish children of our city, and this means an expenditure of a hundred thousand dollars a year, and perhaps more.</p>
   
   <p>No organization or institution should embark on a drive for funds now. The Chicago Jewish Charities has much more work to do this year than last. It has to put its subscription books in order; it has to make sure of an annual contribution from every Chicago Jew who can afford to give. You will soon be called upon to participate in this noble work. Get ready to give a proper response.</p>
