   <p>Under the capable direction of superintendent Philip Seman, the Jewish people's Institute (formerly Hebrew Institute) undertook and also carries out a brilliant task for the physical and spiritual development of our working girls and for the youth at school during the summer vacation.</p>
   <p>The Jewish People's Institute has its own summer resort, known under the name of Camp Chi. This summer resort is for working girls. The Jewish People's Institute has also rented two other resorts: one in Wooster, Illinois for school boys, and the other in Wauconda, Illinois for school girls. Eight hundred Jewish children will spend their vacations there, each two weeks. They will be transported there in three groups.</p>
   <p>Camp Chi is located in Loon Lake, Illinois, seventy-five miles from Chicago. The ground on which the camp is situated was purchased from the Consumers Company, and is directly facing Loon Lake. The camp consists of sixteen <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>permanent cabins or camp cottages sixteen feet square, and six cottages for meetings, nine feet square. There is also a theater saloon, a social hall, washrooms and a large kitchen with the most modern improvements. All the cottages and halls are completely screened. The cabins are provided with strong, thick linen shades in the inside and with wooden covers on the outside, so that, when the weather is bad, it rains hard, or strong winds blow, the shades are lowered and the campers are well protected.</p>
   <p>The camp's lighting facilities are electrified throughout: from the entrance to the camp, leading from the main road, to the specially built pier on the lake.</p>
   <p>They have good drinking water; a machine pumps 250 gallons of water per hour. The well is two hundred feet deep, and pipes distribute the water to all locations. All the fixtures were installed in the most modern way.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Every method of sanitation was carefully taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>The Jewish People's Institute has owned this summer resort for the last several years, and all the girls who were there during the summer, relate nothing but of pleasures, pleasures that cost the sun of seventeen dollars for a two-week period for working girls over sixteen years of age; for those under sixteen years of age, the cost is eleven to twelve dollars for a two-week period. Many working girls go there for week ends which cost $6.75. Transportation is furnished, good food is provided and many pleasures are afforded.</p>
   <p>The Wooster summer resort was rented from the Young Men's Jewish Charities, and that of the Wauconda, from the Council of Jewish Women. The cost to youngsters is three and half dollars for a two-week period. There are stone and brick buildings in the camp.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>This is not a charity matter, you merely pay the cost price. The girls in Loon Lake feel as safe as they would be in their own homes. The same applies to the school children at the other two summer resorts. They enjoy the fresh air, attend lectures, are taught dramatics, listen to essays, bathe in the lake, sing, dance, play ball, make various exercises, hike and are fed whole-some food from a strict kosher kitchen. They retire at ten o'clock in the evening, and at seven in the morning they are on the outside. A Jewish spirit reigns in all the three places on Friday, especially in Camp Chi where the Friday eve begins with the candle blessing at Mother Seman's. [Translator's note, "Mother seman" referred to here is the wife of Dr. Seman.]</p>
   <p>To all this something else must be added, which the Jewish People's Institute has installed:</p>
   <p>For those children unable to leave the city, a summer play school was set up <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>at the institute on Taylor Street. There, the children are instructed in painting, gardening, gymnastics and swimming; they are also taken each week on trips to the parks. All this is furnished by the Institute for the small sum of six dollars for the entire summer, and Superintendent Seman placed this under the supervision of Mr. Edward Cohn and Mr. Emil Gollubier.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seman and his wife, with a staff of attendants see to it, that a pleasant vacation in the summer resorts is had by all, and deserve recognition for their important work.</p>
