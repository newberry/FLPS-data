   <p>The relief department of the Jewish Aid Society is greatly in need of clothes for the vast number of men, women, and children who are now forced to turn to it for aid.</p>
   <p>The society appeals to all tender-hearted people to contribute clothing, old or new. As it cannot afford to call for the clothes, it is requested that the donors bring whatever packages they may have to the office of the society, 1336 S. Morgan Street. Shoes, sweaters, underwear, and blankets are mostly needed. Please phone before bringing anything in.</p>
