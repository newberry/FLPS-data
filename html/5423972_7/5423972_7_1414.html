   <p>The Red Cross campaign was opened in Chicago yesterday in full force. Those who supervise the campaign expect that Chicago will be the largest contributor to the hundred million dollar fund which is asked of the nation for the second Red Cross Campaign.</p>
   <p>During yesterday's activities a sum of $296,000 was collected for the fund. This sum, though, came only from a few large concerns but it is expected, that the really large sums of money will come from the millions of Chicago's citizens.</p>
