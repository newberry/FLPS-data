   <p>Yesterday two little girls with beaming faces were among the first in the relief office at 720 West Twelfth Street. They presented 104 pennies gathered by the children in the Medill School. Rabbi Ephraim Epstein and Mr. Samuel Philipson were next with a check for $1,000 from B. Cohen and Sons which had been contributed at the wedding of Mr. Benjamin Cohen's daughter, Ethel, to Mr. Irving Greenspahn. And so all day long came streams of rabbis, synagogue presidents, and prominent men with checks and cash for the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>All bore in mind the remaining five days left to obtain the 25% promised by Julius Rosenwald. All voiced the same opinion, "Chicago must not remain silent!" Every dollar brings another twenty-five cents. Jews must accept their responsibility and bring or send as much as they possibly can to Samuel Philipson, treasurer, 720 West Twelfth Street. The general belief is that it is correct to send the money directly to Mr. Philipson and to the Joint Relief Committee in Schiff's Building.</p>
