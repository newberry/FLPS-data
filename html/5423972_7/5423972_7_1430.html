   <p>At a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Stratford Hotel plans were discussed for a new and big relief campaign for 1918. Mr. Julius Rosenwald came to Chicago especially to be present at the meeting. He participated in all the discussion, but the meeting was unable to adopt a conclusive plan.</p>
   <p>A committee was therefore appointed to work out concrete plans and present them at a second meeting to be held within a few weeks.</p>
   <p>The main speakers at the meeting were Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Julius Rosenwald and Judge Julian W. Mack, who will hold his court open for some time in Chicago.</p>
