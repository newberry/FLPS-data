   <p>The Ukranian Countrymen Conference was held yesterday at Maltz's Hall, where 26 countrymen Vereins were represented by their delegates. The conference was addressed by Mr. Rashkes, representative of the Jewish Social Committee of Russia, who revealed the horrible conditions that prevail at present, in the ruins of Ukrania. He presented many facts and statistics on the relief work, carried on by the Jewish Social Committee, in Ukrania, where so little aid from America was received. Several resolutions were adopted which promised to start immediate relief-action for Ukrania, which will be thoroughly applied on constructive basis. The conference appointed a new executive of 15 members, who will open soon a great relief campaign amongst the Ukranian Jews.</p>
