   <p>It was recently announced that the Joint Distribution Committee will give up its activities on December 21st., 1923. The announcement, as it read, was interpreted by all as the final dissolution of the American Jewish Relief Organization, one of the most efficient organizations the American Jews have ever created. The dissolution of the organization was at once reconsidered by leading Jewish social workers in this country, who have been instrumental in building it up and who know well that it can still render good services, although not especially engaged in relief activities. It can serve domestic purposes; it can be instrumental in placing our home philanthropics on a sounder basis, and it should not be dissolved. Our leading social workers have lost no time in convening a conference in Washington, D. C., to consider their problem in its entirety, and according to a Washington dispatch to the <span class="page-break">2</span>Courier of yesterday's date, the budget committee of the National Conference of Jewish Social Service has brought a report in which it has recommended that the Joint Distribution Committee shall not be dissolved, but shall undertake to serve as [a] collecting agency for our national organizations. In short, our social workers recommend that the machinery of the relief organization should not be scrapped.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Hias, of the Jewish National Hospital, of the Consumptive Relief Society of Denver, and of the Consumptive Relief Association of California have proposed that a permanent committee of representatives of national organizations be established, and that this committee co-operate with the National Conference of Jewish Social Service, to work out a plan to be submitted to the next conference regarding the preservation of the relief organization machinery as established in 1915.</p>
   <p>We hope that the social workers and representatives of the national organizations <span class="page-break">3</span>will succeed in carrying out their plan in convincing the leaders of the Joint Distribution Committee not to scrap the relief organization machinery. It is of vast importance that this organization machinery continue to serve domestic needs, for the time has come to centralize our home philanthropies, especially as far as they are of a national character. The survival of the relief organization, as an organization to serve domestic needs, will mean the centralization of our national philanthropies, and it will also mean economy of energy and money. At present each and every one of our national organizations has its own emissaries, its own collectors, its own solicitors, and its own money getting machinery. The Hias, for instance, pays as high as sixty per cent commission to collectors. The Consumptive Relief of Denver pays thirty-five per cent and more. The Consumptive Relief Association of California also pays from thirty-five to fifty per cent for all collections. In many cases organizations pay as high as sixty or seventy-five per cent for solicitations of funds. The average is probably fifty per cent everywhere. If a million dollars a year are collected for our people in this country for national <span class="page-break">4</span>institutions, exactly one-half million dollars goes into the pockets of the collectors. The best part of this million and one-half dollars can be saved for the institutions for which they are collected, if there were a central agency to collect these moneys. We believe that a collecting agency would not only serve the purposes of national philanthropic institutions, but also serve the purposes of the national, educational, and intellectual institutions, such as the various rabbinical seminaries, historical societies, the Jewish Publication Society, and similar organizations. It will do away with the middleman between the donor and the institution. The middleman is not necessary at all. Only a central collecting agency will make them superfluous. The middleman is by no means a moral or financial asset to the institution. In many cases he is a burden to them and in many cases he only creates scandal because he is not always the best type of man and the best type of Jew. He is often honest and often dishonest, and it can be done away with, it should <span class="page-break">5</span>be eliminated.</p>
   <p>The relief organizations never spent more than twenty per cent on the collections of moneys, and this twenty per cent, too, was not paid to middlemen, emissaries, or collectors. This represents the cost of organization, officers, stenographers, etc. If the Joint Distribution Committee were to be turned into a collecting agency for national institutions, the middlemen would be cut out immediately and the cost of raising and distributing the funds would not exceed two per cent, instead of seventy-five per cent. Besides, there would be no duplication of work and no duplication of effort. It is, therefore, obvious that our Social Workers are right when they insist that the Joint Distribution Committee be turned into a national collecting agency, for such an agency is an absolute necessity. It is hard to establish one, but if there is one already in existence, it should be made a power for good in the life of our people in this country.</p>
