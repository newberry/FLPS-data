   <p>Not so long ago an American architect presented a plan for a new capital in Australia. The entire layout of his map embodied much beauty. Everywhere were marvelous structures and broad boulevards with flower gardens. The entire city with its churches, temples, museums, administrative buildings and parks appeared as one of the most beautiful rugs of Bitzalal, and as the valley of Sharon crowned with the roses and lilies of spring.</p>
   <p>But should this same architect try to make plans for the improvement of even such a young city as Chicago he would have to take into consideration the railroad lines, the old structures in the wealthy business districts, and all the other things that have grown and become part of the city in its comparatively short existence.</p>

   <p>As for such old cities as Rome, Paris and Vienna in Western Europe, Jerusalem and Bagdad in Western Asia they cannot readily be changed in structure even by an absolute monarch, although he might succeed in bringing in a few alterations. It is said that when Nickolas I sent for an American engineer (the father of the famous artist Whistler) to build a railroad from St. Petersburg to Moscow, and the engineer asked, through which states was the train to go, the Tzar drew a straight line on his map from St. Petersburg to Moscow, disregarding mountains and rivers, as well as distances between cities.</p>
   <p>A selfish ruling tyrant can impose his will where dead nature is concerned such as in constructing gigantic bridges over wide rivers and breaking through long miles of tunnels in a whole series of hills; <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and he may disregard the economic conditions of the states and refuse to give work to the natives. But he cannot even with all his power beat a path through the center of churches in Moscow or the church of St. Petersburg. The Roman tyrant Nero set fire to Rome but he was unable to complete the rebuilding of the city.</p>
   <p>The same holds true when one wishes to reform a people. When the Hascola movement began among the Jews, they built small temples, lax in orthodoxism, bringing in as much of the outside world as possible.</p>
   <p>But, throw nature out of the door and she will enter through the window. What difference, if the platform is transformed, if the Jews remain the same. As long as Jews come there to pray they will have their "pews" and donate their share for charity.</p>

   <p>Thus it was when the Huvi Zion wanted to reform methods of Jewish charity for Israel. They did not not want their funds to be mistakenly used for those old people who go to Palestine to die in the Holy Land, but to be used for those who go to rebuild and colonize, to work in the fields of Judea. It was not long before the new settlement of Palestine adopted the "contribution and disbursement" system of charity existing elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Our modern Zionism that originated in Western Europe, "dressed in a frock with a white bow," has very little in common with the old forms and traditions of the Jewish streets, yet no sooner did all of Judaism over the whole world give recognition to this new form than the old seeped into the new. We again have the old familiar system, albeit somewhat polished.</p>

   <p>So it is now, or soon will be, with the Federation in the Jewish streets of Chicago. When it came, it was thought that it would do away with all the old forms of collecting and distributing charitable funds. But the habits and traditions of a people are much stronger than mere strength. The people have in the course of hundreds of years slowly moulded their own forms and methods of charity distributions and collections - the synagogue collection, house-to-house solicitation, box method, etc. Jews are accustomed to giving charity, which, of course, is worthy. They give to every worthy cause.</p>
   <p>Our modern times have brought a new slant to our old methods. Collectors are now representatives or delegates. The old box collection gave way to one sponsored by a national institution. It is colored with national <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>hues and emblems and is a decoration for the modern Jewish home. Its sound does not frighten us any more but gives us a feeling of well being in charity giving. It is a National Fund Day, a demonstration of the young Jewish generation that has come home, that does not want to proceed further, that is following in the footsteps of its elders.</p>
   <p>It is hard to change the face of an old city. One must always take into consideration those ways of the old forms that have their roots deeply set in tradition.</p>
