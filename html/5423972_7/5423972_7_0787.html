   <p>Do you know what has happened to the board of education of the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities, appointed by Mr. James Davis? If I am not mistaken, three months have passed since the board was appointed, and, again if I am not mistaken, the board has not yet had a single meeting. The question naturally arise, why? If the board of education considers itself superfluous, why not say so? On the other hand, if it thinks that it can do good work and that its existence is justified, why doesn't it get to work?</p>
   <p>By leading a "paper" existence, the board of education will not accomplish anything for Jewish education in Chicago.</p>
