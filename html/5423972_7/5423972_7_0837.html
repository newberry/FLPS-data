I understand fully the great purpose of your visit. I know that you, as representatives of a world movement, bear great responsibilities because the future of your organization depends a great deal upon what you will achieve here.</p>
   <p>"Chicago has a great Jewish community, whose contribution to our industrial and cultural life has been of the greatest importance. Whatever we have built here, has been built with the help of the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>"America, in gratitude to the Divine Providence for the freedom and equality which it enjoys, is always ready to extend help to all oppressed and persecuted people, and to support materially any movement which will lead toward the betterment of humanity. We are proud of your visit, and it gives me great pleasure to extend to you the hospitality and freedom of the city."</p>
