   <p>The long planned "Twenty-One" Committee which was designated to organize the federation, has at last called its first meeting, and after a lengthy discussion it was decided to appoint sub-committees which will soon have their own separate meetings, and later call a large meeting of all subcommittees, to make their combined reports.</p>
   <p>This meeting was considered a success. All members have faithfully promised with their heart and soul their loyalty to the federation in the future, and immediately, also promised to pay their subscription to the charity federation.</p>
   
   <p>The subscribers are indebted to the federation to the amount of $17,000. All that is necessary is to collect this sum and everything will be cleared up as far as finances are concerned for the present.</p>
   <p>Now, in order to carry out the plans of collecting the $17,000, the "Twenty-One" Committee has decided to send out a strong appeal explaining the need to the federation. In the appeal the federation states as follows:</p>
   <p>"We, the 'Twenty-One' Committee, herewith declare our honest convictions. We find that the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities is an absolute necessity in the community, and it must be kept up for it is for the best interests of all Jews concerned."</p>
