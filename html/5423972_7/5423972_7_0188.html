   <p>A short time ago, the Central Committee accepted a recommendation of the Labor Lyceum Committee to send out a referendum to all the branches that each member shall be taxed $2.00 to build a labor lyceum on the Northwest Side. This referendum is now in the branches. To interest the members and show them the necessity for this tax, the Central Committee sent to the branches the following letter: "The City Central Committee of the Workmen's Circle, on the recommendation of the Labor Lyceum Committee has determined to send out a referendum for a $2.00 tax, which may be paid in one lump sum, or within a year, at fifty cents each quarter. This money shall be for a labor lyceum on the Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>"Many members remember that when we bought the W. C. (Workmen's Circle) Lyceum there was a $5.00 tax on every member. The Northwest Side Branch paid that tax with the condition that in the near future we would have a building on the Northwest Side. The City Central Committee made that promise, and the Northwest Side Branches had faith in these promises, and gave their money and made it possible to buy the Douglas Park Auditorium.</p>
   <p>"Now we must start doing something to make our promise good to the Northwest Side Branches. If not for them we would not have been able to buy the <span class="page-break">2</span>Douglas Park Auditorium. The Northwest Branches are our largest branches, and almost a half of our members live in that district.</p>
   <p>"It is the duty of all members of the Workmen's Circle to help build a labor lyceum on the Northwest Side, just as the Northwest-siders helped us on the West Side.</p>
   <p>"For this purpose we have laid aside a sum of $5,000, and with the $200. tax the sum will reach about $20,000. With that amount we can start building or buying a labor lyceum on the Northwest Side. The City Central Committee accepted this $2.00 tax, and they appeal to every member to do likewise, and by so doing we will in the near future celebrate the opening of the second labor-lyceum in Chicago.</p>
   <p>With friendly regards,</p>
   <p>Labor Lyceum Committee,</p>
   <p>M.Bloomenthal, Sec'y."</p>
