   <p>New York, April 14.--A surprise dinner was given this afternoon at the St. Regis Hotel in honor of Chicago's famous philanthropist Julius Rosenwald in recognition for his contribution, last year, of $1,000,000 to the relief fund for Jewish war sufferers.</p>
   <p>All the speakers emphasized the fact that were it not for Mr. Rosenwald's million dollar contribution, it would have been impossible to raise so much money last year for the relief fund. Mr. Rosenwald's generosity prompted American Jewry to contribute its full share.</p>
   <p>The guests presented him with a loving cup, made in England in 1792.</p>
   <p>Jacob H. Schiff was the toast-master. The speakers were: Louis Marshall, Cyrus Sulzberger, Judge Otto Rosalsky and Judge Julian W. Mac.</p>
   <p>The cup was given him in the name of all the relief committees, and it bore the following inscription: "To the patriotic American citizen, devoted Jew and great philanthropist."</p>
   <p>Also present were Mrs. Rosenwald and her children. Among the guests were many noted Jews of New York.</p>
