   <p>The dedication of the Annex of the Home for the Aged is certainly a Jewish celebration in which every Chicago Jew should participate (September 29 &amp; 30, 1912). As we understand it, the committee, who has charge of the affair, sent invitations to all Jews whose addresses were available, but in a city like Chicago, with such a large Jewish population it is impossible to reach every Jew. This, however, should not prevent anyone from attending the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Home for the Aged is not only the first, but the sole, witness of Chicago's Jewish accomplishment. A view on the work of the Aged Home shows what the Russian Jew in Chicago has accomplished.</p>

   <p>The Aged Home is a real Jewish charity home where every inmate is considered a privileged character.</p>
   <p>The basis of the Home for the Aged is not to seek honor for officers and directors, but to pay a social debt to the fathers of society whom time has made old, weak, and inactive.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Jew to visit the Home for the Aged today and tomorrow. It will be fulfilling the commandment, "Respect thy father and Mother."</p>
