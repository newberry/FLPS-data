   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I read in last Sunday's Courier, about a proposition made by the German Yehudim, (reformed Jews), that they will grant several thousand dollars for the up-keep of the Home for the Aged, and the Orphan Home, if these institutions will give up their annual affairs. I think that this proposal should not be accepted. If our reformed Jews are willing to support the institutions they have a purpose in mine, and their purpose is to control and have their way with these institutions. Who can tell what will become of our Homes, which took so much of our effort, to have them established, if they should get control over them.</p>

   <p>I am of the opinion that the Home for the Aged, and Orphan Home should continue running their affairs as formerly. We orthodox Jews shall support them, as much as possible. The Homes were built by us, and they must be supported by us. The leaders of the orthodox Homes should ask every orthodox Jew in Chicago, regarding this matter, and, I am sure, that they will soon convince themselves that none of them would permit the reform Jews to support these institutions. The German Yehudim can give money for the institutions, if they so desire, but the affairs given by these Homes should not be stopped. These affairs are the only assurance that our Homes won't be controlled by our reform Jews.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>An Orthodox Jew.</p>
