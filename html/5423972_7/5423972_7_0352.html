   <p>We think that it is high time for these two institutions to come to their senses and unite. With the united efforts of both they can certainly accomplish more for the best interest of Judaism in Chicago. Each one of these organizations has its virtues and faults. The Shachri Sfas Ever has the virtue of being the oldest. It has passed the quarter century mark and has the cooperation of all the old Hebrew-cultured people of the present generation. It has also the interest at heart of those who have just recently come from Russia. These new-comers are very much enthused and take great pride in finding any thing pertaining to Judaism. But we find fault also in the Shachri Sfas Ever organization. The number of the cultured and other members who are interested is very small, in fact so small that they can accomplish very little for the good of Jewry in Chicago. But the Hebrew Institute is quite different. It is young and has sponsors of wealth and influence and energy with which to accomplish good.</p>
