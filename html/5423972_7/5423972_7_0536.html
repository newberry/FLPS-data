   <p>Let all small and large Jewish groups in Chicago who raise money for building activities in Palestine--let all those who want to help Palestine, redouble their efforts because, very soon, they will have the opportunity of spending their money the way they want to spend it. The Chicago Zionists will conduct the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] campaign this year under the slogan "Build a Chicago colony in Palestine." Every group of Chicago Jews which is interested in the building of Palestine will have plenty to do. It will be able to conduct its entire activity toward a definite purpose: Build a Chicago colony in Palestine. Mrs. Press, the chairwoman of the Volunteers of Zion, tells me that her society has now on hand a large sum of money for Palestine, and that she does not know what to do with the money. Let the volunteers of Zion wait until the plans to build the Chicago colony in Palestine are definitely formulated. They will then <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>know what to do with the money. For the present, let them continue to raise money because large sums of money will be needed later.</p>
