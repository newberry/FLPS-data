   <p>Our article last Sunday about the proposed change in the name of the institution on Taylor Street from Hebrew Institute to Jewish Institute had the desired effect, at least for the present. A committee, which had been formed to consider the question, had been instructed to settle the question to the satisfaction of a majority of the directors who favored a change. This committee, having read the article in the Courier, decided to postpone the consideration of the question until the next annual meeting.</p>
   <p>We repeat our assertion that after so many years of activity under the name of Hebrew Institute, it would be ridiculous to change the name. It is to be hoped that none of the directors will make a fool of himself by bringing up this question again for discussion.</p>

   <p>"Hebrew" or "Jewish"--its all the same. It expresses the same thing, unless they (the directors) want to discontinue some of the activities there and substitute other activities instead. However, we do not see what activities they can discontinue. Under the direction of Mr. Philip Seman, a capable and energetic superintendent, they have classes there in English, painting, manual training, dramatics, typewriting, sewing, cooking, and so on. All of these classes are well conducted and they satisfy a great need of the West Side. What is lacking at the Institute is an active Hebrew school, some sort of a religious center. If this were established, then the name of Hebrew Institute would really be appropriate.</p>
