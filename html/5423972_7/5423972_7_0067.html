   <p>Election of Directors in the Jewish Home for the Aged.</p>
   <p>Our grand Chicago Jewish orthodox Home for the Aged elected its directors yesterday afternoon. A number of prominent Chicago Jews who have repeatedly done all the good work for the Home assembled and selected such men as are energetic and active enough to assure great success for the welfare of this Home for Jewish Aged.</p>
   <p>Mr. Margolis, chairman, opened the meeting with a short address and introduced Mrs. Benjamin Davis, recording secretary, who made her report, in which she related the necessary and important work the administration had done for the Home. She also thanked the different English and Jewish newspapers of Chicago for their cooperation in helping the directors make this Home bloom and give promise of surpassing all other Jewish institutions in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The report was replete with much common sense, which was to be expected from this intelligent lady.</p>
   <p>Also of great importance was the report of Mr. Isidor Siegel, for last year, regarding which, a reporter for the Jewish Courier made the statement sometime ago, that Mr. Isidor Siegel had performed the finest piece of work for the Home, that they had ever seen one person do for any institution. These two reports met with tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baumgarden's report came next. Superintendent Feirlicht then said that the directors can and should be proud of their good work in supervising this Home for the Jewish Aged of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The reports of Mrs. Stone, chairman of the House Committee, and of Mr. Harris Cohen, chairman of the Building Committee, were accepted with great satisfaction.</p>

   <p>Mr. Israel Cohen spoke next, and in a masterly address thanked the public and officers of the Jewish Home for the Aged, for cooperating in the good work. By so doing we have succeeded in creating a name of honor for the Chicago Orthodox Jewish Home for the Aged. In the name of the directors of the institution, he also thanked Mr. Isidor Lasky, former secretary, for his hard work while he was active secretary, and with great pleasure, presented him with a silver loving cup.</p>
   <p>Mr. Margolis spoke then and appealed to the Jewish people of Chicago to help support the institution, for it is in fact, a great and worthy cause. In summing up all reports it was shown that the Home had taken in donations to the amount of $16,793.24, last year, and paid $14,602.05. Cash on hand $92,562.99. The indebtedness of the Home at present is between six and seven thousand dollars. The following directors were elected: A. Margolis, M. Toer, Herman Mies, and B. L. Schlessinger, for the North and North West sections.</p>
