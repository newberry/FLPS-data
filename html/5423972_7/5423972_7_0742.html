   <p>A group of persons, under the name - Jewish Workers Relief Committee, have written letters to all organizations of Chicago, that is labor organizations, to all synagogues, vereins, lodges and etc., wherein they severely attacked the Peoples Relief Committee of America. The members of this so-called committee, in the midst of the Peoples Relief Tool Campaign, have chosen this time for attack. We can not and will not permit those attacks to pass without explanation. We do not answer them, the lampoon writers, neither do we extend them an explanation, because they know the truth, which they so easily deny. We make the explanation to the Jewish public of Chicago, to those who wish no politics in the relief work and to those seeking the truth.</p>
   <p>The Jews of the Relief Committee state that the Peoples Relief is decrepit, the Peoples Relief is very small in membership; they attack the Peoples Relief for its alliance with the Joint Board, whom they call "peoples fiend" and "anti-proletarians." They attack the Peoples Relief for not recognizing the "Yidkeskon," which, as they state, is the only constructive proletarian relief apparatus in Russia.</p>
   
   <p>The very same Jews have shrieked a few weeks ago, that the Peoples Relief in dead. Now it is no longer dead, but they state that it is decrepit. This decrepit Peoples Relief Committee has, for the past year and a half, for cultural work alone, sent to Russia, $300,000 and gathered clothing amounting to$2,000,000. We do not count its work in the Joint Board, which placed itself on a constructive basis through the influence of the Peoples Relief. The Peoples Relief is an organization established by the Jewish working class. That the entire Jewish working class is with the Peoples Relief can be seen by its last convention in Philadelphia. The International Ladies Garment Workers, The Amalgamated Clothing Workers, The Workmen's Circle. The United Hebrew Trades, The International Furriers Union, Joint Board Baker's Union, Jewish National Labor Alliance, Independent Workmen's Circle, Socialist Verband, Poale Zion Party, Theatrical Trade Council and country-men vereins were represented. Without exaggeration, all these organizations represented more than one-half a million Jewish workers. This is the decrepit Peoples Relief.</p>
   
   <p>They sneer at the Peoples Relief by remarking "small in membership!" The Peoples Relief is no Communist organization and did not accept the code of devouring Workers Relief Committee. The Peoples Relief is being attacked by them because it did not accept the Communistic code, and whoever is no Communist is designated as an indifferent citizen and counter-revolutionary.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the entire Jewish working class, together with the representatives of the Ukranian and Lithuanian Alliance have determined, at the convention, to remain with the Joint Board, because they were all convinced that it would be a crime to destroy the relief work now. The Peoples Relief still consists of responsible organizations that did not want to terminate the relief work, which would imperil the lives of millions of Jews in Europe. If the Peoples Relief would abandon the Joint Board now, it would lead to a struggle with the Joint Board and the relief work in America would cease functioning. The Jewish working class did not desire to do this. The "revolutionists," the"left-wing heroes," who compose the Workers Relief Committee, are not concerned with the above mentioned, and they, therefore, attack the Joint Board and pour wrath on the Peoples Relief for remaining with the Joint Board, To attack, in such manner, the Joint Board and the Peoples Relief for clinging to the Joint Board, is demagoguery and charlantanry. They, the "truth-hounds" of the committee know that, but what significance has the truth to a committee adopting the Jesuit motto that "all methods suit the object." If the Joint Board is fiendish and anti-proletarian, why was the Joint Board recognized by the Soviet Government in Russia? If one feels ashamed of the Joint Board, one must feel ashamed of Lenin and Trotsky, who have so warmly accepted it and given it the privilege to work.</p>
   <p>The Peoples Relief Committee was the first to help the Yidgeskom in America. The Peoples Relief Committee had, recently, received a letter from the Yidgeskom in Russia, thanking them for the machines received. Out of $1,640,000 that the Joint Board has now assigned for work in Russia, the representatives of the Peoples Relief demanded that the Yidgeskom schools should receive $200,000 and it was so decided upon. The Peoples Relief supported and will support the institutions of the Yidgeskom, but it can not recognize the Yidgeskom as its sole representative in Russia. The Peoples Relief is not against the Yidgeskom, but it wants to contact all Jewish labor organizations and social enterprises that work for relief in Russia.</p>
   <p>We wanted to explain the matter, as much as possible, and inform the Jewish masses that they should not be misled by persons who seek to destroy the relief work.</p>
