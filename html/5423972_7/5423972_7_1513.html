   <p>Committees from the [Jewish] Relief Office will be present today at all matzoth bakeries and in other places where matzoth are sold in order to see that each package bears a war stamp. The matzoth bakeries have promised to place stamps on all packages.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago are urged not to receive any matzoth into their homes unless the packages have these war stamps. The proceeds go to the Jewish victims of the war. Jewish grocers are also asked not to buy any matzoth without the stamps.</p>
   <p>Today the Permanent Committee will go from door to door for the purpose of raising money for the war -stricken Jews.</p>
