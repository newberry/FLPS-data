   <p>Judgment Day for the Chicago Zionists will soon arrive. Nahum Sokolow and his associates of the Zionist delegation will arrive here on March 14. They do not come here to listen to our songs of praise, nor to be honored by us, but to get money from us for Palestine, to get our quota for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. Our quota is a million dollars a year. In the first six months of the year, we raised fifty thousand dollars, twenty thousand dollars less than Milwaukee, which has a Jewish population of twenty thousand.</p>
   <p>If the Chicago Jews understand figures, they should bow their heads in shame and humilation at such a manifestation of Jewish heartlessness and thoughtlessness. They have no excuse whatsoever for such a sad display of <span class="page-break">2</span>of niggardliness at a time when every Jew who has a spark of Judaism in his soul, must give as much as he can for Palestine. Small Jewish communities in America, which are villages compared to Chicago, have, during the last six months, given more for the Keren Hayesod than the great Jewish Chicago, with its four hundred thousand Jews. Poor Jewish communities in America have given more for the Keren Hayesod than Chicago, the richest Jewish community in America. Small local organizations have raised more money during the last six months than the Keren Hayesod has raised in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Zionists all over America laugh at Chicago. They think, and justly so, that Chicago is an abandoned city, that the Chicago Zionists are either not Zionists, or else they are great misers.</p>
   <p>Up to now the Chicago Zionists have given a thousand excuses: in the summer it was hot and nothing could be done; in the winter it was cold <span class="page-break">3</span>and nothing could be done; then came the great relief drive, and again nothing could be done; there were not enough workers and the few workers who were doing something were overworked, and, therefore, did very little for the Keren Hayesod, and so on. One might say that in other cities of America it is hot in the summer and cold in the winter, that in other cities of America, relief drives take place, that in other cities of America, there are not too many workers but, just the same, every city in America has fulfilled its duty to the Keren Hayesod, and Chicago has not.</p>
   <p>The members of the Zionist delegation will soon arrive in Chicago and their arrival will herald a Judgment Day for the Chicago Zionists. The Chicago Zionists do not have any more excuses. New York has sent in organizers and will send in more help if it is necessary. The other excuses will not serve now. It is neither too hot nor too cold. The Keren Hayesod committee has now been reorganized. A Keren Hayesod office with an office director, with a staff of stenographers and secretaries, <span class="page-break">4</span>now exists. The entire machinery of the organization is now functioning. The success of the Keren Hayesod work in Chicago now depends upon the devotion and sincerity of the Chicago Zionists.</p>
   <p>There are several thousand ardent Zionists in Chicago, and thousands of well-to-do Jews who sympathize with Zionism and who are willing to make sacrifices for Zionism.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Zionists are not poor people. They belong to the middle classes; many of them are well-to-do. If every Chicago Zionist would give, on the average, one hundred dollars for the Keren Hayesod, and everyone who sympathized with Zionism would give, on the average, fifty dollars for the Keren Hayesod, then the administrative committee of the Keren Hayesod would be in a position to give Nahum Sokolow a check for several hundred thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod. The question is whether every Chicago Zionist is ready to do his duty: to contribute his <span class="page-break">5</span>own share and to get contributions from others who are willing to give if someone will go to them, and explain the importance of this campaign.</p>
   <p>We are very optimistic about the possibilities of work for the Keren Hayesod in Chicago. We know that the Chicago Jews are willing to give and that they are generous. They proved their generosity a few weeks ago when they answered the appeal of our relief workers and gave more than they were asked to give. Chicago is known all over the world as the greatest Jewish philanthropic center. Therefore, one cannot say that the failure of the Keren Hayesod up to now in Chicago is due to the niggardliness of the Chicago Jews. The failure is a result of the lack of energy of the Chicago Zionists. It is not the fault of the Chicago Jews, in general, but of the Chicago Zionists, and particularly of the Chicago Zionist leaders, that all over America they are laughing at the niggardliness of Chicago. The leaders themselves did not set a good example of their seriousness and devotion to the Keren Hayesod. If <span class="page-break">6</span>the Chicago Keren Hayesod leaders gave thousands of dollars for relief, and hundreds of dollars for the Keren Hayesod, how could they expect the masses to contribute wholeheartedly?</p>
   <p>We know that this is a weighty and serious accusation to make but we make it because we know that it is well founded. We defy anyone to give us the names of a dozen Chicago Zionist leaders who have, up to now, done their duty to the Keren Hayesod and given as much as they could and should have given, considering their financial means and their social positions.</p>
   <p>There is an old rule: people who do not do their duty cannot cause others to do their duty and their voice is like a voice crying in the wilderness.</p>
   <p>The Zionist leaders in Chicago will not be able to make a successful appeal for the Keren Hayesod as long as they, themselves, do not discharge <span class="page-break">7</span>their duties and obligations in full.</p>
   <p>March 14 will be Judgment Day for the Chicago Zionists. On that day they will have to give an accounting of their work for the Keren Hayesod and let us hope that the verdict will be "not guilty".</p>
