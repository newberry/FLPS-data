   <p>Chevra Hachosas Orchim (Sheltering Home).</p>
   <p>The last meeting of the Society "Hachosas Orchim" concluded with many thanks to Mr. Louis Fink, former secretary of Congregation "Ohel Jacob" for his good deed in sending fresh fish every week to the Society. This charitable deed affords us a great savings in the expenditures of the Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Fink was appointed State's Game and Fish Warden, by Governor Chas. S. Deneen of Illinois, and every since then, Mr. Fink was in position to furnish fresh fish to the Society, free of charge. Therefore all the officers and directors take great pleasure in thanking Mr. Fink for his generosity and wish him success in his office and all his other undertakings.</p>
   <p>Israel Wolfshon, President, Herman Iglovitz, Vice-President, and Jacob Levy, Secretary.</p>
