   <p>The struggle for system and order in our public institutions and social activities is beginning to show results. And formally we have attained that for which we have strived: that individuals and organizations give an account of the monies which they have collected. The first to comply with our demand to give the public an account of the monies collected during the past six years, was a group of Jewish synagogue representatives of the West Side, who signed the report of the committee for the Slobodka Yeshivah [A Theological Seminary in a small town in Lithuania]. For six years money has been collected for this Yeshivah, but an accounting was never given to the public as to how much had been collected. After a long and bitter struggle on our part we prevailed, that Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, who is responsible for the collection, should come out with some sort of a statement. This is somewhat of a victory for the contributing public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The accounting was submitted, and we hope that, from now on, reports will be submitted regularly. But this report is not all it should be, for some of the items are not according to fact. We shall give an illustration of a few of the particulars in this report.</p>
   <p>The report begins with an absolute untruth: "At the request of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Rabbi of the Keneseth Israel Synagogue, we, the undersigned", etc. Our readers know that not Rabbi Epstein but the Courier demanded an accounting in the name of the public; that before the Courier made that demand, Rabbi Epstein had not issued any report during the entire six years. Those, who signed the report know that it was only after the demand of the Courier that they investigated the situation and delivered a report. But a report about religious activity, signed by religious representatives must not begin with an untruth, and the report of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein does so begin.</p>
   <p>As to the report itself, we have the following to relate at present: For the <span class="page-break">3</span>last six years--so states the report--the sum of over twenty thousand dollars has been collected, including the sum of over six thousand dollars contributed by Chicago, and given to Rabbi Epstein for the Slobodka Yeshivah. In the provinces $14,717 was collected.</p>
   <p>As no one received a commission for the money sent direct to Rabbi Epstein, and as no commission was paid for the large sums contributed by the synagogues, the expenses, in the greater part, fall upon the sum collected in the provinces. According to the report $14,717 were collected in the provinces, and the cost of collecting this sum amounted to over $8,000. We think that any further comment upon these figures is superfluous; for every dollar collected in the provinces during the last six years for the Slobodka Yeshivah, sixty cents went for expenses.</p>
   <p>The report further states that not so long ago a sum of over four thousand dollars was forwarded to Slobodka, and as soon as they hear that the four <span class="page-break">4</span>thousand dollars arrived, another thousand dollars will be sent. The question then arises: if they are not sure that the money will reach its destination, then why didn't they send the smaller sum first?</p>
   <p>The report further confirms our assertion, that until last Tishri [month in the Hebrew calendar] there was no Yeshivah in Slobodka. The report states, that during the time of the War until last Tishri, the Slobodka Yeshivah was located in Krementchug and in Minsk [cities in Russia]. Apparently, everybody knows, that during the War, Russia and Ukraina drafted all young men from seventeen to forty years of age, and made no exception of Jews. It is true--which the report states, that the Yeshivah in Slobodka exists again since Tishri, and this we have also asserted.</p>
   <p>The report does not indicate, where the money was all this time; who kept the money, in whose name it was deposited, or to whom it was sent; how much and when to Slobodka, how much and when to Minsk, how much and when to Krementchug. The report also conceals the fact that the leader of the Slobodka Yeshivah is a <span class="page-break">5</span>brother of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The main thing is that every report should have itemized bills. This report has not. It does not specify from whom the money was collected, when it was collected, by whom it was collected, who was in control, who has the slips, who has the receipts, who made the entries, etc. All this--the most essential of the report, is lacking; it states only how much money was received and how much was disbursed. On the other hand, the report quotes items which were printed in newspapers several years ago about the Slobodka Yeshivah. We learn for the first time that a financial report should be filled with newspaper quotations, which have no connection in that respect. The report of collections made here for the Slobodka Yeshivah is no report at all, but an unsuccessful defence, upon which the committee of nine should not have placed its signature.</p>
   <p>This unsuccessful defence only proves how right we were in our demand for an accounting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The public is more than ever before entitled to a detailed and clear report.</p>
