   <p>A few days ago, announcements were made in the press that the Peoples' Relief Committee of Chicago was undertaking to organize a bazaar for the purpose of raising money to bring to America fifty thousand Jewish orphans from the Ukraine. The innocent reader will probably imagine that the bazaar will bring in at least two million dollars because how else would it be possible to transport fifty thousand orphans? Furthermore, the reader will doubtless think that the Peoples' Relief Committee of Chicago has received a permit from the government to bring fifty thousand orphans from the Ukraine to the United States, and that at least the Chicago Jews, if not the whole of American Jewry, have entrusted the local Peoples' Relief Committee with this great and noble task. The innocent reader may also believe that it is possible to send a commission to the Ukraine to "collect" the orphans and to "pack" them into trains, and send them C. O. D. to the Peoples' Relief Committee, Chicago, care of Dr. Hyman Cohn.</p>
   <p>But what is the truth of the matter? The sponsors of the bazaar hope to net twenty-five thousand dollars, if everything runs smoothly. In order to net twenty-five thousand dollars, however, it is necessary first to spend between ten and fifteen thousand dollars [for expenses], which means that, at best, the profit will not exceed fifteen thousand dollars. Of course, this assumption is correct only if the bazaar is a success.</p>
   <p>But suppose the bazaar is not a success. Suppose the weather is bad and people are unable to attend. Or let us suppose that the bazaar is poorly managed. In that event, it is possible that there may be a loss of between fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. The Congregation Atereth Israel knowing that this questionable undertaking may be a failure, hastened to invest thirteen hundred dollars of relief money in the bazaar--money belonging to widows and orphans in Poland......</p>
   <p>The American government has not yet issued a permit allowing the immigration of over fifty thousand orphans from the Ukraine because no organization is as yet prepared to undertake this task. The matter has not yet been brought to the attention of the government, and should the latter issue a permit, it will not issue it to the Peoples' Relief Committee of Chicago, but to the Joint Distribution Committee of New York.</p>
   <p>Even if the Joint Distribution Committee had fifty million dollars in cash, it would still be impossible to bring over fifty thousand orphans from the Ukraine because the Ukraine is in a state of chaos. It is impossible to reach the Ukrainian Jews, and when contact with them is established, the Joint Distribution Committee of New York will not depend upon a bazaar organized by a small relief organization in Chicago, but will undertake the task itself. The Peoples' Relief Committee of Chicago will have no more to do with the orphans than will any other relief committee.</p>
   <p>The Peoples' Relief Committee of Chicago does not really intend to bring fifty thousand orphans from the Ukraine over here, nor has it permission to do so. It is not the organization to undertake such a gigantic task. why, therefore, are the leaders of the organization attempting such a bluff? Why are they trying to throw sand in the public eye?</p>
   <p>Mr. [E.] Greenebaum, Mr. [J.] Rosenwald, Mr. [C.] Rubins, and other well-known representatives of Jewish relief work in Chicago realized that the enterprise was a bluff and repudiated it. The whole thing smells strongly of petty and biased politics. Now the pseudosocialist chauvinists cry at the top of their voices: "The capitalists are immoral!" They rave that the Courier is against relief because the Courier published an official letter, which Mr. Greenebaum had sent not only to the Courier, but to all the newspapers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum sent his letter to all the newspapers in Chicago because he wanted to prevent the general public from being bluffed by a few pseudosocialist chauvinists who take advantage of honest workers, men and women, and mix politics with relief work.</p>
   <p>A bazaar is a fine undertaking when its purpose is to raise several thousand dollars for relief. I would be the first to support such a bazaar, but I will not support one which is mixed up with bluffing and politics--[particularly] on the eve of the great relief-campaign in Chicago...</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum deserves the thanks of all the Chicago Jews because he tore the mask off those pseudosocialist charlatans who say that they represent honest men and women workers of Chicago. They will now curse me, I suppose.</p>
