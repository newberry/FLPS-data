   <p>I entreat you, synagogue Jews, lodge Jews, rich Jews, poor Jews, educated and ignorant Jews, ordinary Jews, prominent Jews--I implore you by everything that is sacred to you and to me, pay up your Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] pledges. On the last day of Passover, you made your pledges at the synagogue--pay up your pledges like gentlemen.</p>
   <p>The Haluzim cannot wait until you wake up and remember that once upon a time you made a pledge for Palestine. Palestine cannot wait. It must be active and the sooner you pay up your Keren Hayesod pledges, the better it will be. If you do not send in your check, they will come to your and they will take not only your check, but will also take up your time. Therefore, write out your check, and sent it to Mr. S. Phillipson, treasurer of the Keren Hayesod in Chicago, or to the Keren Hayesod office in Chicago, 118 <span class="page-break">\2</span>North La Salle Street. Please, hurry up.</p>
