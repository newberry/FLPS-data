   <p>The dedication of two new buildings at Camp Wooster, maintained by the Young Men's Jewish Charities for underprivileged boys, will take place next Sunday. The camp is located on Lake Wooster, near Round Lake, Illinois.</p>
   <p>One of the new buildings is the William D. Stein Hospital, the gift of Mrs. William D. Stein and Philip Stein. It is a six-room structure with an emergency operating room, laboratory, and bedrooms. Two doctors are assigned to the hospital during the summer camp period.</p>
   <p>The second building to be opened is the Nature Cabin, an anonymous gift. This building is made of rough hewn logs and is furnished with rustic tables and chairs made by the boys in the camp wood shop. It is devoted to exhibitions of nature studies.</p>
   <p>The camp accommodates 225 boys at a time. Because of the demand for accommodations, this year, 1,250 boys will be given vacations instead of the usual 1,000 taken care of in past years.</p>
