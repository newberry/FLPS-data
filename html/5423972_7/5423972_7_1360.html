   <p>Two years ago the Peoples Relief Committee succeeded in having thousands of Jews pay nickels and dimes every week towards the fund for war sufferers, and the volunteer army of the Peoples Relief, would collect these donations every Sunday. Week after week, they kept asking the thousands of Jews to do this holy duty of giving relief for their brothers and sisters in the war countries.</p>
   <p>When peace was declared, new and greater opportunities were opened to send relief in larger sums.</p>
   <p>Now a million dollars is needed every month. New methods must be used to find ways and means to raise such a sum. Through the many organizations, the Peoples Relief is able to tax each union worker a day's pay.</p>
