   <p>The organization of Jewish girls on the South Side which was recently organized with the object of securing homes for the friendless working girls, are happy to inform the Jewish public of Chicago that they have had wonderful success in their work. They found good homes and secured jobs of various kinds for a number of unfortunate friendless girls. Miss Jennie Mandel is at the head of the organization. She is planning to build a special home soon for these girls.</p>
