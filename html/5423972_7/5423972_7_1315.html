   <p>At a meeting yesterday of the Joint Relief Committee in its offices at 720 W. Twelfth Street, under the leadership of Mr. Isadore Liederman, it was decided that on Sunday, July 13, a conference should be held of all relief workers and representatives of synagogues, lodges, organizations and landsmen societies in and around Chicago, to hear an important report from one who personally saw the Jewish misery in Poland, Lithuania and Galicia. Also to formulate plans for further relief activities for the unfortunate.</p>
   <p>It was decided too, that the Relief Conference, Sunday, July 13, should be held in the gymnasium of the Hebrew Institute which will be large enough to seat the delegates. Mr. Julius Savitzky, manager of the Relief Office, is already busily engaged in sending invitations to various officials.</p>
   <p>The conference will be addressed by well-known speakers, and most important of all, will hear a report from Mr. B. Horvitch, president of the Joint Relief Committee who will then be in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. B. Horvitch, as a representative of the Central Relief Committee will describe the regions where unfortunate Jews number in the hundreds of thousands. He personally saw their misery, heard their sighs and cries for help.</p>
   <p>Let all Jewish organizations who receive these invitations, as well as those who through some error or oversight do not receive them, elect delegates to attend the Conference.</p>
