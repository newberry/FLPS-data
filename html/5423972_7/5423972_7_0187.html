   <p>Many curious things happen in this world. In Chicago there existed for a number of years a Jewish Culture League, which was neither Jewish, nor cultural, nor a league; it was an organization run by our pseudosocialists. The Jewish Culture League existed quietly for a number of years, until recently it breathed its last. On the grave of the Culture League, there has arisen a new organization, a chatter house, which has become the cultural fortress of our pseudosocialists. However, our pseudosocialists have had bad luck with their new organization because idle chatter is not culture. Our pseudosocialists culture enthusiasts have decided that they need a few billiard tables to entice the people to visit their Culture Center. The Culture Center has thus become an ordinary poolroom. Our pseudosocialists hope to convert the youth to culture via the pool tables, and yet people say that there are not enough fakers in this world.</p>
