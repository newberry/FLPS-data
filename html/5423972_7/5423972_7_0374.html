   <p>The first attempt of the "Drive" in Chicago for the new home of the Hebrew Immigrant and Aid Society was made at a poor time, during the hot days when the people were dispersed through the country resorts. The "Drive", therefore, was postponed until the present (autumn) and now, we understand, a new "Drive" is being organized.</p>
