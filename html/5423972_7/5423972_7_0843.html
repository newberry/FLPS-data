   <p>It was a happy inspiration on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Schweitzer to associate the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of the World Zionist Organization] work with the idea of a sacrifice and to introduce the "sacrifice bond," a bond that sells for from twenty-five to a thousand dollars. The sacrifice bond is as good as a government bond that pays interest, and the principal is guaranteed. A sacrifice bond is what its name implies. The buyer of the bond offers the principal and the interest to the Jewish people, to the Jewish land, to the Keren Hayesod. When a Jewish woman buys a bond, she knows that she has sacrificed something for Palestine. Though it is a sacrifice of money only, and not of time or energy, it is a sacrifice just the same. When the Jewish woman looks at the bond, she will feel a certain satisfaction at having made a sacrifice.</p>
   <p>When a Jewish woman gives something to the Keren Hayesod she feels as if she has unburdened herself, and she forgets about it the next day, and does not think any more about the Keren Hayesod. However, when she buys a sacrifice bond, she has an entirely different feeling. She has the exalted feeling of having made a sacrifice, and the possession of sacrifice bonds--receipts for sacrifices--ties her forever to the Keren Hayesod and awakens her interest in the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Jewish women of Chicago will buy the sacrifice bonds of the Keren Hayesod--for the Keren Hayesod. Chicago has not distinguished itself of thus far in its Keren Hayesod work. Let Chicago at least have the credit of being the first great Jewish city in America to purchase the sacrifice bonds of the Keren Hayesod. Let the Jewish women of Chicago prove that they can make sacrifices, and that by making a sacrifice for Palestine, they express their interest in Palestine.</p>
