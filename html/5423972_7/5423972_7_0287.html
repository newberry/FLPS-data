   <p>In course of reviewing the work of the various committees preparatory to compiling this Summary, unwittingly came to me the forcefulness of the words, "That life is long which answers lifes great ends" and therein found my answer as to why the institute is today a big, live pulsating factor in the Jewish community of Chicago irrespective of class or Section as is no other organization - because at last its house is in order, well ornamented by its work.</p>
   <p>It has finally emerged and left doubt and chaos far behind - too distant ever to retrace its path: the institute is in truth beginning to meet lifes ends. In the past years that it has been my privilege to serve you, it was not difficult to bring to you a personal message, for in spite of all that had been accomplished we were still dreaming and planning - but now it is a reality and despite our poets and philosophers not a stern reality either, but a generous reward for the full energy that was thrown into the strife; and the facts and figures to follow stand out in such bold relief as evidence of our usefulness, as to eliminate any need for further emphasis. Truly it is said figures speak louder than words: At the last annual meeting held May 21st,1911, the following directors were elected to serve <span class="page-break">2</span>for a term of three years. - Messrs.
