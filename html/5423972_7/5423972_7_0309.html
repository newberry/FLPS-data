   <p>The Work of the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute lately began to participate with great enthusiasm in Jewish life and activities. Jewish cultural undertakings are here to stay and continue growing. At last the Jewish public is assured that this institution will be conducted in the most proper manner from now on. The new blood, and the magnetism of the Jewish energetic activities, will naturally draw our Jews together from all sides. The present superintendent, Dr. Pidot, seems to understand his duties to the Hebrew Institute. He realizes that this Institute is a spiritual center, not only for immigrants, but for American born as well. The main object of the Hebrew Institute is to Americanize and teach good citizenship to all. Dr. Pidot started this season with many interesting undertakings.</p>
   <p>The lectures on Political Economy, Sociology, Science, Literature and Knowledge are vitally important for our Jewish communities in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The Dancing Schools of the Hebrew Institute no doubt will help to drive the public dance halls out of their immoral business. The Civic Bureau is to teach the immigrant the means and importance of becoming a good citizen. The Institute Orchestra will be composed of Jewish children who are talented in the art of music. This should serve to empty the pool halls of our Jewish youth. The orchestra, as well as all the other activities of the Institute are planned with the main object of making this Hebrew institution a spiritual home for all Jews, immigrants and American-born alike. The spiritual work of the Hebrew Institute, which is in fact the home of the united Jewish Educational Alliance, is being conducted by Dr. Joseph Pidot and Dr. Morris Levin.</p>
