   <p>A number of prominent Jewish rabbis, business, and professional men met at the Bismark Hotel yesterday and formulated plans to raise a large sum of money to be forwarded to Russia to aid the injured and persecuted Jews. It was decided to appoint a central committee with sub-committees to solicit contributions toward a great relief fund to be sent to Jacob Schiff of New York and thence to the afflicted Hebrews in the czar's land.</p>
   <p>Adolph Kraus acted as chairman and Dr. Joseph Stolz as secretary. It was arranged to hold a larger meeting at the Standard Club, Michigan Avenue and Twenty-fourth Street, the largest and most exclusive Jewish club in this city, next Saturday at 4 o'clock, when the men who will serve on the central and sub-committees will be appointed.</p>
   <p>Fifty thousand dollars has already been sent from London to Russia and an equal sum from New York through Jacob Schiff and it is confidently expected that the Jewish people of Chicago will soon secure a large subscription.</p>

   <p>Sigmund Neiderberger of the Lakeside club has practically concluded arrangements for the use of the Illinois Theater for an immense matinee benefit. He has interested Sam Bernard, the Schuberts, and a number of prominent Jewish actors now in the city and it is expected that the matinee will be given either this or next week.</p>
