   <p>The four hundred and nineteen poor Jewish families who need mazoth and other things for Passover, were taken care of last night at the first meeting of the Ma-oth Hitim Committee [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy], held as the Winchester Avenue Talmud Torah. The Committee distributed fourteen thousand sixty pounds of mazoth, two thousand two hundred fifty pounds of meat, and eight hundred seventy-three dollars in cash.</p>
   <p>This year, the number of poor families is very large and they all have to be taken care of for Passover. This cannot be done on the money which the Ma-oth Hitim committee has received up to now. Representatives of the synagogues and prominent citizens are urgently asked to take this into consideration and to contribute so that the committee can go on with its hoble and necessary work.</p>
