   <p>The newly founded Protective League reports excellent results. Jewish peddlers who were constantly subjected to attacks of rowdyism, may now seek protection from the recently founded Chicago Protective League, the members of which met last evening to elect its officials and thus become a permanent organization. The result of the election is as follows: Hyman Goldberg, president; Henry Weissenbach, vice-president; Jacob Gartenstein, secretary; Morris Israelstram, secretary of finances; Rabbi S. N. Delnard, treasurer. The propaganda committee includes the following members: Michael M. Levenson, J. Landman, Bernhard H. Bloomenthal, Miss Jane Addams, Jacob E. Michalson, Abraham Cohen, Mrs. J. Callner, and Henry Weissenbach. Last night's meeting was held in the Synagogue at West 14th and Johnson Streets. Mr. Henry Weissenbach, the former Assistant State's Attorney, chairman of the meeting, advised that the young organization has recorded splendid success, and that complaints have sharply decreased. He also announced that he will begin proceedings against the rowdies who assaulted peddler B. Ginsberg, whose injuries were numerous.</p>
