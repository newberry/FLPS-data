   <p>Every Jew, is anxious, at present, to hear a true report from his old home, a report which will in detail describe the life, the suffering, and the hopes of the starving Jews in Poland, Lithuania, Ukrainia, and Roumania.</p>
   <p>Sholem Asch is certainly able to fulfill this need. He, the great observer of life, has seen things that a simple onlooker would miss.</p>
   <p>If you wish to hear this report.....You must secure tickets for the mass meeting given by the People's Relief, Saturday, July 19 in the Empire Theater.....</p>
   <p>Sunday morning, July 20, Asch will address the People's Relief Conference to be held in the West Side Auditorium.</p>
