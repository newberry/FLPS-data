   <p>About three hundred of the most prominent and richest Jews in Chicago were present last night as guests at a banquet given at the Blackstone Hotel by Mr. Julius Rosenwald in connection with the fourteen-million dollar drive for war-relief.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, chairman of the committee in charge of the Chicago drive, presided. The speakers were Mr. David A. Brown of Detroit and Mr. Louis Marshall of New York. Their speeches dealing with the necessity of making the relief drive a success produced the desired effect. Mr. Rosenwald announced that, in reply to his questions, many of his friends had expressed themselves as being ready to give to this drive just as much as they gave to the last drive, and more. As for himself, he repeated his promise to give ten per cent of the total amount that would be collected in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. Loeb took this announcement into consideration and declared that he was raising Chicago's quota of the fourteen-million dollar drive from one and one-half million dollars to two million dollars. His announcement was greeted with tumultuous applause.</p>
   <p>A mass meeting in Sinai Temple next Sunday night will formally open the drive. Large contributions are expected there, according to the statement of General Abel Davis.</p>
   <p>Encouraging telegrams from Judge Rozalsky, Nathan Strauss and Felix Warburg were received and read to the public at the banquet last night.</p>
