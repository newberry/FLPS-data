   <p>Mr. B. J. Broinstein, former president of the Brotherhood of Rumanian Jews in Chicago, has received a letter from the American Minister in Bucharest, Charles J. Vopicka, in which he says that if anyone desires to send money to people in Rumania, it may be done by sending him a draft via post without negotiations through any bank in Chicago or New York. The Minister will then pay out this money to the persons designated, and later he will cash the drafts.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vopicka adds that he has received hundreds of thousands of francs from the Joint Distribution Committee of New York, which were delivered to the "Brotherhood of Native-Born Jews in Rumania." Continuing, he states that conditions in Rumania are improving, but that if America had not sent food, and especially flour, these conditions would have been worse. Mr. Vopicka will be in America shortly. He will come on a two-month vacation.</p>
   <p>A general meeting of special importance to the Rumanian Brotherhood in Chicago will be held next Sunday afternoon in the Douglas Park Auditorium.</p>
