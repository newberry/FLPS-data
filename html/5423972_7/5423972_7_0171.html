   <p>At noon, June 10, 1926, the Corner Stone of the Lawndale District Branch of the Institute was formally laid in the presence of a group of friends of the Institute and a goodly number of the local community. The exercises consisted of a prayer by Rabbi Saul Silber, and two short and very fitting addresses by Mr. James Davis, Chairman of the Building Committee, and Mr Jacob M. Loeb, the president of the Institution.</p>
   <p>Those officiating at the ceremony at the time when Mr. Loeb applied the first trowel of Mortar were:- Messrs. James Davis, Julius Rosenwald, Samuel Philipson, Charles Shaffner, Theodore Regensteiner, and Philip L. Seman.</p>
   <p>These exercises indicated the fact that the building from now on will make normal progress, and that we may look forward to the dedication of the building and its final completion on or about May 1, 1927, if no unforeseen difficulties present themselves.</p>
