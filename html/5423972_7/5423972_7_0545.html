   <p>A few days ago, we discussed the remarkable fact that two well-known leaders of American Jewry, Mr. Louis Marshall and Judge Julian W. Mack, had received a cold welcome in Chicago. Both came to the Chicago Jews with an important message. Both made a warm appeal in behalf of two important movements, but the Chicago Jews did not respond to their appeal. The Chicago Jews have great respect for Louis Marshall and for Judge Mack. The Chicago Jews have the utmost confidence in these two men, but, just the same, the Chicago Jews did not respond when these men came to Chicago to appeal for the support of movements which are very dear to them.</p>
   <p>We cannot say that the blame lies with the organizers of the meeting at which Mr. Marshall and Judge Mack spoke. The men who organized those meetings are serious men, who are entirely devoted to the ideal which they represent. Nor can we say that the Chicago Jews, who are known all over the world for their philanthropy, suddenly became misers. Every week, small groups of Jews in Chicago raise large sums of money for Jewish community purposes. The Chicago Jews give, in answer to an appeal, and there is no reason to assume that they have suddenly become misers. Why, then, did they not respond to the appeals of these two great and influential leaders? We are able to give and we will give a clear answer to this question, although we know that many people will not agree with us.</p>
   <p>The masses, rather than the classes, are the driving force of Jewish life in America, and the masses have their own conception of Jewish movements, Jewish tasks, and Jewish duties. Mr. Louis Marshall came to Chicago to appeal for support of the million-dollar fund of the Jewish Theological Seminary, an institution which serves the spiritual and religious interests of a certain class of Jews in America, but does not serve the spiritual and religious interests of the masses. The masses did not respond because they are not interested, because the movement Mr. Marshall represents, does not have their sympathy. More money can be raised, if needed, at a meeting of the board of directors of a West Side Talmud Torah than Mr. Marshall raised for the Theological Seminary, from a group of two hundred wealthy Jews at a banquet at the Covenant Club. If Mr. Marshall had come to Chicago to appeal for a Talmud Torah fund, he would have received a hundred thousand dollars. If he had come to Chicago to appeal for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], he would have received two hundred thousand dollars. He received only a few thousand dollars because he made an appeal in behalf of something in which the masses are not interested. Had the people who organized the meeting and banquet for Mr. Marshall known something of Jewish mass psychology, had they known that the classes give only when the masses give, they would not have troubled Mr. Marshall to come to Chicago and they would not have organized the banquet.</p>
   <p>We can say the same thing about Judge Mack. Jews are either Zionists, sympathetic to Zionism, or they are not. The Jews who are sympathetic to Zionism give money to the Keren Hayesod and the Jews who are not sympathetic to Zionism, will not give money for Palestine even if the appeal is made by the Palestine Development Society, which promises them a return of their capital plus interest on their investment. The Jew who is interested in Palestine because he is sympathetic to Zionism, gives money to the Keren Hayesod and does not expect to receive any interest, while the Jew who is not interested in Palestine, will not be made into a lover of Zion by a promise that he will receive interest on his investment in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Many Orthodox rabbis who do not receive one-third of the salaries the Reform rabbis get, gave relatively large sums for Palestine, during the last Keren Hayesod campaign in Chicago. The largest sum given by a Reform rabbi was thirty dollars, when Judge Mack made his appeal for investments in Palestine. This situation is characteristic.</p>
   <p>Had Judge Mack come to Chicago to make an appeal for the Keren Hayesod, he would have raised two hundred thousand dollars, although the Keren Hayesod does not promise anyone dividends. He received very little because he came to appeal for a movement with which the masses are not in sympathy.</p>
   <p>The Jewish leaders of Chicago will know what they have to do in the future.</p>
