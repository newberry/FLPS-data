   <p>All Chicago relief committees for war sufferers such as the West Side Auxiliary,the North West Side, the South Side, and the People's Relief Conference, have united under one executive committee. All work in raising funds for the relief of the war-stricken Jews will be done through one office.</p>
   <p>To the general executive committee, which consists of forty-seven members, fifteen members of the executive committee of the People's Relief Conference, were added. Committees are being reorganized to the extent that in every one of them the new executive members will have proportional representation only. The first task of the united committee will be the organizing of a Purim festival for the war-stricken Jews. Purim presents from the Chicago Jews will be sent to the Jewish sufferers in the war-stricken countries. Five hundred committees are appointed for the Purim presents deliveries, and one day's wages from every Chicago Jew is to be donated, as a Purim present, to the Jewish war sufferers in the war countries of Europe.</p>
