   <p>My dear Mr. Rosenblatt:</p>
   <p>I have just had the opportunity of looking over a detailed report of the campaign in Chicago and to say that I am pleased with the part played by the Central Relief Committee, would be putting it lightly.</p>
   <p>If you will remember, at the Chicago conference, a few moments after I had been commanded to take on this work, I stated that it would be absolutely essential that the three money raising organizations be united, and that immediately upon my going to New York, I would take the matter up and have them joined as one great organization to do this massive piece of work. In <span class="page-break">2</span>this I was backed by you, and believe that your voice was as helpful as any other, if not more so, in bringing about the fine spirit of co-operation that exists at present.</p>
   <p>The first results of our joint efforts is evinced by what Chicago did, and to you and the members of your organization are due the thanks of the Jews of this country for the splendid and fine manner in which you entered into the Chicago Campaign. The example set by you will be emulated, I am sure, by every other committee throughout the country, which will result in a very large sum of money.</p>
   <p>I wish to thank you personally, and through you, the members of your committee.</p>
   <p>With kindest personal regards, I remain,</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>(Signed) David A. Brown</p>
   <p>Chairman, National Appeal.</p>
