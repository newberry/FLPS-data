   <p>At a meeting of the Joint Relief Committee in their offices in the Schiff Building, a meeting presided over by Mr. B. Horwich, the problem of sending a ship laden with food and clothing for our war victims was discussed. Jewish butchers in Chicago are prepared to contribute their share of meat, reported the committee of butchers. Mr. Yampolski, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Itzcovitch. After a lengthy discussion of the separate relief movements in Chicago, the matter was finally turned over to a subcommittee.</p>
   <p>The question of collecting clothing and underwear to be sent on the ship and distributed among war victims was also given to a subcommittee which is to begin work at once.</p>
   <p>The presence of Mr. Horwich acted as a great incentive which enlivened the meeting.</p>
