   <p>Today, Chicago Jewry has the honor to greet a distinguished guest, the Zionist leader, Dr. Chaim Weizmann. Our eager, enthusiastic "hand shakers," who will hasten, with throbbing hearts, to the La Salle Street depot this morning to greet personally the leader of the nationalist Jews, should realize that after today's first "hand shake" with the guest, they should use the same hand on Sunday, Monday, and during the entire week for another purpose, which is far more important than a "hand shake". They should put their hands into their pockets and pull out a generous contribution for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of Zionist World Organization].</p>
   <p>That sort of gesture will be of most benefit to the ideal which Dr. Weizmann represents, and will bring honor to Chicago with the sort of generosity of <span class="page-break">2</span>which only the Jewish heart is capable.</p>
   <p>Let our "hand shake" today with Dr. Weizmann be a pledge that on Sunday evening, in the Auditorium, and Monday evening, at the La Salle Hotel, this same Jewish hand will give a substantial check for the Keren Hayesod.</p>
