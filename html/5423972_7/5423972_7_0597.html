   <p>Jewish sentiment in Chicago is determined by the community on the West Side. Most of the Jews live there and most of the institutions and synagogues of the Orthodox Jews are found there. In all matters pertaining to Judaism, the official word comes from the West Side. The smaller Jewish communities on the North Side, on the Northwest Side, and on the South Side take cognizance of what our West Siders say and co-operate in every field of Jewish endeavor for the benefit of the Orthodox Jews in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, welcome the branch of the Jewish peoples Institute on the West Side, and the hospital, both of which are going to be established there. We hail the supporters of that plan, and are willing to give full support to the drive to raise the necessary funds for the erection of these institutions.</p>
   <p>Our so-called German Jews have already gone on record as sympathizing with the <span class="page-break">\2</span>enterprises of the Orthodox Jews. At the time of the merger of the two charity organizations, [Associated Jewish Charities and Federation of Jewish Charities], the German-Jewish element agreed to help maintain the Talmud Torahs and theological seminaries. Their present action, particularly the one in support of a kosher hospital, is additional evidence that they stand for a united Jewish community, despite the fact that they pray from a Reform prayer book, or that they do not pray at all.</p>
   <p>Judge Harry M. Fisher says that a branch of the Jewish Peoples Institute, in the Lawndale district will, among other things, keep the Jewish youth out of the poolrooms and other nests of crime, with which the West Side and other districts are well provided.</p>
   <p>We also need a nurses' home for the Michael Reese Hospital. Nurses are just as essential to the hospital as doctors, and the rest of the personnel.</p>
   <p>Thus, by supporting the drive for $2,500,000 to establish these three institutions, <span class="page-break">\3</span>we are supporting ourselves; we are helping to strengthen the Orthodox position in this city. All of us should be aware of this fact.</p>
