   <p>At the meeting of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] Executive Committee, which was held last night in the law offices of Max Shulman, it was disclosed that the Zionist leaders, Dr. Weizmann, Ahad Ha-am, and Chaim Bialik will arrive in Chicago on April 15, and plans have, therefore, been drawn up for the Keren Hayesod campaign, which will soon be launched.</p>
   <p>It is expected that a quarter of a million dollars will be raised in Chicago this year for the Keren Hayesod. Dr. Abramovitz, director of the Keren Hayesod office, has presented a detailed plan for the campaign, and Dr. S. M. Melamed presented his plan for the campaign in the form of a memorandum to the chair.</p>
   <p>It was determined that the campaign should be placed on a highly democratic basis, so as to involve all classes of Chicago Jews in the work. It was also decided to organize an army of a thousand volunteers to aid in this work.</p>
