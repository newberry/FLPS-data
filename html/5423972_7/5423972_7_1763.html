   <p>This society has been in existence since the early sicties and can, therefore, claim to be one of the oldest, if not the oldest, of the Jewish ladies' societies in Chicago. It was originally started as an auxiliary to the Congregation B'nai Sholem and has counted always between 100 to 150 members on its roster.</p>
   <p>Of the original members, only Mrs. Dora Korsosky is still active in the organization. She is a sister of Dr. Wise and has been President of the Society for over 25 years. This organization was most active in the relief work necessitated by the fire.
