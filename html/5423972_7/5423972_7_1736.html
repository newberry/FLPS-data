   <p>Help Comes.</p>
   <p>A sum of $465 was raised at last night's meeting to help persecuted Jews of Biyalistok. Committees were set up to help in the raising of funds. Prominent people will be contacted and funds solicited. Appeals will be made throughout the city in synagogues, lodges, clubs, and verein. Everybody should contribute heartily when you are approached by a committee for funds. Time is short. The Jews of Biyalistok need bread. Do not hesitate. A fund has also been started on behalf of the Society for the Aid of the Homeless. This society will accept applications from Jews in America who wish to bring to America, members of their family residing in the stricken city of Biyalistok. The society will help bring these families over if their relatives here promise to help them get started in America.</p>
   <p>The Application Committee of the Society for the Aid of the Homeless was instructed to meet as soon as possible and make public through the Jewish Daily Courier when and where applications will be received.</p>
