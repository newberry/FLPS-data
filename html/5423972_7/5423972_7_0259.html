   <p>The opening of the Anshei Sholum Synagog's Community Center took place at 3: P. M. yesterday at Douglas Boulevard and Homan Avenue.</p>
   <p>The celebration lasted until late at night, and the large Audience that participated in the celebration left for home satisfied, and conscious that the new edifice is a new fortification for Chicago Jewry in the new, fast growing Jewish community of the Douglas Park District.</p>
   <p>The large audience not only rejoiced in the opening of a new place for Torah, but also contributed thousands of dollars at this event to help complete this edifice.</p>
   <p>It was a pleasure to see how the Jews were willing to pay large sums of money for the honor to march with a scroll of the law in the conscretation march from the Community Center hall on the top floor to the synagog on <span class="page-break">\2</span>on the ground floor. The first to buy such an honor was Mr. Z. Morris, who paid $125. Later he paid $225 for the honor of having the key to open the door of the Synagog.</p>
   <p>The highest honor was that of Mr. Joseph Weill, who paid two thousand dollars for the honor of hanging a tableau over the door of the Synagog; his and his wife's name were inscribed on it; this brought a thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Weill is a well-known social worker and a former president of the Anshei Sholum Synagog. Mr. M. Goldstein, the second president of the United Congregations, paid $200 for the honor of lighting the ever-burning sacred light above the Holy Ark.</p>
   <p>A sum of over four thousand dollars was raised at this event.</p>
   <p>Good speeches were given by the most prominent Rabbis, of our city, and Judge Harry M. Fischer.</p>
