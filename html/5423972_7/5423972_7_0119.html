   <p>The Jewish People's Institute at 3500 Douglas Boulevard is recognized as the Community Center of the vast Jewish community on the West Side. Its services are manifold. During the depression its activities have of necessity increased tremendously, whilst its income has been seriously cut.</p>
   <p>So it was as a matter of absolute necessity that the directors of the Institute, at a meeting held in the first part of August, approved plans for a membership drive with the intention of enrolling as contributing members many of the Chicago Jewish community not now members of the Institute.</p>

   <p>THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.</p>
   <p>According to the analysis of the Institute's financial status made by Maxwell Abbell, the Institute's auditor, in 1929 the gross budget of the institution was approximately $206,000. By 1932 the expenditures had been reduced to $139,000, and during the current year will amount to less than $100,000. This drastic reduction in expenditures has been made possible to a slight extent by the drop in commodity prices but largely through the reduction in staff and to salary cuts. The reductions have placed a tremendous burden on the staff because no essential activity was curtailed and a larger number of individuals were rendered service than in previous years when the staff was larger.</p>
   <p>Yet even these reductions in expenditures could not keep pace with the drop in income.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The income of the Institute can be divided into three main classifications: (1) Internal income, i. e., fees from those who use the various facilities and pay for the services; (2) income from investments of endowment funds, and (3) income from generous individuals in the community who are desirous of seeing the activities sponsored by the Institute carried on for the benefit of those who are not in a position to pay anything or only a portion of the full cost.</p>
   <p>The total revenue of the Institute has dropped from $210,000 in 1929 to $194,500 in 1930, $142,800 in 1931, $123,000 in 1932, and at the present rate will amount to between $$85,000 and $90,000 for 1933. This year's income will be only about 40 per cent of what it was in 1929, yet the Institute is the same building which is being used today by many more thousands of men, women and children who take part in the numerous activities going on at all times.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In spite of the ravages of unemployment so terrible in the Lawndale District and so hard upon those of the working class, the income from those using the Institute had held up relatively well and even slightly better than the other two classifications, decreasing from $119,000 in 1929 to $180,000 in 1930, $53,800 in 1931, $57,600 in 1932 and an estimated $47,000 in 1933. Income from investments has practically disappeared. It amounted to close to $8,000 in 1929 and for 1933 will probably not be over $500.</p>
   <p>Nothing at all can be done ending an improvement in conditions with respect to income from investments and very little regarding internal revenue until more of those who attend the Institute secure positions or are paid salaries or wages which will permit them more than just a bare subsistence. There is only one source of income to which <span class="page-break">5</span>the Institute can look for help in this critical situation, from those persons in the community to whom the message of the Institute's work and value has not yet been brought and whose support is now so vitally needed.</p>
   <p>In 1929 membership and other contributions amounted to over $81,000; at the present rate it will be less than $30,000 for 1933, a little over one-third.</p>
   <p>While other philanthropic institutions in this city and other community centers elsewhere have suffered a loss of membership contributions, in very few instances has this loss been so severe on a percentage basis.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Institute closed the year 1930 with a deficit of over $6,000, in 1931 with a deficit of over $17,800, and in 1932 with a $16,000 loss. There were no reserve funds to draw from and there was only one way that the doors of the Institute could be kept open - by borrowing from the banks. The Institute has borrowed $40,000 to date and from present appearance there will be a huge deficit this year. Not only have the banks refused to lend more, but they are insisting on the gradual repayment of previous loans.</p>
   <p>THE PRESIDENT'S APPEAL.</p>
   <p>In an appeal to the workers for the Institute drive, President Joseph Michaels said:</p>
   <p>"I wish to advise you that the officers and directors who are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the work of the Jewish People's Institute are confronted with a very serious problem - one which they feel is likewise the responsibility of the entire community.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"Do you know that the Jewish People's Institute is officially the only organization of its kind, which is maintained by the people of Chicago, and which has for its purpose the comprehensive development of the cultural, educational and recreational adjustment of thousands of our people? They cannot get such advantages without the help of this organization, and without which help life would be a serious problem, indeed, for them.</p>
   <p>"Do you know that owing to the vast unemployment of the last few years, many of our young people have a great deal more unoccupied time, which unoccupied time it has been the purpose of the Institute to advantageously engage?</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>"Do you know that the same lack of employment and the depression generally, while throwing on the Institute a far larger burden than heretofore, has materially decreased its income? Not only have many of our subscribers felt compelled to withdraw their support, but that part of our income which we receive from those who use the facilities of the Institute has of necessity decreased considerably. Because of these conditions the Institute has a large bank indebtedness which can no longer remain unpaid.</p>
   <p>"It is inconceivable that the Jews of Chicago would permit the doors of this institution to close for lack of support. Never in the history of our people were institutions such as ours so badly needed as at the present time. It is the one organization that cannot make an account of physical ailment or physical starvation, but does make its appeal to avoid spiritual starvation and consequent discouragement and loss of spirit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>"The purpose of our Institute is to give an opportunity to thousands of people to lead more dignified lives and to avoid themselves of the great opportunities that American citizenship offers them. It is here in congenial surroundings that they learn that it is not incompattible with their Jewish training to become better American citizens. Not only to the thousands of young and old who enter the doors of the Institute does this organization bring its benefit, but they in turn carry it into thousands of other homes.</p>
   <p>"While it is for the sake of dignity of those living in the section that we ask a contribution for the recipients of the benefits of the Institute, I cannot escape the thought that there must be always in their minds the satisfaction of knowing that there is a group of high type cultured people who give of their substance and time to aid in this work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>"Ours is an American institution, patronized and supported by the Jewish people. All are welcome to enter its doors, who enter with proper reverence for its exalted purpose.</p>
   <p>"Won't you help us and urge others to do likewise?"</p>
