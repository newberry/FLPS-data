   <p>The Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities of Chicago were very successful in its last membership campaign, the results of which were greater than expected, or-- as the common expression is nowadays--"over the top." The federation, nevertheless, is not wholly satisfied because it needs an additional twenty-five thousand dollars with which to finance all institutions under its supervision in meeting their obligations.</p>
   <p>The famous philanthropist Julius Rosenwald came to the assistance of the federation. He is now offering the latter an additional twenty per cent of the total sum, if the committee can collect more than the quota of $125,000. Thus, if the friends of the Federated will make an effort, and are successful in collecting the additional twenty-five thousand dollars, they can depend upon a bonus of five thousand dollars also.</p>
