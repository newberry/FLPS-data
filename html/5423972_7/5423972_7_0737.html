   <p>Dr. Weizmann will arrive in America on March 1, and is expected to reach Chicago about March 15. Dr. Weizmann is not coming to Chicago simply to enjoy himself. He is coming here to remind the Jews of their duty to Palestine. The Chicago Jews have not, as yet, fulfilled their duty to Palestine, and they are in a position, both materially and financially, to bear a portion of the great responsibility which history has imposed upon them.</p>
   <p>Thus, we can only say to the Jews in Chicago: Be prepared! When the great Zionist leader comes to you, you should know what to do. He is not coming to talk to you personally; he is coming to tell you what has been accomplished in Palestine in the last two years, and what must be <span class="page-break">\2</span>accomplished in the next two and one-half years if we are to attain our goal.</p>
   <p>It is now two and one-half years since Sir Herbert Samuel became High Commissioner of Palestine. In these two and one-half years, relatively little has been done in proportion to what could have been done. Instead of twenty-five thousand Jews, one hundred thousand could have emigrated, if the Jewish people had responded to the first appeal issued by the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. Instead of two hundred thousand acres of land, our property should embrace a million acres, and instead of fifteen thousand pioneers, there ought to be forty thousand pioneers in Palestine today.</p>
   <p>Sir Herbert Samuel still has another term of two and one-half years to serve as High Commissioner of Palestine (it is an old tradition in England that a High Commissioner or Governor General in a colony, dominion, <span class="page-break">\3</span>or occupied territory serves no more than five years. After five years he will be replaced by someone else. In two and one-half years someone will succeed Sir Herbert Samuel). Who this someone will be, we do not know. Perhaps Sir Herbert Samuel's successor will be a Jew and, possibly, a more energetic Jew than the present High Commissioner. It is also possible that he will be a Gentile, and not particularly sympathetic to Zionism. Much depends upon the quantity and quality of our work in Palestine. If England can be convinced that the experiment with the Jews in Palestine has been successful, that Jews are sincere and intend to build up the land, she will surely encourage us, and Sir Herbert Samuel's successor will be an energetic friend of Zionism. But if we do not accomplish a great deal in these five years, England will become indifferent to the whole matter and will not overtax herself for us.</p>
   <p>One need not be a far-sighted statesman in order to realize how absolutely imperative it is for us to continue the constructive work in Palestine and to do it as quickly as possible. But how can we go on with the work <span class="page-break">\4</span>rapidly, when we contribute pennies instead of dollars to the Keren Hayesod? In a city like Chicago, with 400,000 Jews, the Keren Hayesod has 3,000 subscribers in all, and most of the subscribers only contribute small amounts. Chicago should have at least 10,000 subscribers, with an annual income of no less than a million dollars for the Keren Hayesod. If the other Jewish communities in America contribute proportionately, we will have a quarter-million Jews in Palestine by 1926.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weizmann comes to Chicago to speak to us about one thing--about the Keren Hayesod. And we can only say to Chicago Jewry: Be prepared!</p>
   <p>When Dr. Weizmann comes to Chicago we must present him with a large check for the Keren Hayesod. The check should not be for less than $100,000. Therefore, be prepared to raise, in the next ten weeks, $100,000 for the Keren Hayesod.</p>
   <p>The campaign should not begin when Dr. Weizmann arrives. It must begin <span class="page-break">\5</span>immediately. When the great Zionist leader arrives in Chicago, the campaign should be near its end, and the check should be written.</p>
   <p>All Keren Hayesod workers must begin at once to work for this campaign; otherwise the time will be too short. The leaders of large Jewish organizations and institutions must be attracted to the work; the presidents of synagogues, the grand masters of fraternal orders, the leaders of youth societies, etc. We must all be prepared for the day of Dr. Weizmann's arrival.</p>
   <p>Upon Chicago Jewry rests a large responsibility--and the only way to fulfill this sacred duty is to work. Be prepared to make a sacrifice. Be prepared!</p>
