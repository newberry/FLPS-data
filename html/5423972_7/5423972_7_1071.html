   <p>The Federated Orthodox Charities in the city of Chicago will soon hold its annual meeting and report to the public on its activities during the year. It can be taken for granted that the report will be a satisfactory one from the point of view of commissions, but it can also be taken for granted that it will be quite an unsatisfactory one from the point of view of omissions. Those charities and educational institutions affiliated with the Federated, are well organized, well conducted, and deserve praise, but there are any number of charitable, philanthropic and educational enterprises not affiliated with the charities, and many of them are badly organized, not well conducted, and do not deserve any praise.</p>
   <p>The Federated is doing all it can to help the charitable and educational organizations affiliated with it, but unfortunately, it is doing nothing for the "non-legalized" charities, and in our opinion it is the task of the Federated, not only to take care of the "legalized" charities under its supervision and control, but also to lay its hands on the other charities and thus enlarge its scope of activities.</p>
   <p>The community is growing very fast, and communal life is making rapid strides, and it is obvious that the Federated, serving as the only communal agency for the Orthodox Jews in Chicago, must move too, and cannot always remain where it was a year or two years ago. The Federated should take both Jewish Day Nurseries under its wing, it should assist the Association for Incurable Jews in Oak Forest, and should at least attempt to legalize and standardize all Orthodox charity organizations in the city of Chicago, with an income of five thousand dollars per annum and upwards. Only in this way will the Federated Charities grow and prosper and develop together with the community, and will accomplish its task to its own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the Orthodox Jews in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Federated should also take a certain definite attitude toward the educational problem. Doing part of the work only, does not solve the problem of our educational system. Either the Federated decide that it considers its task and duty to take a hand in the solution of the educational problem, and establish a general board of Jewish education in the city of Chicago, supervising and controlling all the establishments of education, private as well as public, or it resolves to take care of the charities only, and not to have anything to do with the educational institutions. By taking an indefinite and vague attitude towards the educational problem, it leaves things in a bad shape, for it prevents others from taking a hand in the matter, and discourages, rather than encourages the initiative of men and women who are generally interested in our educational problems.</p>
   <p>At present the Federated Charities supervise a few Talmud Torahs, and the Yeshivah Eitz Chayim. This leads many to believe that the Federated is an educational agency as well, and blame it for all our shortcomings in the field of Jewish education. Believing the Federated to be the only communal educational agency in the city of Chicago, many people refuse to take a hand in the educational work because they say that the Federated is already doing all it can to better Jewish educational conditions in the city. The fact of the matter, however, is that the Federated is not doing all it can for Jewish education, and that it is only satisfied with the supervising of a few educational institutions; and it is also a fact that the Federated could do much more for the betterment of our educational conditions that it is actually doing.</p>
   <p>While we urge that the Federated become the only central philanthropic agency in the community, and while we maintain that the Federated is in duty bound to lay its hands on all the Orthodox philanthropic charities in the city of Chicago, we do not say that it is likewise in duty bound to become the central Jewish educational agency in the city, but we do say that the present attitude of the Federated to our educational problem is more detrimental to Jewish education, that it does more harm than good to the great cause, and we only urge that the Federated decide the one way or the other; that is to say, that it either drop all its educational activities, or that it make up its mind to control all our educational activities. If it should decide to give up its educational work altogether, then a general board of Jewish education will be established by others, and this board will attempt to remedy the situation and do all it can for the cause. If it should decide to do for education what it should do for all the charities, then the Federated itself must establish such a board of Jewish education and become the supreme educational authority in the community.</p>
   <p>We understand that Mr. James Davis, the able leader of the Federated, is very much concerned with our educational problem, and is rather anxious to do something to improve local educational conditions, but we do not know whether he would like to see it done by others, by a special body to be established to take care of the Jewish educational problem in the city?</p>
   <p>We urge that the next annual meeting of the Federated should not be satisfied with listening to the reports and to accept the recommendations of the board of directors, but that it should empower the board to develop the Federated along the lines indicated, and thus make it the most powerful central Jewish agency in the city of Chicago.</p>
