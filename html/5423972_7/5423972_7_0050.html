   <p>Over Thirty-three thousand dollars for the "Beth Moshaw Zkanim (Old People's Home)</p>
   <p>The above is the largest sum that the Orthodox Jews of Chicago ever raised in one single day for the Jewish home for the Aged. The donations were raised for the purpose of building the annex to the home, and it will be built with no debts outstanding. The Jews on the West side are very happy about this charitable undertaking. The number of donors is rather small but the donations are large.</p>
   <p>The Donations are as follows:</p>

In his address, Mr. Baumgarden expressed his happiness over the fact that the annex will be built without <span class="page-break">\3</span>any, mortgages or outstanding debts. Mr. A. S. Roe, the chairman of the cornerstone committee, was the next speaker. He introduced Rabbi H. M. Fisher who opened the ceremony with a prayer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Israel Koven and Rabbi Yoodelson were the next speakers. They were followed by the auctioneer Mr. Wintervitz.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wintervitz displayed his abilities to get the cash from the Jewish public for this great and holy occasion. Dr. Stolz and Judge Hugo Pam, and Rabbi Saul Silber of "Ohave Sholom Synagogue also spoke. Mr. Wintervitz wound up, auctioning off the cornerstone for the sum of $1,500.00 to Mrs. B. Baumgarden and sold the cornerstone bricks for $113.00. Immediately after the ceremony the Ladies Auxiliary of the Home for the Jewish Aged invited the public to a light lunch, and shortly thereafter, Mrs. Baumgarden showed the guests the metal box, with the different signatures of the donors and the enclosed records of the home, and several daily English &amp; Jewish newspapers. The box was sealed under the cornerstone of the new annex. This concluded the ceremony of laying the cornerstone of the annex to the Jewish Home for the Aged.</p>
