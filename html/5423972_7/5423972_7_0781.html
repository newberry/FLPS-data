   <p>There was a meeting last night of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] volunteers of Chicago at the Hotel La Salle. At the meeting it was reported that from July, 1921, up to now, Chicago had raised two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in cash and pledges for the Keren Hayesod, and that one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars had already been sent to New York. This sum does not include the money which has been pledged for the next five years, and which amounts to about a quarter of a million dollars. The total of all the expenses, including the amount spent while the Sokolow delegation was here, was fourteen thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The volunteers then reported on the work they had done up to now and they undertook to go on with the work of raising new subscriptions as well as collecting outstanding pledges, including annual obligations.</p>
   <p>Dr. M. Shenkin of Palestine, who is now a guest in Chicago, reviewed, in a long <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>speech, his impressions of Palestine and pointed out the practical work which the Keren Hayesod does there, to build up the country.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Horwich was chairman.</p>
