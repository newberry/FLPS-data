   <p>[Translator's note: Ma-oth Hitim--practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy.]</p>
   <p>It is not too early for the rabbis and representatives of synagogues to hold a joint meeting to decide what is to be done this Passover for Ma-oth Hitim. There are many poor Jews in Chicago who would rather go hungry than eat food which our religion prohibits during Passover. They may have to sit down at barren tables for their Passover feast. We can imagine what a sad Passover they will have if those who have plenty, and more than plenty, do not help them. Of course, the more fortunate will help them if the situation is called to their attention. Never yet in Chicago has a poor family failed to receive mazoth, meat, groceries, and some cash for Passover.</p>

   <p>Good Ma-oth Hitim work can be done only when it is a community affair, when all those who represent the congregations are actively engaged in it. There should be only one Ma-oth Hitim committee, with one chairman and one treasury. It should be the duty of this committee to provide all of our poor people with the things they need for a proper celebration of Passover.</p>
   <p>We are waiting now for the call to the important joint meeting.</p>
