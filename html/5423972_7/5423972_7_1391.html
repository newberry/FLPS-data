   <p>Mr. Max Abel, the Chicago representative of the well-known Manischevitz Matzoth Company of Cincinnati, recently sent in to the local office of the Joint Distribution Committee a check for $1,400.96. This was the sum total of war stamps which, in answer to the appeal of local rabbis, he had pasted on every package of matzoth and sack of matzoth-flour that was sent out from his store. This is the largest sum of money which any matzoth company has collected from stamps for the war-suffering Jews. And it also shows how close to Mr. Abel's heart are the Jewish war-victims.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of the office committee of the Joint Distribution Committee, the decision was made to appoint Mr. Max Abel as member-at-large of the executive committee in recognition of his great and noble work for the Relief.</p>
