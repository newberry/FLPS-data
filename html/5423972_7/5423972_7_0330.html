   <p>The institute buildings and grounds:</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute occupies the square bounded by Taylor, Lytle, and Sibley Streets and Gilpin Place, 420x630 feet in dimension, and containing six acres.</p>
   <p>Two large building cover part of this space and are situated in the southeastern and southern portion of the square.</p>
   <p>The buildings and enclosures about them occupy about one-acre and the remaining five acres are devoted to an athletic field, running-track, tennis courts, outdoor gymnasium, and park and garden space. The entire park and garden space has been cultivated for many years, and as a result of the care bestowed upon the grounds, the grass, shrubbery and trees, there is an impression of age never to be found in a newly-cultivated city-park or garden. Nowhere else can there be found so large and so well-equipped a small park in the heart of a very thickly populated district, and because of the character of the institute it is truly a People's Play-Ground, belonging to those who use it.</p>
