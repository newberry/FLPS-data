   <p>At the last meeting of the Directors of the Home for Aged Jews, a committee was appointed to solicit subscriptions and memberships. This committee finds it impossible to call in person on every one from whom a subscription might be procured, or who might be desirous of becoming a contributing member. To all such, and especially to the charitably-disposed outside of the city, an urgent plea is issued that their contributions be sent to the chairman of the committee, Mr. A. Kuh, of Kuh, Nathan and Fischer, corner of Jackson and Franklin Streets. Much money is still needed to place the institution on a firm financial basis.</p>
   <p>Among the late donations are $3,000 from the Israelitische Altenheim Society, $1,000 from Mr. Leopold Bloom, and $200 from Mr. I. Frankel, of Oskaloosa, Ia.</p>
