   <p>The directors of the Chicago branch of Hias will hold a meeting this afternoon at the headquarters of the branch on Morgan Street. Mr. John Bernstein, of New York, national president of the organization, will be the main speaker. Mr. Adolph Krause, president of the Bnai Brith, is also scheduled to talk.</p>
   <p>The meeting will be important for the reason that the organization will submit a report of the work it has done during the year in behalf of immigrants coming to Chicago. The most important feature of the meeting is the presence of the president of this great institution, now when there is so much work to do not only to help the immigrant that is depending on us for shelter and food, but also see that the gates of America remain open for those who are forced to flee from their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>homeland as a result of persecutions or economic conditions.</p>
   <p>All Jews, regardless of beliefs, should be interested in the work of Hias, which is an impartial Jewish organization worthy of their cooperation.</p>
