   <p>Over 150 delegates from all parts of the labor movement attended the yearly conference of the "People's Relief." There they were presented with a report of the activities for the last 11 months.</p>
   <p>The report shows that the total collections in the past eleven months were $60,253.43 and expenses were $11,529. Prior to the election of new officials, a letter was read from Carpenters' Union Local 504 in which it criticizes the execution of the People's Relief, especially because it contains members who are not workers. The letter proposed that the new executive should consist of workers only. The delegates declared the criticism unjust.</p>
   <p>It was reported that the manager, R. Yukelson, had resigned his post and that the executive had called in Mr. Shuchter to replace the former, temporarily. The following were elected for the new executive: Shuchter, Rosenfeld, Rosenblum, Strausman, Uri, Bolonich, Rudin, Maechelson, Chelmer, Dr. Lorber, Fagen, Rubin, Zimmerman, and Sternfeld.</p>
