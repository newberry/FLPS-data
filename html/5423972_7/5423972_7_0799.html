   <p>A Jew should act like a human being, not like a donkey. A Jew should know what it means not to have mazoth for Passover, not to be able to observe the Passover, to be hungry during Passover. The difference between a human being and a donkey is that a human being can imagine himself in the position of another human being, can realize that the other man suffers and can try to help him, while a donkey cannot imagine himself in the situation of another donkey or of any other creature. A donkey thinks only about himself and never about anybody else, and, therefore, one does not say "good morning" to a donkey.</p>
