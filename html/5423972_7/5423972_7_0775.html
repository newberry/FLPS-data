   <p>Queen Marie of Rumania has expressed a desire to visit America, for the purpose of interesting the Rumanian Jews here and the Rumanian-Americans in the orphanage she plans to build in Bucharest. The war left many orphans in Rumania who have no home, who have nobody to take care of them, and an orphanage is urgently needed.</p>
   <p>It has been announced in the Queen's name, that the orphanage will have a separate department for Jewish orphans, where they will be brought up according to the traditions of their parents. Considering the fact that nowadays the Jews in Rumania are not treated as they used to be--the Jews there have been granted equal rights, according to the terms of the Paris treaty--it is the duty of the American Jews, regardless of where they come from, to see to <span class="page-break">\2</span>it that the Queen leaves America with a substantial sum of money. It is particularly important that the Queen's visit to Chicago shall be a success because the initiative was taken in Chicago to invite her to come here, and the assurance was given that everything possible would be done to help her in this noble undertaking. Mr. Henry Friend, the well-known State Street merchant and philanthropist, who knows the Queen personally, has heard that the Queen wants to come here. A correct invitation, signed by Mr. Friend and other well-known Chicago Jews, was cabled to the Queen's palace in Bucharest.</p>
   <p>Queen Marie's visit to Chicago, as I have said before, must be a success. All the forces here should unite, under a prominent chairman and a responsible treasurer, to raise the money and turn over a large check to the Queen.</p>
   <p>However, it looks as if the Rumanian consul in Chicago, Mr. John S. Popowich, has learned the game of a ward-politician or, maybe, he knew it before. In order to gain favor and prestige in the eyes of the Queen, to hold his job, he has decided to show what he can do. He, himself, wants to send the Queen, <span class="page-break">\3</span>even before she comes here, a check from Chicago for the orphanage. All well and good. But where is the money to come from? The Chicago Rumanians, who are members of his faith, are not in any hurry to contribute; the only ones left are the Jews. In a situation like this, Jews should be approached through a Jew--but who? He found such a Jew in the person of one Nelman, who came here, God knows from where, about two months ago. This Nelman, who does not make a particularly pleasant impression upon anyone, has influenced the members of the Poltishiner Verein of Rumanian Jews in Chicago, to call a meeting for today to raise money, so that Popowich can brag about his achievements.</p>
   <p>We are astonished at this action of the Poltishiner Verein. The Poltishiner is one of our most important societies. It has been in existence for seventeen years. It has paid benefits to its sick and indigent members. The public at large has benefited from it. Its contribution to war relief was fair and it has responded liberally to other Jewish undertakings in Chicago by contributions or activity. When one speaks about prominent Chicago societies, which are an <span class="page-break">\4</span>honor to this community, one must include the Poltishiner Verein.</p>
   <p>Our annoyance is, therefore, greater when we see that the Poltishiner wanted to act independently in such an important matter. The Poltishiner should not act that way. There is no great rush. Let it wait awhile. A large, general committee will soon be organized in Chicago and the Poltishiner will form an important part of it. The Poltishiner Verein by its splendid record and by its admittedly serious and productive activity can help to make Queen Marie's visit to Chicago what she wants it to be, so that she can leave Chicago with a feeling of gratitude and a high opinion of the Rumanian and other Jews of this city. This will not happen if our forces are divided.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that Messrs. Ephraim Goldstein, Brener, Abrahamson, Baron, Bromberg, Goldstein, Rohrlich, Sperling, Selzer, Kling, Schwartz, Rabinowich, Chaimowich, Itzkowich, Marcus, Motenko, Rosenthal, Horwitz, Siegel, Dr. Lesh, and others will consider our friendly warning and will change their attitude.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>As far as Mr. Popowich is concerned, he should understand that it is neither diplomatic nor good taste to try to hog all the credit. His desire to have the Poltishiner act independently of the Jewish community, his desire to obtain a little money that way and make an individual contribution to the Queen, is more of an insult than a compliment to Queen Marie. A diplomat should understand this without being told. It looks, however, as if he does not understand nor does he wish to understand.</p>
   <p>Will Mr. Bonescu, his unofficial representative on the West Side of Chicago, call his attention to this and influence him to stand aside?</p>
