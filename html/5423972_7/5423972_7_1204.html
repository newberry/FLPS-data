   <p>The four and a half million Jews of Poland and their unfortunate infants who are suffering from hunger, due to the lack of food, will now be saved by American Jews from a gruesome death. The American Government has taken upon itself the task of sending, through the post office, the food that Americans are sending to their relatives and friends in Poland.</p>
   <p>Many attempts have already been made to transport food for the hungry of Poland, but so far, unsuccessfully. The various companies that undertook to render this service, either charged exorbitant prices, or the packages were en route so long that the unfortunate sufferers for whom they were destined, died from hunger. Some of these companies which sprang up like mushrooms turned out to be fraudulent.</p>
   
   <p>The hunger cries of the unfortunate from across the water became so horrible that they echoed here like thunder, and the American Government decided to extend help to these unfortunates. The first attempt was made not long ago with the aid of the former food administrator, Herbert Hoover.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoover who, during the war was in charge of all European food-relief, has worked out a plan to save the destitute of Poland from starvation.</p>
   <p>The following excerpt from Mr. Hoover's letter to the American bankers, to whom he has appealed for aid in this noble work, will give an idea of the whole plan:</p>
   <p>"There are between three and four million families in the United States with family ties in Eastern and Central Europe. Thousands of then are ready and willing to help in saving their dear ones in the old country. Many have tried to send parcels of food, but in many instances, the expense of transportation exceeded that of the value of the food by more than one hundred per cent.</p>
   
   <p>"We have formulated a plan to open warehouses, where food will be stored, in all large European cities, and we will issue drafts not for money but for the food which can be sent there. We will charge only for the cost of transportation plus insurance, and whatever profits that will be derived will go for the benefit of the unfortunate orphans of Europe.</p>
   <p>"I trust that the American bankers will not refuse to co-operate in this great relief work which can and will save the desperate in Europe."</p>
   <p>Besides this important undertaking, the American Government has established parcel-post connections with Poland and will, through the post office, transport parcels of food from Americans to their hungry friends in Poland.</p>
   <p>The prices charged by the post office for this service are negligible in comparison with those charged by private companies. In addition, one must consider the fact that when one sends a parcel of food to one's relatives or friends won't have to shed tears watching his infant die of hunger.</p>
   
   <p>A reporter of the Courier in his quest for information regarding the sending of food to Poland, visited the high officials of the Chicago Post Office. The post-office officials received the reporter of the Courier cordially, and explained all the particulars to him in detail.</p>
   <p>"Thousands of people come to us daily with questions about how to send food to Poland," said the postmaster's secretary to the reporter of the Courier, "and we will be thankful to you if you will make everything clear in your newspaper."</p>
   <p>The following are the most important rules regarding the sending of food to Poland: 1) Parcels of food can be sent to what was originally Poland, part of which belonged previously to Russia and part to Austria.</p>
   <p>2) Packages are not to exceed eleven pounds. Naturally the sender is privileged to send more than one package.</p>
   
   <p>3) Packages are not to be wrapped in paper boxes; they are not secure and the post office will refuse to accept them. The best way to wrap them is in cloth or thin cotton sacks.</p>
   <p>4) Packages may be sent to the main post office downtown or through the nearest post-office branch in your neighborhood, or through drug-store stations.</p>
   <p>5) The price for sending packages to Poland is only twelve cents a pound.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the American Jews will appreciate this important government innovation. Let's hope that tens of thousands of food parcels will stream daily to the hungry Jews in Poland.</p>
