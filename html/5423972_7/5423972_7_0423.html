   <p>Treasurer Becker pointed out in his report that the Jewish Charities spent $1,501,727 in 1931. The Charities have a deficit this year amounting to $128,106.11.</p>
   <p>Mr Goldsmith, in his report, told about the statistics of the Illinois Department of Labor, which statistics show that there are 650,000 unemployed in Chicago.
