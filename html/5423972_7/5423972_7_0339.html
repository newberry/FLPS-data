   <p>Since Dr. Blaustein has taken over the leadership of the Hebrew Institute of Chicago, this institution has become what its founders had intended to make of it. The Hebrew Institute has become the heart of Chicago's Jewry; it has become the center of Chicago's Jewry from all walks of life. Under the roof of the Hebrew Institute there exists neither orthodox nor reformed, neither conservative nor radical. There exists only Jews. The Hebrew Institute of Chicago as yet is in its infancy. Dr. Blaustein has not been here long enough to make himself felt in every nook and corner. However, one can see the marvelous results, when many hundreds of Jewish youths, instead of wasting their time in billiard parlors or other undescribable places, come to the Hebrew Institute to hear good lectures or to participate in social affairs.</p>
   <p>We are very happy to know that the Jews of the West Side understand the importance of this institution and are ready to offer assistance in order to maintain this institution. Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the man who is so interested in seeing the Hebrew Institute act as a magnet, which would draw to itself every Jew in Chicago, as well as all others interested, has now demonstrated this by the enormous sum of money he has contributed towards the Institute. In his letter to Mr. B. Horowitz he praises very highly the wonderful work of the committee which consisted of Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Shaffner and B. Horowitz, when they made collections for the Institute.</p>
   <p>It would be quite noteworthy if every Jew in Chicago would send his contribution to the Hebrew Institute and make sure that they have done their share in building the greatest temple of Jewry in America.</p>
