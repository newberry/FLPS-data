   <p>Beginning with the Fall session the Institute will conduct a pre-kindergarten school where children of the ages of two and a half to five may attend from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., with the day interrupted for a light luncheon followed by an afternoon nap. This project will answer the needs of children of pre-kindergarten age affording them the opportunity for free play in a group under the sympathetic guidance of trained nursery teachers.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the community will take advantage of the new project and register their children as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Jewish People's Institute is located at 3500 Douglas Blvd.</p>
