   <p>The seventh annual Flag Day for the Jewish National Fund will be held on Hannukah Sunday, December 12. Thousands of young ladies in Chicago and throughout the country will offer their services to sell Zion flags for the benefit of the Jewish National Fund.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds will be devoted to the purchasing and improving of land in Palestine, thereby providing for our persecuted brethren in Europe a much needed haven of refuge.</p>
   <p>The recognition of a Jewish homeland in Palestine by the nations of the world, in the San Remo decision, has placed an enormous task on our shoulders. Therefore, it has become more important than ever before that Flag Day this year shall be made a nation-wide demonstration of Jewish approval and rejoicing.</p>
