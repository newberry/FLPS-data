   <p>America Jews must give financial aid to make this possible. Mr. Maxim's address at the West Side Auditorium drew a tremendous ovation from the audience. The essence of his epic making speech was that there was no bone for the six-million members of Russian Jewry, unless the entire Russian people are freed from czarist oppression. He says, "Emigration cannot solve the Jewish problem in Russia. Six-million people cannot leave a country and migrate to another. Very few can afford to emigrate. The problem is too big to be solved by emigration. It can only be solved where it is. One hundred thousand or more may emigrate, but new ones are born to take their places.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken us and a goodly sum of money was raised. The meeting was ended at 11:30 P. M.</p>
