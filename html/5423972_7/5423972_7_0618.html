   <p>At the Winchester Talmud Torah the members of the Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy] Committee are distributing Ma-oth Hitim to the poor. The entire capital of the committee is only four thousand dollars--a sum which is not even enough to take care of one-fourth of the poor who seek this committee's aid. What shall the committee do after the four thousand dollars is distributed and the rest of the poor come to demand their share? Shall it tell the poor either to eat chometz (leaven bread) or to starve for eight days? I do not envy the Ma-oth Hitim Committee.</p>
   <p>What are the synagogues doing? Nothing. A few synagogues forwarded their contributions to the committee and the others ignore the matter, as though it were not their concern. Individuals are not doing their duty either this year. Every individual or synagogue that has not as yet contributed to the Ma-oth <span class="page-break">2</span>Hitim Committee, must do so soon because the time is short and the ranks of the poor who besiege the Winchester Talmud Torah, are growing. Please hurry. It is late. Do your duty before it is too late.</p>
   <p>A committee of three young girls, pupils of the [Congregation] Kehilath Jacob Talmud Torah, came to the editorial office of the Courier yesterday and complained about the fact that their Hebrew class will soon be closed. The boy pupils of the class will be transferred to the Hebrew Theological College, but the girls will be deprived of the opportunity to continue their Hebrew studies. The members of the committee made their appeal in a Hebrew which was free of any literary flaws. This proves that they themselves have learned a great deal, and that the teachers and the principal of the Kehilath Jacob Talmud Torah have done splendid work. The children would not leave until I had promised to intercede for them, and I, therefore, serve notice to those in charge of the Kehilath Jacob Talmud Torah, that they will have to give the thirteen students attending the high school classes an opportunity to <span class="page-break">3</span>continue their Hebrew studies. The children have spent five years in this Talmud Torah and must be given an opportunity to complete their education.</p>
