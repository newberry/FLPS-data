   <p>On Oct. 6, the doors of the Home for the Jewish Friendless and Working Girls will be formally thrown open. The public will be enabled to inspect the inner workings of this long needed institution. It is located at Nos. 1, 2, and 3 Ogden Front, at the intersection of Clark and Wells Streets, and has a capacity for about 100.</p>
   <p>The special purposes of this institution are primarily to help poor people to help themselves, thus avoiding pauperism. Children whose parents are sick or out of work, will be taken in and sheltered until the parents have been restored to health or have secured employment. Destitute women will be given shelter until they are able to secure work. Convalescents, who have been discharge from hospitals, will be cared for until able to care for themselves. Aged women will be received while arranging for permanent homes. Abandoned children of parents unable to or unfit to support them will be cared for.</p>
   <p>An interesting feature of the organization of this institution lies in the fact that no contributions have been nor will be solicited. The idea originated with the members of the Baron Hirsch Ladies' Aid Society, who have, by their tireless efforts, succeeded in completely furnishing the home in such fashion as to do credit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The officers have been selected and are Mrs. B. Mandel, president, Mrs. Hugo Brady, first vice-president, Mrs. A. Loebman, recording secretary and Mrs Henry Roth, treasurer.</p>
