   <p>The South Side Ladies' Sewing Society was organized in the Fall of 1863, with thirty members. There was only one officer at that time, the president, Mrs. Michael Greenebaum. The ladies met at the homes of members and sewed garments for poor women and children, which were distributed by the Hebrew Relief Association. From the start until the present day, the Sewing Society has been an auxiliary of the Hebrew Relief Association.</p>
   <p>For the last few years the Society has employed four Jewish women to do the sewing, which in former years, was done by its members, expending for this purpose from four to six hundred dollars a season. Lately, the Society has been working in co-operating with the Chicago Women's Aid, in operating the work-room on Canal Street. The Sewing Society has been supplying all material and distributing the furnished garments. In addition, the D.S. Society furnishes employment to thirty women at their homes, who are unable to attend the work-room.</p>
   <p>The annual expenditures have reached the sum of $4,000. at the present time. The number of families supplied, are about 225.</p>
