   <p>Resolution 1.</p>
   <p>The annual city conference of the Chicago Peoples Relief, after listening to a report of the tool campaign, extends its most hearty gratitude and recognition to all women and men who in spite of bad weather, apathy, and attacks by opponents, faithfully stood by the work and helped carry through the campaign until the end. We are unable here to single out the great number of organizations and individuals, who so energetically, supported the campaign, although two groups are worthy of exceptional recognition: First, the Ladies Auxiliary, whose several members were among the most active and tireless workers of the campaign; Second, the multitude of over 400 volunteers, who have in severe cold, windy days, collected about $4,300 for the war victims.</p>
   <p>We also thank the Forward for its tireless support and we hope that in the future, the Forward will also help us in our noble work.</p>
   <p>We also extend our gratitude to our former manager, Friend Ehrenreich, who so greatly helped in reviving the Peoples Relief in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Resolution 2.</p>
   <p>The relief has now adopted a new plank in its program. The necessity of immediate relief, of literally saving people from hunger, is almost over. But the necessity of constructive relief, to help the impoverished, ruined Jewish population, increased. The Peoples Relief has constantly agitated for this form of relief work. The funds, which it distributed independently, were distributed among the various cultural organizations of the European Jewish working class. The Joint Board has also, through the influence of the Peoples Relief, adopted the principle of constructive relief.</p>
   <p>We, the delegates of the Chicago's Peoples Relief Conference of January 7, 1922, convinced that the relief action of the Jewish working class should not cease, determine to continue the work most energetically.</p>
   <p>Resolution 3.</p>
   <p>In entering the new year's work, we recommend that the new executive shall undertake new relief measures for the children's home and children's schools in Europe. The means and methods of the campaign are up to the executive.</p>

   <p>Resolution 4.</p>
   <p>In considering that the transmission work is a very important part of our relief activity, we determine to continue this work and encourage remittance. We authorize the new executive to introduce methods in decreasing the expense relative to this work.</p>
   <p>Resolution 5.</p>
   <p>The new executive shall consist of fifteen people, appointed at the conference by the representatives of the affiliated central organizations, which shall separately appoint three delegates each year.</p>
