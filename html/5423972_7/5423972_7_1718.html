   <p>The Austrian Jewish Ladies Charity Society is going to hold its 12th annual ball at the Douglas Park Auditorium, corner Kedzie and Ogden Ave. on Saturday evening, November 18th. It is unnecessary to speak of the beneficial work the society did in the past, for it is already well known to all West Side Jewry. It has the reputation of allowing no one who is in need to be turned away.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lena Aarons, President; Mrs. Dora Weisfeld, Treasurer; Mrs. Clara Ostiler, Vice-President; Mrs. Yetta Penner, 1st Trustee, and Mrs. Mary Levy, Financial Secretary.</p>
