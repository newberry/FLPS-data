   <p>Every philanthropic organization must lose ground, when it begins to mix in politics. Good philanthropists need not always be good politicians, just as good musicians need not be good architects. The true philanthropist, in general, is not a politician because, being a philanthropist, he has no feeling for politics, and when he does begin to mix in politics he is, as a rule, not very successful. This is still more true in regard to a philanthropic organization. When it begins to mix in politics, it brings only chaos and confusion; it does not improve its philanthropic activity and it accomplishes very little in the political field. The Independent Order [of] Bnai Brith, which is now celebrating its diamond jubilee, is a philanthropic organization, because its basic aims are humanitarian. It did a splendid job as a purely philanthropic organization. It took the part of the weak and oppressed, alleviated the pains of the wounded, cured the sick, helped the unfortunate, consoled those who were grief-stricken, etc.</p>
   <p>The Order owns a number of philanthropic institutions, charitable homes, hospitals, etc., of which it can be proud. In its lodges, throughout the world, a humanitarian spirit reigns, and the professional Bnai Brith worker works very hard for humanitarian purposes.</p>
   <p>The Order was founded at a time when no Jewish politics existed. It, therefore, could not have any political problems--and it never had. If the leaders of the Bnai Brith were engaged with the Jewish problem in Rumania and Russia, they did it not as politicians, but as philanthropists, because they never possessed, nor do they possess even now, any Jewish political ideas and views. To them, the problem of the Jews in Rumania is a humanitarian one only. As philanthropically inclined persons, they naturally are against any persecuting politics. The truth is, naturally, that the question of Jewish persecution is not a question of humanitarianism alone, but also a political one. This, the Bnai Brith leaders did not understand, nor cared to understand and, by applying philanthropic methods to a political malady, they naturally couldn't have any more success than they had.</p>
   <p>While from their standpoint, and very logically, they intend to treat the Jewish problem in Russia and Rumania as a humanitarian one, and act accordingly, they still have no right to issue a political opinion on a Jewish political problem and as Bnai Brith people--i. e. as professional philanthropists--to mix in Jewish politics. The Bnai Brith, a non-political Jewish organization, has no political opinion, has no right to have a political opinion--because a philanthropic organization can have no political opinions--especially when these opinions are wicked, unethical, anti-philanthropic, and against every trait of genuine humanitarianism.</p>
   
   <p>A Bnai Brith person, who adheres entirely to the program of his order, is a politically colorless Jew. He can express an opinion about charity, charitable loans, hospitals, homes for the aged--he can even say to the Cossack, "Mister Cossack, shame on you,"--but he has no connection with the Jewish political thought, and has no right whatever to mix in problems which are purely political; also he has no right to express his opinion over Jewish problems. There isn't any philanthropic opinion about politics, as there isn't any medical opinion about music.</p>
   <p>Now comes the vice-president of the philanthropic Order of Bnai Brith, and tries to teach us Jewish politics. He makes himself ridiculous as well as the Order. Mr. Solomon states that Zionism is anti-patriotic, that American Zionists are not loyal Americans, and that it is impossible to be a good American and a Zionist at the same time. And this is after the president of this mighty republic, who certainly must know what real Americanism is, has endorsed the Zionist movement and has expressed his sympathy with it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Solomon, naturally, has the privilege to make himself ridiculous, and talk as much nonsense as he pleases, but he has no right to make the Bnai Brith ridiculous. He has no right to compromise, through foolishness and wickedness, his own group, and to condemn the majority of American Jews, who are now Zionistically inclined.</p>
   <p>If the rank and file of the Order of Bnai Brith wish to keep their organization honorable, they must not permit their leaders to mix in Jewish politics, of which they haven't the faintest idea, and should not allow them to make enemies for the Order. The Bnai Brith needs all the help it can get in curing the sick and helping the poor. We appreciate the philanthropic work of the Order, and regret that its leaders are mixing in Jewish politics. Let the Order of Bnai Brith take care of the Jewish philanthropic problems, and let the political matters of the Jewish people be taken care of by those who know how to do them.</p>
