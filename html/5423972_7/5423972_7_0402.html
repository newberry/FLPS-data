   <p>There is a movement on the West Side to establish a society for the purpose of alleviating the distress which prevails among our Jewish poor in the seventh ward. The object of this society is to give temporary employment to those who are without work and means, and who apply for charity. It is to be called the "Emergency Employment Association," and will be under the direction of responsible people.</p>
