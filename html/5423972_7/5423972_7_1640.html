   <p>The Northwest Side Free Dispensary Association, an organization of prominent Jews whose purpose was to help the poor and needy in that vicinity, has some time past disbanded, leaving a sum of $419.74 still remaining in the treasury.</p>
   <p>Much has been discussed concerning the proper disposal of this money. It was finally decided that charitable funds belonged to charity, therefore, the membership of the former association voted unanimously to bestow this money to a charitable organization, The Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>A committee of prominent people presented the $419.74 to the Federation.</p>
   <p>The former officers of the dissolved association were: David Greenberg, president; Jennie Goldman, vice-president; Rosa Wiseman, secretary; and Bessie Wienberg, treasurer. The following were trustees: Sam Arber, Charles Casparovitch and Louis Sonenblick.</p>
