   <p>At a well-attended meeting of rabbis and synagogue presidents last night in the [Hebrew] Theological College, called by the Orthodox synagogues, the question of receiving Dr. Chaim Weizmann upon his arrival in Chicago next March was discussed.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the Union of Synagogues should appoint a committee to organize all the synagogues immediately for the purpose of raising the sum of a quarter-million dollars for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. The committee will be appointed by the president of the Union.</p>
   <p>Dr. Shmarya Levin addressed the meeting, and in a brilliant speech, pointed out the duties of the Orthodox Jews in the rebuilding of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Weil was chairman.</p>
