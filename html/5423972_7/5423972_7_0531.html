   <p>The Jews who take an interest in Jewish community life, should be present tonight at the Hotel La Salle, at the annual meeting of the [United Jewish] Charities, which will begin with a fish dinner. If our Jews want to have any influence upon the Charities, they should attend a meeting at least once a year and show that they are interested in the activity of the United Jewish Charities. If a hundred so-called German Jews attend this annual meeting, then at least three hundred of our Jews should attend the meeting because we form the great majority in the community and no one should be able to say that we do not evidence any interest in the greatest Jewish undertaking of the Community--the United Jewish Charities. Every prominent Jew of the West and Northwest Sides should be present at tonight's meeting because the most important undertaking of Jewish Chicago is involved. The leaders of the Charities will pay more attention to our Jews if they take part in the meeting of the Charities.</p>

   <p>Both sides will [more] easily arrive at an understanding if the leaders of the Charities begin to show more consideration for our Jews.</p>
