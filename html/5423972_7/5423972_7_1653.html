   <p>It is a general rule that when a group or community feels the need of creating something, a creator appears. Man is like vegetation. Man is the tree of the field. As soon as Spring arrives and nature greets the world with its fragrant grasses, beautiful blossoms, and gorgeous flowers, the earth begins to display her best and most beautiful gifts. Man responds in the same way whether he is part of the great working class of the world, whether he lives in the country or in the city, or whether he is confined to the narrow social circles in a community.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewish community has realized the vital need of reorganizing its philanthropic institutions--which, at the present time, is the only solution for our communal problems. When the community felt, that in order to carry on its charitable work, it must unify its institutions, Mr. Bernard Horwich proposed a plan.</p>
   <p>If there ever was a proper person who could solve this complicated and thankless problem, that person is Mr. Horwich. He is one of the most prominent, Orthodox Jews in Chicago--a man who may be called "rich", yet he is not so rich that we must envy him. Mr. Horwich is also a great philanthropist who gives money where it will do the greatest good. His ability as an orator is used only whenever and wherever it is necessary; he is not intolerant, but he has enough Jewish stubborness not to be afraid of opposition. In general, he is a man held in high esteem by all.</p>
   <p>When such a person does civic work he must naturally be successful. Going thoroughly over each step, knowing the heavy responsibility resting on him, placing great confidence in himself and his aids, Mr. Horwich began by calling a series of meetings of the various classes of Jews. From each he selected the most capable, the most enlightened, and the most earnest men for his assistants. Mr. Sam Philipson, Mr. Benjamin T. Schiff, and Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, were among the first to join him in organizing a planning committee to assist in uniting the various philanthropic institutions; these men, representing the Jewish community in Chicago as a whole, were the first to contribute their money, time, work, and knowledge to this movement.</p>
   <p>Then the representatives of the civic and charitable institutions were called in. The tragic position of the Chicago Jewish community was then revealed. Each representative admitted the need of a Federation, but they argued that to weld together such an organization was an impossibility. The presidents and directors of these institutions stated that if all institutions had such fine people for directors as his own institution had, a Federation would be a possibility; but, since his institution stood alone in possessing good directors, the others having only mediocre officers, there could, therefore, be no possibility of a Federation. There were many other obstacles to weaken the courage of the planning committee, but this deplorable attitude on the part of the leaders of the various institutions topped the list.</p>
   <p>The planning committee, being nearer to the people, realized they were dissatisfied with the present order, or rather disorder, of the individual institutions. They were unable to endure the bickering and constant appeals for donations.</p>
   
   <p>These expressions of the people gave more courage to the members of the planning committee. Thousands of dollars were received in subscriptions; huge crowds attended every mass meeting; and in synagogues, lodges, and social halls, the cry was, "Federation, Federation".</p>
   <p>Suddenly, however, the public ceased to give money, feeling that this was the best method of bringing the dissenters around to the people's point of view.</p>
   <p>Then, too, the planning committee received aid from an altogether new source. Harry M. Fisher, an energetic young lawyer, was elected judge of the Municipal Court. He was not only the first Russian Jew to be elected judge in Chicago, but also the first candidate to appeal to the Jewish public for votes without setting forth grievances or asking for special favors. He polled a tremendous vote in the Jewish districts.</p>
   <p>As soon as the results of the election were known, Judge Fisher declared that he would use his influence and his friends to help the planning committee in organizing the Federation. Thus the co-operation of the politicians was secured; and many prominent men now brought in money and subscriptions, whereas formerly only some individuals had been donating a few meager pennies.</p>
   <p>Park Commissioner Samuel J. Rosenberg, Mr. Isaac Lurie, and Mr. Max Korshak helped Judge Fisher. These men, joined and worked like soldiers under the command of Mr. Horwich, and in about two months' time they established order and brought new life into the movement, making the idea of a Federation an actuality.</p>
   <p>The old directors fought in vain against the establishment of the Federation. In vain they searched for means to delay its operations for several months. But the "political bench" fought back. Anyone could see that these energetic young men would win, and that the old lifeless ruins must fall--and fall they did. On Jan. 1, 1913, the Federation began to finance all of the Jewish charitable institutions of Chicago.</p>
   <p>But the battles of the Federation were not over yet. All the old directors united with a new element, and again created a great commotion. We will deal with this subject in our next article. [Editor's note: This article is the second one on the need for a federation of Jewish charitable organizations in Chicago.]</p>
