   <p>The Jewish Educational Alliance, a sort of Center for the orthodox Jews of the Northwest Side, has ceased to exist as an independent institution. The alliance was taken over by the Hebrew Institute, which will have a branch there. The Alliance existed over 10 years, with very poor success. The Northwest Side Jews did not support the Alliance. The Hebrew Institute, on the contrary, is kept up by Chicago's wealthiest Jews, who will cover the yearly deficits.</p>
