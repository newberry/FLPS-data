   <p>Dr. Rosenblatt, member of the Polish Parliament and one of the best-known and most beloved Jewish leaders in Poland, will speak today to the Jews of Chicago about the present condition of Polish Jewry. For the first time, Chicago Jews will hear about the plight of their brethren in Poland from a man who lives among them and suffers with them.</p>
   <p>The reports of the Jewish situation in Poland which have reached us up until now, were those of relief commissions and newspaper men. Regardless of how well-informed our relief commissioners may be, or what keen observers our newspaper men are, they are not, under any circumstances, in a position to give us an accurate picture of the Jewish situation in Poland. They often do not understand certain phenomena, even though the reasons for these conditions may be explained to them. They often cannot understand the inner connection <span class="page-break">\2</span>between cause and effect; they can't understand the spiritual condition of the Polish Jews because they haven't gone through what the Polish Jews have gone through in the last five years.</p>
   <p>At best, our relief commissioners may have certain impressions and ideas about the situation of the Polish Jews. But the Jews of America, whom history has designated to play the role of saviors of Polish Jewry, must know more about what is going on in Poland than the relief commissioners, newspaper men, or travelers can tell. They must know the "inside story" of the Jewish situation in Poland.</p>
   <p>Why are the Polish Jews split into eight political parties, having only eleven instead of fifty deputies in the Polish Parliament? Are the causes of this rift purely of an economic character which could be eliminated through a fixed policy of constructive relief, or are there moral, spiritual or religious causes involved? Until now we have been unable to receive the proper answer to this vital question. Dr. Rosenblatt, who is a Polish Jew himself, and who <span class="page-break">\3</span>has contributed much to the development of Jewish life in Poland for the last twenty-five years, is in a position to give us an answer to this question.</p>
   <p>The Jews of America who wish to help the Jews of Poland cannot be satisfied merely with giving donations to save people from starvation. Donations alone will not alter the situation of a people. Radical means are necessary in order to put the Polish Jews in such an economic position as to enable them in a comparatively short time to become independent of American Jews and to be able to stand on their own feet. This is only possible through constructive relief work. It is, therefore, necessary to know:</p>
   <p>What is really taking place among Polish Jewry? What are the possibilities for the development of the new Poland? How much hope is there that the reactionary regime will soon disappear and will be replaced by a more liberal regime? What does the great Polish nation think about the Jewish problem in Poland? In short, it is necessary to know whether it pays to do the kind of <span class="page-break">\4</span>work which will give the Jews an opportunity to remain in Poland. It is self-understood that we cannot build on sand.</p>
   <p>If it is true, as many assert, that the Polish Jews have no future in Poland; that their lot will be similar eventually to that of the Rumanian Jews after the Berlin Tractate, then our relief work in Poland must be conducted differently. It may be that our relief work should consist only of assisting certain groups of Polish Jews to emigrate from Poland. All of these intricate and complicated questions can be answered best by a man like Dr. Rosenblatt. He knows what prospects are in store for the Polish Jews and is in a position to indicate what should be done in order to help them.</p>
   <p>Naturally, it is also important for us to know what is going on in Poland at the present moment. It will be interesting to learn from a man like Dr. Rosenblatt what influence the present relief work has upon the Polish Jews; how the relief organization of American Jewry fulfills its mission in Poland and to what degree it helps to lighten the great economic burden of the Polish Jews.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We know that large sums of the relief money of American Jews are being distributed weekly among the Polish Jews. But until now we have heard very little about the effects of our relief activity in Poland. Our relief commissioners tell us only that the need there is very great; that people are dying of hunger and cold. Yet sometimes we would also like to hear about what we American Jews are accomplishing in assuaging this horrible misery. To this question also, no one else can give us a better answer than can Dr. Rosenblatt who is actively engaged in the relief work.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Joint Relief Committee was fortunate when it invited Dr. Rosenblatt to Chicago to describe to Chicago Jews the condition of the Polish Jews. The Jewish public of Chicago is indebted to the Joint Relief Committee for giving it the opportunity to hear the report of the most prominent person identified with the Jewish situation in Poland.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Joint Relief Committee has performed its duty. Now it is up to the Jewish public of Chicago to do its part in greeting the esteemed guest <span class="page-break">\6</span>and hearing his report about the Jewish situation in Poland. Let Dr. Rosenblatt be convinced that the Chicago Jews are alive to the interests and welfare of their brethren in Poland.</p>
