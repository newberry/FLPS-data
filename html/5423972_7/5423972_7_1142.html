   <p>Our learned contributor, professor S. A. Hoffman, takes the European Zionists to task, because he thinks that they demand too much from the American Zionists, and because he imagines that they, the European Zionists, treated them as "skeletons in Zion". And Assuming this [to] be the case, he goes on to explain why American Zionism seems to be dead and buried. He holds the European Zionists responsible for this and state of affairs.</p>
   <p>However, we are glad to tell our learned friend that he is mistaken from beginning to end. Neither have the American Zionists given so much to the movement, nor have the European Zionists asked too much. They have only asked that we do our duty, and be loyal to the international Zionist organization, but our Zionist leaders in New York think that American Zionists can work on their own hook, and do not need the co-operation of the international organization, and hence the cause of friction. It may also interest the professor <span class="page-break">2</span>and his friends to learn that the European Zionists, especially the Russian and German Zionists, have given proportionately much more for Zionism during the war, than we, the prosperous Zionists in America.</p>
   <p>Soon after the downfall of the Russian monarchy, when the rouble was still worth twenty-five cents, the Russian Zionists have collected the respectable sum of twenty-five million roubles for reconstruction work in Palestine, and it must be admitted that the Russian Jews at that time were not as prosperous and as well-to-do as we in America. The German Jews, especially the German Zionists, have also given more for the Zionist cause then the American Zionists. Of course at present, their liberality may not amount to very much because of the low exchange [of currency] and if Professor Hoffman thinks that we, American Zionists, have saved Zionism by sending a few thousand tons of food of Palestine, he will be surprised to learn that the English Zionists, who are less numerous than we are, have done the same.</p>
   <p>The fact of the matter is that we in America have no reason whatsoever to be <span class="page-break">3</span>proud of our Zionist accomplishments during the last few years. Our contribution to the various Zionist funds do not exceed six million dollars--the Russian Zionists have given a similar amount in that year, and they are less in a position to give than we are we think that we in America exaggerate a little our general Jewish, and especially our Zionist activities. European Zionists have spent millions of dollars for Zionism, before American Zionists have given anything for the movement. As long as European Jewry has intact during the first two years of the World War, the European Jews have given considerably more for relief purposes than American Jews. The Jewish community in Moscow for one has spent in one year some eight million roubles for relief purposes, and there are in one corner in Chicago more Jews than there were in Moscow under the old regime. The other Jewish communities in Russia have displayed a similar spirit of philanthropy, and do not make much ado about it. If it were not for the relief work of the Russian and German Jewish communities during the first two years of the war, there would be no polish Jewry any more, and there would be no Lithuanian Jewry in existence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Of course after European Jewry has [been] shattered and broken to pieces both economically and politically, only American Jewry could save the remnant of European Israel. We talk so much about our contributions to the European and Palestinian Jewish cause, that people must come to the conclusion that the European Jews are all misers, and only we in America are the philanthropists. But until now Baron Edmond De Rothschild, who spent one hundred million francs on the Palestinian proposition, has not found a substitute in America, nor has the American Jewry produced a second Baron Hirsch. We here in this country go wild when we hear that a wealthy Jew has given one hundred thousand dollars for a Jewish cause.</p>
   <p>Professor Hoffman and his friends seem to be very poorly informed on European Jewish conditions. In Europe such things happen not once in a while, but very often, and no ome makes a fuss about it.</p>
   <p>Now, we have not given too much either for relief or for Palestine, but on the other hand we have tried to impose our will on European Jewry. For the little <span class="page-break">5</span>we give, we want to have [the] maximum of influence, and the European Jews would not stand for it, and hence the dissension between American and European leaders.</p>
   <p>To make the European Zionist leaders responsible for the downfall of Zionism in American seems to us to be the height of unreasonableness. The plain and simple truth is that if we would listen to the advice of our European friends, and place the Zionist movement here on a Jewish basis, and not on a basis of politics, we would have today a strong Zionist movement in America.</p>
   <p>That is what every serious-minded Zionist in America should bear in mind.</p>
