   <p>In Chicago they give, in New York they talk; in Chicago they do, in New York they discuss; in Chicago they are concerned with Jewish duties, in New York they are indifferent; in Chicago they have always collected their relief quota, in New York they have never collected the quota and even the pledges--the voluntary obligations--were not fulfilled. However, when it comes to voicing an opinion, it is New York which has the decisive voice, and what the Jews of the rest of the country think, is of no importance.</p>
   <p>Of the fourteen million dollars now being collected for relief purposes, New York has to give five million dollars, although, in all fairness, it should give eight million dollars, considering the size of its Jewish population. The prospects are that it will not give even three million dollars.</p>

   <p>Mr. Jacob Loeb is not an extremist. He is a man who counts his words, and who thinks twice before he says a word--and if Mr. Loeb said to a gathering of leaders and public citizens in New York, that New York was inhuman, that it was criminally indifferent and negligent in its duties--we can readily understand that the prospects for the success of the five million dollar drive are very slim. The socially conscious citizens of New York are angry and embittered over the indifference of the New York Jews to relief work.</p>
   <p>Judge Otto Rozalsky is one of the most beloved and popular Jewish leaders in New York. On the bench, he occupies the same position as Judge Landis in Chicago--he is strict, just and human. He is one of the most active social workers in New York. A relief committee, a few days ago, sent four thousand letters to businessmen in New York, asking them to attend a meeting at which Judge Rozalsky would discuss the conditions of the Jews in Eastern Europe. About two dozen people answered the invitation, which had been extended to four thousand, and the judge had to address empty <span class="page-break">3</span>chairs.</p>
   <p>Such a thing could not happen in Chicago. Were one of our relief organizations to invite four thousand Jews to a meeting, at least six hundred to a thousand Jews would respond, and the speakers would not have to address vacant chairs. However, New York laughs at Chicago, and looks down upon Chicago as if it were a backwoods community.</p>
   <p>A certain activity is felt in Chicago whenever a relief campaign goes on in the city. Not only every social worker, but every prominent and self-respecting citizen tries to make himself useful, and to do whatever he can to help the campaign. Men and women from all classes of the Jewish population, hundreds of women and hundreds of men who always live in quiet retirement, and never enter public life, become active when it is necessary to raise money for relief. It has been this way in Chicago for the past seven years.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is entirely different in New York. The leaders of the relief work can talk until they get hoarse, the newspapers can devote the largest part of their columns to the relief campaign, hundreds of speakers can orate in the synagogues, lodges, clubs, meetings--the public remains indifferent; it acts as if all the turmoil has nothing to do with it. The public at large never responds to any Jewish appeal; it doesn't respond to the relief appeal nor to the Zionist appeal. Were it not for the few hundred consistent philanthropists who contribute to every Jewish campaign, with a full, generous hand, New York would have never given even one million dollars for relief. New York is like that.</p>
   <p>Are the New York Jews like the Jews of Sodom? Are they not the same Jews as those of Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Boston? Yes, they are the same Jews, but the living conditions in New York are not the same as in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In those cities, almost every Jew can be reached, everybody knows everybody else, one has a feeling of regard for the opinion of one's neighbor. New York, on the contrary, is an <span class="page-break">5</span>abyss; it is impossible to reach the Jews there, because they are numerically too many, they are not sufficiently organized, one Jew does not know the other, and one has no feeling of shame before one's neighbors.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, every Jew is a [distinct] personality--in New York, every Jew is a social atom, one of a million and a half Jews. Everybody feels himself lost in the abyss and only the few who are very rich, or very talented, or very audacious can rise to the surface.</p>
   <p>Whenever an individual loses his sense of social responsibility, when he has no regard for the opinion of his neighbor, of his fellow man--he becomes an egocentric. Philanthropy presupposes a certain social philosophy, a certain emotional range, which is created in a certain social atmosphere. Philanthropy is impossible if this emotional response is absent, New York has none of the social or psychological conditions necessary for philanthropic activity, and for this reason, New York never responds to <span class="page-break">6</span>any philanthropic appeals. This explains why Jewish New York is so unproductive in the field of philanthropy.</p>
   <p>Jewish New York is, philanthropically, the smallest Jewish community in America because it gives less, per capita, than any other Jewish community; politically, New York is the greatest Jewish community in America. It has a great political appetite and the pocketbook of a poor man. That is why "the country Jews" are not enthusiastic about New York.</p>
