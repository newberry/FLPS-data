   <p>Again we appeal to the Jews of Chicago. Help the needy; help the war-sufferers. Do not remain indifferent to the fate of our brothers who have been robbed, degraded, and made wretched; who have been left so poor that they die of hunger and the diseases caused by hunger.</p>
   <p>A national misfortune has befallen us; it is the misfortune of each and every one of us.</p>
   <p>Those whom this misfortune has befallen, have suffered for the nation, for all of us. They have a right to our aid, and a right to demand such aid. Our pride and conscience must rise to fulfil this necessary debt.</p>
   <p>The Joint Relief Committee, with offices at 720 West Twelfth Street, has begun <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a movement in Chicago to send a food ship to the needy. We must send this food ship as quickly as possible; the sooner we do so, the more Jewish children will we save from death.</p>
   <p>Take an active part in collecting food for the ship. Give, and see that others give too. You must not permit just a few Jews in the city to do all the work, you must help them.</p>
   <p>In helping them, you help your brothers. Remember! They must not become beggars. Our brothers and sisters have reached the stage where they have to beg for bread, and they are so weak that they cannot even do that. They were well-to-do; they were store-keepers, workers, tradesmen, people of wealth, who never in their lives needed outside aid, and now have nothing, absolutely nothing.</p>
   <p>We must help them to regain their former positions, and we will be able to do it, if they remain alive. They will die, as tens of thousands of them have already died, if they are not, in the meantime, supplied with food.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Contribute your share and help feed them. Chicago Jews, send food or money to buy food, so that the boat may be loaded and sent on its way as soon as possible.</p>
