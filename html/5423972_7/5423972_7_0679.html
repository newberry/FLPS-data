   <p>The United Jewish Charities of Chicago are preparing the Jewish public for a two and a half million dollar campaign to take place sometime in March or April. The money to be collected during the campaign is to be devoted to the establishment of a Nurses' Home for the Michael Reese Hospital, which will cost in the neighborhood of one million dollars, to a Lawndale Jewish People's Institute, and eventually to the development of the Mt. Sinai Hospital. It has not yet been finally determined whether the Mt. Sinai Hospital will get anything out of this drive because the gentlemen at the head of these charities believe that a palatial Nurses' Home for the Michael Reese Hospital is more necessary than enabling the Mt. Sinai Hospital to get fifty or one hundred beds more so that it can admit all those who want to be admitted. We understand that the leaders of the United Jewish Charities contemplate devoting the first million dollars of the two and one half million dollar building fund to the establishment of a Nurses' Home. If, after a year or <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>so, more money will be forthcoming, the Mt. Sinai Hospital will get a part of it. For the time being, however, it will get nothing, but it is called upon to help in the drive.</p>
   <p>We believe that the building-fund drive planned by the United Charities is altogether superfluous. The Michael Reese Hospital does not need a Nurses' Home to cost a million dollars and the Lawndale district does not need a Jewish Peoples Institute. If the West Side Jews need a center for their young people, they can and will establish it without the aid of the United Charities. The many synagogues of the Lawndale District, as well as the many young peoples' organizations, will see to it that such a center be established. The only actual need of the community now is a new home for the Mt. Sinai Hospital, for its present home is quite inadequate to the needs of the district. At present, the Mt. Sinai Hospital can only accommodate a limited number of patients. To do justice to the sick and needy, the Mt. Sinai Hospital must have at least two hundred beds, and to get them, a new building--to cost half a million dollars--must be established. To deny hospital accommodations to our poor and sick on the West Side and to build a palatial <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Nurses' Home of a million dollars for the Michael Reese Hospital is nothing short of criminal. If the leaders of the Michael Reese Hospital are anxious to ape the other big hospitals in the city, let them pay for the luxury from their own pockets, but they have no right to come to the hundred thousand Jews on the West Side and to the seventy-five thousand Jews on the North Side and say: Give us money so that we can establish a palatial home for the nurses of our hospital that is not Jewish in spirit and that caters to as many non-Jews as to Jews. The West Side and Northwest Side Jews would be really destructive to their own ends and rights if they give a single cent for a million-dollar Nurses' Home for the Michael Reese Hospital. Before the West Side and Northwest Side Jews give anything for this purpose, they are in honor and duty bound to see to it that their own hospital, the only real Jewish hospital in the city, always jammed to capacity and often over-crowded, is in a position to develop its service to the community so that it can do justice to the sick and the poor, and even then the West and Northwest Side Jews will have no reason and no right to help build a million-dollar palace for nurses, because it will serve no useful purpose. A nurse must be modest and humble; she must minister to the sick and the poor not for the money <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>alone, and she must live a modest and humble life. To place her in a million-dollar home is to compel her to travel the road of frivolity.</p>
   <p>For these and other reasons, we believe that the contemplated two and a half million dollar drive is altogether superfluous. While half of our people in Eastern Europe are starving, and while we have to provide thousands of Chalutzim with workers in Palestine, we cannot indulge in such luxuries as the leaders of the United Jewish Charities would like [to] provide for the nurses of the Michael Reese Hospital. But this is not the only consideration. The real consideration is that while the community badly needs a large kosher Jewish hospital, and while it is badly in need of at least ten more Talmud Torahs, we cannot go ahead and just waste our money on luxuries. The only drive for local charities that would have a justification would be a drive for the Mt. Sinai Hospital, but since the drive contemplated by the United Charities is not for the Mt. Sinai Hospital, it is superfluous and will, therefore, not be supported by the West Side and Northwest Side Jews. If our wealthy people on the South Side want to equip a palatial Nurses' Home for the Michael Reese Hospital, which is not a strictly Jewish hospital, let them pay for it.</p>
