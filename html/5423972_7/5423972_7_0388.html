   <p>The employment bureau of the Chicago Amalgamated issued a statistical report last week showing that an improvement can be seen in the tailoring industry. The shops specializing in ready-made garments show an improvement, although many special-order shops have been closed during the past two months. It seems that the ready-made shops are rather busy now compared with the recently ended slack season, if one is to judge from the demand of manufacturers for union workers.</p>
   <p>The employment bureau's statistics concerning unemployment show that during the first two months of this year, fewer workers registered for jobs than in the last two or three months of the preceding year. This proves that <span class="page-break">\2</span>unemployment among Chicago tailors is gradually decreasing.</p>
   <p>Preparations are being made now to begin to pay out unemployment insurance on May first. The unemployment insurance fund bureau had some doubts about its ability to begin the payment of unemployment benefits on May first. This doubt has now been removed. The office of the unemployment fund regularly receives their pay roll contributions from the manufacturers. This is a sure proof that unemployment insurance benefits will begin to be paid out on May first.</p>
