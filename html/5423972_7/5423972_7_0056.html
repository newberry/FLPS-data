   <p>In the presence of a large enthusiastic crowd yesterday afternoon, the ground-breaking exercises for the annex to the home for the aged, on Albany and Ogden Ave. took place.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Sol Silver, Mr. Israel Cowen, Mrs. Benjamin Davis and Mr. A. Margolis, president of the home, spoke during the ceremonies. The ground was broken by Mr. Margolis with a shovel that was beautifully decorated with the National colors. This honor was extended to him by the board of directors for his untiring activities, on behalf of the aged.</p>
   <p>It was interesting to observe how quietly this ceremony was carried out, and how intently the public listened to the words assuring everyone of the valuable services the home will render to the aged. As it was stated yesterday, everything will be in readiness for the laying of the cornerstone in about two weeks.</p>
