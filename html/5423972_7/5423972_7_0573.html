   <p>More than a million and a half dollars was pledged inside of a little more than an hour last Sunday night at the opening in the Auditorium of the drive for $2,500,000 for Jewish charity and institutional work in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The largest sum was contributed by Julius Rosenwald, who handed Jacob M. Loeb, presiding at the meeting, a check for $150,000, and followed it up with another for $5,000 to establish a memorial fund for the late Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, of Sinai Congregation.</p>
   <p>Among other large subscriptions were $50,000 each from Edward Katzinger and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Maurice L. Rothschild, $30,000 each from A. D. Lasker, Albert H. Loeb, Max Straus, and Simon W. Straus, and $25,000 each from Max Epstein, Harry Hart, Max Hart, and Samuel J. T. Straus. Twenty-thousand-dollar contributions were received from the Selz family and the Spiegel family. Henry Friend and Herman Mollner each gave $10,000. All the contributions were made payable over three years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loeb made an eloquent appeal for subscriptions at last night's meeting and Dr. Louis L. Mann, successor to Dr. Hirsch, made his first public address in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Judge Henry Horner, Judge Harry M. Fisher, and General Abel Davis, spoke next.</p>
   <p>Jacob M. Loeb's speech, that helped loosen the purse strings of the assembled <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>at the Auditorium, was as follows:</p>
   <p>"It is my lot to welcome this large, this magnificent audience. I approach my task with diffidence but not without courage. You are thrice welcome.</p>
   <p>"In the name of those Jews who have and give freely, I welcome you as fellow donors. They feel the blessedness of service. They know the rewards of sacrifice. They give not only because they would relieve others, but because they would be true to themselves. They invite you to share with them in the inestimable joy of giving.</p>
   <p>"In the name of those Jews who lack and need, I welcome you as beneficent friends. Some lie sick and suffering. Fevers are consuming them. Others <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>want only opportunity for the physical and cultural training which is already yours. Not by their gratitude, but by your own self-esteem will you be repaid. They are crying out to you, that you may not be degraded when you pass judgment on yourselves.</p>
   <p>"In the name of high-minded leaders among non-Jews, I welcome you as enlightened instructors. They have tried but so far failed to teach the lessons and value of unstinted giving. Their eyes are upon you tonight. We are to be an example for them and theirs to emulate. They are urging you not to disappoint them.</p>
   <p>"This is an historic event, an epoch-making evening. The United Drive for $2,500,000, which is here being launched, is a stupendous undertaking. No one realizes that this is so better than those responsible for promoting it. More is being asked of the Jewish community at one time than ever before.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>But never before was so much needed, never before was a cause so worthy. We are to build a Nurses' Home and Training School, a new Mount Sinai Hospital and new branches for the Jewish People's Institute. Are we driving for just cold stone, brick and mortar? No! We are to build a new Jewish community, a new Jewishness. We are providing for the future. We are protecting the homes and firesides of our children's children. We are forging safeguards against revolutionism. We are raising bulwarks against anti-Semitism. We are placing a new value on the Jew, raising him in his own estimation and in that of his neighbor.</p>
   <p>"But my task is not to tell you of our projects and their importance. That is for others more capable. You are anxiously waiting on their dulcet tones and eloquent words. I shall detain you but a moment longer: just a word. Ours may be a prolonged Drive. This will be a long meeting. Please, please, stick to the finish of both. Do this for the sake of those who have gone <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>before, who have suffered bitterly and died because they were Jews. Do it for the sake of the thousands yet unborn! In the name of your forefathers and your posterity, do not quit until we have done.</p>
   <p>"If you won't, who will?"</p>
   <p>The speech of Mr. Loeb was greeted with tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>Rosa Raisa, grand opera star, and her husband, Giocama Rimini, made the evening notable from a standpoint of entertainment.</p>
   <p>Donors to this fund, collection of which will continue during May, have the assurance that their money will be carefully conserved and expended to get the greatest results. It is not a fund to be spent at random after <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>collection. A budget for the amount already has been made out by the directors of the charities. Here are some of the items included in the budget:</p>
   <p>Building of a nurses' home and training school at Michael Reese Hospital, and the extension of the social service from that center.</p>
   <p>Enlarging and rebuilding Mount Sinai Hospital into an institution of 150 beds.</p>
   <p>Establishing a new branch of the Jewish People's Institute in the Lawndale District, the Jewish population of which now numbers more than 100,000.</p>
   <p>Carry on welfare, ethical and Americanization work among the 285,000 Jews living in the several Jewish communities of the city.</p>
   <p>All of the activities are directed toward better health, better citizenship, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and better community life, which will have its strong reaction on the health, citizenship, and the progress of the entire city.</p>
   <p>The Headquarters of the Drive are at 321 Plymouth Court. Do not wait for solicitors--send in your contribution.</p>
