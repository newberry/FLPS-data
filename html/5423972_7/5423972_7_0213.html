   <p>"Chicago Hebrew Institute"--those three words, which indicate the title of the institution on Taylor and Lytle Streets, are now being considered by the directors. A motion has been made to change the name: instead of Chicago Hebrew Institute, the institution would be called Chicago Jewish Institute, or Jewish Peoples Institute. The opposition is to the word Hebrew, of which term our so-called German Jews are ashamed because anti-Semitically inclined Gentiles make fun of the word Hebrew. These German Jews [no more] represent the Americanized, civilized Jew than the Jew who wears a stiff derby pulled over his ears which, when knocked down, covers his face and makes him look silly, represents the Jew.</p>
   <p>There was a time when our so-called German Jews were ashamed of the word Jew.</p>
   
   <p>They thought that Hebrew was a better, a more refined expression. They belived that the word Hebrew put the Jew in a more favorable light. They fought the name Jew and sought to influence the press to call them Hebrews, not Jews. When the institute on Taylor Street was organized, they fought the West Side Jews in order to have the institution called the Hebrew Institute and not the Jewish Institute.</p>
   <p>Times change, however. The so-called German Jews began, just like the Russian, Rumanian, Hungarian, and Galician Jews before them, to feel the hostility of the non-Jews and as they came closer, their adherence to our ranks became stronger and stronger, until they became Jews like ourselves. They are interested in all Jewish activities and many of them have become good Zionists. All this was caused by the contempt of the Gentiles on the one hand, and the efforts of the Reform rabbis on the other. Orthodox Jews may have their own opinion about the Reform rabbis. They may not agree with them. They may dislike the shortening of the Prayer Book, the playing of the organ in the temple, and the singing of a choir of Gentile girls. The Orthodox Jews may stay away from the temple but there is one thing they will have to admit--had it not been for the efforts of the Reform rabbis, the Jewish ranks would have been greatly diminished.</p>
   <p>The Reform rabbis have kept a great many within the fold of the Jewish people. They are a great comfort to us. Their great charities benefit our poor and needy. Together with them, we can put up a front which the Gentiles respect, at least officially.</p>
   <p>Now, as well as before, we, the Jews of Eastern Europe, believe that no matter what we may be called--we are Jews. It makes no difference to us by what name the institution on Taylor Street is called. But to change the name of the institution, after so many years of activity under the name of Hebrew Institute, is both unjust and foolish. The name Hebrew Institute is dear to the hearts of thousands of Jews in this city who have benefited by it and who have helped it to become important.</p>
   <p>The word "Jew" is no more in fashion than the word "Hebrew" is out of fashion. Changing the word Hebrew for the word Jewish will give an opportunity to the anti-Semites and cynics to make various sarcastic or malicious remarks. Even Jewish cynics will not keep quiet. They believe that the Institute is not doing the work which we think it is doing, and that the word Jewish will not convince anyone that it is different from what it actually is.</p>
   <p>"The name 'Hebrew Institute' has become a symbol not only to the Chicago Jews but to the Jews of other cities, who have always taken note of all the activities that have been going on under the roof of that institution during all these years." This is the opinion of Nathan D. Kaplan, former president of the institution and one of its founders and supporters.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaplan's opinion on this matter is correct, and it is to be expected that he will resolutely defend his point of view when this question is taken up by the directorate.</p>
   <p>If a majority of the directors decide to substitute the word Jewish for Hebrew on the facade of the building, we, too, would suggest a minor change: "Hebrewize" the inside of the institution. If the inside of the institution is Hebrewized, then the Jews will forgive the changing of the name, although, it would be a crime to change the name, regardless.</p>
   <p>Hebrew Institute was a name that was good enough for sixteen years. May the institute continue to keep that name.</p>
