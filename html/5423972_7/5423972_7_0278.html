   <p>The English Educational Club of the Hebrew Institute, which was founded in 1909 by Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, superintendent of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, will tender a colorful spectacle Sunday evening in honor of its annual anniversary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lipsky accomplished a great deal by founding such a club. He now can feel proud of his work which has brought such fine results. But the greatest compliment is due to the club. We see former students of the club, who are now making further progress in their studies in various universities, and also who occupy an honorable place in the business world.</p>
   <p>The anniversary will be celebrated in the Chicago Hebrew Institute with a rich program.</p>
