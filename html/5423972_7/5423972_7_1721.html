   <p>Chief Rabbi Isaac Finger on ha-Yeshivah ha-Kedoshah Torath Haim (The Holy Theological Seminary The Tree of Life) came here from Jerusalem on his usual annual trip to collect donations for the Yeshivah. The Rabbi and his religious messengers are well known to us here in Chicago. The Rabbi has all the proper recommendations and credentials from the most prominent rabbis, showing that he is the authorized collector for the Jerusalem Yeshivah. All monies collected by him will go to the right channel. Our great Rabbi, Ben Zion Laizerovitz, who himself visited the Seminary in Jerusalem, can testify to the reliability and integrity of Chief Rabbi Finger.</p>
   <p>We now appeal to the Jewish public in Chicago. It is the duty of every good Jew to contribute as much as possible to this worthy Yeshivah. Send your contributions to Mr. Newberger, 1115 West 14th Street.</p>
