   <p>A year ago, a Jewish policeman named F. H. Asteler was killed on the corner of Twelfth and Halsted Streets by an automobile. He was on duty regulating traffic so that people might cross in safety. This Tuesday, at the dedication of the monument, the widow, although herself a poor woman, and others present collected thirty-two dollars for Jewish war-sufferers. The money was given to the office of the Joint Relief, 720 West Roosevelt Road.</p>
