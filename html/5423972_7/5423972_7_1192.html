   <p>Last Friday Chicago rabbis issued an appeal through the Courier to the Jewish public of Chicago and vicinity to remember their unfortunate brothers across the sea, when they bought their matzoth for Passover. The appeal is a poignant one and we are reprinting it so as to impress everyone:</p>
   <p>"To the Jews of Chicago and vicinity:</p>
   <p>"The Passover holiday is approaching. Every Jew is preparing to welcome the holiday with the best of everything. But while we make these preparations for the holiday, we must not forget that about six million Jews have been ruined by the war, and many of them are unable to buy matzoth, wine, and meat, not to mention clothing or other things. Many of these Jews have no place to rest their heads or to warm their frozen bodies. Unfortunate and <span class="page-break">\2</span>desolate, they plead, 'Save us, help us'.</p>
   <p>"If everyone would give twenty cents or a quarter, it would be enough to provide our poor unfortunate brothers with matzoth. When you buy matzoth, don't forget to remind the storekeeper to place a special relief-stamp on your matzoth packages, a two-cent stamp on a five-pound package, and a four-cent stamp on ten-pound packages. The Almighty will bless you for this, and will shower good fortune upon you and your families."</p>
   <p>At the same time we wish to call the attention of the local Jewish public to the Moes Chitim (donations to supply the poor with matzoth, wine and other foodstuffs for the Passover) for the needy Jews of Chicago. Not everyone in our community enjoys great prosperity. We have in our midst many sick persons who are unable to work, and those who do work but are not earning enough to provide for themselves and their families. There are many widows in our <span class="page-break">\3</span>community. Throughout the year they manage to get by somehow. For the Passover, though, they need more, and they should be able to sit around a table laden with appropriate Passover food which costs more. They cannot afford to buy this food and we must provide them with it.</p>
   <p>For the past few years a remarkable system has been functioning in Chicago to help the poor celebrate Passover in a manner befitting Jews. All that the poor have to do is to register, and they are supplied with matzoth, groceries, meat and a few dollars in cash, without embarrassment. It is a splendid custom!</p>
   <p>In order to continue the custom this year, a meeting of rabbis and representatives of synagogues has been called for tomorrow evening at the Waller Street Talmud Torah where all arrangements will be made to provide needy Jews with food for the Passover.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>No one who is able to attend, should fail to be present at the meeting tomorrow evening.</p>
   <p>The allotment of wine used by Jews for Passover and other religious celebrations, as arranged in Washington, has not been disclosed yet. We know that a rabbi of a congregation has the right to issue a permit to his members for the use of wine, but we do not know through what channels the wine will reach the homes of the members. Some state that the rabbi issues the permit to the wine dealer and the latter delivers the wine to the member; others say that only the rabbi can handle the wine, but he can give it away or sell it. A ruling from the Collector of Internal Revenue is expected.</p>
   <p>In Illinois the matter is somewhat complicated because of the "search and seizure" law, a law of which very little was heard until now, but one of which we are hearing more and more of late.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The "search and seizure" law of Illinois states that state authorities can, at any time, enter your home to search [for] and seize alcoholic beverages if they find them. But when the national prohibition law went into effect, the Federal Government made a concession allowing everyone to keep a little wine and whiskey for his own use. This allowance led to the abrogation of the "search and seizure" law by our wise Attorney General, Mr. Brundage.</p>
   <p>But times have changed! The young attorney, Sam Antonoff, has become Assistant Attorney General. Unable, apparently, to find any other activity to occupy his term of office, he permitted himself to be "assigned" to the liquor-traffic branch. He wants "to regulate the liquor traffic in order to prevent blasphemy", and he threatens to enforce the "search and seizure" law.</p>
   <p>Well, there can be no greater blasphemy than to have Sam Antonoff begin to raid Jewish homes and Jewish religious celebrations, and to confiscate the wine found there! No greater blasphemy can occur than to have Sam Antonoff <span class="page-break">\6</span>bring Jews to court, charging them with possession and consumption of wine!</p>
   <p>Regardless of the procedure, the liquor problem will be regulated by the Federal Government, and, somehow, Jews will have wine for the Passover and other religious celebrations. We, therefore, advise Sam Antonoff not to be foolish, if he sincerely wishes to prevent a blasphemy.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Joint Relief Committee is calling a convention of Jewish representatives of the Middle West for Sunday, March 14, at the Sherman Hotel. The purpose of the convention is to discuss important questions and to formulate new plans for further relief activities in these states.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. J. Bronstein, acting secretary of the Joint Relief Committee, with offices at 720 West 12th Street, recently issued invitations to representatives of synagogues, lodges, vereins and various organizations to elect delegates <span class="page-break">\7</span>to the convention. Each organization is entitled to one delegate, and an additional one if it has more than a hundred members.</p>
   <p>The great majority of orthodox Jews must be organized for charity purposes. There is no better way of organizing than to come together and formulate plans for co-operation in this work.</p>
