   <p>The Jews of the North Side have established a Jewish Educational Alliance as a center for the youth of the North-West Side. For years the Jewish population has been growing rapidly and now they count in the thousands. They have purchased the old Marks Nathan Orphan Home building which will be enlarged and improved. $16,000 was paid at once, and the balance is to be paid when the orphans will have moved to their new quarters. Efforts are being made to place the new institute on a self supporting basis. The officers elected are D. Koenigsberg, president, L. Siegel, secretary and Adolph Blender, treasurer.</p>
