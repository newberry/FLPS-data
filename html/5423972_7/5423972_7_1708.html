   <p>A body is now being organized under the name of Central Bureau, which will embrace all charity affairs undertaken by Chicago Jewry. Until now, the Central Bureau centered its work around the charity activities of our German brethern, but the orthodox charities will shortly unite with the Central Bureau or will establish a Central Bureau for the Jewish orthodox charities.</p>
   <p>There is no reason for having a separate Central Bureau of Orthodox Charities even though there exist diversities of opinions on the distribution of charity. A separate Central Bureau will only affect those in need of aid by curtailing and impeding their relief.</p>
   <p>What is the purpose of the Central Bureau?</p>
   <p>The Central Bureau wants to unite the charities and to attain the best results in the easiest manner as the Federated or the Associated Jewish Charities have in view.</p>
   <p>Until now, the situation was so:</p>
   <p>A poor family consisting of either an aged father or mother living with a widowed daughter or son, who have children who are ill, find it necessary to <span class="page-break">2</span>apply for relief.</p>
   <p>At this point, the business of applications appear. They would apply at the orphan home, the Home for the Aged, the hospital, the Women's Loan Institution, Jewish Aid Society, and at other such institutions. Each of these then sent out an investigation committee consisting of trained social workers, and each committee used to submit to the various bodies different reports. The home of the unfortunate family became an exposed position, they were exposed to all sorts of impertinent investigation by various people; in most cases the reports did not agree. When one body, according to its report, had agreed to render relief, a second body interfered by declaring relief to be unnecessary.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee wants to abolish such chaos in the giving of direct relief, just as the Federated or the Associated Jewish Charities wants to abolish the collecting of money for charity purposes. It aims to limit the professional investigators. The Central Committee wants established means by which charity can be equalized.</p>
   <p>Any case of need that will be reported to any charity organization, will be immediately referred to the Central Committee whose object will be to become familiar with the conditions of the family. If it materializes as we have mentioned above the families will not need to contact the different charities. They will <span class="page-break">3</span>merely approach the representatives of the bureau, and the bureau will provide for each member of the family according to his needs. The bureau will then see that the various charity institutions fulfill their obligations, and in many cases, the bureau shall see that the family is not broken up.</p>
   <p>Under the present system of charity, it isn't unusual to find a few children of one family in the Marks Nathan Home; their brothers or sisters in the Chicago Home for Jewish Orphans; other brothers and sisters in the hands of the Jewish Home Finding Society; and still others in the Home for the Friendless. They are brought up in different surroundings. They become strange to one another. The mutual relationship between brothers and sisters is torn assunder.</p>
   <p>The Central Bureau will abolish this.</p>
   <p>The Central Bureau will be a good thing. Its work will be to register, cooperate, and investigate all cases of charity. It would be desirable if our charitable institutions would get in touch with the Bureau as soon as possible. Just as the Federation introduced order and responsibility on the financial side of our charities, so will the Central Committee establish order and responsibility in the welfare of our institutions.</p>
