   <p>As is known, the Federation [of Jewish Charities] supports, among other institutions, the Hebrew Shelter Home on Morgan Street at the corner of Maxwell Street. The question has arisen, among certain individuals, of erecting a new shelter home to compete with the one already in existence. Now the time has come for the Jews of Chicago to become familiar with all the facts concerning this matter.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Shelter Home, which is supported by the Federated Charities, is so well organized and adapted to the task it serves that it is praised by everyone. It has a distinguished board of directors; it has all the necessary conveniences, and is run in a strictly orthodox fashion.</p>
   <p>The facilities and equipment of the Hebrew Shelter Home are adequate for the assistance of the needy strangers who come to our town. [Translator's <span class="page-break">2</span>note: It is a custom among Jews to provide strangers who come to a town, with food and shelter until these people establish themselves.] There is absolutely no need to spend $25,000 to construct a new building in competition to the existing Hebrew Shelter Home, and thus impose on the Jewish public an additional annual expense of from $6,000 to $8,000.</p>
   <p>The erection of a new shelter home is based on selfish motives, and not on the need for [additional] social work in our community. To permit the building plans to continue, would not be fair to the Jewish public who will have to stand the expense. For the above-mentioned reasons, I am of the opinion that to start building an institution to compete with an existing one, would not only be a waste of money and energy, but would also impose a useless tax on the Jewish community, by urging it to support another institution for which there is, at present, not the slightest need.</p>
   <p>The Federated Charities supports the existing Hebrew Shelter Home. Proper <span class="page-break">3</span>attention is given to every Jew who goes there. The board of the Federated Charities, wishing to save unnecessary expense, tried in every way to avoid this dispute and to reconcile both parties. But despite all efforts it did not succeed. In the face of these facts, I deem it my duty to urge the Jewish public of Chicago to make all of their contributions to the one organized body, which is the Orthodox Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>The Jewish people can rest assured that this statement is not made for the sake of argument. It is based on the actual conditions as they exist. Therefore the public should not be misled by a statement that may be contrary to this.</p>
   <p>James Davis, President of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities <span class="page-break">4</span>Another Appeal By All Synagogue Presidents</p>
   <p>Last night at a meeting of synagogue presidents in the Ohavey Sholom Congregation, the decision was made to publicize the following appeal to Chicago Jewry regarding the Hebrew Shelter Home:</p>
   <p>We, the presidents of the Chicago Orthodox Congregations, turn to the great Jewish public with the request that it should not permit the Jewish community-funds to be misused. Everyone knows that for the past three months, the rabbis have tried by every means, to reconcile the authorities of the Hebrew Shelter Home and those who are planning to build another one.</p>
   <p>Much to our regret, the efforts of the rabbis have been in vain. The people who intend to erect this building refused to heed the counsel of others, and are proceeding with their plans which will cost the public twenty-five thousand dollars a year to maintain. We do not need such an organization. Both the work and the money will be wasted. We have a <span class="page-break">5</span>splendid shelter home on Morgan Street, a home which is strictly Kosher, and is large enough to accommodate more inmates than it has.</p>
   <p>We request, therefore, all synagogues in Chicago to appoint delegates to represent them at the large mass meeting which will be held Thursday evening in the Waller Street Talmud Torah (Hebrew School). This dispute should be resolved at this meeting. In the meantime, we ask all the Jews in Chicago to refrain from contributing to the new shelter home fund.</p>
   <p>No synagogue should fail to appoint delegates who will have to act as judges in rendering a decision concerning the Hebrew Shelter Home, in behalf of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago.</p>
