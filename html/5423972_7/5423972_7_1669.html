   <p>Dear Editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>I have wondered why the Rabbis gave their consent to the Federation. Must one get the consent of a Rabbi to know that gold is gold and that this is good and useful? Anyone can say so, and thus it is with the Federation. But, just as everything can stand improvement; as, when gold is found in the gold mines in the form of small nuggets, it must be hammered and smelted to purify it, so too, the Federation can be improved upon. The improvement should be as follows: To help the needy they must be given an Eve or several Eves. I mean that the Federation should establish or bring new life to the old Ladies Auxiliaries, for those institutions that need the most money, for example, the Marks Nathan Orphan Home. These are not to be independent auxiliaries but act as a part of the Federation.</p>
   
   <p>I do not pretend to give advice on how this is to be done for the Federation has enough smart practical people who will know of a method to formulate this idea, should they once take it into earnest consideration.</p>
   <p>I recommend this idea of the Ladies Auxiliary because I know it to be a fact dating back to the beginning of the world, that women have done much to aid human welfare.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Federation has added to its list many large subscribers, but has lost many hundreds of dollars from small subscribers of 25 cents a month and even 5 cents a week. In many small households the housewife would gladly give 25 cents a month and the husband would contribute $3 a year. They feel ashamed to subscribe such a small sum, yet they cannot afford more. Thus he is lost to the Federation.</p>
