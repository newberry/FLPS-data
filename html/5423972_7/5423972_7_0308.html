   <p>Tomorrow evening, the second opening dance will be given by the Hebrew Institute. These dances which are given by the Hebrew Institute will take place every Saturday evening. The dance of last week met with great success.</p>
   <p>We are hoping that these dances will bring the desired effect and draw our Jewish youth away from the cheap dance halls, which are a disgrace to the West Side.</p>
