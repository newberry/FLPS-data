   <p>The Keren Hayesod in Chicago has collected up to now about forty-five thousand of the seventy-five thousand dollars pledged to it. Had the collecting been done in a more organized fashion, the whole amount of seventy-five thousand dollars would have been collected by now, but for various reasons, not all the money that was pledged has been collected. Taking everything into consideration, the Keren Hayesod has not been a success in Chicago. To those who claim that if Mr. Brandeis had been at the head of the movement in America, everything would have been better, it is important to point out that the entire income of the last Registration Fund Drive in Chicago was one hundred thousand dollars. No matter how ineffectual the Keren Hayesod in Chicago has been, nevertheless, it has been more successful than the Registration Fund Drive. Thus, it can be seen that the small success which the Keren Hayesod has enjoyed up to now, in Chicago, has nothing to do with the question of leadership.</p>
   
   <p>The cause of the limited success of the Keren Hayesod in Chicago can be found in the fact that not enough people are active in the work, and even those few people who really do something for the Keren Hayesod, are not doing enough. As long as there isn't a group of one hundred individuals in Chicago, devoting themselves to Keren Hayesod work, just so long will the Keren Hayesod be unsuccessful. Chicago Jews are not at fault, but the Keren Hayesod Committee is.</p>
