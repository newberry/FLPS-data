   <p>Saturday evening, at a meeting of synagogue presidents, it was decided that on the last day of Passover, an appeal should be made in all the synagogues in behalf of the war sufferers. This resolution was passed after a committee composed of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein and B. Horwich of the Central Relief [Committee], had stressed the needs of the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman, Sam Rosenthal, Sam Ginsburg, and Dr. S. M. Melamed represented the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], and urged the synagogue presidents to arrange a cordial reception for Dr. Weizmann, when he arrives here April 15. It was decided to arrange a banquet in honor of Dr. Weizmann, and to present him with a check for $50,000, given for the Keren Hayesod. A committee of fifteen synagogue presidents was appointed to arrange the banquet.</p>
