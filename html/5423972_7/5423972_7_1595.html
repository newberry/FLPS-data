   <p>A group of prominent businessmen of Chicago will meet today in the office of B. J. Rosenthal, in the North American Building to discuss ways of raising funds for a new movement to aid the unemployed of Chicago. This group of businessmen is considering various [types of] relief for the unemployed, such as warehouses of food and other necessary commodities, a public wood and coal yard where the unemployed can find work, housework for wives of unemployed men, employment bureaus, etc. Also a plan is under discussion whereby unemployed skilled workers would be hired to teach unskilled workers a trade.</p>
   <p>The basic principle of this new organization is that relief is not to be given as charity, but as "loans". The recipients will have to pledge, on their word of honor, that they will pay for everything they receive. Accurate accounts will be kept of the things the unemployed receive. No one will receive aid from the organization without a recommendation from the Associated <span class="page-break">\2</span>Jewish Charities, the United Charities, or some other authorized charitable institution.</p>
