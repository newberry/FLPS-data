   <p>Thanks from the Jewish Shelter Home.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Jewish Home, we take this opportunity to thank the Society of Aid for the Homeless. We appreciate the interest the officers of the Jewish Shelter Home have taken in our Society by assisting us with a $1,000 donation to help us pay off the mortgage on the Shelter building.</p>
   <p>We especially thank the following gentlemen: Mr. B. Hurwitz, Mr. Max Schulman, Mr. H. Rubinstein, and Mr. I. Ginsberg, the representatives who paid the amount of $1537.50 to Mr. Simon Strauss, who was the holder of the mortgage. Mr. Schulman as an attorney has undertaken the work of recording all legal documents and clearing the title of the Shelter House which we named "Father Abraham Hotel."</p>
   <p>We hope every Jew and Jewess in Chicago will do all in his or her power to help us maintain this worthy house for the poor.</p>
   <p>Respectively</p>
   <p>Isaac Isaacs, Secretary.</p>
