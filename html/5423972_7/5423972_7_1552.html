   <p>"Jews of Chicago! Again comes the cry for help from our brethren in all the war countries and especially from the unluckiest of the Jews, in Lithuania, Poland and Kurland, who are being driven from town to town and village to village, who have no place to lay their heads, nor food with which to comfort their bodies.</p>
   <p>"We, the Rabbis of Chicago, know that every Jew of Chicago and vicinity did his utmost to help his unfortunate brethren in the present crisis. The noble Jewish reply to the want of bread in Palestine was swollen with many thousands of dollars. The merciful response of the Jews of Chicago on the unforgettable day of sadness was a rain of contributions of hundreds of dollars. We believe, that there isn't a Jew in Chicago and vicinity, who has not responded financially, more or less, to the need of our hunted and persecuted brethren.</p>
   
   <p>"But, dear brothers and sisters, our help is negligible in this great sea of loneliness and want, of hunger and thirst, which hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters are condemned to. Let us remember, that from the provinces of Kovno and Kurland alone, over 300,000 Jews - men, women and children, were suddenly exiled and are wandering now, naked and barefooted, hungry and thirsty. Now comes news of Jews being exiled from the provinces of Vilno, Grodno, Chelm and Lublin. It is estimated that a million Jews are now homeless, wandering through fields and forests. Their bare feet are swollen from walking and their bodies shrunken from hunger. They stretch out their withered hands for a little grass and are unable to get it.</p>
   <p>"And no one is able, nor wants to help our brethren. We must help them. If we are unable to help them with dollars, let us help them with cents. It is pitiful enough even to beg for dollars, but it is a thousand times worse, when a people have to beg for cents.</p>
   
   <p>"Only cents do a million people beg of us now - men, women and children of our own blood! In the name of these million souls, we the Rabbis of Chicago appeal to every man, woman and child of Chicago and vicinity, that each one of us, who comes to buy anything - foodstuff, clothing or anything else shall remember that unfortunate million Jews in the war torn countries and donate a cent for them.</p>
   <p>"You are buying your breakfast in the morning - it does not matter how much your breakfast amounts to - enjoy it, but remember to donate a cent for the Jews, who have nothing to eat.</p>
   <p>"When buying a suit, dress or shoes - for yourself, your wife or child, wear it in good health - but donate a cent for the naked and barefooted men, women and children in the war countries.</p>
   
   <p>When going out with your best girl and you buy her a box of candy, or an ice cream soda - enjoy it - but remember with a cent the young men and women, who pine away for a drink of water. Donate something, even though it is only a cent; donate every time, when thinking about yourself. Do not forget your unfortunate brethren. Jewish Children! Donate something, donate cents for the Jewish people, who turned beggars. The emergency committee for the unfortunate Jews in the war countries will place on sale one cent war stamps in every place, where Jews come to buy groceries, meat, clothing and other things. Buy a stamp from the storekeeper and pay him for it, for with each stamp you buy you are saving a Jewish life from starvation.</p>
   <p>"Beginning next week, let these war stamps be the symbol of Jewish sympathy. The store, which has the Jewish war stamps is and should be the place, where Jews must trade, where Jews must buy, and let the God of Israel block the hand of the demon, who transformed half of the universe into an ocean of blood in which the Jewish people are drowning. Oh, God! make an end to the Jewish sufferings! With eyes full of tears and with broken hearts, we the Rabbis of Chicago affix our names here:</p>
