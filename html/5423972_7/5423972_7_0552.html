   <p>Chicago Jews could have treated Mr. Louis Marshall better when he was here to make an appeal for the million-dollar drive for the Shachter Seminary. They could also have treated Judge Julian W. Mack better when he came here to make an appeal for the Palestine Development Company. Ten conservative Jewish congregations of Chicago could easily have given Mr. Louis Marshall fifty thousand dollars for the million-dollar fund of the above-mentioned institution, and Judge Mack should not have left Chicago without fifty thousand dollars for the Palestine Development Company, which certainly does constructive work in Palestine, and which would have been able to do a lot more if it had the necessary funds. The Palestine Development Company guarantees principal and interest to the investor so that no one loses anything by investing a few dollars in the Palestine Development Company.</p>
   
   <p>I am sorry that the two Jewish leaders left Chicago dissatisfied and disappointed. Both leaders deserved better treatment from the Chicago Jews.</p>
