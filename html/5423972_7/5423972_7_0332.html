   <p>The Institute extends a cordial invitation to Clubs already organized, and to individuals who wish to organize clubs, to come to the Institute, provided there is present the sincere desire to do definite work along artistic, musical, literary, or dramatic lines; or if the organization pursues some idealistic object, such as Zionism, Nationalism, Jewish-labor interests, immigration, literary, scientific, etc.</p>
