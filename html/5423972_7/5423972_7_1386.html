   <p>The officers of Major General Martin's division in Camp Grant were greatly surprised yesterday. They heard that Harry Horwitz, a private who was recently sent across to the Western Front, together with other soldiers from Camp Grant, had contributed to the Red Cross fifteen thousand dollars in cash and property in Harvey, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Horwitz is twenty-six years old. He came from Russia, and lived at 631 South Marshfield Avenue, Chicago, until he enlisted. While he was in the training camp, he received word from relatives that both his brothers, who were in the Russian army, had been killed by the Germans. Harry impatiently awaited the day when he was to leave for Europe and assured everyone that he would revenge himself upon the Germans. His will is proof that he was prepared even to die so long as he carried out his wish. In it (his will) he leaves the above-mentioned sum to the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>In Camp Grant they don't know whether or not Horwitz has fallen in battle. His comrades in the camp are watching the casualty lists.</p>
