   <p>The Kiev Relief Society of Chicago decided on July 5, 1921, to send $1,000 for their townspeople in Kiev who are stranded in Roumania at present.</p>
   <p>The money will be sent through the local office of the Ukrainian Alliance, through Dr. Joseph Krimsky, the President of the National Ukrainian Federation.</p>
   <p>They have decided, also, that all relief money which they send for their countrymen, will be sent only with responsible and social organizations, and by means of private individuals who leave for Roumania and Poland, because of personal reasons, and make the relief-work their business.</p>
