   <p>Sinai Temple was crowded last night with the Jewish aristocracy of Chicago. They listened carefully to the appeal for two million dollars, which is the local quota of the fourteen million dollar drive that is being conducted all over the country in behalf of Jewish pogrom- and war-sufferers on the other side of the ocean. Many wept as they heard about the terrible conditions there.</p>
   <p>Money flowed freely. Nearly a million dollars was collected. Various committees undertook to collect the second million within the next ten days, that is before the fifteenth of December, when the drive comes to an end.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, chairman of the committee in charge of the drive, presided at the meeting. The speakers were: Lieutenant James Hecker, David A. Brown <span class="page-break">2</span>of Detroit, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, and Judge Harry M. Fisher. The last speaker made the most powerful speech of the evening. He talked about his experience in the Ukraine, about the condition of the men, women and children there, who are naked, barefoot and hungry, about the pogroms which many Jewish towns and villages have experienced. He spoke particularly of the pogrom in Proskurow where Petliura's soldiers slaughtered thousands of Jews. He told about the huge grave in the cemetery there that he visited, a grave where all the martyrs are buried together. At the request of Judge Fisher, the audience rose to their feet to honor the memory of those martyrs. Dr. Hirsch said Kadish ( a prayer for the dead) and many tears were shed. Judge Fisher concluded his speech with the statement that the only help for the thousands and thousand of Jewish orphans, middle-aged and elderly men and women of Eastern Europe who live there in great fear and need, in loneliness and in danger of their lives, must come from the American Jews, and that he awaits the answer [of the South Side Jews].</p>

   <p>Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt's statement that the Central Relief Committee, Chicago branch, was giving one hundred thousand dollars for the fund was greeted warmly, and a storm of applause burst out when Mr. Rosenblatt, then and there, handed in a check for the above-mentioned sum.</p>
