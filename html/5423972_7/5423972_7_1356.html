   <p>The Peoples Relief and Its Campaign for Membership.</p>
   <p>Upon the successful conclusion of the Tag Day, Sunday April 20th, the Peoples Relief entered into a campaign for an increased membership. This movement for a large membership started several months ago but was retarded and weakened by the Day's Wages Campaign. Many organizations such as the Hebrew Workers, Bialistock Branch of the Workmens Circle, Pinsk Branch, and others were successful in their membership campaign, but others were unable to undertake two campaigns at once. Now all are expected to do their part. The volunteers will be making house to house canvasses until June 1st.</p>
