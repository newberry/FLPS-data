   <p>Tomorrow morning Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy] will be distributed at the Winchester Avenue Talmud Torah. Thus far only $2,500 have been collected for Ma-oth Hitim. The committee requests all synagogues to try and raise more money. At least ten thousand dollars will be needed for this Passover, since the number of needy is great.</p>
