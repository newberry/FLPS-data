   <p>Upon the request of the Jewish peddlers, there will now be issued Red Cross Stamps of one cent and up. Hitherto, the smallest stamp was twenty-five cents. The peddlers may obtain these stamps at the Blue Island Savings Bank, Twelfth Street and Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>The peddlers are doing very fine work for the Red Cross by paying for the stuff which they buy, with Red Cross Stamps.</p>
