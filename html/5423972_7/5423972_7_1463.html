   <p>The protracted Din Torah [lawsuit decided informally through voluntary arbitration according to Jewish or common law in a Beth Din] in which the Chicago Federated Charities and the independent builders of a new shelter home have been involved for the past two months, is slowly assuming the character of a comedy. For a number of years, the Jewish community in Chicago has been fighting the practice of squandering money, and the irresponsibility and inertia which exist in the welfare institutions. After a great deal of exertion and grief, the Federated Charities was organized. The Federated amalgamated the [charitable] institutions which had grown up in Chicago in the course of many years.</p>
   <p>Before the Federated came into existence, each institution had functioned as though it were an isolated Kingdom, responsible to no one but itself. Each <span class="page-break">2</span>institution had, on its own account, appealed to the public for money. The amount of money that the Chicago Jews contributed toward the maintenance of these institutions was seldom known. If an individual wanted to find out how much all these institutions had cost the Chicago Jews, he would have to go from one institution to another; he would have to inspect the accounts of each institution, and then, after all this, he would know nothing. Some of the institutions either kept no accounts at all, or, if they did, the bookkeeping was in such a poor condition that little could be learned about the debits and credits.</p>
   <p>The Federated Charities brought order out of chaos. The Federated supports, financially, the institutions affiliated with it, and a really competent bookkeeping system shows how much money is taken in, and how the money is spent. From time to time, financial reports are made public, and whoever wishes to find out the incomes and expenses of all the institutions, or of any single one, can do so.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It stands to reason that people with honest intentions and common sense will not seek to return to the state of chaos that formerly existed in the Jewish Orthodox charities. And when a person seeks to isolate himself and to run a separate institution without keeping accounts, or without any responsibility, we must suspect him of sinister and ulterior motives.</p>
   <p>The people who contemplate building a new shelter home arouse such suspicion. The Federated Charities support a well-equipped shelter home which is sufficient for Chicago. Another shelter home is absolutely unnecessary. Why a few people should spend public money, which fell into their hands before the Federated was established, to build a new shelter home, and why they should send out agents to collect nickels and dimes among the Jewish public, cannot be explained by anyone without casting suspicion on those people.</p>
   <p>At the session of the Din Torah which was held Thursday, Rabbi Saul Silber correctly stated that another Talmud Torah (Hebrew School) was far more <span class="page-break">4</span>necessary than another shelter home. The existing shelter home, under the supervision of the Federated, fills the requirements of the community. The rabbis have assembled seven times to listen to [a statement of] the grievances, and it is to be regretted that they have hitherto not had enough courage to come before the public with a statement that another shelter home is superfluous and that we must not squander charity funds.</p>
   <p>It was thought that by the establishment of the Federated, the business of collecting money from the public without justifiable reason, would once and for all times, be put to an end. The case of the new shelter home proves that there still exists a free-for-all. Whoever wishes to have some pretext in order to collect nickels and dimes, chooses his own charitable enterprise, and appeals for contributions.</p>
   <p>Before any Jew of Chicago donates to the new shelter home, he has a right to ask those at the head of that project: Who gave you the right to decide for all the Jews in Chicago whether or not another shelter home is needed?</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>To whom have you given an account of the money you have thus far collected, and in what manner have you disbursed this money? Who were the accountants who inspected your books?</p>
   <p>Unless these questions are satisfactorily answered, we don't see how anyone can give his support to the organizers of the new shelter home. This is not a free-for-all.</p>
