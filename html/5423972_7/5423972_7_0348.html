   <p>The work of this institution, as it has been outlined, by Superintendent Harry A. Lipsky, is of the utmost importance to the life of the whole community of which it is to serve as the social and educational centre. Here, if all goes well, the communal activity will centre and here many of the most vexing problems of the newly arrived immigrants will be solved out of hand.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that more than 6,000 Jews, chiefly recruited from the city populations of Russia, northeast Austria, and Roumania are poured annually into the West Side district tributary to the Chicago Hebrew Institute. The problem of adjusting these foreign-born residents to the new environment, so alien to them, and of fitting them to discharge with some fullness their duties as citizens of the American republic is one of much difficulty.</p>
   <p>Already the work of the institution has left its clear impress upon the life of the entire Jewish community, but its temporary quarters at 224 Blue Island Avenue are no longer adequate to care for the steady annual influx. When it became possible to acquire the property on West Taylor Street abandoned by the Seminary of the Sacred Heart, the board of directors was quick to seize the opportunity. Impetus was given the movement by the offer of Julius Rosenwald to make a loan of $75,000 for two years without interest, provided that the remainder of the purchase money could be raised by July 12. The fund now has grown to within about $10,000 of the amount.</p>
   <p>"The function of such an institution as that which we desire to found is literally the making of American citizens," said Mr. Lipsky, who has been in charge of the work for a year. "Its importance in forming ideals and directing conduct, it seems to me, cannot be exaggerated. Its activity must be manifold, and if it is to be carried on untrammeled, facilities must be furnished. In our present cramped quarters nothing like satisfactory work can be accomplished.</p>
   <p>"We have here in our midst, perhaps ninety-five per cent of all Jewish immigrants who make their way to Chicago. It must be recognized that they are essentially a city population. They have not been suffered to live out of the cities of Russia; they are unequipped for farm life and they will remain city dwellers here in America. The problem then is to assimilate this great foreign influx, to take the crude material of citizenship and mold it into form.</p>
   
   <p>"It is the aim of the institute to stimulate in the people a distinct intellectual life, to aquaint them with the fundamental facts of American government, and to rouse in them the qualities that make for good citizenship and for helpful, wholesome community life. It is no less the aim to give them well developed healthy bodies and to encourage the even development of their powers."</p>
