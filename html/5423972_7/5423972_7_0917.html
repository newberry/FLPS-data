   <p>Last night, the annual meeting of the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities took place at the La Salle Hotel. More than two hundred Jewish men and women, who are very much interested in the existence of Orthodox institutions in Chicago, were present. The meeting was preceded by a fish dinner. Reports were then given concerning the activity of the central charity organization. Directors of the Federation were elected, and approval was given to the election of directors of the various institutions that form the Federation. A resolution was adopted to enroll more members and to raise more funds for the treasury of the Federation.</p>
   <p>President James Davis, in his report, spoke of the great work of the Federation. He thanked those who had raised money for it, particularly Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt. He concluded by saying that he would like to see all Chicago Jews--from the West Side, from the South Side and from the North Side--united in one charitable organization; that there should not be [two organizations], an Associated and a Federated, but one organization, one central body, in whose behalf everybody should work. This central organization should support all of the charity institutions in Chicago. In his report, Mr. Davis also hinted that the Mt. Sinai Hospital, as well as other institutions which are now independent, should be taken into consideration when a merger is proposed.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman, the financial secretary of the Federation, declared in his report that the organization had a subscription list of 8,205 members at the beginning of 1922; that these members had pledged themselves to contribute the sum of $222,057.25 during the year; that the "home banks" had brought in the sum of $12,084.26; and that last year the income of the Federation was $216,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shulman said that he was in favor of including all the important Talmud Torahs in the Federation; he favors a Board of Education and an appropriation of sufficient money to maintain the teachers' seminaries.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald, Dr. S. M. Melamed and Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt also spoke. The violinist, Mr. Victor Young, played a few solos.</p>
