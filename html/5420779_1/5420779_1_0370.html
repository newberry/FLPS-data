   <p>The secretary of our Jugoslav Socialist Federation received a letter from Ljubljana, from Etbin Kristan, Socialist leader, in which letter Kristan announces that he will arrive in America without fail at the end of August.</p>
   <p>Comrade Kristan arrives to start a tour of lectures sponsored by the Jugoslav Socialist Federation. There are hardly three months left until his arrival and this short time has to be used for agitation if we want lectures and meetings given by Mr. Kristan to have the greatest benefit to our struggle.</p>
   <p>The locals of the Federation have to ask about details from the secretary. Do not delay. This year is one of great events, of big fights; strikes are everywhere, the presidential elections are near. Such times have to be used for our biggest Socialist campaign.</p>
   <p>We have to help our ranks and enlarge our press. For that purpose the journey of Mr. Kristan is made. We must not be unprepared, we must be ready!</p>
