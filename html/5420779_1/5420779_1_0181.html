   <p>The Chicago Union of Bakery Workers appeals to the workers and public in general:</p>
   <p>"Many times the organized bakery workers of Chicago tried to move the bakery firm of Aldrich Baking Company, at the corner of Clinton and Adams streets, to grant to its bakery workers better and more humans working conditions - but in vain.</p>
   <p>"The only means that remains for the workers of that firm is to organize themselves and with united forces fight for better working conditions.</p>
   <p>"The manager of that firm knows that well, for that reason he opposes any attempt to have his workers organized.</p>
   <p>"The wages of that firm are miserable. The majority of the workers receive #9.00 weekly. These conditions must be ended. Other workers must help the bakers.</p>
   <p>"Not one worker must buy bread of this firm. No class-conscious worker should buy bread without the union label. Workers! Remember that, tell your wives, housekeepers and friends about it. Help the bakery workers to receive better wages and net be slaves of capitalistic exploiters."</p>
