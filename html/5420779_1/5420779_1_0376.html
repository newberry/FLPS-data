   <p>The Jugoslav Socialist Association No. 6 celebrated May Day as a holiday on Sunday, April 30th.</p>
   <p>In spite of the poorly attended mass meeting, from a moral point of view, the day was a success.</p>
   <p>One of the speakers explained a proposal of four hours a day being sufficient to supply the needs of industry.</p>
   <p>Not a socialist, but an engineer, E. P. Stimson, endorsing capital, stated he believed four hours a day sufficient to maintain a sufficient supply for the demand, and also to leave a good reserve balance.</p>
   <p>The speaker backed his statement by submitting a plan to the Congressional Committee of Labor in Washington.</p>
   <p>That plan in substance stated that working time could be reduced to four hours a day, with better pay, more production and greater profit. Six shifts would be needed in twenty-four hours. Machinery should be improved and new installed where needed. Engineer Stimson demands that a committee of labor investigate his proposition, although it appears to the workers as thoroughly practical.</p>
   <p>There again comes an intelligent technician supporting a socialist idea. The Stimson's plan may be correct, but that workers will benefit by it is another question. Capitalists are the worse enemies of a short-hour day.</p>
