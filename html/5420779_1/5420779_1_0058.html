   <p>A law against alcohol has been in effect in the United States for some time, and the longer the law continues in existence, the more evident it becomes that the law is being broken everywhere and in many different ways. Drunkenness has not been abolished, and wine, whisky, and beer are still plentiful. Hundreds of thousands of homes have become like the saloons of former days. Moreover, people drink not only in their homes, but in public places as well, just as before Prohibition.</p>
   <p>The saloons are closed, it is true. And many Saloonkeepers who defy the law are being sentenced to jail. But what do they do to escape the penalty? They find some poor and hungry man, and pay him a hundred dollars, say, to serve out their jail sentence for them!</p>

   <p>In China, a condemned man can "buy" a substitute who will suffer the death penalty in his stead, the money going to the widow and children, or to the parents, of the proxy. In many savage tribes, it is the custom for the chieftain to sacrifice young girls to the tribal deity, to expiate his sins.</p>
   <p>There you have three different practices from three different parts of the world--Asia, Africa, and America. America is considered a civilized country. It is civilized--provided you consider extreme savagery to be civilization.</p>
