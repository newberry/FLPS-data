   <p>For the first time in the history of Branch No. 6 of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, an entertainment was held at which no liquor was permitted. It has long been the wish of our members to initiate this reform, because it was an unworthy spectacle to see drunk, staggering people leave our Socialist entertainments. Moreover, it was very hard to maintain order as long as drinking was permitted.</p>
   <p>Many of our comrades were dubious of the success of a "dry" entertainment; but events proved them wrong, and they are glad of it. To everyone's surprise, the evening was well attended, and excellent order prevailed throughout. Our entertainments will continue to be "dry" and orderly--in marked contrast to those arranged by the nationalist [i. e., nonsocialist] organizations.</p>
   <p>Our evening was an outstanding success in every respect. Everything was as it should have been, as the five hundred people who attended can attest.</p>
