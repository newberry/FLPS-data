   <p>The question about the movement of our youth is one of the most important problems. Who has the youth has the future of the world; who has the youth wins the victory.</p>
   <p>Karl Liebknecht said to the German opportunists: "Give me our youth, the rest you may keep." He took the youth, organized them, and today we have a forceful Communist Party and a strong Communist movement.</p>
   <p>That is our big problem of today. We have thousands of Jugoslav workers' familes whose children do not read any newspapers or books in our language. They read just English, but do not read either the Young Worker nor the Young Comrade. Their elders in great numbers read Radnik. To make it possible to educate the children in the workingman's spirit, we will publish each week reading matter in English that parents may be able to give to their children for reading. More about this later.</p>
