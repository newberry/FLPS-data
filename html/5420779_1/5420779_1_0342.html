   <p>The success of our federation depends on her tactics, of which the foundation must be its ideals, and ultimate aims.</p>
   <p>Active and purposeful tactics of our federation will help not only her development but will also promote the spread of socialism among Jugoslav working classes and do much good for the success of the Socialist movement in general in this country.</p>
   <p>The tactics of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, as its living element, must be based only on the interest for the working classes -- and the proletarian class struggle they have to be conducted in the name of final ideals of the proletarians - always keeping in mind social, political and economical conditions in America.</p>
   <p>Only such tactics will bring our Socialist federation on the right road and protect it from other influences of reformistic and opportunistic ideas and tactics from which suffer some Socialist parties and workers organizations abroad and here.</p>
   
   <p>The split of the Socialist party in France, the dissension of the same party in Germany, the shake up in Italy and Russia, like the existence of two Socialist parties in America -- all that is the result of discord in the tactics of the socialist movement.</p>
   <p>The disagreement on the most important and vital questions cause a split, creates trouble and reacts harmfully on workers' masses.</p>
   <p>In the main there exist two social classes in the United States which have political and economic value.</p>
   <p>On reciprocal class relations and struggles of both classes rests the development of America. In that hectic struggle between the American capitalism and the proletarians the Jugoslav working people takes active part, whose work and tactics have to be decided.</p>
   <p>Very often we meet with the accusation that the Jugoslav Socialist Federation is an artificial organization, which has no right to exist in this country because her members belong to the small bourgeoisie class of Europe. For that reason our federation cannot be the representative of the working class, and can not lead in the struggle for its ultimate aims.</p>
   <p>For that reason our critics recommend the Jugoslav working class immigrants to join different nationalistic and benevolent organizations, which are not identified with the class struggle of the workingman, but are often in the open opposition against its struggles for better living conditions.</p>
   <p>Such criticism is without any significance, because it is not based on knowledge of the economic and political position of our immigrants in America.</p>
   <p>It is true our members of the federation are taken from theranks of the small bourgeoisie of Europe. But these newcomers here - former small farmers, merchants and tradesmen of Europe -- become an undivisible part of American proletarian masses. They become identified with the working classes of this country.</p>
   <p>When we speak about tactics and wages of the struggle of the American working class, we have to know that the same applies equally to the Jugoslav working class here.</p>
   <p>As social democrats, we know that the only tactics to be used by the American working class against exploitation are the tactics of the relentless class struggle, which struggle is far from any patriotic or chauvinistic egotism and has nothing to do with the compromise and association with the bourgeoisie and her tools.</p>
   <p>This principle must be the foundation of our tactics. With this principle the Jugoslav working class will help the American proletarians, also the international national proletarian movement to destroy the present social order.</p>
   <p>The workers' struggle in America started with America's discovery. The struggle was not organized and had to fail. There were uprisings of slaves, also of free workers but they were put down easily.</p>
   <p>When capitalism became strong, machinery was introduced, capital centralized and the exploitation of workers became more evident and the fight more stubborn, then this fight assumed other character and the workers became organized. Many different organizations led a one-sided fight and for that reason were seldom successful. The culmination of this labor struggle was the catastrophe at the Haymarket in Chicago in 1886.</p>
   <p>Bombs and guns were used by both sides.</p>
   <p>The tragedy of the Haymarket did not fail to make a great impression on the laboring class. That event was a great teacher for labor. The working class came to the conclusion that anarchistic methods were of no use in its fight. The foundation was, therefore, laid for a new uncompromising fight of the American proletarians.</p>
   <p>During the last hundred years of struggle for better wages, better working conditions and shorter hours many parties and organizations were formed.</p>
   <p>In 1897, out of the Socialist Workers party, was organized a new American Socialist party.</p>
   
   <p>This party is a member of the Internacionale. The party advocates an independent class struggle of the proletarians and recommends to them an industrial workers' organization. The party as a whole took on itself to help the organized and unorganized proletarians in their fight against the bourgeoisie, but never to miss the occasion to criticize the duties, aims and tactics of those who are fighting and recommending socialist views and practices.</p>
   <p>These tactics of the American Socialist party built a strong solidarity among the fighting workers and work for sympathy and authority among working masses. This is proven by facts.</p>
   <p>The American Socialist party grew from 1897 to 150,000 members. At the last elections it gained one million votes.</p>
   <p>Now there is the question: What tactics must the Jugoslav Socialist Federation pursue to fulfill her duties and purposes successfully and to add her part to the common struggle for the destruction of the present capitalistic exploitation and the establishment of the socialist ideals?</p>
   <p>At the start we must be conscious of the fact that our federation alone can not do much regarding betterment of the conditions for the working class and realization of any political reforms for the proletarians.</p>
   <p>Our federation is not able to be an independent economic organization for the reason that our members are working in different branches of industry and trades, and are spread all over the United States.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav immigration is only a part of the whole proletarian class of America and we alone are not able to create a political party which would be able to fight for political reforms of the proletarians. Our federation can be and is a cultural and political workers' organization whose aim is to enlighten the Jugoslav workers here and to agitate for and propagate socialism.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that the action of our federation is not limited just to our Jugoslav workers of America,on the contrary her activity must have a wider range; to strive for better working conditions in general, the destruction of capitalistic exploitation which is a burden for all proletarian shoulders. All these things the Jugoslav Socialist Federation cannot accomplish otherwise than in connection with those workers organizations, of which tactics and activity have the purpose to realize the ideals of the American working classes.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the character, duties and aims of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation we will follow the tactics of an independent revolutionary fight of the classes. in the fight against American bourgeoisie, to relieve exploitation and its ultimate abolishment.</p>
   <p>Regarding the relations of our federation with other existing proletarian organizations here, we must adopt the tactics of the American Socialist party.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav Socialist Federation has to participate in economic and political struggles of the proletarians in America, to create solidarity and unanimity in the ranks of the struggling working masses, at the same time endeavoring to smash with her sharp socialist criticism the conservative notions and practices and to win the American proletarians for the ideas of socialism.</p>
   <p>In this manner, agitating solidarity and unity among working masses, helping the workers materially and morally in their struggle against bourgeoisie, propagating and agitating for revolutionary socialism also holding high the banner of uncompromising proletarian class struggle, the Jugoslav Socialist Federation of America will grow strong and develop. At the same time the federation will organize the Jugoslav workers in America under the flag of revolutionary socialism, then she will accomplish nobly her task in the universal socialist movement for the liberation of the international proletarians.</p>
