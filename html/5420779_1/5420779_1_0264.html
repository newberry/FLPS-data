   <p>This is the second week we have been having a Young Comrade's Section in the Radnik. Maybe some of you haven't seen last week's Young Comrade's Section (It was in the issue of Nov. 20), so let us tell you what the idea of this section is.</p>
   <p>We want this section to be of, by and for the children. We want you to write stories, news, articles, and send pictures and everything else. If you send it in we will print it. You are workers' children. Your life is different from the life of the rich kids, because they have the money and we are poor. Our fathers work but the bosses get rich. We want you to write about all this. Write us about the things that interest you. Write us about the rich and poor people, especially the children. Write us about your school. Write us stories, puzzles, jokes, everything. Send us in drawings and pictures. Come on, this section is yours. What are you going to do with it? Write to Young Comrade's Section, care Radnik, 1113 W. Washington Blvd., Chicago.</p>
