   <p>Very often we hear remarks that the Socialist groups of different foreign languages do not work sufficiently for the enlightenment of the working classes. Very often these groups are denied recognition and consequently the right to their existence.</p>
   <p>To prove that those remarks are without any foundation, we print some statistics of the work of Socialist foreign groups. Among them are: the Slovak, Scandinavian, Hungarian, Polish and Jugoslav groups.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav group sold $2,470.24 worth of Socialist literature. Most of this literature was printed by the group itself. This group publishes two weekly papers and gives lectures in all the larger towns of America. In one year this group gave about five hundred lectures.</p>

   <p>Such is, in the main, the work of different foreign language Socialist groups. If we consider that the World's War brought great stagnation into the workers' lives, that great misery and unemployment were created, we should be satisfied with our progress.</p>
   <p>Our adversaries may make detracting remarks that our work amounts to little, but did they publish just one booklet with the purpose of helping the working class intellectually or financially?</p>
