   <p>1911. Income $4,890.00, Expenses $4,834.00. We request all thinking Croatian working men to compare the figures above and to come to the conclusion that our progress during the past year was insufficient and small.</p>
   <p>After that consideration they must act to secure the regular edition of their organ, Radnicka Straza. We all must take care of that, willingly and cheerfully. All of us who think socialistically. The Socialist thinking means for us work and struggle.</p>
   <p>Our progress last year was minute. It was not progress at all, it was a standstill. A standstill means going backwards. In 1911 we hoped to augment subsoriptions by at least $1,500. We did not reach $800.</p>
   <p>But not only subscriptions were neglected, also the distribution of books and taking in advertising was small.</p>
   
   <p>We do not expect big amounts from advertising, but the income from them takes care of smaller items. We have a $600 debt at present.</p>
   <p>Comrades, the situation is for your like an open book. You know the circumstances of our organ. That situation is indeed poor and unbearable.</p>
   <p>Croatian workers, you have to (1) gather subscribers, (2) distribute books, (3) take in advertising, (4) remember your paper with some donation.</p>
   <p>Comrades, take this call earnestly and do your duty as Socialists!</p>
