   <p>Today starts the convention of the Jugoslav S. L. P. A. in National Hall, 1802 Racine Avenue, Chicago.</p>
   <p>The convention has a historical character for many reasons.</p>
   <p>Tasks which confront us are of great importance to all members of the party. We are up against the solution of many problems in the party in general, as well as in our Jugoslav section. Reorganization, agitation and propaganda, union questions, press and literature, are subjects of this year's convention.</p>
   <p>Delegates, all workers, are coming from all sections of the country from New York to Los Angeles. These are miners, steel workers, lumber jacks, etc. Our movement is united. That is an important moment of the convention.</p>
   
   <p>We are sure of the political success of the convention, and we greet our delegates, steeled to the struggle.</p>
   <p>This year's convention will manifest its readiness to do all in favor of the unity and victory of the proletarians.</p>
   <p>Welcome, comrades!</p>
