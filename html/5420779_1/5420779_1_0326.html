   <p>Sunday, June 29, the Austrian successor to the throne, Francis Ferdinand and his wife (born Countess Chotek), were assassinated at Sarajevo.</p>
   <p>The people of Austria have suffered for centuries under the rule of the Habsburgs, but it is a pity that were not able to resist expressing their indignation and try to free themselves in any other way than by the act of an assassin.</p>
   <p>An upheaval in a state, or in society in general, can be brought about only by the consciousness of people against which any typranny is impotent. In a people used to slavery, an act of violence causes more oppression.</p>

   <p>People must be liberated from ignorance, fear and lies. Then they must be led against crowned and uncrowned heads. Both annihilated lives are of no help to the people of Austria for their liberation. On the contrary, they are a proof of lack of a serious and successful struggle to attain liberty for said people.</p>
