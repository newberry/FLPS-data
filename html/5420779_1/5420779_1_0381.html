   <p>Men are divided into two classes: one which sweats to earn the money, another which sweats to spend the money.</p>
   <p>Interests of labor and capital are contrary. The capitalists think it is wonderful to work "because in that way my wealth multiplies."</p>
   <p>The worker says:"the work by which others get rich is slavery for me." The capitalist looks upon the worker as a machine, which needs just a little oil so that it will not stop. The worker, however, thinks that he also is human, and as such, has a right to enjoy happiness.</p>
   <p>Here, in a few simple words, are mentioned all causes of class struggle. Workers ask for shorter working hours and higher wages. Employers refuse to grant these demands for fear it will curtail their profits. Capitalists have in their hands wealth, the army, force, and laws. The workers' power is their number, and their conscious struggle.</p>
   
   <p>Workers are organizing so that they can win collectively that which they could never achieve as individuals. They can also reduce the political influence of the capitalist with their vote, and change laws in their favor. Workers are uniting in political, trade and cooperative organizations. These unions are the tools which will eventually give a fatal blow to capitalism, and make out of the present capitalism a society of justice, brotherhood, and freedom.</p>
