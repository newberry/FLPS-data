   <p>We announced before that the Socialist Party took action to place striking tailors' children in homes with the comrades that are in better condition to feed them. Hundreds of fellow workers answered the call, also many members of our Jugoslav Socialist Association. But there are more needy that should be cared for.</p>
   <p>We are calling not only on members but others that are able to help while their fathers are waging a fight for better working conditions. All willing to help may let us know at once, or may report to the Socialist Party Secretary for Cook County, 180 West Washington St. - and strikers committee will contact the families willing to keep such children.</p>
