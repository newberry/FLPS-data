   <p>With regard to our third monthly report, which appears on another page we repeat: "Arm all our members!"</p>
   <p>The Croatians with "Radnicka Straza."</p>
   <p>The Serbians with "Narodui Glus."</p>
   <p>The Slovenes with "Proletaree."</p>
   <p>This is the first requirement for the progress of our Jugoslav Socialist movement. Arm all the members with sufficient quantity of Socialistic books, distribute in greater measure, than before those books among proletarians who are not yet organized.</p>
   <p>Give Lecturers! Hold meetings! There are lectures is each organization but there are no hearers that is good hearers, who must be made good by lectures, so that they will grasp the importance of lectures. If you can't prepare lectures, hold readings and explanations of articles from socialist papers, as well as readings of chapters in Socialist books.</p>
   <p>Comrades! In this way you have to forge a sword of Socialist intelligence and consciousness.</p>
