   <p>Great masses of people and unbounded enthusiasm marks the progress of the socialistic struggle. East and west, north and south, assemble working men's legions under the banner of Socialism. The united workers are the bearers of light and progress.</p>
   <p>Let the dead past bury its dead. The philosophers may philosophise, the students may study, but the millions of fighters will break all obstacles and unite on the hard rock of industrial and political solidarity.</p>
   <p>Standing on that rock we look with ease on the world, to become the world's master. Standing on that rock we are able to smash capitalism. We are able to efface industrial slavery from the earth, liberate the working masses and step victoriously into a socialist republic.</p>
   <p>Yours for victory,</p>
   <p>Eugene V. Debs</p>
