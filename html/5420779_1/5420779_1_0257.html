   <p>On March 10 and 11 the Jugoslav fraction meets in plenum. This plenum will mark a new situation, not only in our own fraction but in the whole party and the labor movement in the country. What is its significance?</p>
   <p>First, this is the first time the Jugoslav fraction will operate nationally along lines of a completely centralized party. Until now we had a federation in unity with other federations, which at best could be called the "Communists' conference of America." Later we accepted centralization, but in practice we worked as a federation. Eventually the party re-organized but traditions of the federation did not disappear. As language fractions are not separate political bodies, but principally propaganda auxiliary means by which the party in general operates among Jugoslav workers, it is logical according to the proletarian party rules and according to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>party constitution that the central committee has a right to appoint language committees. This is one step ahead in the course of our centralized party.</p>
   <p>The deepest impression left by the plenum's first meeting is the change of the general party policy among Jugoslav workers in this country. Another significant effect of this plenum will be the manifestation of solidarity in the Jugoslav fraction. We must admit that we had misunderstandings: but we also affirm that our enemies wishes that our fraction would split and be dissolved will not be fulfilled.</p>
   <p>We had manifested our solidarity in the past, but this present manifestation of unity will show excellent form.</p>
   <p>In the first place the unity of our movement will be expressed in future political work, while in the past our movement was seldom so remarkable.</p>
   <p>The plenum's intention also is to solidify this work with organized <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>measures which will move our forces and put every effort on a responsible basis and furnish new elements to our ranks, freedom to rise to the necessary height in our movement and work.</p>
   <p>We are confident that plenum in this direction will be significant and will manifest interests of the movement and the working class as a class. The members of the plenum will acquaint themselves with new requirements in movement and create necessary decisions which they will later bring before other members of the fraction. They will be the controller of the situation and experiences of our party so that we all can benefit from them. The plenum will also be a school for our movement, a school of class struggle against our political enemies.</p>
