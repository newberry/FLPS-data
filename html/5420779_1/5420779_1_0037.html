   <p>There are many children who not only lack any enthusiasm for school, but who readily admit that they do not have the slightest interest in preparing their lessons. This condition causes great worry to their parents, especially those who do not understand the reasons for their children's attitude.</p>
   <p>It should be remembered, however, that the school system has many shortcomings, that it presents many features which are not calculated to attract the child, and keep his love and respect for his teachers and his school work. Much, too, depends on the child's home training, his temperament, and his personality.</p>
   <p>In many cases, the child is alienated by the rudeness of his teachers. Considerable blame must likewise be attached to the "dryness" of the curriculum, to the uniform requirements and method of instruction, which demand of each child the same interest and the same ability in all subjects, without regard to his natural inclinations.</p>

   <p>However, the parents should not be dismayed when their child displays a lack of interest, or is backward in school. We may point out, for their benefit, that there have been many people who were poor students in school, far below the average, but who later became outstanding men and women: inventors, poets, artists, and good citizens in general.</p>
   <p>It is dangerous to abuse a child, to call him "lazy," "stupid," "dumb," and the like. And it is even worse to beat the child in an attempt to make him like school and to make him study. Intelligent parents and teachers can succeed much better with reason and kindness than with rudeness and force.</p>
