   <p>The great majority of parents are guilty of selfishness when they expect their children to support them some day and repay them in a material way for the parental care their children have received. This attitude is only natural and is easy to understand, but the irony of it is that the children, once they are grown, seldom repay their parents in this manner.</p>
   <p>Every father and mother has certain bounden responsibilities toward their children, whom they have brought into the world. It is their duty to provide for and bring up their children to the best of their ability.</p>
   <p>The greatest attention and care should be directed toward inculcating in the children a feeling of love for their parents. And the natural consequence of this parental love finds its expression in material assistance for the parents at a later day. But where parental love does not exist, one cannot expect much <span class="page-break">2</span>from one's children when one is old and unable to work. The best way to insure that this does not happen is to instill the child with the qualities of kindness, unselfishness, sobriety, respect, and all the other virtues. When these take root in the child's heart, one may be reasonably sure that he will be a good man when he grows up. The child should also acquire work habits so that he will not become lazy, for then he would be useless to himself and to others.</p>
   <p>Do all you can for your child! Feed and clothe him; send him to school; provide him in every possible way. Under normal circumstances, this will produce good results; but in any case, you may be sure that you have done your best, and your conscience will be clear. If the child is intelligent and good, he will learn later on how to value all that his parents have done for him. Then he will see his duty, and will repay his parents--out of sheer love for them, out of natural and sincere gratitude, and not because society demands it of him.</p>
