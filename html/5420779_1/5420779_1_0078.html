   <p>Those who reproached Socialism that it will kill family life and home, are losing ground for their abstract theory. Ten years ago the United States had eight million women working for daily or monthly wages. During the war this number was still greater. Women were called to work then to "win the war for humanity." Men and women who did non perform some kind of work were called "slackers," even traitors. Today the number of working women must be over 10 million.</p>
   <p>Family and home life are disappearing in this country little by little. It is hard to find a girl who would rather stay home, do housework and tend children than go out of home and work as a hired worker. Thousands of girls work in offices. The number of females working in industries directly counts to millions.</p>
   <p>Many women prefer to work than to be dependent on men for their existence, to bear the burden of family life. We encounter a great number of girls <span class="page-break">2</span>and also young men who do not look for matrimony because their positions are so miserable that it seems impossible to take care of a home and children. If we also consider the great number of divorces in America, then it is clear that family life is undermined if not destroyed already.</p>
   <p>Husbands leave wife and children. Wives and mothers murder their children because their husbands left them, or were killed at work. In the family reigns a steady quarrel about money matters, and the only legal solution is divorce. No wonder it comes to tragedies. Family life is destroyed, no necessity for Socialism to wreck it.</p>
   <p>Capitalism with its industries, exploitation of men and women, of children by corruption, oppression and its injustice leads to disintegration of the whole society and its pillars, the family.</p>
   <p>It is figured that in America there are six million more men than women. And that creates a great problem. There are so many men who are not able to get married, to establish a family.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In Europe there is the same picture, but reversed, regarding sexes. Before the war in Europe there were more than eight million women in excess of men. After the war women are sixteen million in the majority. This fact is a direct cause for unemployment. Women's labor is cheaper, for that reason women are preferred as workers, and that leaves men idle.</p>
   <p>Capitalists of the whole world caused the great war in the hope to gain new markets, to make profits. But it happened otherwise. The German and Austrian capitalists were ruined. Russian capital does not exist. The capital of the Allies suffered much. Of course a few profiteers became and remained rich, but conditions changed.</p>
   <p>The people refuse to be exploited by the capitalists and all that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the capitalistic class.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Institutions which were considered main supports of capitalism are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> as a consequence of capitalistic oppression and exploitation of the working masses.</p>
