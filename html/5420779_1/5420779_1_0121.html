   <p>Some time ago, in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the State <span class="gap">[gap]</span> bill was introduced to forbid the existence of the foreign <span class="gap">[gap]</span> magazines.</p>
   <p>The high patriots of the state of Oregon tried to bite <span class="gap">[gap]</span> themselves, if we believe the statement of professor <span class="gap">[gap]</span> wegian origin, who was American <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>Professor Anderson says: "The people who speak just one <span class="gap">[gap]</span> live in a house which was just one window: they live with one thought; just in one direction. The people who speak several languages have windows on all four sides of their houses and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in this world. The great German philosoph<span class="gap">[gap]</span>."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"I do not sympathize a bid, said Mr. Anderson, with this <span class="gap">[gap]</span>stericans agitation against foreign countries on foreigners."</p>
   <p>In America are about 1,800 newspapers and magazines, publisher in foreign Languages and the number of copies <span class="gap">[gap]</span> eight millions.</p>
   <p>These papers represent thirty-two languages. They are published in every, one of the states. Of that entire press only belong to the socialists. Communists <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Communist or A<span class="gap">[gap]</span>archistic. It is considered that 19 of this press is completely loyal and 96 anti-social. In this country there are not more than twenty openly radical news papers, Of which give are published in Jewis<span class="gap">[gap]</span>. The ultra-radical press is published in the English language in millions of copies and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> millions of readers.We do not now how accurse are the statements of Mr. Anderson, but one <span class="page-break">\3</span>thing seems to be important, that is, that the ultra radical newspapers are published in the English language <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are read by millions of Americans. That means that the state of Oregon will have to prohibit also the English Language because mostly in that language the re<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ical propaganda is being spread. If that is the case, what is the use of destroying the foreign language press?</p>
   <p>If the foreigners are considered as radical, who vouches that they will not learn the English language and read newspapers published in English?</p>
   <p>Of course, these "hurrah" patriots, while raving against foreign and imported languages, forget that the English Language is also imported.</p>
