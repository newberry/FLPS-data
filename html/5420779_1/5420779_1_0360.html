   <p>The election campaign goes to its finish. Our party showed great strength. Thousands and thousands are flocking under our flags. Our war cry, our struggle for industrial liberty, the sublime aim of our movement carries light into the darkness of industrial slavery.</p>
   <p>There is no more cast and west, north and south. The workers are not divided by nationality and religion any more. Socialism binds them all; the industrial and agricultural worker, the miner and mariner, men and women.</p>
   <p>We have to do away with all those small differences. There is no more important question than the capital question - socialism or capitalism? On what side do we go? Who is with us? With whom are we? Who will emerge out of the fight stronger than he was before the fight? Who will bring the dawn of a new day?</p>
   <p>I say, socialism. Just as our movement did attract youth years ago, so it attracts them today.</p>
   <p>I say, youth, this is your time. You will finish the work. And then what will happen? We will have a new building of society, a building where there will dwell a happier generation. That will be an institution where men will be men. An institution where the dreams of generations will be fulfilled, an institution which will answer the prayers of millions, who pray in their simple hearts: "They kingdom come!" Youth! The world is thine. Come and take it. Save it for the human race.</p>
