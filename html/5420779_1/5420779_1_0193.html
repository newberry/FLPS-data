   <p>The question of workers' unions is becoming more real each day. There is not one group of workers in a factory or shop for whom the question of unionizing is not most important.</p>
   <p>The American unions known as the American Federation of Labor are the most conservative unions in the world. Their structure is most unsuitable. It is such that sometimes members of one union are strikebreakers for the other. But for such conditions unionism is not to blame, nor the workers. The blame lies with the leaders, who are in the service of capitalism and not in the service of the working class, but its enemies. With a change of leaders the unions will begin to climb. The main thing is to prepare the workers to fight against bureaucracy. Here class-consciousness and a fighting spirit are necessary.</p>
   <p>To have results we must: (1) Spread the idea of unionism among all the workers. No excuses must be to erated for the existing faults of unionism. Things have to be explained to the workers, bind them closer to the <span class="page-break">2</span>unions and introduce those who are not in the union. (2) Constantly it is necessary to organize unions against bureaucracy in the union itself. Bureaucracy stands against the working class. (3) It is necessary from separate unions to make one great union. (4) It is necessary that all unions, however small and dispersed, become one large union and give it a certain political direction. Because each "class struggle is finally a political struggle," the political character has to develop in the real complete political duty of each worker, that is, the destruction of the capitalistic system for the final liberation of the working classes.</p>
   <p>These are the most important basic duties of real revolutionaries. These are the Communist tasks with respect to the workers' unions of America. These truths are accentuated many times in the everyday struggle of the working class in America.</p>
