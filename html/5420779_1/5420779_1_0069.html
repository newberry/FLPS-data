   <p>A bitter fight has been going on for some time between the Government and the liquor dealers regarding permission to sell liquor stocks now on hand in the warehouses and in retail establishments.</p>
   <p>On January 16, 1920, national Prohibition goes into effect, and the sale of liquor will then cease altogether. Under ordinary circumstances, liquor could be sold up to that date, but this is now precluded by the fact that war-time prohibition is still operative. War-time prohibition was enacted by Congress, and has been sustained by the Supreme Court. The sole hope of the liquor distributors is now President Wilson, who has the power to declare demobilization at an end; and [since war-time prohibition would then no longer be effective,] the sale of liquor would then be legal until January 16.</p>
   <p>Well, the sale of liquor will soon be prohibited by law. But, of course, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>stuff will be sold illegally. Our present [war-time] prohibition law has failed to do any good. By forbidding the sale of liquor, it has permitted the dealers to make a lot of money through illegal sales. In addition, the law aids and abets swindling, since the victim cannot complain of a swindle in an illegal transaction. In many cases, people have paid a lot of money for a barrel of whisky, only to find that there was a little whisky on top and that the rest of the stuff was water. This has been a frequent practice recently, and it shows how much evil there is in our so-called civilized society. Many of these swindlers are among our "best citizens," although the truth is that they are just so many crooks.</p>
   <p>One of the results of prohibition has been the widespread drinking of wood alcohol, which is nothing else than a poison. There were numerous cases of alcoholic poisoning during the last year, and in the last few days no less than two hundred cases have been reported. People help themselves as best they can. In order to get something to drink, they either make their own <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>alcohol or buy it. And in either case the stuff kills them. During the recent Christmas holidays, many people bought whisky from bootleggers. The stuff was poisonous, and forty-five persons died as a result of drinking it. These cases are reported from all over the country, and there will undoubtedly be more of them. The bootleggers are interested only in making money; they are not at all concerned about what happens to their customers.....</p>
   <p>We are not friends of alcohol; neither do we advocate drinking. The fact is, however, that Prohibition has been enacted against the will of the people; and the truth is that the people are ready to defy the law in order to get liquor. This is the best proof that the people are opposed to Prohibition.....</p>
   <p>Prohibition was enacted by Congress, which did not act out of sincere conviction. The newspapers have told us of many wealthy advocates of Prohibition who have provided themselves with ample stocks of liquor sufficient for many years to come, although these same people want liquor kept out of the hands of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the masses. According to those who know, there is plenty of drinking in the homes of the wealthy. If this is correct, then Prohibition is nothing less than hypocrisy.</p>
