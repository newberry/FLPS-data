   <p>Each nation possesses what we call national pride in general. For prudent people, national pride is the same as vanity of a separate person. Many people have vanity who are proud of it in their limitation of thought, Not few citizens of this country originated in some other countries enjoy in their own national traditions, customs, rules and characteristics.</p>
   <p>Each country creates for itself certain standards of morals, behavior, comprehension and national training.</p>
   <p>We, who are in this country for a long time, could discover that the so-called national pride is well established in this country. There is nothing of importance which the average American will not declare for "American" or "un-American," according to his comprehension.</p>
   <p>Industry is an American product. The army and navy are American. The exploitation of workers by the rich is also American.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Millionaires and billionaires are also an American product. Hundreds of such American products exist. Anything that favors capitalism and the prevailing system is American. Nobody will even try to prove that some thing could be un-American.</p>
   <p>It is un-American to disapprove of church or religion; find faults with authorities or disagree with those who are leaders of society.</p>
   <p>It is un-American to tell a thief that he is a thief; to a capitalist that he is an exploiter; to a robber that he is a robber. There are many other such un-American things.</p>
   <p>Lately one of the 'patriots" declared that "an open shop is American." Open shops and factories are those where organized labor is not tolerated; where strike breakers work. That is American. It is in accord with the law which gives to everybody the right for whatever he pleases whenever he wants it. According to that those are wrong who want to induce their co-workers to join unions and struggle against capital.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>If a factory stops work, goes on strike, the employers are allowed to hire strike breakers, gunmen, the worst scum of society to break that strike. All that is American, allowed, by custom approved.</p>
   <p>Some time ago negro slavery was an American product. And how! But it can not be considered a holy thing, for that reason today. Yes, slavery was a holy thing once, but today men are wondering how it was possible to tolerate slavery at all.</p>
   <p>There is the electric chair, a first class American product. We must not forget gallows, prisons and lynchings as American products. But who could enumerate all the American products?</p>
   <p>If there comes a man who will assail old and prejudiced institutions in this country, his work will be classed as un-American. Atheism is, of course, un-American. But America gave one of the greatest free thinkers and speakers: Robert G. Ingersoll. Ir Ingersoll had not been against the church traditions every American child would know him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>But he is avoided; his works are classed as 'un-American.' Why? Because he spread truth about nature, religions and customs, and that is considered un-American.</p>
   <p>Another great institution which appeared in this country is considered un-American, that is Socialism. Surely, that product does not belong here. It grew on a foreign soil in another climate. It cannot prosper here. We have democracy, the right to vote, that is sufficient. For Socialism there is no place in America.</p>
   <p>That is said by representatives of capital in America, by their agents and all factors responsible for public opinion, who think that any political trend or economic theory is eaten if it is declared un-American.</p>
   <p>To that we say that not long ago women's suffrage was considered un-American. But it became the most American product. It became so after a struggle of long years. Persecutions of fighters for said idea, of men and women who asked equal political rights for men and women.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Things which were considered un-American became American and vice versa. There are thousands at present of which the coming generations will be ashamed.</p>
   <p>Also Socialism will become an American institution. When? That depends on the workers. But when it will become extended over the country to be of influence on its life, it will attain the right of American citizenship.</p>
   <p>A great throng of industrial workers and other exploited men are working on the extension of Socialism in America. A victorious Socialism will become American in time.</p>
