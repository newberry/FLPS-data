   <p>During debates in Congress over the revision of tariff duties a commission was appointed to investigate costs of production in the United States as well as in foreign lands. This investigation was intended to bring light on items for which the tariff was to be reduced, because American capitalists affirm, that the production costs in foreign lands are lower than in the United States.</p>
   <p>The commission investigated just seventeen of the main industries. The result was so uncommon, the veracity of statements made in the report could be doubted.</p>
   <p>What the commission has published up to now refers only to England, Canada, and the United States. It is yet to be seen that with higher wages and shorter working hours in the United States the production costs are considerably lower than in England. Except in two industries to raise the value of $1,000 raw material to another $1,000, the production cost in the United States is lower than in England. On the average this cost is in the United States $470, in England $561. According to said figures the English producers have a 20% higher tariff for their production costs than the American.</p>

   <p>If those findings are true, there is no reason to oppose the lowering of tariffs. It is to wonder, why those figures were not published before.</p>
   <p>The American capitalists pointed to Great Britain as their most dangerous competitor and all that was said could be considered true to some extent. According to the commission's report the average weekly wage is twice as large here and at the same time, working hours are shorter. Both things taken into account show that wages per hour are fourteen per cent higher than in England.</p>
   <p>But - according to statements of the commission - the unfavorable conditions are equalized by two things: First, the English manufacturers must have for the same amount of production twice and one half as many workers, at the same time, the use of horse power is eighteen per cent higher.</p>
   <p>One more surprise is in the report of the investigating commission. The ship-building industry of England is the oldest and best in the world. So it would appear, shipbuilding must be most profitable for British shipbuilders. But it is not so. The British, to increase the value of $1,000 of raw material to the same amount,have to spend more also in shipbuilding. Exactly $79.00 more than Americans ($679 against $600) <span class="page-break">3</span>Taken into account that most products are sold in England much cheaper than in the United States, we can draw two conclusions: First, the profits of the American capitalist must be extra high; second, the strain of the work must be frightful, because only by unmerciful exploitation is it possible for the American capitalist to drive out of the worker more value in production than in any other country of the world.</p>
   <p>That the overstraining of workers in the United States is a common thing is well known.</p>
   <p>The Taylor's system and other refined methods, control of the workers' every minute, are introduced in many factories. He who is not able to give the requested quantity of work is thrown on the street. It is no wonder that a workman of forty is considered an old man. Some times younger men do not get work.</p>
   <p>This murderous exploiting system must end. That will be done by a conscious working class, organized in the economic as well as in the political field - in workers' unions and the Socialist party. It is these how the purpose to put and end to exploitation of man by man, one class by another.</p>
