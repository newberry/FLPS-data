   <p>The Americans are a people of action. It is said that they are great egotists. Whatever they do, they do it for profit. That is not so. In the last war the Americans contributed much to the Allies' victory but did not get or take anything. A group of Americans was interested in the fate of Serbia during the war. After the war they did not forget Serbia. They sent the America Mission and Red Cross to Serbia, who worked in the reconstruction of Serbia. All over America there are committees working for the rehabilitation of Serbia. One of these committees handled the Elizabeth Milbank Anderson Foundation and sent to the general State Hospital at Belgrad a complete automobile automobile Ambulance outfit.</p>
   <p>The outfit was presented to the Hospital by the American Mission for Serbia. On the ambulance is the inscription "In memory of Mrs. Elizabeth Milbank Anderson, the American friend of Serbian children."</p>
