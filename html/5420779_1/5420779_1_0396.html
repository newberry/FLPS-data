   <p>In the great city of Chicago the socialist workers from all different nationalities of the Socialist Party organizations -- of them are 40 -- will hold a big First of May celebration, on Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>On Sunday there will be a demonstration parade through streets inhabited by the workers.</p>
   <p>Not later than 11:30 A. M. all members have to assemble in front of the office of Radnicka Straza , 1830 Center Avenue.</p>
   <p>We Croats will be joined by the Slovenians, Serbians and Bulgars. We, all Jugoslavs will join the Czechs and Slovaks.</p>
   <p>Get together comrades!</p>
   <p>The parade passes through sections where workers live, for the reason this parade must be forceful and magnificent, a grand manifestation of militant workers against all capitalistic bloody institutions.</p>
   <p>Who has not the intrepidity to demonstrate loudly and ostentatively on May First for our socialist principles, has no right to call himself a socialist.</p>
