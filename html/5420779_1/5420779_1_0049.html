   <p>About six months ago a progressive workers' club was established at Chicago. This club had many results along organizational lines and successful activities among our Jugoslav people. The club is numerically the strongest Jugoslav (club) in America and the best in its methods.</p>
   <p>For a short time during its existence the club organized a Tamburitza orchestra, and a dramatic society. Besides, courses are given for illiterates in Croatian and English grammar, and book-keeping. Lectures are also given. The Jugoslavs see in that club their teacher, helper and adviser.</p>
   <p>What we just told will be proven Sunday, January 2, when the dramatic society will perform Leo Tolstoy's "The Living Corpse," a drama in 6 acts, 12 pictures portraying 40 persons. We recommend this great performance of the club, "Milan Glumac."</p>
