   <p>Last Saturday a supper was given in the house of our esteemed countryman Mr. Steve Babic, which was to our people of more importance than suppers given in any of Chicago's big hotels for the last few years.</p>
   <p>At the time of the Convention of the Cigar Makers Union there were present many delegates and labor leaders of America and Canada among them Mr. Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor and the greatest authority on the labor movement in the world. Mr. Steve Babic on this occasion invited Mr. Gompers and many prominent labors leaders to his home. Among them: G. W. Perkins, President of the Cigar Makers Union, the Vice-Presidents of the Union, the Treasurer, and many others.</p>
   <p>The evening was an important affair for the Jugoslavs in so far as Mr. Gompers is a very important figure and plays a big role in our country. Mr. Gompers was during the war a valuable councilor of President Wilson and a sponsor of the Jugoslav cause.</p>
