   <p>The Southern States find that more and more Negroes from the South are migrating to industrial cities in the North. "Aristocrats" from the South are beginning to value Negroes because they need their working power and are worried because of their moving North.</p>
   <p>Some go so far as to say that they should act more humanly with these dark-skinned proletarians. A while back the Department of labor issued statistics on Negro emigration north during the year ending September 1, 1923. During these 12 months 480,000 Negroes emigrated from 13 Southern States. From Georgia alone 120,000 Negroes emigrated, or 10% of the total Negro population of the State. Alabama lost 90,000, Mississippi 82,000, and Florida about 90,000 or 27% of the total Hegro population of that State.</p>

   <p>Much as the employer of the South may feel the Negro emigration, its effect is equally noticeable in the North, where colored workers have taken the places of white workers in various industries; especially in the steel and automobile industries and in the Chicago Stockyards. In 1910 there were only 45,000 Negroes in Chicago, while in the year 1920 that number had increased to 110,000. Detroit, the automobile city, had in 1910 about 5,980 Negroes and in 1920 about 41,000. In these last three years the number of Negroes has naturally grown in Chicago as well as in New York.</p>
   <p>According to statistics, in 1920 there were in New York 152,469 Negroes. In the largest Negro district, Harlem, they had been terribly abused by landlords. Not only were they obliged to overcrowd their rooms more than whites, but they had to pay more rent than the whites. Many colored families had to endure starvation, in order to pay the high rents and keep off the streets. Colored people could rent lodgings only in their <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>own districts, and there they were overcrowded.</p>
   <p>On account of the new immigration law, there will be a larger influx of Negroes into the industries and they will become dangerous so other workers because they are not organized. In other works, write organized workers must either peacefully watch colored workers take their jobs, working longer hours for less money, or they must undertake the job of organizing the colored orders and in that way eliminate the danger of losing all that the workers have gained up to this time.</p>
