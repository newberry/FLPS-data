   <p>We are herewith submitting a few hints and suggestions on the proper upbringing of children. It is now up to the parents to adopt them and benefit by them.</p>
   <p>1. Use the utmost caution to avoid instilling fear into your child and letting it get a permanent hold. Don't tell frightening stories to your children, as our parents used to do, and don't let others try it.</p>
   <p>2. Teach the child to be obedient. This doesn't mean to develop in him a feeling of inferiority, or an attitude of submission. The behavior, and the language, of parents, teachers, and other adults must be such as to inspire the child with respect and obedience. Naturally, the child should not be asked to do anything improper, unjust, or harmful, and he is perfectly within his rights to refuse to do anything of the kind.</p>
   
   <p>3. Train your child not to "pick" his food; he should eat whatever his mother sets on the table, whether she is serving a meal for the entire family or for him alone. An exception may be made in case of a physician's order, or in case the child has a violent dislike for certain foods.</p>
   <p>4. Teach the child how to meet and overcome his difficulties; tell him they are inevitable, that one must expect them, and that life is not all play, but is real and earnest, with opportunities and responsibilities. If you do everything for the child while he is small, he will become soft, weak--in fact, plain lazy--and will never be able to fight his own battles.</p>
   <p>5. Teach the child to be considerate of others, to do something for them now and then, even things he may not like to do. This training is necessary in order to keep him from acquiring habits of greed, selfishness, and vanity. A person who cares nothing for his fellow man is his own worst enemy. The greatest pleasure in life is derived from doing good to others, especially when it makes them happy.</p>
   
   <p>6. Teach your boys and girls, while they are still very young, to perform small but useful tasks. This does not mean that the child should be considered a slave and made to do heavy, onerous labor; it does mean that the child should be taught to do light, useful work. Make him responsible for some small task for the house or for his own needs. A normal child enjoys working in the home, and a well-trained child will not depend upon his father or mother, or the maid, to do his own work.</p>
   <p>Never ridicule or laugh at things that children take seriously, even if they are absurd. Try to explain to them, and make them realize, exactly what is wrong, so that they may know better next time.</p>
   <p>When we realize the profound effect of the impressions received in childhood, we no longer wonder in the least that the science of child training has formulated these rules in the conviction that parents should abide by them to the letter. These rules are the foundation for the child's future life, a foundation which must be strong in every respect.</p>
