   <p>The courts of Chicago are occupied daily with a very serious problem--the divorce evil. The chief reason for so many divorces in America is that people consider marriage a contractual relation, which endures just as long as the two parties care to stick it out. In most cases, no deep feeling unites the couple; no attempt is made to know and understand each other, and thus provide the foundation for a lasting union.</p>
   <p>The notion that the husband has to support his wife is a legal right to which the latter clings tenaciously. If the husband is unemployed, the wife will seldom make sacrifices: she insists on her right to be supported. This egotism repels many a husband; he loses his illusions about married life, and leaves home because he sees in his wife, not a friend but a partner who sticks with him as long as life is agreeable. Marriage in America today is not a union of souls; it is a matter of "joining hands," and for that reason the marriage tie <span class="page-break">2</span>is very loose, so that divorce results easily.</p>
   <p>Statistics show that most divorces are granted in the first years of married life; divorce is considerably less frequent in subsequent years. Often, the children are the tie that keeps their parents together.</p>
   <p>The great number of divorces in America is an evil that is rooted in the present-day [economic] system. The worker is a slave to need and to economic conditions. This oppresses his spirit; it is difficult to be in love when one is hungry. When a woman is driven into marriage by hunger, she cannot choose:she will accept anybody able to provide her with a better life, a life free from worry. The worker's lack of security is also a cause of marital strife,and he is driven to alcohol instead of endeavoring to improve his lot.</p>
   <p>The courts and the moralists deplore the large number of divorces, but do nothing to prevent them, to change the capitalistic system, the principal source of this evil.</p>
