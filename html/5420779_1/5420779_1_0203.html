   <p>Called by the Jugoslav Educational Association of Chicago, a meeting was held in the Croatian Brotherhood Hall, West 18th Street and Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Croatian singing club "Zora," Croatian Benevolent Lodge "Bratstvo," and the J. E. A. Delegation, met to make a plan on how to help coal miners on strike in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and West Virginia, who are suffering with their families in a long strike.</p>
   <p>The first steps were taken at the conference and a committee was elected and a plan made to raise the money for the Coal Strikers' Aid Committee. At once it was decided to give a great concert program and to be followed by several such events. The proceeds will go toward the strike fund.</p>
   <p>The committee also plans to get all necessary materials and goods for <span class="page-break">2</span>the affairs from merchants as donations. The committee also appeals to our merchants and tradesmen to volunteer their donations or to be generous to the committee which will soon pay them a visit. The committee is especially asking of singing and musical clubs that have received notice, to at once respond, so that we can arrange the port for them.</p>
   <p>The committee is also appealing to other organizations to refrain from activities on days reserved by the Strike Fund Committee.</p>
   <p>The first concert will be given March 18, 1928, at 2:30 P. M., in the Croatian National Hall, West 18th Street and Racine Avenue.</p>
