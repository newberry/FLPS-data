   <p>It seems that for all <span class="gap">[gap]</span> was, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the said it <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of social unrest, foreigners are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> country.</p>
   <p>If there is a strike, it is the work of prisoners of foreign <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>This situation <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are eager to leave this country.</p>
   <p>On the other hand <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are treate <span class="gap">[gap]</span> well ...to be the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> exploited.</p>

   <p>This happened to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in America. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they came from countries there they were <span class="gap">[gap]</span> brutally <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of a bureaucratic government.</p>
   <p>They did have to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who had the official position. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>not only for the people <span class="gap">[gap]</span> were picture <span class="gap">[gap]</span> poetry, and as saviors of culture.</p>
   <p>It is easy to believe that our <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by the fact that they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> American officials. If they were hard driven at work, they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. However, they agreed they were treated <span class="gap">[gap]</span> country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>This <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> better their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> They <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in American <span class="gap">[gap]</span> called <span class="gap">[gap]</span>alcontent, unruly, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> could call the foreman by his first <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> everything was all right. Whatever the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> ways days <span class="gap">[gap]</span> go.</p>
   <p>But conditions changed. In the foreigner one saw an enemy because America was at war with his country. America wanted to make patriots of foreign workers overnight, but you can't arouse patriotism in a man who has nothing. The hired workers do not possess anything and cannot feel like property owners who live well. Over<span class="gap">[gap]</span> they wanted <span class="gap">[gap]</span> rich and poor equal in deeds, words, and thoughts, but they failed.</p>
   <p>As it was to be expected, the foreign workers remained cool toward this <span class="page-break">4</span>patriotic propaganda. Many workers, out of fear or other causes, declared themselves first class patriots.</p>
   <p>As soon as one part of the foreign workers was considered patriotic, the rage went against those who remained calm and were not swayed by artificial sentiment.</p>
   <p>The propaganda against foreign workers is in full swing today. In the lead for it is the American legion. The legionnaires are armed. They usurp the right to arrest people, to disband meetings of foreign workers, to demolish business place, destroy libraries and do similar acts of violence.</p>
   <p>The effect of all this is in contrary to what America wants to do for the foreigners, namely, the establishment of schools to teach them English and the meaning of American constitution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>On one side they try citizens of the foreigners by education on the other the Legion tries the area by violence. The result will be that foreigners will hasten to leave America.</p>
   <p>The authorities are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> conditions in America. If the workers are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> look for the cause of that dissatisfaction, and there <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Jail, lynch or deport them.</p>
   <p>In is well known that the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. From Gary some 8,000 <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for <span class="gap">[gap]</span> strike and bad treat of the employees.</p>
   <p>All over the world in will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. This is not <span class="page-break">6</span>the way to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> foreign <span class="gap">[gap]</span> good Americans are not <span class="gap">[gap]</span> bring a bad reputation for America.</p>
   <p>America must give <span class="gap">[gap]</span> more order, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> over the fate of the country to a chauvinis<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ic legion.</p>
