   <p>The first union printing press was well received by our people in the United States. The Central Committee decided to start a move toward erecting their own press, which will free them from private capitalistic exploitation.</p>
   <p>Therefore, our class conscious people in America, and especially in Chicago and in Allegheny, quickly collected a larger amount for the print shop which will be the cornerstone of our progress in this land.</p>
   <p>Now that the printing press of our workemen's federation is completed, and has this month started on bigger orders. So it is the first time the Radnicka Straza was printed in its own printing shop.</p>
   <p>We are happy to say that this is the first and only Croatian union print shop in America. All others, to our shame, are scabs. That the paper is printed in a union shop can be recognized by the union label. Newspapers <span class="page-break">2</span>that have no union label are scabs and do not recognize workers' unions nor pay their workers honest wages. By that we can see their false friendship toward working men. You can notice on the second page of this paper, first column, a union label No. 290, which is our press number.</p>
   <p>Newspapers, books, circulars, letter-heads, and all work turned out by our print shop carries union label No. 290. The duty of every worker is to have their work done in and to support union shops.</p>
