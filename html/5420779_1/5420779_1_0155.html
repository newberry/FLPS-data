   <p>All progressive peoples of Europe condemned the Hungarian holders of power with their leader Khuen Herdervary for suspension of constitutional rights in Croatia and Slavonia.</p>
   <p>Following the activity of our Croatian people here in the United States of America, we find that also here in many places where a greater number of our hardworking people live, protest meetings were held to give vent to the bitterness over the oppression of our people in Croatia.</p>
   <p>As is seen from the lines above, in Hungary as well as in Croatia, the struggle for people's rights did not cease but has just begun. It is laudable that the Central Committee of the National Croatian Union decided to donate the sum of $3,000 as help to lead the national struggle in Croatia in their homeland.</p>
