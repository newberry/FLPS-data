   <p>Answering attacks against "Radnicka Straza" and with intention to enlarge our paper, comrades from Allegheny, Pennsylvania, proposed a conference in Chicago for the Christmas Day, where we could thresh out many important questions concerning our move and strengthening Radnicka Straza.</p>
   <p>The central committee accepted the proposition and ordered a conference for December 25 and 26 with following schedule:</p>
   <p>1. Central and executive committee's report</p>
   <p>2. Strengthening the organ "Radnicka Straza."</p>
   <p>3. Formation of Jugoslav Socialist Federation.</p>
   <p>4. Enlarging cooperative print shop.</p>
   <p>5. Various questions discussed.</p>
   <p>It is desirable that all organizations send in their delegates. Also the cities where there is no organization may send their representatives, who will have an advisory voice.</p>
   <p>The conference was unexpectedly called and it is impossible at this late hour to discuss in detail, which we will do in next issue. At present we hope that comrades will realize its significance and try to make it successful, for the benefit of our move and the whole working class struggle.</p>
