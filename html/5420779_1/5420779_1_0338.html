   <p>It was noticed that many members of our Jugoslav Socialist Federation are not subscribers to any of our Federation's organs, while others are behind with their payments. Many forget to renew subscriptions and slowly cease to be subscribers.</p>
   <p>For that reason Branch No. 3 in Pittsburg, at its meeting on Sept. 14, resolved as follows:</p>
   <p>(1) Each member must be a subscriber to one of our Federation's organs.</p>
   <p>(2) Any newly accepted member must subscribe for one or at least for half a year.</p>
   <p>The same question was put before a meeting of the Chicago Branch No. 6. There it was resolved: That it was impossible to be a conscious worker, a conscious Socialist; that it was impossible to participate in the Socialist movement if one did not read the Socialist press, especially the organ which belongs to his federation.</p>
   
   <p>The above resolutions of branches No. 3 and No. 6 of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation are very important. Such resolutions must be passed by all our branches and strictly adhered to. That helps to maintain and enlarge our Socialist press. But the main thing is that members reading the Socialist press will gain knowledge and fighting spirit, both so necessary in the ranks of our Socialist army, fighting for the liberation of the working class and for more agreeable and better social conditions in the world.</p>
