   <p>On the first May of this year terminated the contract between employers and employees of some of the biggest bakeries in Chicago. On account of the high prices of life's necessities the bakers asked a raise of $2 per week, but the employers refused vigorously. This caused a strike three days ago.</p>
   <p>The workers are against electing a committee of six - three bakers and three employers, who will act in the case of dismissal of workers. The strikers ask for control in such important matter, because the employers exact very hard work from the workers.</p>
   <p>The workers must be quick when at the modern machinery; many a worker cannot stand the pace. The employers want to expose this strike as the work of German spies and agents, and the authorities are willing to take that for the truth.</p>
   <p>Nothing is easier than to show this strike as a German business, thus <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to shatter the workers' struggle and do away with the strike. This method has become common and the people's masses as well as the bourgeoisie in their dollar patriotism do not see the true issues of the fight.</p>
   <p>In answer to that we want just to mention that all strikers are union members, all must be citizens or at least have their first papers. Beside they are not just of German nationality, but from different nationalities, an international union.</p>
   <p>The workers agree that the state should take over the bakeries and manage them for the benefit of the people. In that case the bakers are willing to return to work.</p>
   <p>All this shows how depraved must be those elements who denounce the strikers as spies and agents of Germany.</p>
