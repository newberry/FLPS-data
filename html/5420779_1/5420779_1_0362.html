   <p>Not long ago, Wilson in his book tried to assail foreigners and said that they are the worst kind of American inhabitants. To many of them who immigrate to America entrance should be forbidden.</p>
   <p>At present, at the time of elections, Wilson feels bad about his own book, so he declares the whole thing was just a joke, and that he was never serious about it. Mr. Wilson remembers that there are many foreign immigrants who acquired citizenship, who have the right to vote, and that those votes are not to be thrown away.</p>
   <p>Not only that, he recalls that here are Croatians and he hopes that among "the worst kind of inhabitants" he could get a few votes.</p>
   <p>For good money, of course, he found some newspaperman who wrote an article in his favor in the Croatian language. This article is distributed throughout the Croatian colonies now. This article is signed by a Croatian committee of the National Democratic Party. These people are afraid of <span class="page-break">2</span>publicity so that they did not sign their names to the notice. They intend to get some votes for boss Wilson by remaining in the dark.</p>
   <p>Those wretches are not ashamed to recommend Wilson, the same Wilson who called the Croatian working class the "worst kind" of American people.</p>
   <p>But the Croatian workingmen who have the right to vote will answer Wilson by voting, November 5, for the Socialist candidate.</p>
   <p>That will be the best answer. And the Democratic gentleman will not joke anymore with the "worst kind" of Americans.</p>
