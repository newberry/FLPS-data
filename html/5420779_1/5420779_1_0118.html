   <p>An American magazine wrote the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tions the people in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> every little faith in medicine. They laugh if you tell them that microbes, mosquitoes, flies, rats and other animals are able to spread <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. They think that sickness is not caused by any outside agency, but is sent by God. They say. If God sends us sickness and misfortune <span class="gap">[gap]</span> knows best <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   <p>That there are people in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that sickness is sent by God, we do not <span class="gap">[gap]</span> He know the Balkirs <span class="gap">[gap]</span> conceited Americans who imagine that they exce<span class="gap">[gap]</span> in civilization and that other people are just savages. Furthermore, we do not know which country is referred to in the above statements. In Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece people know how to appreciate a doctor's knowledge and believed in doctors, rather than priests.</p>
   
   <p>In proportion there are not many doctors, and the people have no <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to profit from medical science. No <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that people in their desecration depend on a priest, sorcerer or even a common <span class="gap">[gap]</span>t.</p>
   <p>But now is it in America? Correse<span class="gap">[gap]</span> of culture think that the situation is better were. But a cared scrutiny will show different results. In the same <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that the police arrested members of a church <span class="gap">[gap]</span> City, Illinois, on account a immorality. They were lying on their backs, claiming to be possessed the only <span class="gap">[gap]</span>st.</p>
   <p>In the United States there is a special religious a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> called the Christian Science. They believe in immorality, but reject any medicine. When they get sick, they pray, but never call a doctor. Where not see way these people are more intelligent than those in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who believe sincerely that God sends all good as well as and things.</p>
   <p>We, who lived in the Balkans, never <span class="gap">[gap]</span> anybody say that be is possessed of the ' <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Ghost' as is the case in <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ion City, a town in the center of American civilization, in the state of Illinois.</p>
   
   <p>In America religious hypocrisy is far <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> number of American universities serve religion, force students to attend churches and sermons.</p>
   <p>Why, indeed, do is imagine that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is better than over there; that Americans are freethinkers, that the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>alkan people are victims of fal<span class="gap">[gap]</span>cies, mistakes are a constant occurrence, fed and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, on the other s<span class="gap">[gap]</span>e egotism and greed of those two want to profit from church and religion.</p>
