   <p>The government officials from the bureau of "undesirable" aliens, with duty to guard the state from such dangerous elements, Mr.G. E. Schubert (known as a secret policeman or a plaincloth man) conducts an investigation against "Radnicka Straza," Saturday at 1 P.M. he honored us with a visit.</p>
   <p>Two weeks before he had called three comrades to come to his office-not considering the waste of time for the men - one answered - John MASTEN -went to the bureau. Mr. Schubert was not there. He was told that they will call us again, but will not visit us: he did last. He came and brought No. 51. "R. S." of Dec. 9, 1910. A translated editorial "Mr. TAFT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS."</p>
   <p>Mr. Schuber asked how long they were in the "free United States"(so that some may be deported)</p>
   <p>He asked if we believe (!) in organized government. He Also asked how they had the struggle and what way they expect to reach the goal -- and the goal is revolution, change of capitalistic system into socialism! He received the answers -- and marked them down. He learned what he wanted, he for translation of the article substance of which is that the Taft's government serves capitalism. and for that article we are ready to carry <span class="page-break">2</span>all responsibility -- come what may. We may mention: that the persecution doesn't scare us! We know that the socialist movement in this free country "will only be persecuted. We can see fast sharpening differences between labor and capital and we see that the government is placing all its might on the side of late - but we know that struggle will temper our forces and we will succeed.</p>
   <p>We also know that the Socialist Party will take us in its defense, also "League of Defense" that defended bigger "offenders" - fellows accord-ing to the Russian Reuchman - it defended RUDOVICH, PUREN and FEDERENKO. We recommend to Mr. Schubert to study those incidents and save his bluff, to his higher up and to those black bums that denounced us. Most interesting aspect of whole affair is Mr. Schubert's acknowledgement that his investigation is based on the denouncement, based on the false report of some unworthy country man of ours!! Some dishonest spy is secretly undermining.</p>
   <p>AZEV, famous Russian spy couldn't for ever cover his track, he met his fate, that should be the lesson to spies.</p>
   <p>Will this start some sort of stampede against "R. S." and what will the authorities do in the future. We don't know but we may suspect. We are <span class="page-break">3</span>not afraid that they will deport some of us -- the reacionaries are not that strong yet. But they may entangle us in a long law-suit, for which we are not financially prepared.</p>
   <p>Our Central Committee and our association in Chicago know its duty and will try and forestall any assault. Others too in this great country should consider this matter and come in with their support. This is the time where all comrades should do their duty, which class conscious worker should never forget. It is imperative that all should agitate for "R. S." get new readers, more subscribers. Gather new fighters, forward with the socialist struggle. Let that be the answer to our enemy's and authorities that listen to their lies come workers for the Radnicka Straza.</p>
