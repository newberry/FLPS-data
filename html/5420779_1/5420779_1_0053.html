   <p>All are convinced that a good book spreads culture. History proves that from Gutenberg's time on all the educators tried to educate through good books.</p>
   <p>A good book ennobles the heart, enriches the mind, but a bad book is able to spoil and destroy all that is ethically good in us</p>
   <p>The youth follows the example of older people. Just for that reason, youth will take after bad books read by their elders. The markt is flooded with inferior books.</p>
   <p>For many people this, seems to be of no importance, but the influence of bad reading is of great importance for a young person in his later life. Our youth must be advised to read our wondered national poems, our beautiful national tales, our historical narratives, these will influence the national spirit of our youth.</p>

   <p>The reading of books and papers of different political parties should be replaced with reading of books which will educate the mind.</p>
   <p>Employers have to watch, what their young employees read. By encouraging reading of good books, they will do more for the uplifting of our people than by donating thousands in money for you folks who are morally lost already.</p>
   <p>We have to educate our youth and that we will do best by placing good books in to their hands.</p>
