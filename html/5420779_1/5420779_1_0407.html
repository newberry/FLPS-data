   <p>Many, many times we declared that we do not approve of the Unions of Labor or the manner in which they act. Their action was restricted to too narrow borders. The American Union men had in mind just a limited fight for betterment of their daily existence. Never did they looked forward, never thought about the future and liberation of the working classes.</p>
   <p>As long as capitalism prospered, as long as there was work, it went some way. The workers unionized and acquired some benefits. But that is ended now. The number of proletarians grew. Farmers and tradesmen who were forced to quit augmented the number of unemployed workers. Today the worker has to fight with his fellow worker for his daily bread.</p>
   <p>In America there are one million jobless workers today. The few benefits easily won by them make the workers to dream. But the most distressing fact remains that there were "leaders" and" prominents" who led the workers' struggle from the right path, who misguided the workers for the benefit of capitalism. Yes, Gompers, Mitchell and others rendered great services to capitalism. If they did it voluntarily or against their own will does not change in the matter.</p>
   <p>The workers were misdirected not to watch for their future. They were <span class="page-break">2</span>led from the only aim and purpose in this fight of the laboring classes, which is the abolition of the capitalistic system.</p>
   <p>While this happened, the rich capitalists did their best to entangle the workers.</p>
   <p>The trusts appeared and become omnipotent. Capitalism put its men in government positions.</p>
   <p>The Courts, the Army, the Police, all the machinery of government is in the hands of the capitalist class. In Congress there are no representatives of the laboring class. There capital is the ruler. In the legislature there sit representatives of capital to make laws, order taxes and tolls. The cost of living goes higher. The government sends the army against strikers. The Courts prosecute any labor movement. Boycotts are declared to be against the law. It is impossible to enumerate all evils against labor caused by capitalism for the reason that the workers did not recognize in time that their fight thru Trade Unions is insufficient. They neglected to lead a political fight. The workers supported capitalistic parties, did not care to send workers as law makers to have influence on economic questions. The capitalist did understand the political impotence of the worker and took away and grabbed these few things which the worker had acquired in the previous struggle.</p>

   <p>Just at present, capitalism made a new, fearful stroke against the laboring class.</p>
   <p>The Hat ters' Union at Dansbury, Con., instituted a strike in D. Loewe's Hat Factory. The strike was not successful so the hatters started a boycott.</p>
   <p>The owner of the factory sued for damages caused by the boycott. The Court at Hartford, Connecticut, found the hatters guilty of $222,000 damages, with about $10,000 court costs.</p>
   <p>For these amounts all the members of the Hatters' Union, 200 of them, were made responsible. They vouched with all their possessions for the payment.</p>
   <p>The boycott was declared a crime in free America, while in all other lands an orderly boycott is permitted.</p>
   <p>How will American Labor take this stroke against right? Will that strike open the eyes of the American workingmen, to see whereto capitalism leads? Will he recognize the need of an independent political fight, which is advocated by the socialists?</p>
   <p>It seems the breakdown of the labor movement in America is unavoidable. It seems the Socialist Party is confronted with great tasks. Will victory follow? Hundreds of thousands of union workers understand the undisputable teachings of socialism. The judgment of Hartford's Hatters will be of consequence, may alarm the workers to enter in an independent, political fight.</p>
