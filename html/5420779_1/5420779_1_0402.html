   <p>Very often we hear: "Our people are not educated. Before you preach Socialism enlighten the people." That is said earnestly and impartially by our adversaries.</p>
   <p>Enlighten! Enlighten! What else does Socialism do than enlighten?</p>
   <p>Let us see what the word enlighten means.</p>
   <p>"Enlighten means to uncover the causes of occurrences in our environment. Uncover laws causing such occurrences, be they laws of nature or of society. To enlighten means to take off of peoples eyes the veil, which does not allow to know and discern the laws of nature or laws made by society.</p>
   <p>Cognisant of this fact we ask once more: What does Socialism do? Socialism uncovers to mankind all the causes of misery, crime and badness.</p>
   <p>Socialism threw the first rays of light into the abyss of human relations. We know by now why war, poverty, and injustice exist.</p>
   <p>Why are the workers abused, why are women without rights, why does generally economical and political disparity exist. The anwers to all these questions we receive from teachings of Socialism. Socialism explained and unmasked the doings of society.Socialism demonstrated to us laws which govern the present day society. Socialism taking as a base <span class="page-break">2</span>the past and the present, outlined the future of humanity.</p>
   <p>Socialism found the key for the development of human society and salvation. Great and mighty is the socialist idea.</p>
   <p>When we Socialists spread among workingmen, farmers and tradesmen all the teachings offered by Socialism, we do a great educational act.</p>
   <p>The more - Socialism is not only one, but the most important of all the educational factors in the sense of that word.</p>
   <p>Any one is able to teach reading and writing, arithmetic, and a little in physical science, chemistry, and geography. Of course, such a person does much good to the people.</p>
   <p>But this service must be compared as nothing, compared with services rendered by Socialist teachings.</p>
   <p>The work of a common educator will do little in dispersing ignorance. Because he does not teach the people, from where originate his misery, his sufferings, how abate them?</p>
   <p>Only Socialism explains these issues, and points the way; humanity will overcome them. For that reason it is natural that Socialism is very close to the people's heart and soul and influences human thoughts.</p>
   <p>We socialists are the only bearers of enlightenment.</p>
   <p>Socialism is the science of the oppressed, robbed and the outlawed. The masses of the people are the place for this work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Today all the nations are awakening, conscious of human progress and civilization. Leading them are workingmen fighting for the prosperity and happiness of the whole human race.</p>
   <p>Is not all of that magnificent? Culture covered by the word - ideal? Does all that not mean: to teach, uplift, to enlighten humanity?</p>
   <p>Is there a more beautiful teaching than that of Socialism, which is against egotism in man? Preaching love, equality and liberty for everybody?</p>
   <p>Only Socialism disperses darkness and ignorance, carries around light and hope and leads all the lawless nations to fight for a happier future.</p>
   <p>Is there a more dignified work than to save the farmer, to show him a better future, where there will not be constant insecurity, ignorance and slavery?</p>
   <p>The teachings of Socialism in cultural fields, through education, destroy the dominance of money and riches, create of man a new being who will be ruler of the Cosmos.</p>
   <p>Yes, we Socialists are educators, the real bearers of people's enlightenment.</p>
   <p>But Socialism not only lifts up the human reasoning through his principles, Socialism ennobles the human heart. The struggle led by the working class is tiresome and hard.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>That struggle exacts work and sacrifices.The more the Socialist movement progresses, the more the desire develops to change this ugly and unjust state of things.</p>
   <p>In turn this influences the good qualities in man. His character looses its barbaric and inhuman traits. Socialism is the mightiest lever to lift humanity to the heavenly heights of reason, science and progress.</p>
