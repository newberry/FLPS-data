   <p>The organization of progressive workers' clubs is in order in all settlements where a greater number of our people live. Such organizations are existing among other nationalities because there is felt a necessity for the enlightenment of the working class.</p>
   <p>The capitalist class has its different clubs and organizations in all towns, and gathers in them youths and workers, because such clubs are a good instrument in capitalistic hands to teach workers bourgeois ideas. To make them for a certain length of time not dangerous for the capitalist order, which is based on extortion, exploitation and oppression of the working class, such is the basic purpose of bourgeois clubs.</p>
   <p>The workers until lately did not have their own clubs to gather their members and educate them. That means to educate them in the ideology of the working class.</p>

   <p>The progressive workers of Chicago took steps to organize in Chicago a working men's club, which will take into its circle a greater number of workers and improve their culture. For that purpose a meeting was called to make preparations for the organization of such a club. The chief speaker at that meeting, Comrade Zinic, explained the economic and cultural necessity of the workers to have such a club.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, a committee of eleven was elected to organize a great club, while all those interested would help the committee in their task. After the preparations are made, the club will begin to function.</p>
