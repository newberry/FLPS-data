   <p>Every workman who is not a citizen is obliged to procure his citizenship papers. It does not amount to much if you just have good principles; strive after other ideals if you do not care to procure citizenship, in order to be able to participate in the fight for the realization of our aims.</p>
   <p>He who has his first papers and is entitled to the second, why not take them out immediately? He who has not even the first papers, why not procure them? Better late than not at all. It is regrettable that many immigrant workmen do not care much for these things. Many of them have been here ten years or more and do not think about getting what they are entitled to.</p>
   <p>More regrettable is the fact that there are many who are Socialists and do not even take out their first papers, so little do they think of they think of becoming citizens.</p>

   <p>There are comrades who during the election campaign are very active as solicitors of votes for their Socialist Party, but they are not citizens and cannot help with their own votes.</p>
   <p>There is one more reason why one whould take out citizenship papers. According to the new naturalization law, the first papers are void after seven years. After the 28th of September of this year, all first papers taken out more than seven years age will be void. Whoever does not become a citizen by that date-if his papers were taken out over seven years ago-has to take cut another set of first papers and hold them for two years before being eligible for citizenship.</p>
   <p>To become a citizen is not very expensive. Instructions on how to become such can be gotten at the office of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, 111 N. Market St., Chicago. Our Jugoslav Socialist branches must take care that as soon as a member has the right to become a citizen, it is done. Such members are very few. We have to have more, and then will our participation in the Socialist struggle for liberation be more useful.</p>
