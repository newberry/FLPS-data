   <p>Sacco and Vanzetti are condemned to die. If they are not saved by the strong hands of the working class they will perish in the electric chair. The capitalist class is after the worker's blood.</p>
   <p>Why is the capitalist class so eager to destroy both of these Italian workers?</p>
   <p>The formal charge against them is murder of a payroll clerk of a capitalist enterprise. But this charge is just a trick to conceal the real class character of the affair. Salzedo, a witness for Sacco and Vanzetti, who possessed information of the frame-up against both, "threw" himself from the 14th floor of a building in New York after he was arrested by agents of the Department of Justice of the democratic government of the United States.</p>

   <p>That was done to cover up the truth. Salzedo paid with his life for his fidelity to his comrades, who were framed by the servants of capitalism.</p>
   <p>Even without the testimony of Salzedo the defence was able to prove the complete innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti, inasmuch as they were not on the spot at the time the murder was committed. What is more, the defence proved that the bullet which killed the payroll clerk did not fit in Sacco's revolver.</p>
   <p>After the trial the defence was able to obtain affidavits from witnesses against Sacco, stating that their testimony given at the trial was false.</p>
   <p>But Judge Thayer, sending two workers to their deaths, denied them a new trial. Even if the whole world does know that both accused are innocent, they must die as a reward for their loyalty to the working class.</p>

   <p>But the working class of America and of the whole world must not allow that to happen. When sentence was pronounced by a servant of the capitalist class, the people in far off Red Russia, in Italy and France, all over the world, protested against this to heaven, crying about the crime which the American ruling class wants to commit against two innocent workers.</p>
   <p>We must not stay away. The American proletarians must be in the first ranks of the battle line to save the lives of these comrades. From all gatherings and meetings, from union meetings, from factories, mines and shops, from all over wherever workers are, a loud voice of protest must be heard against such great injustice. From now on the slogan of the working class must be: "Sacco and Vanzetti must go free."</p>
