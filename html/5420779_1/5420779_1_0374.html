   <p>The last few days we had in Chicago a very lively agitation and enlightment for our socialistic cause. Soon we will have 300 to 400 members in our Jugoslav Socialist Federation instead of the 300 which we have now. That means more class conscious Proletarians in our ranks. Instead of 400 subscribers of yesterday, we will have 1,000 soon.</p>
   <p>On Nov. 30, we had two Anti-war meetings. December 2nd, two excellent lecturers, (at Clybourne and Center Avenues.) We distributed about 2,000 leaflets and sold $15 worth of Socialist books. We get 36 new subscribers.</p>
   <p>Comrades! We have to continue this work, especially, we have to put more weight on lectures.</p>
   <p>From the last lecture you went away satisfied. You will return to other lectures in greater numbers. But you must try to bring <span class="gap">[gap]</span> those who are not organized.</p>
   <p>The next lecture will be Saturday, Dec. 16th.</p>
