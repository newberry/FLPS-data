   <p>These days the membership of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation will have to decide by voting about a very important issue proposed by the central committee.</p>
   <p>The committee proposes to raise membership fees ten cents per month, the ten cents to be used as an agitator's fund to defray expenses when sending agitators and organizers to places outside of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Here are the reasons which prompted the committee to submit to the members such a proposition:</p>
   <p>At our last congress in Milwaukee it was planned to employ a permanent traveling organizer who would give lectures and hold meetings in places where our branches exist, to organize and establish new branches in places where there are favorable conditions.</p>
   <p>The committee very often receives requests to send out speakers. Whenever possible the committee send out a speaker, but the expenses for remote places were too high, especially for the branches with small membership.</p>
   <p>Branches with small treasuries can not stand those expenses, and just such branches are in need of speakers and agitators, to make the indifferent masses interested in our socialist movement. Young, inexperienced comrades <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are to be directed in how to do business in the branch.</p>
   <p>If all the sums of money which are expended for speakers on meetings, debates, lectures and so forth,were put together it would be shown that for that money a permanent organizer could be engaged.</p>
   <p>Such an organizer traveling according to a fixed schedule from place to place could reach the same place twice or three times in a year.</p>
   <p>For that reason it is necessary that all the money given out for the speakers by single branches accumulate. The expenses are justly and equally divided all over the federation, so that each member pays ten cents monthly, which money is deposited in the fund for agitation.</p>
   <p>It is not said the agitator or organizer must be the same person for all times and places. That work may be divided, but some one should be on the road, and his expenses paid from the fund.</p>
   <p>Such planned agitation would be more successful, the expenses equally divided, with benefits for all concerned. That is a very important fact. There are many places where conditions are favorable for establishing branches but there is nobody in those places able to start things going and there is no money to send an organizer there.</p>
   <p>Our organizers will visit such towns, to establish branches, and that will benefit our press and federation.</p>
   <p>If our comrades consider our proposition, we are sure, they will vote for it.</p>
