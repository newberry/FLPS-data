   <p>The bad economic conditions have had a bad effect on all cultural and political organizations of the working class. This applies to the Jugoslav Socialist Federation also.</p>
   <p>The federation did not lose in membership but its progress was not in the same proportion as it was during the first three years, when the economic conditions in this country were more favorable.</p>
   <p>If we investigate the causes of the set-back in our progress in the second half of 1914, we will find them in the strikes of the miners in Illinois, Chio and Arkansas, and bad working conditions for the miners of Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>If we bear in mind that 75% of all the members of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation are miners it is easy to explain why its progress was retarded.</p>
   <p>In the month of May, 1914, the Federation was organized according to states and in each of them admitted to the Socialist party of America. Until that time our members were considered just as a section withoutall the rights of the party.</p>

   <p>During four years we added to the federation one hundred fifty-two branches and thirty-three branches went out of existence. On December 31, 1914, there were one hundred nineteen active branches in the federation. Total income for four years was $17,804.49; total expenses, $17,601.71. Total assets of the federation and of the branches are at the end of 1914, $9,948.12. If to that we add the assets of the official organs of the federation and the stock of literature supervised by the press committee, then the total assets would be $17,264.12</p>
   <p>The slogan of all of us who are trying to increase our Socialist ranks in America must be: "To work! Forward for economical, political and cultural liberation of the Jugoslav workers in America."</p>
