   <p>Again one step ahead toward victory. Yes, the smallest success is a step closer to our goal!</p>
   <p>The fact that we dare to even think of realizing a women's organization speaks for itself. The thought was not empty. A ladies meeting was held last Sunday, and they established an organization which will be a link in the large chain of the world's labor struggle.</p>
   <p>Member's fees will be 30c monthly, the same as men -- the same rights, the same duties. A temporary committee of three will do the necessary work until the first regular meeting. A small number joined at the start -- eight in all --of us and with that we started our paper Radnicka Straza.</p>
   <p>Today after a comparatively short time there are over 5,000 of us with the movement and we are supporting and reading Radnicka Straza.</p>
   <p>Big things are all born small. This should be our toast to all new members and comrades</p>
