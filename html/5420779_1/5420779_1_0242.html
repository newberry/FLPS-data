   <p>The Communist Party Branch of Fraternal Order No. 57, Croatian Brotherhood Union (H. B. Z.), issued an unbecoming, lying circular written in an extremely low fashion, bitterly attacking in an ignorant style the answer to our query: "Who in the H. B. Z. are the agents of the Belgrade regime?"</p>
   <p>This foolishness was printed in Radnik. Judging by its style, silly expressians, number of grammatical errors and general ignorance, this foolishness must have originated on Radnik's offices. Once when it appeared as a circular it came out in Radnik's pages. It is understood that Radnik, according to the circular, discovered agents of the Belgrade regime in the Croatian Fraternal Union.</p>
   
   <p>It also appears that the members of the Jugoslav Educational Association are Fascists, or Social-Fascists, and that Novi Svijet took in its defence Ga<span class="gap">[gap]</span>dic and Jonic, president and secretary of H. B. Z.</p>
   <p>Their only argument is that Novi Svijet is against the special convention of H. P. Z. But our reasoning in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to the special convention, no decent and normal person would come to such conclusion, never, only the Radnik, and its insane followers whose <span class="gap">[gap]</span>irtues, sensibilities, honor and decency are darkened by fanati<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ism and stupidity.<span class="gap">[gap]</span> are a few <span class="gap">[gap]</span> from our writings concerning the affairs of H. B. Z. its president, secretary, and the decoration the received from the Jugoslav king, etc., and let our readers he the judges. They will see who supports the re<span class="gap">[gap]</span> and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>dic and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> president and secretary of H. B. Z.</p>
   
   <p>In this work the agents of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> regian uses various means. One is to influence the man in public life, such as newspaper owners and editors, merchants and professionals, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, who are thought to be influential in the colony and will <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to spread their idea and thereby justify the necessity of the present form of government in Jugoslavia. In pursuing their policy further, the higher representatives of the Jugoslav monarchy and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> decided to decorate the head officials of H. B. Z., and through them induct their poisonous propaganda into this benevolent organization. The confidence which workers have in their leaders should <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with. It is dangerous to play hero of a bloody government at the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> expense. They have opened their eyes and learned from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> understand the nature of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will not allow <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of their organization, either <span class="gap">[gap]</span> or unconsciously, to serve the oppres<span class="gap">[gap]</span> their brothers in the old country.</p>
   
   <p>From the article, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and diachronic and<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Nevi Svi<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Feb. 27, 1930.</p>
   <p>Since <span class="gap">[gap]</span> ever social and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> movement is forbidden, especially an opposition which is totally abolished.</p>
   <p>Jails in Jugoslavia are full of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> awaiting trial. In <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are reserved to, worse than in the dark ages of the Inquisition.</p>
   <p>We don't like to be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> but <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the nurely natural development and logically conceived ideas, this distatership will not last long. The end may not be very far, and the quicker it falls the better for Croatian, Serbians and Slovenians.</p>

   <p>In neither Germany, England, France, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Italy, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>alkans, nor United States or<span class="gap">[gap]</span> other place in the world can the present a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> so that it can sur<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ive very long.</p>
