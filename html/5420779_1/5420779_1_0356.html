   <p>Sunday, April 10, 1913, at 2 P. M., in the National Hall, corner of 18th Street and Center Avenue,</p>
   <p>PUBLIC PEOPLE'S MEETING</p>
   <p>with discussion of</p>
   <p>1. Are the Socialists wreckers of home and family life?</p>
   <p>2. Are the Socialists lazy bones and bums?</p>
   <p>3. Are the Socialists without religion or nationality?</p>
   <p>All those things were affirmed last Sunday by the Croatian priest Rev. Sorich. For that reason we call on Rev. Sorich to appear at this meeting to prove his charges in public. Rev. Sorich may talk one hour, then a Socialist will speak one hour. After that Rev. Sorich will be permitted one-half hour more, and a Socialist will close with a 15 minute talk.</p>
