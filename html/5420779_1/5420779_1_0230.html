   <p>To help unemployed workers Cardinal Hayes, Roman-Catholic leader in this country, set aside every Friday, from October 30 to December 18, as a day for prayer. He issued an order to all believers and the clergy to join in prayer. Croatian churches of Roman Catholic faith are willing to pray and cooperate with the order. There are about ten Croatian churches of Roman-Catholic faith in this district.</p>
   <p>Neither Cardinal Hayes nor the rest of the clergy - with very small exception - believe that prayer will end unemployment, and that the good Lord will send manna to the poor. Miracles such as these occurred in ancient times when intelligence was low and the leader could fool the masses with images and present them as true facts.</p>
   <p>Such comedy with prayer is being prepared to show seeming sympathy toward workers and to keep believers in the ancient darkness of faith <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in whose name the worst kind of exploitation is committed.</p>
   <p>The workers could wait forever before they receive the help from heaven. They may even come to believe that it ever happened or that the Cardinal and the spiritual leaders receive their bread and their luxuries from heaven. That which never happened to priests, who are God's servants, cannot happen to workers, who are only common sinners.</p>
   <p>Salvation of the working class is not in the prayer but in education and organization. Work and struggle against the whole system of injustice and oppression.</p>
