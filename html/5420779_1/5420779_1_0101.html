   <p>More than fifty years ago the Croats started to come to that part of the city known as South Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the year 1902, there came to South Chicago a Slovenian priest, Father John Pleonik, with the intention of organizing a parish of Slovenians and to build a church, but he did not succeed.</p>
   <p>In February, 1903, came Rev. John Kranjec, who started to organize the Slovenians and Croats in the Parish of St. George. Lots for the building of a church were bought on the corner of Ewing Avenue and 96th Street. The church was dedicated, June 17, 1904, by Archbishop J. E. Quigley.</p>
   <p>The new parish prospered for many years, but there came discord between the parishioners of the two different nationalities, the Slovenes and Croats.</p>
   
   <p>The Croats, numerically stronger than the Slovenes, complained of the neglect of their Croatian parish members by the priest, a Slovene.</p>
   <p>On April 28, 1912, a committee was elected to appeal to the bishop and have a Croatian priest sent to their parish. The bishop advised the Croats to build their own church and promised he would get them a priest. On Christmas, 1912, the Croats of South Chicago had a Croatian priest, Rev. Sorio, to celebrate mass.</p>
   <p>From that date many of the leading Croatians of South Chicago started to be interested in having a church of their own and a Croatian priest. They were successful in getting Rev. Ivan A. Stipanovich, under whose guidance money was collected and the new church built.</p>
   <p>The Daily Calumet of December 24, 1913, says: "The new Croatian church on 96th Street and Exchange Avenue will have its first service Christmas Eve, at 12 o'clock A.M. Rev. Father J. A. Stipanovich, pastor of the congregation, is happily engaged with his people in decorating and preparing his church for the first mass, which they are so gladly awaiting. Although this young pastor has been only one year in this country, in this short time he has made great progress, together with his countrymen and leaders of Croatian people in South Chicago, toward uplifting and educating their people by building up their school and church."</p>
   <p>We sincerely wish him every success and improvement, as we do to every other good work in South Chicago. The first mass was read in the new church on Christmas Eve, 1913. The corner stone was laid August 31, 1913. The church was dedicated by Archbishop Quigley, May 17, 1914.</p>
