   <p>To Czech parents living in Irving Park and vicinity! The patronat (managing board) of the Ceska Svobomyslna Skola F. B. Zdrubek (F. B. Zdrubek Bohemian Free Thought School) takes the liberty to announce that registration of pupils for the Saturday and Sunday morning classes will be held on September 2, 1922 at 9 A. M. and on September 3, 1922 at 9 A. M.</p>
   <p>Day school pupils are to register on Tuesday, September 5, 1922 at 4 P. M. By this arrangement, the patronat accedes to the wishes of those parents who, though wishing to enroll their children in the day school, find the hours unsuitable for various reasons.</p>
   <p>We fervently hope that these parents will appreciate our efforts, and will enroll their children in a Bohemian school. In this way they will do their national duty. Children are admitted to this school when 7 years of age or over.</p>
