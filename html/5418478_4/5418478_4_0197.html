   <p>Shortly after three o'clock this morning Mr. František B. Zdrubek died at his home, 4010 Grenshaw Avenue. From the very moment he was stricken with paralysis in the left side of his body the doctors feared this outcome despite the fact that he fought bravely for his life. Since Monday, when he was stricken, Mr. Zdrubek, regained consciousness only once, and then only momentarily.</p>
   <p>By the death of Mr. Zdrubek, one of the best known and most deserving of men was torn from our midst. Mr. Zdrubek, as a newspaperman, as a liberal-minded man, and as a patriot, ranked in first place among us, and today even those who were his opponents bow their heads respectfully beside his bier. The details about the funeral have not yet been decided upon. The deceased is survived by only one son. The son, together with his wife and young daughter, lived with his father on Grenshaw Avenue.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. František Boleslav Zdrubek was born on July 26, 1842 in Bezdĕdicích, Hostomic, Bohemia. He graduated from the gymnasium [High School] and then studied theology in Prague. Later, he studied at the Protestant Seminary in Basel, Switzerland. He arrived in Chicago in May 1867. Soon he dedicated himself to newspaper work, and edited the liberal-minded [Free Thought] Pokrok in Racine, Wisconsin. In 1869, this paper moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and in 1871 to Cleveland, Ohio. In 1874, he became editor of Pokrok Zapadu in Omaha, Nebraska, and in October 1875, he was editor of the Svornost in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. B. Zdrubek can really be considered as founder of the liberal-minded [Free Thought] party in America, and especially in Chicago. He worked for it by word of mouth and in writing. He published the Svojan and in addition wrote many articles, the purpose of which was to teach our countrymen liberal-mindedness and the English language. He also published several text books for the youth attending Czech [Free Thought] schools. He was an enthusiastic, tireless worker, the like of which are seldom found. That which he considered right, and which he defended without regard aroused many antagonists.</p>
   <p>Much remains after Mr. Zdrubek which insures his continued remembrance by all American Czechs.</p>
