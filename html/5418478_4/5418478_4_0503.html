Lots on 57th Avenue and 22nd Place have been purchased, thus assuring that the new school building will be situated in the center of Cicero's Bohemian community.</p>

To begin construction work in winter time is considered especially advantageous because of the fact that many generous Bohemian bricklayers and carpenters are expected to offer their services free of charge. The chairman of the building committee, Mr. Jan Sebek, announces that about twenty offers of this nature have already been received.....</p>
