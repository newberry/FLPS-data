   <p>Benevolent Society will hold their annual picnic on Sunday, May 26th, in beautiful Silver Leaf Grove, on 12th Street.</p>
   <p>Industrious preparations are being made to assure the success of the picnic in all respects. Bohemian sharpshooters cheerfully attend all picnics given by National societies and it is hoped that under these circumstances their favors will be repaid.</p>
