   <p>P.4--The directors of the Bohemian National Cemetery have given $1,000 to Bohemian schools in Chicago as a New Year's gift. This gift was made in the hope that it may help to offset the increasing cost of maintenance of the school.</p>
   <p>The attendance in these schools has increased during the last several years, requiring the opening of more classes and the employment of more teachers.</p>
   <p>We believe that the money was donated to a worthy cause.</p>
   <p>It will help our children to learn the Bohemian language and also to absorb certain fundamental rules of behavior which will be essential in later life.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian people of Chicago feel proud that their number has increased to 100,000, but their schools, libraries, theatres, and art-clubs have not kept pace with the increase in population. This condition could soon be corrected if more of us would take an interest in these things. We are a progressive race. Let us show it!</p>
