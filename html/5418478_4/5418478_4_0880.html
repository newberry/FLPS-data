   <p>The celebration held last night by the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) was a truly dignified commemoration of the famous "teacher of nations," Jan Amos Komensky (Johann Amos Comenius). During the program, he was remembered correctly as an apostle of peace, who disseminated the pacifist teachings of the Bohemian Brothers among other nations. These teachings condemn all wars, as well as any use of compulsion by brute force.</p>
   <p>The spacious premises of the Beseda were filled with members and guests who listened to the speeches with keen interest.</p>
   <p>The English speech was delivered by Mr. William B. Owen, the principal of the local teachers' college, who used to lecture on Komensky at the University of Chicago.....This was Mr. Owen's first appearance before a Bohemian audience, and it is to be hoped that it will not be his last.</p>
   
   <p>Professor J. J. Zmrhal spoke of Komensky as an apostle of universal peace. His speech was well worth listening to.</p>
   <p>The men's chorus of the Beseda contributed to the success of the evening by their presentation of a number of choral compositions.....</p>
