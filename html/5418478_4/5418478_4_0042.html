   <p>The Lodge #41 celebrated yesterday, starting at noontime, the unveiling of its new flag. The celebration was preceeded by an imposing parade to "Thalia Hall," corner 18th and Allport streets. The parade made a round of many streets between 18th and 20th and all the way different clubs and societies joined it. The parade was accompanied by fifteen carriages and coaches with mother, god-mother, maids and delegates. The celebration started with placing the flag and its mother, Mrs. Stuchlik, and its god-mother, Mrs. Ludvigova, in the place of honor.</p>
   <p>In the rear were located maids of honor and many flags of other clubs and societies.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened by John Jurena, Pres. International Businessmen's Union, who greeted the present guests and introduced to them all officials of the club.</p>
   
   <p>Several patriotic speeches were delivered, commemorating the dynasty of "Premysl," during whose rules as Kings of Bohemia, the country reached the highest development and prosperity. All Bohemians should be proud of their past history and always be true to this national flag, so much more - as it is the product of hard work of the Bohemian women's hands.</p>
   <p>The speaker of the celebration, F. B. Zdrubek, told the audience what the ideas of clubs and lodges, the fraternity and friendship of members united under the new flag - should be forever.</p>
   <p>Mutual help in industry and workmanship should be the main guiding idea of the Bohemian societies, especially those in Chicago, as the Bohemian community is in need of such cooperation. He appealed to all American Bohemians never to forget the real meaning of brotherhood. The new flag was then adorned with innumerable flowers and greeted by representatives of other societies.</p>
   
   <p>After expiration of the celebration program delegates and guests danced continuing late into the night.</p>
