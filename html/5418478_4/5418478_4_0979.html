   <p>The Junior Sokol tournament held in Douglas Park on July 1, 1922, revealed the good physical development of our youth. Everyone was impressed by the serious behaviour of the young contestants; it was proof that the junior members really understand the meaning of discipline. It was a joy to see how humbly but with what an undoubted self-confidence these lads prepared for the tourney. When we consider the ill-chosen time of the tournament, we must feel a certain satisfaction in seeing thirty-two adolescent boys and forty-six adolescent girls take part in the competitions. Only the very best teams and individuals were permitted to compete.</p>
   <p>Of the junior teams, the Pilsen Sokol won the first prize with 263.3 points; the second prize went to the Sokol Slavsky with 259.55 points; the third to the Sokol Chicago with 246.76 points; the fourth to the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs with 237.76 points. Among the individuals (juniors) competing, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Brother Jindra of the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) gained 49.36 out of a possible 50 points; Brother Rada of the Sokol Slavsky gained 47.5 points; the third place went to Narovec of the same team, who gained 47 points.</p>
   <p>Among the female juniors, the first place went to the Pilsen Sokol team--283.15 points; the second to the first team of the Havlicek-Tyrs--260.4 points; the third to the second team of the same organization--236.25 points; the fourth to the Karel Jonas Sokol team--229.45 points; the fifth to the team of the Sokol Chicago--229.45 points; the sixth to the first team of the Sokol Slavsky--207.6 points; the seventh to the second team of the same organization--184.1 points.

   <p>The whole performance went smoothly, the various contests rapidly following one another. On July 4, 1922, the central district participated in the tournament of the American Gymnastic Union. The [so-called] male sixteen was truly Czechoslovakian, since there were eight Slovaks of the Zupa (district) Ludevit Stur and eight Czechs. There was also a "female sixteen". The spectators were tremendously impressed with the excellent drills of both teams. It was a truly fine example of teamwork. It is time that such teamwork became evident in all of our national work; there must be unity, brotherly sincerity, and mutual confidence. These will produce a sacred tie which will bind us together. Let us all hail this joint responsibility.</p>
