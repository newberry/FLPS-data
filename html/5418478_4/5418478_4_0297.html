   <p>The representatives of our public bodies, unions, and associations who form the advisory boards of free-thought schools in America should most decidedly call to the attention of the Press Committee of the Svobodná Škola [Free-Thought School] the fact that this purely children's paper is published for another purpose than that of stirring up controversies in our public life, or of printing provocative pronouncements, under no matter what cover these pronouncements may be hidden. In the January issue, we find two articles which absolutely do not belong in a paper devoted to the spiritual education of youth. How sad a phenomenon it is when a periodical whose publication is paid for by the whole freethinking public is used for the sinister machinations of a few individuals who are trying in this way to rehabilitate their somewhat besmirched reputations! We are convinced that this warning will receive proper attention in responsible circles and that it will not be necessary for us to talk more plainly to the vainglorious individuals who are members of the odiously illustrious press committee.</p>
