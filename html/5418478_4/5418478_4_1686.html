   <p>The thirteenth session of the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) [hereinafter referred to as the Jednota] was opened yesterday morning in the usual fashion by the president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek. The pass word ceremony was waived, and the calling of the roll followed. It was ascertained that all the delegates were present with the exception of a few tardy members who arrived later. The minutes of the [two] previous sessions were read and fully approved. The reading of congratulatory messages continued. [List of congratulatory messages sent by various lodges, societies, and individuals is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Various recommendations and suggestions were then in order, that is, such suggestions as would improve the functioning of the Jednota generally. There was a debate concerning the propaganda fund by means of which a better knowledge of the work of the Jednota could be disseminated. One of the Cleveland delegates <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>declared that there would be no objection on her part if the Chicago members were inclined to organize such a fund. The convention secretary explained that the preservation of the Czech nationality may not be expected in large cities [of the United States], but in small country towns such propaganda [as previously alluded to] should be made so that the Jednota might establish lodges in places not having them. This, she asserted, would lead to the preservation of the Czech nationality in those places. Another Cleveland delegate, speaking for her own lodge, announced that she would not object to the creation of a propaganda fund, but, as far as her own lodge is concerned, she would not wish the tax for this to be more than five cents per member during the first year. After the propaganda fund is exhausted, the central committee could levy a new tax similar to the one which preceded it, but not until the disposition of the previous fund has been accounted for. Other delegates argued that nobody should expect a presiding officer of a lodge to spend her own money to finance trips to some distant towns for the purpose of starting new lodges or clubs there. New lodges and clubs should be organized with the aid of the propaganda fund, and this fund should also <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>be used to pay awards to the founders of new lodges or clubs. The delegates who recommended the creation of this fund did not ask for more than five cents annually from every member [of the Jednota]. This would affect all lodge and club members equally. The matter was put to a vote; there were 592 in agreement and 78 opposing. The propaganda fund will, consequently, be created. The per capita tax shall be five cents per annum. From this fund rewards shall be paid to the founders of new lodes. Any member who secures twenty members in a city or twelve members in the country, and thus creating a new lodge, shall receive $15 from the said fund. The same will hold true for the founders of clubs. In case there should be two or three founders, the reward shall be equally divided among them. The reward shall be paid by the central committee.</p>
   <p>It was decided that in cases where any member of any lodge brings legal action against her lodge, such members shall not be excluded from the Jednota, but shall be deprived of all privileges [they heretofore were entitled to], provided that nothing in this ruling is in contravention of the laws [of the land].</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Officers of a lodge against whom the legal proceedings were instituted shall be deposed. A lodge, which sues the Jednota, shall not hold any meetings during the course of the litigation.</p>
   <p>Lodge No. 64 recommended that the password be abolished by the entire Jednota. It was pointed out that the password could be abolished only in small towns or villages where all members of lodges are known to one another, but not so in large cities. An overwhelming majority voted against abolishing of the password.</p>
   <p>The Cleveland central committee moved that the central committee be denied the right to reintroduce, for the purpose of voting by individual lodges, any provision made by the Jednota in convention assembled. This motion was approved. It was further decided that the central committee shall be in charge of the propaganda fund.</p>
   <p>Since no [other] suggestions or recommendations were made for the good of the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Jednota, the convention was ready to consider applications for aid [made by various organizations]. A plea was made that the Bohemian Free Thought schools be remembered as much as possible. The following institutions sent applications for aid: the Cechu Domov (Home of the Czechs) of Cleveland, Ohio; the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) of Chicago; the patronat (managing board) of the Ceska Svobomyslna Skola Jan Komensky (John Comenius Bohemian Free Thought School) of Cleveland, [Ohio], and a number of other organizations and institutions. It was pointed out that the central committee has $2,100 on hand. [After] paying the [expenses] of the presiding committee of the convention ($340), there will be other expenses connected with [this] convention which will have to be paid. It was therefore recommended that all charitable and other causes be remembered proportionately. A very lively debate ensued following the suggestion that some extra compensation be paid to the officers of the central committee who attended the convention. One of these officers pointed out that, due to the fact that the central committee had no office space of its own, she was obliged to use her own residence, telephone, etc., for the business transactions of the Jednota. This was objected <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>to on the grounds that all officers [of the central committee] already receive salaries as stipulated by the convention, and that they should be satisfied with the salaries allowed them. This point was further debated, but since the time was limited, the session [was adjourned] and the delegates repaired to the dining hall for a joint luncheon. All unfinished business was to be taken up in the fourteenth and final session of the convention.</p>
   <p>The final (fourteenth) session was opened by the convention president at 1 P.M. The giving of the password was waived, and there was no roll call since all of the delegates and officers of the Jednota were in their places. The convention decided that the retiring officers of the central committee shall not receive any extra compensation for their services. The festivities committee was granted the sum of $200 to cover all necessary expenses. Should this sum prove insufficient, the Illinois Grand Lodge is to pay the balance. The Cechu Domov at Cleveland, Ohio, and the Utulna of Chicago, Illinois, were granted $50 each. For the Bohemian Free Thought schools of Cleveland, of which there are five, $100 was set aside as a contribution. The Bohemian Free Thought schools of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>St. Louis, Missouri, were given $25, and the same amounts were approved to be paid to the schools of South Omaha, Nebraska, Baltimore, Maryland, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The schools of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Racine, Wisconsin, East Saint Louis, Illinois, the T. G. Masaryk School of Cicero, Illinois, and the F. B. Zdrubek School of Irving Park, Chicago, are to receive $20 each. The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani (Council for Higher Education) at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Brnenska Utulna ([Bohemian] Old People's Home at Brno [Czechoslovakia]), were allowed $10 each. The Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago was given $50, and the Free Thought schools of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were granted $25. The sum of $25 was approved as a contribution toward the building fund of a Bohemian hall to be erected on the Northwest Side [of Chicago]. The music fund of the Utulna was allowed the sum of $10. To commemorate the deaths of sisters A. Vodak and B. Velan, the sum of $10 was further contributed to the Utulna. Sister Anna Vagner of the Vesna Lodge No. 11 of the Jednota was not allowed any contribution for her support. Such support shall be paid to her out of a special fund provided for that purpose by the Jednota. The sum of $30 was approved as a gift for three very aged founders of <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>lodges, each of these three sisters is to receive $10, thus honoring the work which they have accomplished.</p>
   <p>The convention urged to all individual lodges to support the Free Thought movement as much as possible. The president of the convention requested the delegates to have their lodges work in the interest of the suffering Russians. The sum of $15 was set aside as a contribution to be sent to the special committee in Czechoslovakia which is active in providing funds for the suffering Russians. All in all, the sum of $810 was approved by the convention for charitable purposes and for gifts; $340 was paid to the officers of the convention, and the central committee was allowed $100 for incidental expenses connected with the return trip. After paying the [above-mentioned] items and all other expenses, the balance of $693.66 was handed over to the newly elected central committee by the [treasurer] of the retiring committee.</p>
   <p>The convention decided, for the good of the Jednota, that any member who resides in a distant locality (on a farm) and writes to the central committee for the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>issuance of a password, may receive such by mail but only from her own lodge president and not from the officers of the central committee. The president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek, recommended the adoption of certain....songs, such as are in use at Cleveland. [Translator's note: These songs deal with the work of the Jednota, of course.] The Cleveland delegates sang three of these songs as examples of their lodge work, and were applauded for their efforts. The assembled delegates were again admonished to adopt this usage.</p>
   <p>Finally, the installation of the newly elected officers of the central committee took place. These officers are: Marie Liska, president; Anna Brychta, vicepresident; Anna Stolf, secretary; Antonie Mazac, treasurer; Alzbeta Lisy, financial secretary; Antonie Denemark, sergeant at arms; Anna Velik, custodian; Marie Pits and Antonie Hofreiter, members of the economics committee; Katerina Gruenwald, Emilie Uxa, and Anna Tomasek, members of the auditing committee. The installation was performed by the president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek, who inducted the above-named sisters into their offices accompanying each such induction with a <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>few sincere and well-chosen remarks. Sister Marie Liska, speaking on behalf of the installed officers, delivered a fitting address in which she thanked the retiring central committee, particularly Sister Marie Hajek, and asked for continued co-operation. The retiring president promised that, together with the rest, she would work for the Jednota with all of her energies. The new president then received several beautiful bouquets from her [own] lodge and from some of the delegates. Other such gifts were presented to the new secretary, treasurer, and sergeant at arms. Sister Pits, too, was remembered by a gift of flowers. The newly elected president then delivered a gift of honor to the retiring president, Sister Marie Hajek, and Sister Marie Simak. The latter she kissed as her own dear mother. The members of the festivities committee and two of its aides were likewise remembered by gifts. That committee was addressed by the new president of the central committee, Sister Marie Liska, who also delivered the gifts. Sister Marie Smrcek, who spoke on behalf of the festivities committee, gave an address of thanks, whereupon after a brief epilogue by the retiring president, the sixth convention of the Jednota was declared ended.</p>
