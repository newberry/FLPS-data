   <p>The Sokol Plzen hall was literally overcrowded with a select group who came to hear Dr. L. J. Fisher's talk about the recent Sokol Slet (mass convention) in Prague. Among the guests were many who attended this Slet and many of those who participated in the previous Slet held in Prague.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fisher is not only a prominent Sokol, but also speaker of ability.....</p>
   <p>Before the lecture began, a number of selections from A. Dvorak were played by the quartet from Svatopluk Cech Park.....</p>
