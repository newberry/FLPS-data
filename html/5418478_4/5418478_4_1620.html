   <p>The second day of the convention distinguishes itself with transactions as serious as were those of the first day. All delegates were present .....Before the session opens let us look around and note the setting in which the convention meets. The convention hall gives an impression of fellowship because of its pleasant decorations consisting of both the Czechoslovak and American flags and bunting. In the middle of the stage thus embellished one may see the picture of the first president of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, the beloved Professor T.G. Masaryk, which is a proof that the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union), in convention here, did not forget its old homeland and its aged first executive.....</p>
   <p>The morning [third] session began shortly after 9 A. M., having been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>called to order by Mrs. Ruzena Fivek, the first vice-president, due to the absence of the president. The roll call followed....The president arrived while the roll was being called and took his place on the rostrum. The minutes of the previous session were approved. The reading of correspondence followed.....The letters were mainly congratulatory messages from the following organizations: The Vojta Naprstek Lodge No. 26 of the Jednota; the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies); the Pravoslav Trojan Lodge No. 15 of the Jednota; the lodge No. 11, Radbuza Lodge No. 11 of the Jednota; the board of directors of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) which also invited all the delegates to visit the two institutions. All of these letters were acknowledged and the president asked the press representatives to make this fact known.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the reading of resolutions, which were worked out by the resolutions committee, followed. The first one of them was directed against <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the proposed new constitution of the state of Illinois. It was approved unanimously. Its text follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In the state of Illinois there will be a special election held on December 12, 1922, which is to decide whether the proposed new constitution, as recommended by the state constitutional convention, is to be approved by the people, thus becoming the basic law of the state of Illinois; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, That same new proposed constitution, if accepted, would threaten our democracy and strengthen the sectarian element; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The introduction of the Bible into the public schools would cause dissension among our citizens since religion is a private and personal matter; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota is one of those organizations which love peace and liberty; be it therefore <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>"Resolved, That we appeal to all the members of our Jednota, and to all the Bohemian people to work against the enactment of the new constitution of the state of Illinois, and to vote against it--irrespective of what religious opinions they may hold--on Tuesday, December 12, 1922."</p>
   <p>Another resolution, which was recommended by the same committee and approved by the convention, was the following:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, On the one hand constant appeals are being made to the immigrant population to become Americanized and to apply for American citizenship, and on the other hand constant attempts are being made to prevent and make impossible the obtaining of American citizenship by these immigrants, to introduce police control of immigrants, to introduce registration of these immigrants, and to tax them because they are immigrants; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, These procedures, as well as the introduction of unduly <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>stringent immigration laws and their enforcement, are not dignified and are unworthy of the best traditions of this country, which at one time was a haven for political refugees such as was Vojta Naprstek, or men desiring freedom of conscience such as was Ladimir Klacel; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota, meeting in its seventh convention, endorses the easing of the stringency with which candidates for citizenship are faced; it also discredits all such class legislation which is directed against immigrants; in short, it stands for a more liberal interpretation of the immigration laws."</p>
   <p>Still another resolution, presented by the committee, but rejected by the convention was the following:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Since the World War ended more than four years ago, and all countries of the world having freed those individuals whose only guilt <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>was that they held opinions about the question of the War which differed from the opinion held by the majority; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The prisons of this country still hold prisoners who were not otherwise guilty but by a difference of opinion on the same question; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Jednota, in its seventh convention assembled, recommend the freeing of all such political prisoners from the prisons of America. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That an appeal be sent to the President of the United States, regarding the freeing of these political prisoners. It would certainly be in the spirit of [Abraham] Lincoln to free those men who are still imprisoned because of differences of political opinions."</p>
   <p>The committee on constitution and bylaws recommended the following changes <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>which were also approved by the convention:</p>
   <p>Chapter VII: The third paragraph of this chapter was struck out and in its stead the ruling was made which gives the Grand Lodge the right to appoint, from among its own members, an editor who would be in charge of the organ of the Jednota. Paragraph 7 of the same chapter (page 9) was changed to, "a resigning officer shall give a thirty-day notice to the proper officers who would thus have an opportunity to appoint his successor". On page 12, in the section dealing with the duties of the treasurer, the following words were struck out: "moneys to each fund separately," and "no more than one fund may be deposited in one bank". A recommendation which would do away with the office of chief medical officer was responsible for a prolonged debate, but it ultimately won its point and that office shall be abolished.</p>
   <p>In chapter IX, dealing with the board of directors, the following change was made: The editor shall be dropped as a member of that board, and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>instead of 17 there shall be 16 members. In regard to the payment on policies, it was ruled that if the beneficiaries or relatives of a deceased member do not apply for the payment of such policy within one year after the death of said member, they will forfeit any further rights to the policy and its value shall become the property of the Jednota. Mention was also made of the insurance policies of suicides, and it was ruled that the policy shall be paid provided the member committing suicide was a member of the Jednota for at least ten years. Otherwise his beneficiaries shall be entitled to only a certain percentage of the face value of the policy.</p>
   <p>In Section 5 of chapter X, dealing with the setting up of new lodges, the initial deposit was changed from $25 to $10. Section 7 was simplified and Section 8 struck out. Article 5 (on page 21), dealing with the age, etc. of candidates for membership, was so changed as to be more advantageous to new candidates. After a brief debate it was decided that only one kind of death tax shall be paid by members and that tax may be <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>increased if necessary. Article 19 (page 23), dealing with the death fund, was changed in the sense that should the fund increase from $15,000 to $25,000 the surplus shall be transferred to the reserve fund.</p>
   <p>After a long and lively debate, it was decided that the provision about the payment of policies be fully approved. Hitherto the full face value of a policy was payable to beneficiaries, etc., only when the deceased was a member for five years, which fact made difficult any propaganda directed at securing new members. The new provision changed all that. But since such an important matter required very careful voting, the balloting was done by roll call. There were 16 against and 42 for the new provision; it was, consequently, passed. The session then adjourned.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was called to order by the vice-president, Mrs. Ruzena Fivek; there was roll call followed by the reading of the minutes of the morning session by Mr. Frank Lukes, the secretary. After a minor <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>change, the minutes were approved.....In the meantime Dr. K. Neumann, the president, arrived and took over the chair....A letter from the office of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was read and its message of congratulation noted.</p>
   <p>The delegate Vaclav Vokac moved that the question of the organ of the Jednota be considered and thoroughly discussed. He was of the opinion that the publishing of the organ would be a useless waste of money, and that all matters concerning the Jednota could as well be published in one of the Free Thought periodicals already appearing, and such co-operation would be found very advantageous by the Jednota. The publishing of an organ has its shortcomings, such as lack of educational reading matter, and by selecting a regular periodical, part of which could be devoted to the business of the Jednota, that problem could be solved. Of the delegates who were present several took part in the debate which followed Mr. Vokac's recommendations, the most interesting views having been <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>advanced by Mr. August Kopta, the second vice-president. He stated that he knew "where the wind was blowing from," and that the recommendation made by the previous speaker was intended to aid either the newspaper Spravedlnost (Justice), or the periodical Vek Rozumu, (Age of Reason), probably the latter. Mr. Kopta stated that he was not for the abolition of the organ of the Jednota and was supported in that position by numerous other delegates.</p>
   <p>An organ may be good in every respect; what is necessary to make it so, is the securing of a good editor. Besides that, the publishing of an organ is a necessity. Should some other newspaper or periodical be used, and later becoming bankrupt cease to appear, as frequently happened in other cases, the Jednota would be left high and dry and without opportunity to make reports to its members by such means. The proposal was finally defeated. A letter which just arrived from the Velkoloze Jednoty Taboritu (Grand Lodge of the Taborites) congratulating the convention was read, its contents noted, and the president again expressed <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>the thanks of the whole convention for this message.</p>
   <p>Further reports of the committee on constitution and bylaws came up for discussion. One report recommended that the chapter dealing with the committee on orphans (page 27) also make provision for caring for the aged and unfortunate members of the Jednota. This addendum was worded as follows:</p>
   <p>"Each member shall pay a one-cent tax monthly for the benefit of such members as are destitute or suffering from misfortune. This fund shall be controlled by the Grand Lodge. All lodges making collections for this fund shall send the money thus collected to the Grand Lodge. This fund shall be a separate one; that is, all its receipts and disbursements are to have a separate entry.</p>
   <p>"Any member who has belonged to the Jednota for five years and has been bedridden for a considerable length of time, or who has been crippled, <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>or who, because of advanced age, is unable to work, and to whom his own lodge has discharged all its duties as stipulated by the constitution and bylaws, shall be entitled to ask for this aid. The request for such aid shall be made on blanks furnished by the Grand Lodge, and the application shall be presented to the applicants own lodge which, after investigation of the case by a committee consisting of three members, shall forward the application, with the report of that committee, to the Grand Lodge for approval and disposal. The application must be accompanied by a sworn statement showing that the applicant is sunable to work, that he is destitute and dependent upon this financial support; it must further be accompanied by a sworn statement made by the applicant's beneficiaries proving that they are unable, because of their own circumstances, to care for the applicant were he refused this aid. The application must further be accompanied by a doctor's certificate proving that the applicant is unable to work. The aid may not exceed the sum of $25 in any one year, and may not be granted more than three (3) times to the same member."</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>This new provision which is truly humane and therefore necessary evoked a very interesting debate in which a great many delegates took part. It finally was put to vote and passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>
