   <p>When a special train of the New York Central Railroad came to a stop at the la Salle Street Station at half-past two this morning, joyful shouts resounded from two sides. Those who were in the train shouted with joy, and the many people who were waiting in the vestibule responded. They were, for the most part, our fellow countrymen. Aboard the train were the participants in the American Sokol Expedition who were returning home from the Vsesokolsky Slet (Mass Sokol Festival) held in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Regardless of the late hour, many friends and relatives who could not wait any longer to clasp the travelers into their arms and at the same time hear all the news and greetings from our native land, came to the station. The welcome which was given to those who were returning was impressive and touching.</p>
   <p>The train should have arrived at 9:30 last evening, but just about that time <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>beautiful scenery of our native land; that they were able to witness how the free Czechoslovak nation is striving to preserve its liberty. But, they are all glad to be home again in Chicago. Perhaps every one of them reached the conclusion that our Chicago is the dearest place, and that it is our real home.</p>
   <p>About six hundred and fifty participants of the Sokol expedition arrived in New York aboard the steamship "Mauretania" on Saturday morning. Most of them were Chicagoans who decided not to stay in New York, but to continue on their way home as soon as a special train could be secured. They succeeded and were able to leave New York aboard a special train of the New York Central Railroad late Saturday night.</p>
   <p>Of the three hundred participants who left New York, about one hundred remained in Cleveland, Ohio. Some of them left the special train destined for Chicago, and about one hundred and sixty arrived here. Everyone praised the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>return trip.</p>
   <p>We interviewed one of the participants in the expedition, Mr. J. Cerny, a member of the technical staff of Sokol Slavsky, who gave us the following details: The expedition left Prague, Czechoslovakia, just two weeks ago yesterday. It consisted of about six hundred persons. Because it was impossible to secure a regular train for such a large number of people, the Czechoslovak government furnished a special train which was very satisfactory. The special train arrived in Cherbourg, France, on Saturday, when the expedition boarded the steamship "Mauretania" which started on its journey at once.</p>
   <p>All the participants of the expedition agreed that conditions in Czechoslovakia are improving.</p>
   <p>In spite of such an early morning hour, about three hundred persons came to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the La Salle Street Station to welcome the returning expedition. They all either cried or shouted with joy.</p>
