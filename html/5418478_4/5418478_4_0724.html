   <p>We have mentioned several times that the National Cemetary Association has shown itself to be especially generous this year toward the Bohemian liberal schools of Chicago. It donated to them a thousand dollars which amount was divided by the Association according to the number of pupils attending and the importance of the various schools.</p>
   <p>All Chicago Bohemians were pleased by this generosity towards the schools, whose purpose it is to bring up an enlightened youth, to protect our children and to successfully raise future members for our societies and thereby assure our future. We are convinced that the National Cemetary Association will support important national institutions in the future, in fact that it will be even more generous. In that manner it will refute the charge made against it in some circles, that it only looks after the dead and neglects the living. The prosperity of the National Cemetary is now assured and representatives in the Association will endeavor to do as much good as possible with the money flowing into their hands.</p>
   <p>We have been requested to publish the following:</p>
   <p>The Bohemian National Cemetary Association has divided the New Year's gift to the Bohemian liberal schools of Chicago, an amount of $1000.00 as follows:</p>
