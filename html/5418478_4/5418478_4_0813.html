   <p>Yesterday may well be called a national holiday by us, for it saw the most impressive action in our movement to liberate Czechoslovak lands. It was a milestone in the history of our people.</p>
   <p>Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, our revolutionary leader, who has been conducting the affairs of our people for fully four years, and who has been directing our fight against Austrian tyranny, made another appearance to give outlines of the progress achieved in the revolutionary movement.</p>

   <p>....several thousand of our people succeeded in securing a place at Carter Harrison High School, where Masaryk lectured, many, however, had to deny themselves the privilege of being present, for they could not be admitted to the overcrowded, though spacious, hall.</p>
   <p>The program was begun at 8:30 P. M., when Masaryk, accompanied by Czech leaders, entered. The United Czech Singing Societies, under the leadership of Mr. Houdek, sang "The Star-Spangled Banner," and followed up with the Czech national anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where my homeland is). At its conclusion a spontaneous ovation was given to Professor Mawaryk. The enthusiasm of the multitude, in this manifestation of loyalty and love for our leader, defies description.....</p>

   <p>....Several thousand of our people succeeded in securing a place at Carter Harrison High School, where Masaryk lectured, many, however, had to deny themselves the privilege of being present,for they could not be admitted to the overcrowded, though spacious, hall.</p>

   <p>Mr. Krbec, chairman of the executive committee of the Czech National Alliance, introduced Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance. Dr. Fisher expressed his extreme pleasure for the privilege of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>being in a position to speak again and to extend the most heartfelt greetings to our beloved leader, after a period of three years during which the Czech National Alliance had to struggle hard to gain recognition of its meritorious patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>"We Czechoslovaks, like others, were caught unprepared by the war, and we had, in the beginning, to limit our efforts to merely gathering as much money as possible," the speaker said. " We soon discovered that this was not enough. We discerned that we could not rely solely on the resistance offered by our people in the old homeland.</p>
   <p>"We felt the need of an organization which could bring the demands of our oppressed people before the forum of the world. Our purpose was severely criticized. Enemies arose in our midst, and with them lack of understanding. Finally however, sound political judgment won out. We stand today, united <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in the consciousness of moral obligations due to our motherland. We stand here as one single body--Czechoslovaks determined to make any sacrifice under the leadership of Professor Masaryk to win independence.</p>
   <p>"The significance and weight of our organization was promulgated in President Wilson's manifesto itself. What would we be without it? It is necessary to consider the political value of our organization, and how its activities influence the American public. The Czech National Alliance placed us at the disposal of America whenever we were called on. This fact has elevated us in the eyes of America, which is battling for liberty just as we are..... Masaryk, whose council guided us, pointed to the straight line our people were to follow. He did it when, under the very shadow of the gallows, he called out the inspiring words: 'It's a fight for life or death, indeed. No peace is ever possible between the Czech nation and the Austrian idea.' Professor Masaryk tells us that it was a plain man, a simple soldier prisoner, who first used these words....."</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Mr. A. Schustek took the floor for the Slovak League. He stated that the Slovaks found themselves beset with difficulties, just like the Czechs, when they began to organize.....He declared himself to be convinced that there is not one Slovak in America who would not be in sympathy with the Slovaks in the old country. He also called attention to the alleged offer by the Austrian Government to create a greater Moravia. This idea was designed to entice the Slovaks away from the Czechs, and thus drive a wedge between their associations. "The Slovaks stand closely united with the Czechs today," he declared.....</p>
   <p>The Reverend Innocent Kestl, speaking in the name of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, urged our people to unite and to practice self-control. He referred to the American War of Independence, during which the people voluntarily submitted to discipline, and followed George Washington as their leader. Similarly, our people should stand behind President Wilson.....</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Congressman Adolph Sabath expressed extreme gratification at the fulfillment of his long cherished desire to meet Professor Masaryk, who will be much better able than he--Congressman Sabath--to tell the American public what is expected of it and what it has to do in the interest of the small oppressed nations....The congressman spoke in the English language. The singers then rendered Smetana's lovely chorus, "Rolnicka" (Peasants' Song).</p>
   <p>The high point of the evening came with the introduction of Professor Masaryk. He began by developing a historical picture, pointing out events which prompted the Czechs to offer opposition which finally crystallized into a systematic fight for independence.</p>
   <p>"You might have found fault in my not coming to this largest Czech and Slovak settlement four years ago instead of how," our leader explained. "My task here, however, is to work among Americans,and there are, besides, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>many other things to do."....He also spoke about his experiences in Europe at the outbreak of the war and conditions in Bohemia....."We do not know how many of our people were executed there; we shall learn about that probably after the war. For the present, let us rise to honor our dead." It was a solemn moment when everybody stood up and remembered those who have, under the most unfavorable conditions, sacrificed their lives for the Slavonic races.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk continued: "In observing all this, I decided that I, too, had to act. I felt pangs of conscience because I had not begun to work sooner, and my meditations prompted me to go to foreign lands." ....[Translator's note: Masaryk's wandering in Europe is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>...."The first recognition came to us, as always, from France. Briand was <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>prime minister there, and he promised to aid the Czech cause. When President Wilson asked the Allies to define their program, included in their answer was a statement relative to the independence of the Czechoslovak nation. The Allies have solemnly promised it to us. We have a right to demand that that they keep their promise; and they will keep it."</p>
   <p>Our aged leader then emphasized our rights by referring to Lincoln's conception of a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people," and also to President Wilson's declaration "that no people should be subject to a government not their own". This includes the Czech people also.</p>
   <p>Masaryk explained the meaning of "Americanization". It is equivalent to social equality of all the peoples, which will mean the end of monarchy. Masaryk expressed his firm conviction that unless the Czech lands are <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>liberated, there will be no liberty for America either. This is not a mere boast, it is the result of thinking. Bismarck himself said that the ruler of Bohemia will also rule all of Europe. The question of who should rule Bohemia will be solved, however, by removing the Hapsburg rulers. The speaker looks upon Austria as keeping nine nations under one dynasty, which exploits its people with the aid of aristocracy and the army. America has the choice between free small nations and a dynasty of Central Europe. America is understanding noticeably better what sort of a dynasty this is: a dynasty to which nothing is sacred, not even religion, which it abuses. Being acquainted with conditions, Masaryk declares that death for the Czechs means also death for others by a force which will not stop at England or America. There is no way out of this dilemma but to win the war. Masaryk understands that some people may be alarmed by the successes won by the Germans up to the present; he himself, however, does not share these apprehensions. Even if Austria should survive, the lot of the Czechs ought to become better, for Austria knows now what resistance means. By <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>their resistance the Czechs have gained in prestige; they are thought of more highly than before. This is revealed in the promises Emperor Carl is making to us.....[Translator's note: Views and opinions on European conditions and events omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Our distinguished guest closed: "I wish to express my sincere gratitude to all of you. I shall do my best. May we attain the goal for which our best boys are sacrificing their lives: the Czechoslovak Republic!"</p>
   <p>After the storm of applause at the close of our leader's lecture had subsided, and the chorus had sung another piece, "The Hymn of the Czech Farmer," the audience was invited by Mr. Krbec to ask questions.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Kutak requested that an outright declaration be made to the effect that monies collected in America are used exclusively for purposes of the <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>liberation movement. This request was made on account of the dissension on this question prevailing in the State of Texas.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk: "It is right to insist upon having our financial affairs in good order. I lay stress upon strict control, and not one cent is expended without my knowledge. I can assure you that all the monies collected for political purposes are directed toward that end only. I learned about the respective controversies--not from my friends. You cannot imagine how many communications, how many complaints, I receive. I know of the distrust in monetary matters existing in America. I have been reiterating that no account can be kept of money for revolutionary purposes. This might be attempted by children, but not by a nation.</p>
   <p>"The Austrian Government thinks that we are flooded with millions, and therefore it expends millions to down us. Believe me that I am well <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>informed. The Austrian Government knows that we, too, know how to economize, no matter how many millions we have. We cannot tell our enemies how we spend our funds; we are no such simpletons. I have been notified by America that I do not have to keep account of the money that comes from here. It's for you to believe or not. I assure you that nothing is happening without my knowledge, and that not one cent is being spent for any other purpose."</p>
   <p>Another question called for a statement about whether the attitude assumed by us is correct, in this event the action for liberation should fail.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk answers: "Truly, he who does not try will not win. The Czech nation will not be in any worse a position than the one in which it was before. This is a question of life for our people. I had, true enough, spent many a sleepless night, pondering about this question, particularly in view of the recent events in Russia. Those were terrible moments of <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>uncertainty. I am convinced, however, that the attitude taken by us is correct even in case of failure.</p>
   <p>"Now, when hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, how trifling does a quarrel about a few cents look! The question of what these lives mean is also a question of honor for the nation, and I say with a calm conscience that things happen as they have to happen. Daszinsky [Polish parliamentarian] told of 30,000 to 60,000 Slavs executed by the Austrian Government; but wait till you hear what our soldiers have to say about what happened in Galicia. Then you will know why we had to break loose from Austria. A man of reason must understand why we could not postpone this fight. The Austrian Government is not going to present us with liberty on a tray: we have to win it ourselves."</p>
   <p>The third question came from a Slovak. He desired to be enlightened on the program of the future Czechoslovak Republic, on the position of the <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>Slovaks in it, and whether they will have to become Czechs.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk answers: "Picture yourself as Slovensko (the Slovak part of the Czechoslovak Republic), with the Slovak tongue as the official language in schools and political institutions. The language has never been an issue between us, and never will be. There is no such thing as Pocestovani (forcing Czech language and customs upon another). We have ours, you have yours; and every one works toward the same goal."</p>
   <p>Those were acute, burning questions. They were thus answered and solved. They had been used by many as a cloak for their hesitation. It is hoped that now they are cleared up, efforts will be made toward more intensive, concerted action.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Vojta Benes, organizer of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>
   <p>He delivered an uplifting address which abounded with metaphors. He reminded the audience of the solemn promise of loyalty given by those assembled in the Czech National Theater in Prague, Bohemia. This promise was repeated by the multitude. This,and the singing of "Hej Slovane" (Ho ye Slavs), closed the memorable meeting. Every one felt fortified by the confidence created by Professor Masaryk, and the hope that our efforts will be rewarded with success, the crowning glory of which will be the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic.</p>
   <p>Masaryk Guest of Czech National Alliance</p>
   <p>The unpretentious but important office of the Czech National Alliance was the scene of a heartfelt welcome given to our leader Professor Masaryk, yesterday, by our Czech leaders. Masaryk came to make personal acquaintance with the representatives of this body. The latter, in turn, were eager to <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>hear Masaryk say some words in recognition of the work they have been doing for over three years.</p>
   <p>Masaryk arrived at the office at about 6 P. M., accompanied by Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, Vojta Benes, organizer, and K. Pergler. Members of the executive committee of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and of the Slovak League were waiting there.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes welcomed Professor Masaryk, and stated that Miss Masaryk, a daughter, who has also come here, will no doubt be of great aid to him in his activities. Mr. Benes expressed his satisfaction over the fact that we are making common cause against a common enemy and that perfect harmony reigns in our ranks. The Reverend Kestl in the name of Czech Catholics promised full co-operation. Professor Masaryk responded by offering a clipping from the Cech, organ of the Archbishop of Prague. In the article, which was obligingly read by <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>Mr. Benes, the Archbishop fully agrees with the steps taken by our Czech representatives in the Austrian Parliament. The Cech is an ultra-conservative paper.....Mr. Schustek of the Slovak League also spoke.</p>
