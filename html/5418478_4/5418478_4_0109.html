   <p>The readers of this paper know that the Board of Directors of our Public Library, allotted five hundred dollars for the purchase of Bohemian books a few years ago. This was done to comply with a petition of the "Ctenarske Besedy" (Reading Club). The money thus set aside was never used, although the Reading Club furnished the library with a list of books suitable for the purpose.</p>
   <p>However, since Mayor Harrison, a short time ago, appointed our countryman, L.W. Kadlec, to the Board, the matter was revived, and the well-known bookseller, August Geringer, was chosen to purchase the books from book dealers in Bohemia.</p>
   <p>There have been purchased for the Library a total of 700 volumes, all of which were included in the list as selected by the Readers Club. So that all our readers may know what books are available, we shall publish the titles of the books in the near future.</p>
