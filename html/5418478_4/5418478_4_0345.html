   <p>The magnificent motion picture "Janosik" is again being presented tonight in the Sokol Chicago hall on Kedzie Avenue [between 23rd and 24th Streets]. The final showings of this soul-stirring drama will be at seven and nine P. M., and it is expected that the performances will be attended by large crowds [of our people]. "Janosik" was successful wherever it was shown; it drew attention to itself not only by its technical perfection and its beauty, but by the many scenic details of the natural beauties of Slovakia. There will also be a showing of a funeral of thirty-two Czechoslovak legionnaires who were executed by the Austrian army authorities on the Italian front. The admission fee is 55 cents for grown-ups and 25 cents for children.</p>
