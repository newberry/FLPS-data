   <p>A large and select company met in the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola Vojta Naprstek (Bohemian Free-Thought School Vojta Naprstek) on Homan Avenue near 26th Street last night. The occasion was the closing ceremonies of the exhibition of the work of the school pupils. The exhibition was open for a week and its proceeds will be used for the school building. Apparently the exhibition was successful and was concluded by a banquet during which there were speeches and a musical program.</p>
