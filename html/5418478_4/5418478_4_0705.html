   <p>P.5 Col.7--Mr. Soukup is holding classes for adults who are interested in learning to speak and write the English language. One may join any of these classes, held on different days and hours or receive private lessons at a more convenient time. The tuition is very low, therefore anyone who is able to attend is urged to do so. Mr. Soukup will help anyone of foreign birth, to easily master the English language in a short time. He knows that it is difficult for anyone in America, unless they are able to speak and write English.</p>
   <p>His school is located at 1646 W. 18th St., in the center of the Bohemian settlement in Chicago.</p>
