   <p>A council of the delegates of the United Czech Societies of Irving Park was held yesterday. A motion was introduced in this meeting that the new Czech liberal school should be named for the deceased journalist and speaker of the Svobodna Obec (Bohemian Freethinkers Congregation), Frantisek B. Zdrubek, and carry the following inscription: "Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola F. B. Zdrubek" (Bohemian Freethought School F. B. Zdrubek). This motion to honor the memory of the deceased F. B. Zdrubek was accepted with great enthusiasm, and it was resolved to provide a tablet with his name upon it.</p>
   <p>Further, the report of the building committee on the progress of construction of the new school building was noted.</p>
   <p>The building committee has in mind the staging of a big bazaar to celebrate the opening of the new school upon completion. Preparations for the bazaar are already in progress. Those present in yesterday's meeting were: Messrs. Matas, Lisy, Brezina, Kavalle, Laznovsky, Ringl and Lebeda; Mmes. Sulc and Ine.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we must add that the new Zdrubek School will be attended by all of the wards of the Czech Orphanage.</p>
