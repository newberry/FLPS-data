   <p>As our readers know, arrangements have been made for the third gymnastic contest in our city. To make the celebration more brilliant and splendid, the committee decided to ask all Bohemian societies to be present at these festivities in such numbers that they will attract the attention of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>We think the Sokols were right in doing this and not paying attention to the division of Bohemians in Chicago. They invited all Bohemian clubs and societies to participate, which refutes the contention of one of the local English language newspapers announced not long ago that the Bohemians have no organized social life here. The Bohemian Sokols intended to prove by their public appearance that this conception of the English reporters is entirely wrong. The Bohemian Sokols have decided that at such festivities we should appear as united Bohemians, like sons of one mother, no matter what are our viewpoints on other vital problems.</p>
   <p>In all important national undertakings, and especially at festivities, the Bohemians should act in harmony. At all such gatherings we must demonstrate patriotism. In this way we will create a good name among other nationalities. On these occasions to classify ourselves as good Catholics or Liberals would be an absurdity. Having these ideas in their minds, the Bohemian Sokols have invited the Bohemians belonging to the Catholic church to their festivity thus emphasizing that the Sokols are not sectarian in matters of religion.</p>
   <p>Every good and honest undertaking and this one too, will always find a destructive individual, whose desire is to keep the local Bohemian community divided into two hostile groups and who endeavors to fire again the hatred of one Bohemian for another; to such persons everyone is an enemy that does not follow their direct ideas. In the last copy of the Catholic newspaper Hlas, (The Voice), there is an article, obviously written by a city reporter, who is not a Catholic nor a member of any of our Bohemian clubs. This correspondent is angry about this proposed harmonious representation and states that the mutual common appearance sounds very nice, but the idea itself is wrong. He said: "There is another question that should be answered - who is guilty of this division among the Bohemians in Chicago? Who originated the cause of this disagreement?"</p>
   <p>We can positively assert in the name of all Bohemian-American Sokols, that where some disagreement arose among the Liberals and Catholics, the Sokols were never the cause of it. The main problem of the Sokol communities is always the idea of the development and strengthening of the body through exercise, and the Sokols are carrying on with their problems as much as circumstances will permit.</p>
   <p>We are absolutely sure that almost every Sokol Unity has members who are inclined more or less to the Catholic faith, but none of those members can complain that he was ever offended by a Sokol. Every lawful citizen is welcomed by the Sokols, whether he be a Catholic, Protestant, or an unbeliever; as long as he conducts himself properly he will be treated with honor and respect. Mr. reporter allowed himself in his ignorance to suggest and express an idea, that the Sokols are acting this way only on account of the approaching election. This kind of suspicion can be attributed only to a man who has no serious argument and must use a lie; we are acquainted with a correspondent of a different newspaper, who uses the same kind of arguments, and we are quite sure that they are one and the same individual, who hides behind a false name. The correspondent of the Hlas states in his article that he is against the quarrels and divisions of his own people, but that he could not be in accord with the idea of the Catholics being willing to unite with Bohemian Sokols during the proposed festivities. Taking into consideration his remark that he is against the division in national life, the editor of the newspaper advises in the next paragraph that Bohemians put an end to these disagreements. We have a right to expect that our Catholic countrymen will not listen to the oppositionists who are tying to obstruct the tendency of unification of all the Bohemians here in America; we are hoping that they will attend our festivities of the Bohemian-American Sokols in impressive numbers.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to mention that two Bohemian-American newspapers have accepted and printed in their columns few deriding and abusive articles about the festivities of the Bohemian Sokols; they are - the ultra-liberal and national Dennice Novoveku and the Catholic newspaper Hlas.</p>
