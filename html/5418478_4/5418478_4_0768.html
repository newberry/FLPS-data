   <p>The theatrical performance and entertainment given Saturday night by the pupils of the Northwest side Sunday School in the hall of Mr. J. Bartusky, was a most successful affair. The citizens and friends of our Bohemians School Youth attended in large numbers and the efforts of the pupils surprised everyone.</p>
   <p>The acting of each individual was excellent, the speech was in Bohemian, which of course we would be pleased to hear in some of the larger theatres. The various acts were received with deserving applause.</p>
   <p>At the close of the performance dancing was in order, and the audience made merry the rest of the night.</p>
