   <p>The Chicago District of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) inaugurated its series of educational meetings last Sunday, May 28, 1922, in the parish house of the Svata Ludmila (Saint Ludmilla) Parish. This meeting was the first of a series of similar ones which are to follow. The topics of these meetings will be varied so as to be attractive and refreshing to our people. At the splendid meeting held on Sunday, the speakers were Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, chaplain of the National Alliance; Reverend Martin Krizka, chaplain of the Blahoslavena Anezka Ceska (Blessed Agnes of Bohemia) Parish; and the central office manager, Anton V. Tesar.</p>
   <p>Reverend Martin Krizka spoke about human charity, and dwelt on the many motives which induce people to engage in charitable work. Sone do it to gain glory, a good name, and reputation, others because they have nothing else to do, etc. There was much truth in his words. He ended by discussing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the work done by the National Alliance among our people; where all of the motives for such work are characterized by love and self-sacrifice, and urged those present to identify themselves with it always.</p>
   <p>Reverend Jedlicka spoke about our young people, and stressed the importance of the activities of the Chicago District. "The work performed in that District for the benefit of our youth is very important," said he, showing the many ways our young people are tempted by the world after leaving school: how they become estranged from our faith and nationality, and how our parishes lose them. It is necessary to extend our efforts to hold these young people, and this shall be on our program during the year.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tesar then mentioned the great miseries and sufferings of the Bohemian nation during the last three hundred years, years during which our people lost their independence, were impoverished and deprived of the right to use their own mother tongue. Sunk in its deepest degradation, it was believed that the nation would never rise again. Then came the awakening. Mr. Tesar <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>portrayed the work of the leaders of that awakening, the work of men who redeemed a nation that was sorely neglected....finally the speaker arrived at the period of our history when our people formed the Czechoslovak Republic; he mentioned Prague, the castles of Bohemia and other historical sites in both Bohemia and Moravia. The lecture was illustrated by stereopticon slides.... All those who attended this first meeting clamored for others to follow....</p>
