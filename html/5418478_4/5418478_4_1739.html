   <p>It is expected that besides the members of the Union there will be a great many friends in attendance, to say nothing of the general public which appreciates the meritorious work of the Union. The entertainment will assuredly be of the first class.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge deserves to be recognized by the public, and this occasion will make such recognition possible. Nobody will regret having attended this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>picnic. The entertainment will start at 10 A.M., and from that time until late you may expect to have real brotherly fun and entertainment. Admission is only twenty-five cents per person.</p>
