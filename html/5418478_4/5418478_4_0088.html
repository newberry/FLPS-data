   <p>P.1, Col.6--The manager of the public library, Mr. H. E. Legler, informed us yesterday, that at the meeting of the Library-Board, held in the past week, it was decided to purchase a large quantity of new Bohemian books which were recommended to the Board. The Bohemian members of the Board, Mr. J. Toman, some time ago requested several individuals to furnish him with a list of recommended Bohemian books which could be purchased for the public library. This new list, together with the corrected old list, he turned over to the Librarian, Mr. Legler, who wishing to be fair to everybody, recommended at the meeting of the board, the purchase of the listed Bohemian books and to enrich the Bohemian branch with them. The Board accepted the recommendation with the exception of the Otto Encyclopedia which was eliminated from the list temporarily. Nevertheless the library will be enriched with the newest Bohemian works and these in turn will increase the attendance at the Bohemian branch of the Public Library. We regret to add, that the librarian of this branch is forced to continually protest against the bad behavior of some of the youth frequenting the library. It would certainly be in the interest of Bohemians if the parents were to take some prompt actions in the matter.</p>
