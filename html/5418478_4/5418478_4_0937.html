   <p>Professor Masaryk, will not carry away any specially good remembrance of Chicago for himself. Hardly anyone attends his lectures at the university and when he lectures among us, we burden him with useless questions, as though we were some kind of inquisitors, who must examine his heart and kidneys and in the end we give him a sample of harmony and brotherhood. Unionists, socialists, catholics, liberal and protestants can have profit and pleasure from the professor's lectures, but they must not expect Mr. Masaryk to be a referee in our quarrels and arguments. Many difficulties are created for him and we are exhibiting bad manners thereby.</p>
