   <p>Brothers! The prevailing unpleasant social and economic conditions directly affect the program of our national and Sokol organizations, and to a certain extent are endangering their very existence.</p>
   <p>Seeing that the only possible means of rescue lies in unification, both sides appreciate the sincere efforts of the unification committee and fully comprehend the moderate stipulations upon which the unification will be realized.</p>
   <p>Considering that because of these unpleasant conditions we are forced to take this step, it was resolved to call a special meeting at Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy hall, February 24, at 8 P. M., where, in the presence of members of both associations, the unification question shall be decided.</p>
   <p>In the interest of the whole, it is essential that every member be present. Those who cannot attend this meeting because of important business should fill out a proxy ballot. According to the contents of this proxy, each member is entitled to empower either the president or the secretary to vote for him in this referendum when the question of unification is decided.</p>
   <p>For the Sokol Slavoj:</p>
   <p>Frank Vondracek, president,</p>
   <p>1526 South 58th Avenue, Cicero, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Karel J. Wittman, secretary,</p>
   <p>1615 South Keeler Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
