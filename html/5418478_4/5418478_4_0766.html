   <p>The Theatrical given by the pupils of the Bohemian Sunday School (at the Lime Kilns) was a success in all respects. Even though it was the first time that the pupils appeared before the public, they carried on as though they had previous experience behind the foot-lights. The public attended in large numbers and the efforts of the amateurs were received with great applause, for they really surprised every one with their fine work. Besides the theatrical presentation there were a number of speeches made and some singing was offered which met with approval.</p>
   <p>After the performance Mr. John Pavel presented the teacher of this school with a beautiful golden ring given by the pupils in appreciation of his industrious efforts in teaching them.</p>
   <p>The dancing program lasted until late in the night. We trust that the school, to which we wish great success, will in the near future again venture before the public with some lengthier play.</p>
