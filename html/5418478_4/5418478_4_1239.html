   <p>The Sokol Plzen (Pilsen), one of our foremost groups of aggressvie nationalist workers, celebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary--and the thirtieth anniversary of its ladies' auxiliary--last Saturday night. The celebration was held in its own hall on Ashland Avenue.....</p>
   <p>In the huge assemblage composed mostly of men and women Sokols, we were happy to see many of those who have earned the silver in their hair in devoted patriotic and Sokol work.....</p>
   <p>The banquet was preceded by the reading of the unit's history.....</p>
   <p>Of this history, the reading of which took two full hours, and which was full of most interesting details....we mention just these facts: The Sokol Plzen was founded July 11, 1879....and built its own home in 1892.....The beautiful <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>building was not completely finished until three years later, but even so, the completed parts served well as the center of the unit's gymnastic, social, and theatrical activities....</p>
   <p>The unit has now four hundred members, its ladies' auxiliary two hundred and seventy members....</p>
