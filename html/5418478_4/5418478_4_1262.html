   <p>The above picture shows students and instructors in the present course of the Slovanska Sokolska Gymnasticka Unie. (Slavonic Sokol Gymnastic Union).</p>
   <p>The number of students is not very large, but indicates an increase in Sokol instructors, who are greatly needed. It is to be hoped that with the increasing number of instructors, more activity will be displayed in the gymnasiums.</p>
   <p>At the end of this course, a great Sokol exhibition will be held at which the Cesko-Amerika Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) will formally present to the Slovanska Sokolska Gymnasticka Unie a cup which this organization won at the Olympic games in Chicago.</p>
