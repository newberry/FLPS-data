   <p>It has been pointed out that the Sokol societies are losing considerably in membership by enlistments and drafts in the Army. These losses should be made up by elderly men, many of whom have been dodging gymnastic drills up to the present. The Sokol Americky (American Sokol), representative organ of our gymnastic societies, has a word to say about this in its October issue:</p>
   <p>"'Fitness' has become a catchword among the American people. While we call for young men, the native American invites the middle-aged and the elderly men to keep trim and to strengthen their bodies by exercise." This way, they say, the elderly man will be able to perform the work which was done by young men who are now in the military service.</p>
   
   <p>Remarkable results have been attained by exercise and drills; their mention would, however, draw only an indulgent smile from some of the older members of our organizations.</p>
   <p>It is in this effort that we still lag--body culture of the more mature man and woman. We do not claim that every one of them can engage in gymnastics, but if they at least played a little, it would have a beneficial effect upon their body fitness and their mood as well.</p>
   <p>Our people do not seem to give this thought the proper consideration. We only talk and let others act.</p>
   <p>This is proved by the fact that only five per cent of the female and ten per cent of the male members of our Sokol organizations actually engage in the drills.</p>
