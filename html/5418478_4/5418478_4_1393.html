   <p>Our continuous calls, that the young Bohemian girls should organize a gymnastic society is now an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>Bohemian girls, assembled in our Bohemian "Pilzen" Hall, unanimously decided to found such an organization and judging from the accomplished deed, we are assured that this new society will properly proceed in its work toward prosperity.</p>
   <p>Yesterday at 7 p. m. they started the exercises for the first time and the number of "Falcon" girls was considerable. Many new members filled out the membership applications. We hope that, in the future, the "Ladies Falcon Association" will reach the high point of prosperity. The new association will operate and exercise under supervision of the "Pilzen-Falcons" until the ladies shall be able to choose a capable instructress from among themselves.</p>
