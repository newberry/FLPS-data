   <p>The Chicago Public Library Commissioners will in the near future purchase a considerable stock of new books of English, German, French and Scandinavian publication. For the purchase of Bohemian books not one cent has been set aside thus far in spite of the fact that we are continually boasting that there are 25,000 Bohemians in this city. Some time ago the "Ctenarska" Beseda"(Reading Club) managed to have appropriated about $500.00 for the purchase of Bohemian books, and requested a catalogue of recommended volumes, but since then everything seems to have been forgotten again. Since no one seems to be interested enough to go to the public library and ask for Bohemian publications, it is not to be wondered at, that the directors of this institution do not purchase Bohemian books in a great hurry, that we are considered as ignoramuses who do not know how to recognize the importance of a library.</p>
   <p>We ask for the third time: Does the "Ctenarska Beseda" (Reading Club) whose aim it should be, intend to do something about this matter. It is dependent on the Club to push this matter, because the first action in this cause was taken over two years ago by the Club.</p>
