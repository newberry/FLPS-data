   <p>Reports which have just reached our office through Mr. Jiri Kristufek, of 2747 South Clifton Park Avenue, indicate that the Zapadni Cesko-Bratrska Podporujici Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Association) has sanctioned the creation of an independent lodge of the Association in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Heretofore lodges belonging to this organization were limited to certain western states. The new ruling, just passed by the Association in convention at Omaha, Nebraska, makes it possible for the large number of our Chicago countrymen to establish such a lodge; this is of the greatest significance in our societal and national life.</p>
