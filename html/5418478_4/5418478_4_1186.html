   <p>The Karel Jonas Sokol gymnastic society in Cicero, Illinois, through its technical committee, is urging all men between the ages of twenty and forty to report at the nearest Sokol gymnasium and enroll in the courses in military training that will be conducted there free of charge.....</p>
   <p>All of our Sokol volunteers have found that the gymnastic training they had received while members of the Sokol organizations is a real asset.....Not only have their harmoniously-developed bodies caught the eyes of the army officers, but the Sokols were also familiar with the routine, for the Sokol drills include a great deal that can be put to advantage in military training. Consequently they are soon promoted to the ranks of petty officers and higher commands.....vv</p>
