   <p>The modern age has brought us many rights and privileges which we vainly sought in times past. Among other things it sanctioned our nationalistic and language rights, and, above all, our Slavonic character--our Bohemian nationality. One fact which is not denied to us even by a foreign land is that a Bohemian child has a full right to know and to understand the beauties of his own mother tongue, the sole heritage about which Svato-Pluk Cech [translator's note: One of the greatest literary figures of Bohemia] so eloquently speaks, calling it a might, a glory, and riches! When all else is taken away from us, our language remains; it was ever the shield that guarded us in our bitterest battles!</p>
   <p>Parents! Do not shirk your responsibilities! Be good American citizens, but do not permit your children to throttle their love for Bohemia! Do your national duties toward them by sending them to the Carter H. Harrison High School where they may attend classes in the Bohemian language. It depends upon you that Bohemian instruction be continued in this school, for should attendance dwindle, all such instructions will be discontinued, and it will be your children who will suffer a loss Parents, do not forget that the Bohemian language is a recognized subject in this school, and that those students who enroll in it get [academic] credit for it.</p>
