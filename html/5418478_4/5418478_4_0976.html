   <p>Extensive preparations are being made by the Straz Katolickeho Sokola v Chicagu (sentinel of the Bohemian Catholic Sokol of Chicago). The committee in charge of the program has promised a diversified entertainment for this evening. The members who are to meet in the Cesko-Americky Sokol hall (Bohemian-American Sokol) are not merely representatives of the Katolicko-Americky Sokol (Bohemian-American Catholic Sokol); they are also to be the delegates to a Bohemian-Catholic convention in Czechoslovakia, thus representing the Bohemian Catholics of America.....It is expected that our Chicago countrymen will take advantage of this opportunity to select the young men and women who will attend this important convention. The Catholic societies and the Bohemian Catholic people who have made this organization possible [Translator's note: The Catholic Sokol team], will wish to be present tonight to watch the exercises and to see the development of the work.</p>

   <p>The delegates themselves look upon this evening's meeting as something to be remembered. It is to be desired, however, that our young people leave us cheerfully, in spite of the great solemnity which their mission entails.....</p>
