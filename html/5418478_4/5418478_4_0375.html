   <p>The first course in citizenship and its meaning, a knowledge which is necessary before citizenship rights may be conferred upon a candidate seeking them, has just been completed, and one hundred candidates for citizenship received their diplomas under the sponsorship of the Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek.</p>
   <p>The second course will be started in a few days, again in the T. G. Masaryk School. This time it will be conducted by the members of the Zabavni A Podporujici Klub Rohac (Rohac Social and Benevolent Club.) The instructors will be secured from the United States Department of Labor, the same as in the first course. The tuition fee is $1, which will help pay for the rental of the schoolroom. There will be no other fees charged. Every candidate who successfully completes this course will receive a diploma which will help him when making application for his second citizenship paper; the government examiners, when seeing such a diploma, will not subject a candidate to any oral examination. This is done mainly because these diplomas are awarded only after candidates pass an examination conducted by a government official. The diploma thus becomes a proof of the candidate's ability to become a citizen. Make your applications to enroll in this course, with the following members of the Club; Mr. Jan Stehlik, 5538 West 25th Street; Mr. Josef Lohr, 5743 West 22nd Street; and Mr. Stanislav Schneider, the T. G. Masaryk School; and Mr. J. J. Langr, 2526 South 57th Court, all in Cicero, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Non-Citizens, seize this opportunity offered to you at this time when you may easily spend some of your free moments to your own advantage. Enroll in this course.</p>
