   <p>As we announced in yesterday's issue of this paper, the J. A. Komensky Memorial Celebration Committee decided, with permission of the National Grand Lodge and the Grand Lodge of Illinois C. S. B. S. (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society), that the portrait of J. A. Komemsky, which was painted by our artist, Mr. Klire, be presented to the school, on whose front the name of Komemsky is engraved. The presentation took place yesterday.</p>
   <p>To be sure it was not a large celebration, but the more significant, because the respect for this great teacher was expressed in ardent words from the tender hearts of the children and if the Principal of the above named school keeps her word, Komemsky School will be the fountain from which will spread love and respect toward this Bohemian genius among American people.</p>
   <p>When the Committee arrived at the school at the appointed time, all <span class="page-break">\2</span>pupils and teachers gathered in the upper hall and Mr. Matonsek, speaking in English, made the presentation. Mrs. Mahoney, Principal, accepted with a short talk. Dr. Jirka, as a member of the Committee, as well as the school board, explained to the gathering, the beneficient influence of Komensky and tried to awaken respect in the hearts of all for the greatest teacher of his time, who today is read by the entire civilized world.</p>
   <p>On all the black-boards of the school were written various extracts from Komemsky's writings. The teachers and the principal of Komemsky School gave proof that they are well acquainted with the writings of the great Bohemian teacher and that they respect his influence highly.</p>
