   <p>It was a pleasant duty for the reporter of this newspaper to attend and to report on the monthly meeting of the Slet committee which was held June 7, at Sokol Chicago Hall. For more than six months the factors of our sokol units have held their meetings their in order to make plans for great sokol holidays. At the present time there is plenty of work to be done, and during the course of the meeting it was apparent that all this work was being done with love and enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman of the committee, Brother Mueller, in the presence of many sokols and sokolice (women sokol members), everyone of whom followed the reports of various committees which quite clearly portrayed the contours of the first Slet of the Americka Obec Sokolska.</p>

   <p>The reading of communications followed. Brother J. Hiller, a member of the educational staff, announced that because of the depression the Ceska Obec Sokolska v Praze (Bohemian Sokol Union of Prague, Czechoslovakia) will not be able to send a five-member delegation to the Slet, as it was originally announced, but will send a delegation of three members. This announcement caused a great deal of disappointment and it was justly pointed out that the Ceska Obec Sokolska v Praze, which for a long number of years neglected the American branch of sokoldom, should send to this Slet not only a delegation but an exemplary team. It was decided to send a letter to Prague and let the Ceska Obec Sokolska v Praze know what the American sokoldom thinks about it. The expenses, which would be required to cover such trip, were also taken into consideration and it was resolved that such a trip could be financed by the Czechoslovak government which could send the sokol team to the United States on an educational tour.....</p>
   <p>The administration committee recommended the appointment of a lodging committee. It was decided that one member of every sokol unit in Chicago should launch a <span class="page-break">\3</span>campaign among the members of his unit for the purpose of securing lodgings for the out-of-town visitors of the Slet. Brother Simaner, a member of the economic committee, reported that contracts for the printing of Slet posters and other literature concerning the Slet was already awarded. He also reported that Pilsen Park had been leased.</p>
   <p>Brother Jarka Kosar made a motion that our sokol halls be open to the out-of-town sokols who should use them as headquarters during the time of the Slet. The motion was carried. The secretary of the administration committee, Brother A. Hruby, then read the minutes of the meetings of the said committee held April 22, May 25, and June 3, and from which we excerpt the following:</p>
   <p>"The results of negotiations between the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society) and the administration committee which was represented by Sister Dobias were as follows:</p>
   <p>"One of the first agreements was that the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana <span class="page-break">\4</span>shall take care of the moral success of the performance, that is, it shall see to it that the "Prodana Nevesta" (The Bartered Bride), a Bohemian opera, be properly presented on the stage, and that the Slet committee shall take care of the financial success of the performance, that is, the sale of admission tickets. The net proceeds of the performance were supposed to be divided equally. It was estimated that the gross receipts for one performance in Sokol Chicago Hall be about two thousand dollars. The expenses were estimated at about twelve hundred dollars, including the remunerations of the soloist. But in the meeting of the administration committee, in which this agreement was taken into consideration, it was decided that because of accumulated work it would not be fair to burden the members of the Slet committee with additional work connected with the sale of tickets; Sister Dobias was instructed to offer the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana a new proposition. According to this new proposition the Slet committee would be satisfied with twenty-five per cent of the net proceeds of the performance but refuses to be held financially responsible. This new proposition was rejected by the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana, and the presentation of the Prodana Nevesta during the Slet was called.off.</p>

   <p>The receipts in this meeting amounted to $7,102.86; the expenses, $803.41; cash on hand, $6,299.45.</p>
