   <p>The Czech Literary Society has taken upon its shoulders the great and burdensome task of preparing a new grammar of the Czech language edited in English. This comprehensive text book is to be introduced in Chicago high schools and colleges, and should also serve scientists interested in our tongue. In order to gain general support for this enterprise, it is necessary that the purpose and the mission of the book be properly elucidated.</p>
   <p>Let us, first of all, consider that we possess no suitable textbook for our Czech classes here; we mean the Harrison high school and the high school in Cicero. The schools outside of Chicago suffer from the same deficiency. But it is not only the books printed here, even those available from the old homeland, Bohemia, which do not answer the purpose. It is obvious that the books printed in the old country which are used by <span class="page-break">\2</span>pupils who are already acquainted with the language cannot serve the American born Czech pupil with a sufficient, or practically no knowledge at all of the tongue. The instruction has, therefore, to lead in a different direction. The student here makes errors different from the pupil of the old country.</p>
   <p>There is a great number of pupils of Harrison high school who have no preparatory knowledge, because there is no suitable book available for them. The pupils who already speak the language are advanced in the higher classes. The beginners, however, lacking books corresponding with their level, soon loose their patience, and so drop out of the community of our people.</p>
   <p>The book prepared by the Czech Literary Society will present the grammar of the Bohemian language with explanations in English. It certainly is the wish of Czech parents to prevent their children from becoming <span class="page-break">\3</span>denationalized. For this reason, we maintain at a great cost our afternoon and Saturday classes. The Harrison and Cicero schools are equipped according to modern requirements. In these schools, the student of the Bohemian language gets credit for his achievements in the tongue. All that is left for us to do is to procure the requisites; the instruction in these schools will bear fruit as plentiful as the teaching in any private school. Czech parents should sacrifice the amount for the purchase of the textbook. They should take into consideration that the money yielded from the sale must be used for future editions. The first edition, which is expected to be brought before the beginning of the next school year, must be financed by donations.</p>
