   <p>The Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) has recently enlarged its summer camp. What is most important, its cooking and cooking facilities have been placed in expert hands. This week the Sokol is sending its victorious junior teams to that camp for a free vacation. The teams distinguished themselves during the recent tournament given by the Zupa Stredni (central district of the American Sokol Union) and won first place both as teams and in individual competitions. They, therefore, deserve this [vacation] for they were the youngest among the competing teams, and in spite of their youth, defeated all other competitors.</p>
