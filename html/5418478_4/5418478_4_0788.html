   <p>On Tuesday night, October 17, the Czech Fourth Ward Improvement Club held a meeting to which it invited the director of the central office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics), Mr. Antonin Vaclav Tesar, who was to address the Club, using for his subject the theme "Nase povinnosti obcanske" (Our duties as citizens). The club consists of more than three hundred members and is provided with an excellent leadership for our people and their welfare. In his introduction, Mr. Tesar mentioned the fact that he came only for the purpose of calling the attention of our people to some very important matters which should serve as guides to voters at the next election, the endeavor being to purify our political life. He said:</p>
   <p>"Everywhere we hear complaints about the present conditions, we cite instances of mismanagement and discrder; we observe and follow the disorganization of our social order; in short, we know,--all of us--that the setting of our house in order is absolutely necessary. The bringing of order into this chaotic <span class="page-break">\2</span>situation must needs be ruthless. Every American citizen has a great power as long as he performs his duties as such and performs them with a good conscience. This power must be well utilized by us in order that it does not fall into disuse.</p>
   <p>"The American Czechoslovaks have always accomplished great things as long as they worked together for a good cause, whenever an opportunity arose, be it the liberation of Czechoslovakia, or fighting of a bill in Congress which proposed to thwart the use of our [Czech] mother tongue, impelled by a hatred for all foreign-language groups.</p>
   <p>"It was always our unity which helped us to achieve our national and cultural objectives. We need such a unity even in our political questions. Our Czechoslovak people should, in all political matters, consider only the best candidates irrespective of party loyalties. A central body organized for the purpose of keeping our people informed about the qualifications and character of candidates would thus be a desirable civic institution. We should also help candidates having good character and qualifications, particularly if these candidates <span class="page-break">\3</span>happen to be our own countrymen.</p>
   <p>"In all such cases any personal selfishness, envy, or any other vices that we may have, must be overcome; it is these vices which have always stood in the way of our progress. I know that, for instance, envy exists among us when we see that it is one of our own countrymen who is endeavoring to attain a higher or better position in life, or that he has set up an ideal which he now desires to achieve. Such men deserve to be helped by us, and [not] held back by us.</p>
   <p>"Take any one of our daily papers and you will read in it about the numerous cases of political graft, both big and small; you will learn about disorder, wholesale waste of public funds, moral decay and criminality. It seems as if everything in our city were infected by this immoral miasma; justice and honesty disappear, and there can be no talk about one's duties to one's fellow men when conditions like the above are allowed to go on unmolested; on the contrary, we now face a moral bankruptcy of the social order. Many--O, so many!--lack in desirable Christian virtues. These moral evils and corruptions will not <span class="page-break">\4</span>disappear until people refine their ethics rationally, socially, in the fields of science, the arts, commerce, and industry. It devolves upon us to serve the state conscientiously, and thus to be of service to the citizens and to the country as a whole. To be fully cognizant of one's civil rights is especially necessary when one holds the ballot in one's hand. At such a time one ought to consider the situation well. And the general clean-up, to be effective, must be attempted by all of us, and not only by some of us. It must be attempted by both men and women--in short, by everybody whose great privilege it is to be a citizen of this great republic.</p>
   <p>"The plundering of public funds, the constant increase of taxes accompanied by a continual wasting of the money of the taxpayers, the appropriation of public funds for all kinds of unnecessary or superfluous objects and situations must stop. The people desire that it be stopped, and the voice of the people must be listened to. We need a remedy to effect an improvement. There can be no substitutes, no surrogates for such a remedy--we must consider our duties to our fellowmen. We will not sacrifice our rights as citizens for the benefit of <span class="page-break">\5</span>a few individuals who would profit by it."</p>
   <p>The speaker [also] mentioned two questions which will gain in importance at the November elections--namely, the question of the soldiers' bonus, and the question of the manufacture and sale of light wines and beers. He explained and supported both of these questions, giving his reasons why an American citizen should vote for them. He likewise mentioned the unfriendly provisions and bills which have been proposed in some states of the Union, and gave his reasons why that was done; and how important it is for us to fulfill our duties as citizens as conscientiously as possible, thus guaranteeing the discontinuance of these unfriendly attacks on the immigrant folk. [Translator's note: The above being rather vague the attention of the reader is called to certain bills which circulated at the time of this election, the purpose of which was to curtail the use of foreign language in our schools and thus indirectly to thwart the cultural life of foreign-language groups. Americanism of the 1916-1919 period was only a sympton of certain dislikes and even hatreds with which all things foreign were regarded by the so-called "hundred percenters".] He gave several examples <span class="page-break">\6</span>of false Americanism. He then injected a timely word about the salvage of our youth. He called the attention of the parents to the youth problem, which deserves our wholehearted attention and which should be followed with much interest. Mr. Tesar had to repeat his address. [Translator's note: He probably spoke to two audiences on that day.] At the end of his address he received the thanks of the president of the club, and the audience expressed its appreciation by rising, grateful for his words in behalf of our Czechoslovak people.</p>
