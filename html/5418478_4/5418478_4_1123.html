It was recommended that bids be accepted for illustrated postal cards. The committee announced that the huge posters heralding the last Slet of the Czechoslovak Sokol Union held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, were selected and will be used to advertise our Slet. This was approved.</p>

   <p>The news from Brother V. Struppl, Slet reporter, that, according to Brother Konecny who just came from Czechoslovakia, all of the presidents of the Czechoslovak Sokol Union will come to Chicago to attend our Slet, was a delightful surprise. It is also possible that an exemplary team of men and a team of women will be sent here.</p>
   <p>The report of the economic committee was as follows: Letters were sent to several places to ascertain under what conditions the hall could be rented for our festive days. The management of the Coliseum is asking one thousand dollars for Sunday; the Second Regiment Armory is asking four hundred dollars. The economic committee will find out whether the Armory building will be adequate, that is whether there is enough room for five or six hundred Sokols and about ten thousand seats. If there is, then a deposit will be sent at once.</p>
   <p>Brother Jarka Kosar requested that as soon as such a place is assured for Sunday, then Pilsen Park ought to be rented for the next day, that is for Monday. A place where the contests will be held should also be secured.</p>

Brother August Novak was appointed to serve on this committee.</p>
   <p>Brother Jarka Kosar joyfully noted the enthusiasm and interest which prevails at the meetings of the committee, and he asked that the representatives transmit this enthusiasm into the hearts of our people, and especially into our Sokol halls. For the central technical staff, he announced that it will be necessary to secure the services of traveling instructors in order that correct training may be assured. This was approved.</p>
