   <p>Ten weeks still remain until the unveiling of the Karel Havlicek Borousky monument in Douglas Park. However, that is, in no way, too long a time in which to make all preparations for such a grand and great celebration as this will be. There is no doubt that this will probably be the greatest Bohemian national celebration that was ever held in America.</p>
   <p>Taking part will be, not only the Bohemians of Chicago, but surely all other Czech towns and communities throughout the United States. Therefore, it is necessary for the committee to contact all Bohemian communities, which will send delegations and representatives of <span class="page-break">\2</span>lodges and private excursions here, because preparations must be made to house the crowds of guests expected. It will be necessary to arrange with railroads for reduced fares from all parts of the country. It also will be necessary to create excursion committees throughout the country, and this cannot be accomplished in a week or two. For that purpose alone, the entire period of time which remains will be needed. In order that the success of the celebration be assured of being accomplished, it is necessary that the work of arrangements be started at once.</p>
