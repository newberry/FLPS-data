   <p>Happy is the man, truly happy, who can say that he has lived not merely in order to live, but that he has done something in his life that will be remembered after he is gone. And happy is the organization which not only has existed, but which has always succeeded in keeping away from the ordinary, the commonplace--which has always progressed along pathways which in themselves are worth remembering, and whose remembrance by the public is its most valuable, most permanent monument. Such men and such organizations are few and far between. Especially few of them are in Bohemian America. The Sokol Slavsky may therefore look with that much more pride to the past in order to anticipate its future. Although it was twenty-five years last February since the Society was founded, it was not until Saturday night and yesterday that the Sokol Slavsky celebrated, in a dignified manner, that important anniversary which has an indisputable significance, not only from the Sokol point of view, but from the standpoint of the whole of Bohemian America. The Sokol Slavsky has worked quietly and diligently throughout these twenty-five years. It worked efficiently and with full knowledge of its responsibility without a thought of ostentatious recognition. There never has been need to prod it up; it has always stood in the vanguard of every movement which is in sympathy with the Sokol ideas, with the ideas of national advancement, and with the ideas of the progress of humanity. This we have said many a time already, and it would serve no good purpose to talk about it again. Today we limit ourselves to the statement of the fact that the sum total of the activities of the Society during the past twenty-five years has been such that our public may be justly proud of it, and that the public favor shown to it now is fully deserved and should inspire it to still greater and more blessed work in the future.</p>
   <p>That our public knows how to be appreciative was shown Saturday night when the great hall of the Cesko-Anglicka Svobodna Skola (Bohemian-English Free Thought School) on West 18th Street was filled to over-flowing by a select, but still democratic audience of friends and partisans of our brave Sokols.</p>
   
   <p>The occasion was an entertainment with an artistic program, the first event of the anniversary celebration.....It was opened by the Napravnik's beautiful overture "Vlasti" (To the Homeland)....followed by a short address by the head of the Sokol Slavsky, Brother Bohus Hak....</p>
   <p>After speeches....again music and song kept the audience captivated.....</p>
   <p>The splendid entertainment was concluded by the reading of congratulatory messages and telegrams from all parts of the United States, and one from Brother Klepal from Skoplje.</p>
   <p>A worthy counterpart of Saturday's celebration was yesterday's event held in Pilsen Park. This was preceded by a parade which started in the early afternoon from the building of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies).....</p>
   <p>After a short rest, a lively crowd gathered together in the open space behind the Pavilion....where a splendid proof of the excellent results of physical culture was given to those assembled.....</p>
   <p>After the formal program of the afternoon, a sociable and friendly fellowship developed which was not interrupted even by the steady rain that started toward evening. The rain, however, eliminated the program for the evening, for which among other features, as a special number, a drill with Chinese lanterns had been planned.</p>
   <p>Our report would be incomplete if we neglected to give due acknowledgment to the co-operation of the Polish singing society of Filarets. This society is among the best in the city of Chicago, and sang several compositions which were rewarded by great applause.....</p>
