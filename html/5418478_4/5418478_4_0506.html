   <p>The American people still are not properly acquainted with the cultural development of us Bohemians, because many of our fellow countrymen are not well versed in the proper use of the English language in public. Therefore, it quite often happens that Bohemian-Americans are not represented at various meetings where they could voice their opinions on various important questions and gain honor and recognition for the Bohemian-American element.</p>
   <p>It is possible to overcome this deficiency only by training. Consequently, a course of lectures on community speaking is being held at the Farragut Public School, 23rd Street and Spaulding Avenue, in Room 302. The lectures will be given twice a week--that is, Tuesday and Friday evenings--at 7:30.</p>

   <p>An expert teacher, Miss Claire O'Hair, a graduate of the University of Illinois, is in charge of the courses. It is to be regretted that last Friday only six Bohemians were present. The course of lectures provides good training, the teacher is excellent, and it is up to us to take advantage of this opportunity. Many of us could gain recognition in public life and push aside many a "knownothing" who holds his position only by his nerve and a glib tongue.</p>
   <p>There are many people among us who have good common sense and only lack experience in public speaking. Now here is our chance to get rid of this handicap. Let us hope that on next Tuesday Room 302 will be crowded with Bohemian men and women.</p>
