   <p>The Damsky Odbor Ceske Besedy (Ladies Auxiliary of the Bohemian Club) has been busy for some time preparatory to launching its activities tomorrow. The home of the Club is at 3659 Douglas Boulevard. This time the program will be managed by the junior members of the Ladies' Auxiliary--all the gifted young daughters of the members of the Club. Miss Emily Bachman, assisted by Miss Helen Holpuch, was successful in securing one of the best known speakers, Mrs. George R. Plummer, who will speak on the subject "The Vanishing Lady". The second number on the program will be the singing in English of three beautiful songs by Miss Helen Lonek. She will be accompanied by her sister, Lillian. The third item will be a piano solo played by the gifted pianist, Miss Bernice Jelinek.</p>
   <p>The activities of the Ladies' Auxiliary extend over a period of almost twenty years; the younger set introduced a new idea which consists of <span class="page-break">2</span>securing speakers of the English language so that members of the Club who speak only that language might be able to take an active part in its activities.</p>
   <p>All of the meetings and transactions of the club shall be in the American language [sic] although the members are free to speak at the meetings and transact their business in either the Czech or the English language. The newly installed members of the board of directors of the Ladies' Auxiliary are now preparing some very interesting and meaningful lectures, concerts, and excursions.</p>
   <p>Thus, for instance, on October 19, they will sponsor a trip through the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium. The trip will start at 2 P. M. and the members of the Club are asked to be on hand to take part in this trip through the Sanitarium, the chief physician of which is Dr. Allan Hruby.</p>
   <p>The new officers of the club whose term expires in April 1923 are: Mrs. Pavlina Holpuch, <span class="page-break">3</span>president; Mrs. Marie Storkan, vice-president; Mrs. Albina Lonek, secretary; Mrs. Marie Vlcek, treasurer. The directors of the various committees are the following ladies: Mesdames Ruzena E.
