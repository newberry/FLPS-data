   <p>The cornerstone of the Vojta Naprstek school was laid yesterday in the presence of the building committee and directors of the trustee board, and representatives of several societies. The original ceremony was to be held on Sunday but because of unfavorable weather, the actual laying of the cornerstone was postponed until yesterday. However, even yesterday, conditions were not much better. On Sunday, snow was drifting, and yesterday it rained. Therefore, the stone was laid without any display. The metal container, in which are deposited documents of the school and of the new building, and copies of Bohemian newspapers, coins, and other mementos, were placed under the stone. The new building will be dedicated to its purpose in July.</p>
