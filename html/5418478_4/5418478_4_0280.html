   <p>Several years ago we had a paper, Bohemian Voice, which became extinct without anybody's taking notice of it. Not until this year did we succeed in producing a publication, The Bohemian Review, which has become the official organ of the Czech National Council. With high honors it serves not only our national organization, but the entire American branch of the Czech people as well. This is due to the commendable work of Dr. J. F. Smetanka, the editor, who makes the history of the present struggle for Czech independence available to the second generation of American Czechs who read English almost exclusively.</p>
   <p>Excerpts from this publication are frequently quoted in the English language press; sometimes entire articles which splendidly convey information to the American public are reprinted.</p>
   <p>Everyone of us knows how pleasant it is to read about our people and our own aspirations in American publications.</p>

   <p>The Bohemian Review is a perfect vehicle for information. For this reason it is sent to American writers and newspaper offices, senators and congressmen.</p>
   <p>Our more prosperous fellow citizens should subscribe to it or pay the subscription fee for various schools, library branches, etc. The price of this monthly is only one dollar per year.</p>
