   <p>The Zabavni a Podporujici Klub Kosu (Blackbirds Social and Benevolent Club) has made extensive preparations for a Saint Wenceslaus dance festival to be held tomorrow night at 8 P.M. in Mr. Kafka's restaurant, West 26th Street and Avers Avenue.</p>
   <p>The mere mention of the name of this popular Club is a sufficient guarantee that the place will be crowded with people who expect to be amused in a thoroughly unrestrained fashion. Whenever the "Blackbirds" arrange an evening of entertainment, one may be sure that it will be a success, cordial and full of good fun. This fact is known to all friends of good fun, and we may say, therefore, that the "Blackbird" affair will be well attended.</p>
   <p>Mr. Josef Havlicek's orchestra will provide the musical part of the program. Admission is 35 cents per person.</p>
