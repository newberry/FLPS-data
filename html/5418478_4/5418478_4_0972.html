   <p>Brother Dvorak sent the following news to us from the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) Camp at New Buffalo, Michigan: On July 22, 1922, the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor Lyra (Lyra Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) visited the camp. Their beautiful voices reverberated through the camp for two days, and it goes without saying that the presence of our talented singers contributed much to the noble entertainment of the Sokols. The Lyra singers drew great attention to themselves when on Sunday they sang several selections at the New Buffalo railroad station. There were a great many visitors there from the surrounding summer resorts who, mixing among our people, were greatly impressed by the singing.....</p>
   <p>Due to the enlargement of the camp, we have much greater comfort here this year than at any time previous. The cooking is excellent too; all these things have made our stay and that of our friends very pleasant.....</p>
