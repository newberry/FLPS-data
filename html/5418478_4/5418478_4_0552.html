   <p>The regular classes of the Czech liberal schools will begin September 4. [The schools are maintained by an organization which conducts them on a free religionist (rationalist) basis as differentiated from parochial or sectarian schools. No religious services are held or prescribed.]</p>
   <p>It is the duty of Czech parents to make use of them for their children.... In these times of restricted immigration, it is necessary to let our children know something about the history and the language of our people. Classes are held on working days in some schools, on Saturdays and Sundays in others. [Follows a list of names of the various schools; no locations are given.]</p>
