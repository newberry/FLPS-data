   <p>The following are the minutes of the meeting of the Statni Vybor Svazu Svobodomyslnych v Illinois (Illinois Grand Lodge of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) which was held on September 11, 1922, in the Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial Building) in Chicago: [Names of the attending delegates and the organizations represented by each are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. These minutes included also the meeting of the combined organization committee. It was authorized to have copies of minutes of the meetings of the state committee forwarded to the three [Bohemian] dailies and to the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason). Several letters were read [by the secretary].</p>
   <p>A letter was received from the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers), containing certain favorable replies to various inquiries made by us. It was insisted, however, that one rule remains in force, namely, that the secretary of the executive committee of the Svaz must attend the meetings of the joint organization committee. The matter will be presented by our delegate at the next meeting of the executive committee of the Svaz.</p>
   <p>The following bills were submitted for approval: A fee of $5 payable to Brother V. Petrzelka for a lecture delivered by him on May 5, 1922, before the Moravan Lodge of the Cesko-Americka Jednota, was approved; a rental bill of $4.50 for three meetings of the organization, and fares and postage amounting to $25.75 connected with our [official] visit of the Free Thought organization of Milwaukee, was approved; bills for notices in the three Bohemian dailies-- Denni Hlasatel, $4.00; Spravedlnost, $5.00; Svornost, $7.50--were approved with the exception that the treasurer was instructed to ask the Svornost for a reduction in the rates charged by them.</p>
   
   <p>The secretary reported that all assignments and tasks to be performed by him were duly carried out. He read a copy of a letter sent by him to an important organization. In regard to the last convention, he reported that only 28 delegates attended, a deplorable fact revealing the lack of interest among our freethinkers. The convention, nevertheless, accomplished its mission. He pointed out the necessity of establishing contacts with our out-of-town brothers, and the result and growth which our movement will acquire by such methods.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Illinois Federation [of Bohemian Freethinkers] also addressed the meeting. The course of the meeting was smooth, and those who attended it left with a good impression and enthusiasm for continued activity. The Milwaukee members are clamoring for a weekly publication from which they except much good to result for their local movement. A brief debate followed the secretary's report, and it was finally decided that he should receive $15 to cover the expenses associated with his trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The secretary expressed his gratitude for the appreciation shown for his work, but returned $7 of that amount for the benefit [of the work] of the Illinois Federation, accepting only $8 for actual expenses. The secretary was empowered to have the necessary documents printed. [Translator's note: This report does not specify what kind of documents.]</p>
   <p>The auditing committee submitted the following report: Receipts to June 30, 1922, totaled $357.50; disbursements for the same period [January 1, 1922 to June 30, 1922] amounted to $118.50; the balance on hand on July 1, 1922 was $239.</p>
   <p>The reports of the local Federation of the Svaz from the Town of Lake, Chicago, were encouraging. The festival held by that organization gained the sympathies of certain people who, though not exactly inimical to the work which the organization is doing, were hitherto rather indifferent to it. The net receipts were $700, of which $80 shall be used for the publication fund of the Vek Rozumu. There is not a single local club, society, or other organization which would not have a delegate in the local Federation of the Svaz.</p>
   
   <p>Reports of the local Chicago Federation showed that the mass meeting was successful, netting us about $300. There will be another mass meeting next year. It was decided that all freethinkers, instead of using an oath during pre-election work, should pledge their word of honor; in this way they (the freethinkers) will truly practice Free Thought. A managing committee was delegated to join in with the work of the committee in charge of the Posviceni([Czech] country festival). The local [Chicago] Federation took an active part in the work of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools).....</p>
   <p>Following the reports of the local organizations of the Svaz, a lengthy debate ensued which revealed that the state Federation was not limited to two lecturers, but that other men are invited to give lectures for the organization; this practice shall continue. The important thing is that they be true freethinkers, and as such, useful to our organization and movement. There were no reports from the local organization of Cicero, Illinois, its delegate being absent.</p>
   
   <p>There followed a debate concerning the work at Cicero, and it was agreed that something must be done to inject new life into it. Further steps in this direction were to be made by the organization committee which was also entrusted with the task of starting local organizations in Berwyn and Willow Springs, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The report of the executive committee was hailed with satisfaction. It was announced that our life philosophy was beginning to be appreciated at last; that work had been started leading to formal renunciation of church membership; that official spokesmen [of our Free Thought movement] are to be sent on a mission to Bohemia; that such recommendations as were made at the last conference are now in print; and that action was started by the joint organization committee leading to the preliminary work of starting a weekly publication of the Vek Rosumu.</p>
   <p>Several recommendations were made for the good of our movement. The constitution</p>
