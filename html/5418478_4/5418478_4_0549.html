   <p>"In these days we work chiefly to help the old homeland win independence. This is a sublime idea which will show to the whole world that the Czech nation shall not perish. It will show that our people are still alive, creating works of art, producing scientists in almost all branches of learning. Our Czech nation is capable of developing in both the economic field and the political field in the management of its own affairs, with these high aims in mind, we must not, dear friends, forget ourselves--the Czech branch in American. For, if we work for ourselves, it will not mean the abandonment of the movement for the liberation of the old homeland, or--God forbid--the damaging of it. We shall, on the contrary, show the Americans that we are a healthy people, strong, and full of enterprise, and that we know how to preserve our language even outside the borders of our old homeland."</p>
