   <p>Czechoslovak Cicero had a significant national celebration yesterday--the opening of a new school which will carry the name of the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomas G. Masaryk. This was an event of great importance because through continuous and concerted action, the Patronat (school board composed of representatives of associations interested in schools, [patronage]) and our Cicero organizations, as well as individual citizens, have succeeded in providing a permanent building for our Czech school in Cicero, a building owned and administered by our [Czech] public; hence there is no longer any worry lest a hostile school board will discontinue Czech classes in schools maintained by Cicero taxpayers. It is only proper to mention here that it was the refusal of the town school board to permit the use of rooms for the holding of Czech classes in Cicero public schools which stirred up propaganda for a Czech school building in Cicero; and the work that was started at that time has now been brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The cornerstone of the new school building was laid May 8, and yesterday, in the presence of the delegation and the group of Sokols from Czechoslovakia who witnessed and participated in our great Slet (Sokol mass convention) festivities, the School was opened. Thus these guests of ours had an opportunity to attend another important national event in the life of Czechoslovaks in America, the dedication of a Czech school building.</p>
   <p>The delegation and the model Sokol group were guests of the Sokol Karel Jonas at a luncheon and, afterward proceeded in the company of men and women Sokols to the new school building on 57th Avenue and 22nd Place.</p>
   <p>Our guests received an enthusiastic welcome from our school youth and the assembled public, and to the accompaniment of music of Mr. Cerny's band, were conducted to the platform in front of the school building, after which Mr. Sebek, the chairman of the Patronat, opened the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>He welcomed those assembled as well as the guests from the old country, and <span class="page-break">3</span>thanked all associations and individuals whose generosity had made it possible to build this beautiful school which will always serve as evidence of the superiority of the great Czech colony of Cicero.</p>
   <p>His speech was followed by the American anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the Czech hymn "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home), sung by the pupils of the School, and afterwards by little Miss Marousek's declamation of an appropriate Czech poem. Then, Mr. Jan Havranek, commander of the Sokolska Zupa Rastislavova (Sokol unit called Zupa of Rastislav) of Brno and a member of the delegation was introduced and addressed those assembled, directing his remarks particularly to our school youth. He said that the delegation has had many unforgettable moments during their stay in America, and one of the most impressive of such moments is the opening of a beautiful, new Czech school. At one of the important occasions, the delegation were painfully touched by the remark that the Czech branch in America is bound to perish, but today they have become convinced that such is not the case. As long as we are building Sokol halls and Czech schools, there is no need for <span class="page-break">4</span>concern about the life of the American branch of the Czechoslovak nation. When the delegation was leaving the old country it was accompanied by a multitude of people who asked the members to greet, on their behalf, our American brothers, to give them their love, and express their gratitude for everything they had done for the liberation of the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>Addressing the youth, Mr. Havranek said: "Far away overseas there is a country where at this time there is night already. In that country there lives a nation from which your father and your mother have descended; a nation which was great at one time, but it weakened, gave up the struggle, and many thought that it would perish, disappear, just as some people think about its branch in America. But that nation took new life, has obtained its freedom and become great again. It is the nation to whom you belong, even if you were not born in Bohemia, or in Moravia, or perhaps in Slovakia. The country in which that nation lives is beautiful, an 'earthly paradise for the eye,' as you sing in the national anthem. Here, your parents have built a school for you in order that you may learn their native tongue, in order that you may <span class="page-break">5</span>become acquainted with the history of the Czechoslovak people, in order that you may acquire love for it and become proud of being children of Czech parents. When I go back to Czechoslovakia and again address my pupils, I shall tell them that I have spoken to you, I shall give them your greetings, and express to them my feelings of joy and pride at having been present at the inauguration of a Czech school in America, and at being able to give you their love. Keep on loving your old country as you have been loving her up to this time, and we in Czechoslovakia shall never forget that there are good Czech people in America, people who love their old country, people who continue building their Sokol halls, their schools, people who live and will live."</p>
   <p>Professor Jan Hiller of Czechoslovakia spoke after Mr. Havranek's beautiful address. He discussed briefly the progress of schools and education in Czechoslovakia, and expressed his pleasure at being able to participate in this important ceremony. Then there were a few words by Mr. Psenka--the delegation was unable to stay much longer--followed by an inspection <span class="page-break">6</span>of the new school building after which the delegation left to attend the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the foundation of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. In the meantime, Mr. O. R. Fuerst was presented to the assemblage and delivered a lengthy talk about the importance of schools in America. He recounted the first struggles of Czech immigrants in Chicago and the great progress the Czechs have made in this Western Metropolis.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Fuerst's speech, Miss Helena Krigseis presented the congratulations of the Dorostovy Klub "Cechoslovak" (Czechoslovakian Young People's Club) and was followed by addresses by representatives of various Czechoslovak organizations.</p>
   <p>After their speeches the ceremony of the inauguration proper took place.....</p>
   <p>The new building has three schoolrooms, all of them light and spacious, well-equipped, and therefore fully suitable for their purpose. The third floor contains a large assembly room, on the first floor there is a dining <span class="page-break">7</span>room, and the apartment of the building superintendent, Mr. Schneider. Classes in the school will start tomorrow. The school fills a need Cicero has felt for a long time. It cost $35,000 and the friends of Czech schools will always bear in mind that their generosity will be always needed for the maintenance of our school in Cicero.</p>
