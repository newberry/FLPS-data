   <p>Yesterday was a day of celebration for Chicago Bohemians because of the convention of National Gymnastic Societies. Both Local Societies the "Cesko Americkeho Sokola" (Bohemian American Sokols) and the "Telocvicne Jednoty Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) took part in the ceremonies. Both halls of these societies were filled to capacity. The celebration came to a close in the evening in GymnasticUnion Hall where the historic play "Zebraci"(Beggars) was given with great success. The celebration ended in good order to the satisfaction of all and indicated to us how such occasions can be carried out successfully when all work in harmony.</p>
   <p>It is expected that yesterday's celebration will be the means of bringing about more friendly relations between our local gymnastic societies.</p>
