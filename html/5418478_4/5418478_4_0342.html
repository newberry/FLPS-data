   <p>The publication describes the history of the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and so long as it describes the Bohemian lifeit is, undoubtedly, a wonderful contribution to the history of American Bohemians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This publication entitled "The Memoirs of the Bohemian Doctor," discusses the history of the Bohemians in America, generally, and in Chicago, particularly and is written by the oldest Bohemian physician in Chicago, Dr. Jan Habenicht.
