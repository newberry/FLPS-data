   <p>In the record of meritorious activities of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) which, with the aid of illustrated lectures, propagates a correct understanding about Bohemians and Bohemia not only among the non-Bohemian elements but chiefly among school children of Bohemian origin, there should be recorded two more successful lectures given in the local public schools. Both of these lectures took place in the so-called Bohemian "California" district, that is, in the McCormick School located at 27th Street and Sawyer Avenue and in the Farragut High School located at 24th Street and Spaulding Avenue. The speakers for these lectures were Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal and Mr. E. St. Vraz.</p>
   <p>The finest pictures from the superb collection of our famous traveler, Mr. E. St. Vraz, were selected and projected upon the screen by means of a very modern stereopticon projector. These pictures were really beautiful, and the children and teachers did not hesitate in expressing their admiration and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>surprise.</p>
   <p>The lecture in the McCormick School began at 11 A.M. The principal of the school, Mr. Chamberlain, introduced Mr. Vraz as a Bohemian and a traveler of world renown and asked the children of Bohemian parentage to greet Mr. Vraz in their native tongue. A very impressive demonstration on the part of the young listeners took place instantly. The children's voices rang out in unison: "Vitame Vas, Pane Vraz!" (We welcome you, Mr. Vraz!) followed by a burst of applause. Mr. Vraz, who was perceptibly moved by the impressive demonstration, spoke a few words in English and Bohemian which surely left a lasting impression with the listeners. He then introduced the main speaker, Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal. Professor Zmrhal, in the course of the one and a quarter hours which had been set aside for the lecture, led his grateful listeners through that earthly paradise of ours lying between Sumava and Snezko, describing its rich and colorful past and its present day cultural life. The lecture was illustrated by about one hundred and fifty scenes. As far as politeness and attention are concerned, the children gathered here could serve as an example <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to many grown-up persons. It was almost 12:30 P.M. when Professor Zmrhal ended his lecture with the showing of several scenes from the Fifth Sokol Slet (Gymnastic Congress). When scenes depicting a veritable sea of Sokols doing close-order drills were shown, the auditorium resounded with almost unceasing applause.</p>
   <p>The second lecture was given in the Farragut High School at 1:30 P.M., and the speakers again addressed a large number of students. The school's spacious auditorium was filled to the last gallery. Here also in the course of the lecture there was manifested the same enthusiasm as was shown in the McCormick School, and the lecture lasted until 3 P.M.</p>
   <p>These lectures were attended by at least one thousand listeners, and it can safely be said the greatest percentage of them were of Bohemian origin. It is an undeniable fact that a good piece of work from the cultural point of view was performed by both lectures on Friday and not only the Educational Department of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada, but the entire Bohemian public can be satisfied with the results.</p>
