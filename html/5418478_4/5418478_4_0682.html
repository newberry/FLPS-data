   <p>A meeting of the Associated Bohemian Liberal Schools of Chicago was held Sunday afternoon, May 21, in the hall of the Bohemian-American School, Lad. Klacel. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Kopecky.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. Communications received were then read, the most important of which was from the local educational society, which explained the much regretted misunderstanding in regard to the teaching strength. After investigation of circumstances, it was decided to allow Miss Doubek to remain in her position, and place Mrs. Vajner in another place soon to be vacated. This unpleasant occurrence should be a warning to all Patronages to see to it that their directors act only according to resolutions.</p>
   <p>A communication from the Bohemian-English school on 18th Street, dealing with the fifteen dollar raise for its teachers, and which they take upon themselves to pay, was accepted with thanks. The Patronage of the Jan Amos Komensky school settled its account for the past three months. The school committee installed Mr. Jeze as teacher in the 4th ward. The committee also is investigating the qualifications of other teacher material.</p>
   <p>A report also was read at this meeting on the theatrical given on March 5, which shows that there was a profit of $109.35 on that occasion. The credit for this success is due to Mrs. Louise Benes, Mrs. Vokouk, and the teacher, Miss E. Jesenska, who dedicated themselves with extraordinary energy to that task, for which they are given general recognition.</p>
   <p>A sub-committee was appointed for a children's festival celebration held on May 21, under the direction of teacher, Mr. Bubenicek.</p>
   <p>Various proposals, tending for the good of the Association, were discussed, which are of importance for those who take an interest in the development of our liberal schools here in Chicago, and which cannot be brought at this time because of their extent. This much I wish to add however. The Association, in the course of its short existence, has evidenced great spiritual strength in the development of our schools, and if it is supported more by the Bohemian public, it can be expected that we will build such schools that we can be proud of them.</p>
