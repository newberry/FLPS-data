   <p>Regardless of whether the accusations made in the Providence Journal against Dr. Frank Iška are well founded or not, the fact remains that the Doctor is not particularly lucky in his demands for damages. His suit against Attorney A. V. Geringer, editor of the Chicago Czech paper Svornost, and another suit against the Česko-Slovanská Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union) and its officers, were both thrown out of court. A similar fate threatens some other court actions begun by him.</p>
   <p>Dr. Iška suffered his most crushing defeat, however, before Judge Samuel A. Trude of the municipal court of this city. It was in this court that the case of Dr. Frank Iška versus the Chicago Herald was tried before a jury.</p>
   <p>As we reported in previous articles, it was the Chicago Herald that reprinted, as the first among the local papers, the revelations made in the Providence Journal against which Dr. Iška originally started action. The court session <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>took one and one-half days, only to result in a ruling that the suit is made up of flimsy charges which cannot be sustained, wherefore the jury was instructed to render a verdict of "not guilty". The defendant newspaper is thus absolved of any responsibility for the statements made in its article. After this decision the court voiced the opinion that any further arguments would be of no avail, because a decision in favor of the complainant would be invalidated by the higher courts.</p>
   <p>When court opened yesterday morning, the judge ruled out statements which Dr. Iška wished to make concerning his occasional appearances as "speaker for the Czech free thought community;" the court permitted the complainant merely to describe to what amount his financial interest was damaged in his occupation as publisher of the Vesmír (Universe). The defendant, therefore, limited his explanations to the following:</p>
   <p>When, on February 27, 1916, the reports about his accepting subsidies from the Austrian Government began to appear in the daily press, his publication, the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Vesmir, had a total of 3,200 subscribers. In order to establish the fact that damage had been done, Attorney Ratkovic read the relevant part of the article published in the Chicago Herald in its Sunday edition of February 27, in which it was contended that Iška drew two hundred dollars a month as a regular subsidy. The complainant's attorney tried to show the jury that the Chicago Herald acted in bad faith by publishing a report which it knew was not based on truth.</p>
   <p>In the following testimony Dr. Iška said he was called on the telephone by somebody from the Herald last Saturday. The voice informed him that an article about his accepting subsidies from the Austrian Government was to appear on the following Sunday, and asked what Dr. Iška had to say about it. Iška answered that he had no contact with the Austrian consul, nor with anyone associated with the Austrian Government, and that, consequently, he was receiving no money. When asked about how he thought a news item such as the one in question could have found its way into the columns, he answered that it might be traced to personal vengeance by his enemies. In the course <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of this conversation over the wire, Iška was asked to name some men who are prominent in the movement for the liberation of the Czechs and Slovaks in Austria. He mentioned several, he said. The judge, however, did not permit him to mention these names in court, because of an objection by Attorney Burnham for the defense.</p>
   <p>Attorney Ratkovič then read the remainder of the Herald report, trying to prove malicious intent; but the judge made a remark which foretold bad news for Iška. The court pointed to the fact that the Herald reprinted the report from the Providence Journal, true enough, but published with it the denial of the charges as made by Iška in the interview over the telephone, so that both sides of the case were shown. On top of this, a second blow was dealt to Iška's case. The court held that the Herald did not accuse Iska of taking a bribe, but that it simply mentioned a subsidy amounting to two hundred dollars per month for Iška's publication, which may be regarded as a token of appreciation of its value, and may even be a compliment.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>These words, uttered by the serious-faced judge, were nevertheless accepted by the listeners with a visible air of humor.</p>
   <p>Anyone, even slightly versed in the business of the courts, knew from then on that Iška's case was hopelessly lost, and that its dismissal was only a matter of time. The court obviously intended to give the complainant full opportunity to bring forth evidence which might strengthen his case, and the session continued.</p>
   <p>Iška was asked where he first read the Herald report.....After some technicalities had been adjusted he was allowed to state that the report was read before the Stráž Osvojenych (a club whose name means "Guard"), on February 27, 1916. The court pointed out that in the file, mention is made of the Herald as "having a large circulation," but not that it is "being subscribed to" and actually read by a certain number of people who, by reading the report in question, might become influenced against the complainant to such a degree that material losses would result.....</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The judge instructed the jury to return a verdict of "not guilty". The attorneys for the complainant decided not to appeal to the higher courts. The suit was filed by the firm Goldzier, Rodger, &amp; Froehlich.</p>
