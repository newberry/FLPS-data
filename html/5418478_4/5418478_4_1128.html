   <p>A great swimming meet was held recently at the well-known Chicago Athletic Association, 12 South Michigan Avenue, in which a large number of contestants participated. According to Mr. Fred A. Hayner, sports editor for the Chicago Daily News, this swimming meet was the greatest ever held in Chicago. We ourselves pay very little attention to sport events. We report such events only when our countrymen, who are active in athletics, become prominent. We are reporting this swimming contest because our Bohemian-American countryman, Dr. Edwin P. Swatek, was awarded first place in this contest by gaining the greatest number of points--2,987, out of a possible 3,000.</p>
   <p>Dr. Swatek, a dental surgeon, has his offices at 25 East Washington Boulevard and lives with his wife and two children at 3305 Sunnyside Avenue, He is American born.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. Swatek comes from an old Bohemian family which settled in the United States a long time ago. His father, Mr. John Swatek, a coal salesman, who resides with his wife and other members of his family at 1514 Sunnyside Avenue, was born in Ceske Budejovice, Bohemia. He himself told us yesterday that his son Edwin became a sport enthusiast during his student days. Swimming became his hobby, and today he is an acknowledged expert. Edwin is thirty-seven years old.</p>
