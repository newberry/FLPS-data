   <p>Bohamian Bicyclists have their own club, and foster their sport with exemplary zealousness, making an excursion to some part of the City every Sunday.</p>
   <p>This affords the members an abundance of sport and refreshment. Some of their excursions are to more distant places, such as Aurora, Elgin, Rockford, Joliet, Milwaukee and Benton Harbor.</p>
   <p>As can be seen, our bicyclists are very active and surely these Sunday excursions are more beneficial to their bodies and souls, than to spend beautiful days at dull play, such as many of our youths prefer.</p>
