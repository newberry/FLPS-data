   <p>Tonight at 8 P. M. at the Svatopluk Cech Park Field House at May and 20th Streets, there will be an exhibit of hats made in the Park by girls who meet there twice a week from 8 to 10 P. M. in order to learn the art of making and trimming hats. The purpose of the exhibition is to show our adolescent girls how they can make profitable use of leisure hours at night by making their own finery instead of wasting time in idleness or in nickelodeons. The Park Management invites all our Bohemian mothers and their daughters to visit this exhibition. They will be agreeably surprised to see the elegant and colorful work of our maidens.</p>
