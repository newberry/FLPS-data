   <p>A series of regular weekly lectures with stereopticon slides was started in the Bohemian Settlement on Centre Avenue last Wednesday night. The Settlement is in charge of the well-known worker in Bohemian national enterprises, Reverend Vaclav Vanek.</p>
   <p>The lectures will now be held regularly every Wednesday at 8 P. M. If we take into consideration the fact that their principal aim is to combat cheap motion-picture theaters, attendance at which is generally recognized as harmful to our youth, we shall certainly admit that this is a worthwhile undertaking.</p>
   <p>The first lecture dealt with American Presidents who were attacked by assassins--Abraham Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and former President Roosevelt. Admission to these lectures is free, but small contributions to the Settlement's charitable work are gratefully accepted.</p>
   <p>The next lecture, on an equally interesting topic, will be held next Wednesday at 8 P. M.</p>
