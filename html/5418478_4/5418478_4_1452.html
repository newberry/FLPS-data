   <p>The committee for the building of the John Huss Memorial in Chicago held one of its regular meetings last night.....</p>
   <p>According to the treasurer's report and information given by Dr. Frantisek Iska over four hundred countrymen in 326 communities throughout the United States have started collecting contributions for the Memorial. Some of them have reported considerable success, and some contributions have been sent in already, so that Dr. Iska was able to place in the hands of the treasurer the amount of $206.15 yesterday.....</p>
   <p>The meeting agreed to pay the taxes on the six lots that had been bought for the Memorial on 22nd Street between 42nd and 43rd Avenues. After a discussion by which the financial status of the committee, the condition of collections, and future prospects were made clear to those present, the committee adopted the proposal of Mr. Jan Pecha to start with the digging of foundations and building the basement wall of the central part of the building up to the street level.</p>
   <p>The idea of competitive bids for this part of the work was dropped because it was hoped that expert contractors would be found who, after reading the newspaper reports on this meeting, will come forward and request the necessary information on which to base their bids which, considering the purpose of the building, it is hoped will be most favorable.....</p>
   <p>The work is expected to start May 12 or shortly thereafter, so that the foundations will be ready for the ceremonial of laying the corner stone July 4, the Sunday before the five hundredth anniversary of the martyr death at the stake of John Huss.....</p>
   <p>Thereafter the discussion of a method of systematic collections for the John Huss Memorial among Chicago's Bohemians was discussed. It was decided that the secretary should compile a mailing list which would be worked on by correspondence and later used for guidance by collecting committees which will be nominated by the plenary meeting of the Ceska Svobodna Obec (Congregation of Bohemian Free Thinkers).</p>
