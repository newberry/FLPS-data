   <p>The request for the establishment of a Bohemian reading-room in our "Pilsen," placed several days ago, together with a petititon carrying the signatures of several hundred Bohemian citizens before the management of the City Library, was favorably accepted in a meeting of the Library Board and referred to the committee on delivery stations. As appears from the following letter, sent by the mangement of the Library to Mr. J. Andel:</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Your letter accompanying the petition in regards to the establishment of a reading-room at 541 Blue Island Ave., was placed before the Board at a meeting held on the 26th of May, which referred it to the committee on delivery stations - William B. Wickersham, Secretary.</p>
   <p>It now depends on what kind of opinion in the matter the committee gives the Library Board at its next meeting.</p>
   
   <p>However, it is possible to expect, that this time the wishes of the Bohemian public will finally he realized, because the committee referred to surely will not find otherwise than is more than entitled to the reading-room.</p>
