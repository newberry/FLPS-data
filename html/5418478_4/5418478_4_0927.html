   <p>Thursday's Bohemian lecture in the Jirka School on 17th Street was successful in every respect, and it would be desirable if such lectures could be held among us more often. Mr. Zmrhal, a teacher in the local public schools, deserves credit for having made a beginning.</p>
   <p>The attendance at the lecture was satisfactory, although we expected a much larger crowd. Mr. Zmrhal worked conscientiously and in his welcoming speech, as well as in the lecture proper, he proved himself to be a talented speaker. With a little more practice, we shall have in Mr. Zmrhal an outstanding speaker, a master of both English andCzech languages. The "Delnicke Sokol" (Workingmen's Gymnasts) Singing Society also participated and was exceptionally well received. Also the music rendered on guitars received deserved applause. We hope, that we will hear the sound of Bohemian songs more often in our public schools and there will be held in our native tongue more of these interesting educational lectures. Mr. Zmrhal will acquire great merit thereby.</p>
