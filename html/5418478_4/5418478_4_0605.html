   <p>The administration of Dvorak Park is trying hard to make the life of Bohemian servant girls in this city more pleasant and successful, particularly during their first years of struggle with conditions which are strange to them and therefore particularly difficult to become adjusted to.</p>
   <p>In order to make a more definite, more efficient effort in this direction, the Sdruzni Ceskych Sluzebnych Devcat (Association of Bohemian Maid Servants) was organized in the Park some short time ago. This Association meets in the field building of the Park every Sunday afternoon. These meetings are held for the purpose of making the girls mutually acquainted, and helping them to spend a few hours in sociable intercourse, good fellowship, and friendship.</p>
   <p>The principal cause of these girls' difficulties along the way to a more agreeable, more abundant life is their lack of knowledge of the English language.</p>

   <p>In order to remedy this situation, the Park director approached Miss Emily Suster, a public school teacher, with the request that she hold a weekly English class in the Park. Miss Suster most kindly agreed, and her acceptance of this duty will no doubt be received with due appreciation. Miss Suster will hold her classes in the Park building every Sunday from 5 to 6 P. M. The instruction will be free, and the Park administration is hoping that the girls will take full advantage of this opportunity to acquire a knowledge of the language of their new homeland.</p>
