   <p>The present management of the Chicago Public Library agreed decisively with the request of Mr. L. W. Kadlec, a very active member of the Library Committee, to order a new supply of Bohemian books for the local library. The committee of the Library, consisting of Messrs Callaghan, Moses and MacMillan, entrusted the order again to August Geringer, and it has been already sent to Prague, Bohemia, to be filled. The Bohemian department in the local library is frequented by the Bohemians very diligently. It serves as a literary home for the Bohemian people.</p>
