   <p>Those enlightened countrymen who attended an entertainment given by Mr. E. Ratajik at 2658 Clifton Park Avenue remembered the Vojta Naprstek School. A total of eight dollars and fifty cents was collected for the benefit of the school.</p>
   <p>The money was sent to the office of this paper, and an authorized official of the school may receive it. Every such case where our countrymen who attends some entertainment and remembers our foremost national institutions by taking up a collection in their behalf is deserving of the heartiest recognition. Such entertainments gain in charm when a patriotic duty is also performed in connection with them.</p>
