   <p>Slavia won her first game yesterday in very hot and humid weather, which made the game rather difficult and tiresome for the players and the spectators. Slavia's victory, however, was not as great as had been expected, because the opposing club had an excellent team, of which only three players were from the former Ogden Park Soccer Club.</p>
   <p>The first half ended two goals to one in favor of Slavia....</p>
   <p>Each team made one goal in the second half.....</p>
