   <p>A significant celebration was held on the Northwest Side yesterday, upon the occasion of the opening by the Gymnastic Union Sokol Cechie of its own new national hall. The hall is to become the center of national life in that part of the city. For this occasion a parade and concert were arranged for the afternoon and a theatrical performance for the evening. The response on the part of the public was so great that "Cechie" can now look cheerfully toward the future with hopefulness, because with favorable support, it can easily carry the heavy burden created by the building of the hall.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian National Club, Osveta, Young Mens Club, Bohemian Workers' Choir, Hlahol, Slovan, and various ladies' branches were present in full strength. Mr. Strnad and Mr. Havel, the builders, were introduced to the public between the acts, and Mr. Strnad took the opportunity to deliver the building to the chairman, Mr. Kristan.</p>
