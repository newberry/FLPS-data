   <p>Our ladies have set an example worth following. The Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood), which held a week's convention in our city, worked tirelessly and zealously for the good of the Jednota, for the furtherance of Free Thought, and the unity of our people. This was appreciated not only by the members of the Jednota, but also by our other great (really the greatest) women's organization--the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union.) The latter organization shows great wisdom in not considering the Jednota a competitor but an ally, and in rejoicing when its good work proves successful.</p>
   <p>To express its feeling of friendship for the Jednota, the Bohemian Ladies' Union arranged a banquet in honor of the Jednota delegates. The event took place yesterday in the Sokol Chicago hall, and its purpose was not only the honoring of the Jednota delegates but all its own diligent workers as well as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>those of the Bohemian Ladies Union. As with everything else undertaken by our ladies, so this banquet, too, was a complete success. Every single detail of it was thoroughly thought out and faultlessly executed. The results of the whole affair were such as to bring great joy to the participants, which, in turn, surely produced enthusiasm of benefit to both organizations. It was a banquet such as one rarely sees. More than six hundred persons sat down at tables which were literally groaning under the weight of the many delicacies which only Bohemian cooks know how to prepare. Not less efficient were the handsome and sprightly maidens who attended to the service; their every move was beautifully purposeful, contributing to the pleasure of the guests.</p>
   <p>As an aesthetic complement to the banquet its musical and other features are worthy of mention. The musical program began with an overture played by the orchestra of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) under the baton of Mr. Rubringer. The youthful musicians bore themselves well, and deserve the applause which greeted their efforts. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>president of the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Ladies' union, Mrs.Brichta, greeted the delegates and all other guests with a hearty address. Other items on the program were a song by....Mrs. Splavec, poems recited by two inmates of the Bohemian Orphanage, a song by Miss Weiner, who was accompanied at the piano by Mrs. Macek, and a dramatic reading by Mr. Bezdek. Mrs. Bohumila Ludvik, as chairman of the entertainment committee, thanked all those whose efforts made this affair a success, and the program ended with a musical number played by the orchestra of the Bohemian Orphanage.</p>
   <p>The last-named institution will also profit by this banquet, a collection having been made, among the guests for its benefit. The amount of the collection was $84.</p>
