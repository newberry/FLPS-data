   <p>A meeting of the John Huss Memorial committee was held in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on 18th Street yesterday. It was opened by Chairman Joseph W. Egermayer with almost all the committee members present. Secretary Leopold Ruzicka read the minutes of the last meeting of the Ceska Svobodna Obec (Bohemian Free Thought Community) as far as they concern the John Huss Memorial. Both records were approved. The reading of letters, sixty of which had reached the committee since its last meeting, absorbed considerable time. The reports of various subcommittees followed. Dr. Iska reports for the press and propaganda committee that the mailing of invitations to the ceremony of laying the cornerstone have been sent out to all Free Thought benevolent societies, both in Chicago and in outside communities throughout the United States and Canada. The mailing of invitations to Bohemian businessmen and well-to-do individuals as well as to organizations will begin this week. Acceptances have been received so far from twenty-eight Chicago societies and lodges which will attend the ceremonies, and which have, so far, donated sums totaling $327. The propaganda work of societies and associations is supplemented by the work of 250 agents in the country whose activity will be intensified during the fall and winter season, when the building of the Memorial will be in progress. Mr. Iska turned over $257 that has come into his hands since the last meeting. His report was received and approved. The building committee submitted plans prepared by Architect A. Charvat and presented their detailed explanation. Three lots will be used by the Memorial, each thirty by one hundred and twenty-five feet. First the foundation of the main front building, will be laid. It will have a fifty-foot front and be forty-two feet deep. The front will be fifteen feet from the sidewalk so that there will be ample space for lawns and flower beds around the whole building. Behind the building a free space of sixty-eight by ninety feet will be reserved for an addition containing a meeting hall. It was agreed to proceed so that by October 17, 1915, when the cornerstone will be laid, the whole foundation will be not only fully excavated but also laid and to finish the main building by the end of May, 1916, so that it may be ready for use by May 30, the anniversary of the day of the burning at the stake of our second martyr, Jeronym Prazsky (Jerome of Prague). Of the plans submitted the committee adopted the one which provides, in the main two-story building, space for a library, a museum, two large offices, and a meeting room which will be used also for advanced classes for our youth and for the instruction of future Bohemian teachers. A committee of three was appointed, consisting of Mr. Egermayer, Mr. Jan Pecha, and Mr. Vojtech Cada, which, in co-operation with Architect Charvat, is authorized to make all necessary arrangements with contractors.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will take place on October 13.</p>
