   <p>Prof. Masaryk, who came to the United States for the purpose of giving a series of lectures at the University of Chicago, made a short stopover in New York and used the opportunity to arrange a lecture for his countrymen. This was given on Sunday afternoon May 11th in the National Hall before a distinguished assembly of countrymen.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk came to America without any boisterous fanfare, but his literary significance is all the more prominent, for reports of his earlier public and teaching activities have been preserved here.</p>
   <p>This probably explains the general interest, which was called forth by Sunday's lecture.</p>
   <p>As was stated in the beginning Professor Masaryk lectured on "The development of Czech socialism since the year 1848."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Although the lecture was started somewhat later than the time it was announced for, the public, appeased by the band's selections, patiently waited until the arrival of the lecturer. When he finally put in an appearance he was welcomed with a veritable storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Before we proceed to the lecture proper, write New York papers-- it will not be amiss, if we take a little notice of the lecturer's person.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk, although he is a man of about fifty-two years of age, at first sight has the appearance of a highly intelligent man. The manner of his appearance is pleasing at first sight. It is neither the appearance of a pessimist nor a fanatic! On the other hand, hardly does he materialize before the eyes of the public, it becomes evident, that we have to do with a man extremely spiritual, who exists in human life spiritually and not at all bodily.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It is not possible to speak here about any measure for the education of this university professor, educated by the highest authorities in the world. At least so far as we are concerned, we consider Professor Masaryk a learned man, which is also evidenced among newspaper opinions.</p>
   <p>In brief, we consider him an authority and even though his views are at odds with the customary views of so called patriots, we have respect for him as a man of science, spiritual strength and extraordinary energy.</p>
   <p>But that is enough of that. Mr. Masaryk's Sunday lecture served only to the honor of his reputation and his name.</p>
   <p>Although he limited himself exclusively to Czech conditions, still his logical deductions influenced everyone so convincingly, that no one was able to disprove them. His easy and readily understood manner of speech had a noticeable influence upon the listeners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The interest of the listeners, who gathered in great numbers because of the fair weather, was lively. Each of those present followed the speaker devotedly, knowing that such occasions are rarely offered them.</p>
   <p>The clear voice of the speaker filled the space of the large hall of the National Building and the simple but massive subject of the lecture was so masterfully carried out that the interest of the listeners was held from beginning to end.</p>
   <p>The lecture summarized in brief is as follows:</p>
   <p>In the prologue the speaker said that he considered it an honor that his first lecture here is in Czech and that he can speak about Czech socialism. About the socialist question he said, "I do not find a more important question in Bohemia. Our people are a nation of workers. There can be no mention of a national aristocracy. The working class create the nation, to speak of that is my purpose.</p>

   <p>"Bohemian lands were and are the jewel of the Austrian Crown. Already in the 17th and 18th centuries they were recognized as the most industrialized lands in Austria. Therefore Bohemian lands, as industrial, were more apt, these others, to incline toward socialism. To be sure, that beginning did not fully develop until after the year 1848 at which time true life first began. Up to that time the people were in serfdom, the Bohemian peasant was a white Slave. However from the year 1848 the people arose with their demands, mainly political.</p>
   <p>"When the Paris revolution spread and overwhelmed Prague, there was assembled in the St. Wenceslaus Baths in Prague on March 11th a congress and here among other things was introduced the demand for the organization of labor. The whole rebellion had a purely socialistic foundation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"There would not have been so many political errors, if the mass of people had been remembered, that is, politics should have been conducted more along democratic lines. However, when the reaction set in, after 1848, neither Bach nor the government wanted to recognize or make use of the gains of the revolution, that is the destruction fudalism. The peasant was free to a certain extent and progress was possible. Absolutism was continued further, but the year 1848 had great social significance, even greater than the political.</p>
   <p>"That the success of socialism was not such as it should have been, can be laid to the fact that it came with the French revolution, it was overwhelming and therefore did not carry out social reform.</p>
   <p>However there were many who began to work on these fundamentals, among them was Klacel, who finished his activities in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In the year 1859 we see an order which takes into consideration the factory workers and in 1869, when constitutionalism was begun it was more than plain, that the question of socialism must be solved and that labor was beginning to organize.</p>
   <p>"La Salle and Marx appeared with doctrines of socialism and their doctrines were accepted. In 1867 when the Austrian constitution gave the right of assembly, there was among workingmen and organizations more interest. However there were no organizers. Labor announced, that it was expelling politics from it's program and that it thinks that the socialist question can be directed by the national-government. However it was soon discovered, that it was impossible to accomplish anything in Austria without politics. Therefore a new motto was adopted: Into Politics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>"A new movement, brought in from Germany, where the doctrines of La Salle and Marx were combined, was introduced into Bohemia and the doctrines of Marx gained supremacy over the doctrines of Bakunin, because socialism is a consistent antagonist of anarchism. Thus there followed two tendencies, anarchism against socialism and socialism against anarchism. In the 80's anarchism was defeated, but socialsim was victorious. Already in 1878 the government provided health insurance and in 1888 accident insurance, in the year 1889 the first political club was organized and in the 90's Bohemian labor stood upon its own feet. In 1897 they organized their own daily paper Pravo Lidu and labor takes notice of and discusses all important questions. The organization of the women is progressing and it is from that time that their developement is figured.</p>
   <p>"It is certain, that the modern movement in Bohemia is socialistic. Even older writings indicate this. Macha, Nemcova, Svetla and others indirectly touched upon socialism. Neruda, Arbes and mainly in the later period Machar, who is considered as the greatest socialist poet, dedicated and still dedicate their powers to it and if literature is the product of the spirit, then Bohemian literature proclaims, that the question is a socialist question. To the little Bohemian man belongs the future!"--</p>
