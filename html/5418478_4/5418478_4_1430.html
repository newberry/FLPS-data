   <p>The building work is progressing rather slowly, and it is not expected that the Memorial Home will be opened to the public before June 1. The cost of the building was estimated at $20,000.</p>
   <p>We have written many times about the Jubilejni Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial), the foundations of which were laid last year. That was a time of jubiliation for not only Czech America but for the whole enlightened world, because we were reminded of the five hundredth anniversary of the death of a martyr, who died for the sake of proclaiming the truth and upholding his convictions, Master John Huss.</p>
   <p>Czech America could not find a better way to celebrate an occasion so dear to all rationalists, than by laying the foundation of a home, which will house men who will honorably fulfill their missions.</p>
   <p>The building will have its site on 22nd Street, between 42nd and 43rd Avenues.</p>
   <p>The work has been progressing ever since the laying of the foundation, we may say that the building will be completed on the estimated date.</p>
   <p>Judging from the finished part, the building will help to beautify the locality.</p>
   <p>The building will contain offices, small workrooms, and a hall where meetings may be held. The hall will also be used as a classroom for students.</p>
   <p>The cost of the building is estimated $20,000, but the entire amount is not on hand at present. The committee still requires a few thousand dollars, but expects to have the balance before the opening celebration.</p>
   
   <p>The John Huss Memorial Home will be in the center of a large garden, because enough space was left for grass plots and flower beds. At the rear of the building, where later a large convention hall will be built, trees will be planted in the early spring. This space will be used in the summer for out-of-door celebrations, and for the holding of peoples councils.</p>
   <p>The dedication exercises will take place the first Sunday after May 30, when it will be exactly five hundred years since Jeronym Prazky (Jerome of Praha) followed his great teacher John Huss to the funeral pyre. Both of these men laid down their lives for their convictions.</p>
   <p>We will carry out the decision which won for us the interest and assistance not only of the Czech Freethinkers in Chicago, where the memorial will be located, but of Czechs throughout the United States, because practically one half of the funds needed came down from the country districts.</p>
   <p>Six thousand dollars are still needed to cover the cost of the building, which the Ceska Svobodna Obec v Americe (Czech Free Thought Community of America) expects to collect from enthusiasts in the country districts, and from well-to-do countrymen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Svobodna Obec v Americe (The Czech Free Thought Community of America) has been asked to take charge of this great project--the building of this great Czech community center--by the unaninous vote of all interested Czech rationalist societies, and it accepted the responsibility.</p>
   <p>The committee for the building of the Jubilejni Husuv Dum is composed of members elected by the Svobodna Obec, and representatives of the participating societies. The officers of the committee are: chairman Mr. Josef W. Egermayer; vice-chairman, Mr. Alex Purer; secretary; Mr. Karel Kavalle; treasurer, Mr. Jan Cizovsky. The following gentlemen have been chosen as members of the building committee: Josef W. Egermayer, Jan Pecha, Alex Purer, Frantisek Masek, Vaclav Soukenik, and Dr. Iska. This committee meets as often as business requires, in the Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) hall on West 18th Street.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Svobodna Obec will issue a memorial booklet, which will show the names of all donors arranged alphabetically. Through the efforts of these donors, a building will be erected which will reflect honor upon us. It will be beneficial to those who will follow us in the footsteps of our great martyr, who is recognized and honored by all educated people the world over as a harbinger of a new, better, stronger, and healthier era.</p>
