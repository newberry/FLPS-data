   <p>Today the Denni Hlasatel is inaugurating its twenty-fourth year of publication. At this opportunity we may look with pride at the work accomplished in the past, and face the future with great expectations.</p>
   <p>The future will surely bring additional work, but with it the recognition and the good will of the public, which are the most valuable rewards a newspaper can receive.</p>
   <p>For almost a quarter of a century our newspaper protected the interests of the Bohemian-American people, especially the workers; it urged the people to live in good relations with their neighbors; it offered, suggestions and information which, while keeping this American branch of our nation strong and healthy, would help in making our people into desirable citizens of this new fatherland.</p>
   <p>In addition to this our newspaper endeavors to include many interesting, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>well-investigated daily reports; it sees to it that its readers get entertaining articles and well-selected stories. This policy has put our paper into the foremost ranks and made it the most read and most popular Bohemian daily.</p>
   <p>The management and editorial staff will exert their efforts not only to maintain, but to increase the popularity of our paper during the coming year.</p>
