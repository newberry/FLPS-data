   <p>Mr. Frank Horlivý, well-known Bohemian dramatic artist of Chicago and a member of the Ludvíkovo Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvík's Dramatic Association), will depart for Slovakia during the first part of May to be a director and stage manager for a new film corporation in order to produce several moving pictures about Slovakian life which will be shown in America later on. First of all, the well-known Slovakian drama, "Janošík," in which Mr. F. Horlivý played the title role in the Chicago production, will be made.</p>
   <p>In order to make these pictures perfect, it is necessary to take them in Slovakia itself, and that is the reason why Mr. Horlivý is going over there as director and stage manager of a local film company, the Tatra Film Corporation. In addition to these great plays, the interesting scenery of Slovakia and various pictures from the life of the Slovakian people will be taken, which surely will be something new for America.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Horlivý will be accompanied by two film experts and photographers who have worked for one of the foremost film corporations in America. Therefore, the production will be in the hands of an able and experienced stage manager and experts, who will do their best with all technical problems. Mr. Horlivý will remain in Slovakia for a period of about three months. He will be back at home before the beginning of the theatrical season this fall, so that he can again devote himself to his histrionic profession.</p>
   <p>Thanks to Mr. Horlivý's proven abilities and his histrionic experiences, one may surely expect a brilliant success of his new undertaking.</p>
