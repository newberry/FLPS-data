   <p>P.2, Col.3--For many years the Patronat Home and Nursery, supported the Saturday and Sunday Schools at 1813 So. Ashland Ave., and for three years now, has successfully supported the evening school for children of matured age.</p>
   <p>The school is exceptionally convenient for those who are not able to attend the Bohemian School, or for those who have attended Saturday School and wish to advance themselves in the Bohemian language.</p>
   <p>It will do all in it's power to endeavor to interest the children in acquiring love for the Bohemian language and National art.</p>
   <p>The Patronat hopes that the parents will not neglect to take advantage of this precious opportunity to have their children attend this school.</p>
   <p>Teaching classes will be held every Tuesday from 7 to 9 o'clock in the evening, for a contribution of the sum of 15 cents monthly.</p>
   <p>Application may be made to the teacher, Miss Zdenka Kolar, at the premises of the school, 1831 So. Ashland Ave.</p>
