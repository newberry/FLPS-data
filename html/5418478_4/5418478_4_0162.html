   <p>Hardly a day passes that the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar does not receive a letter from some out-of-town countryman, complaining that the local papers openly take the side of the Germans, and requesting the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar to send these papers a letter or an article which would stop their bias.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar welcomes such letters as evidence that our countrymen are noticing the attitude of American dailies, and it is doing all in its power to comply with their requests. Just at this time, the Bureau is preparing an article which will be mailed by an addressing agency to all <span class="page-break">\2</span>American dailies. This article fully explains the point of view of the Slavs, and particularly the Austrian Slavs, in the present struggle.</p>
   <p>In this, the Bureau is keeping in mind the proclamation of the President of the United States, requesting strict neutrality and warning against the stirring up of national hatred. The Bureau's action is principally directed against the German press which, disregarding the fact that the foremost German organizations in the country have agreed to comply with the President's request, continues to attack the Slavs not only in its own papers, but never misses an opportunity to do so in the English language papers as well.</p>
   <p>The remarkable aspect of it is that the Germans believe they are being wronged, and all they are having published in the American papers in order to clarify their point of view is being done only in self-defense against the abuse that is being meted out to them from all sides.</p>
   <p>In reality, and taking Chicago newspapers as a criterion, it is the Slavs <span class="page-break">\3</span>who are in error if they think that the American newspapers are partial to the Germans. The truth is that these newspapers are accepting polemical or informational articles from the Germans rather than from the Slavs. But here it must also be borne in mind that the English and French frequently come forth with their own contributions, and these contributions are, as a rule, quite merciless to the Germans. For instance, the sensational article by H. G. Wells which aims to prove that the only cause of the war, and the principal element disturbing world peace, is Prussian militarism and imperialism, and that only after a thorough defeat of Germany and the division of Austria into its national units will it be possible to keep the desired order in Europe, has gone through the entire American press and outweighs hundreds of articles written by the editors of the New York or Chicago Staats-Zeitung. The statement of the Chicago French Consul, Baron Laurent, that France is not fighting against Germany, but for Germany, in order to rid it of the oppressive burden of imperialism, and for the whole of Europe, which is being menaced by the German system, was reprinted by many out-of-town papers.</p>
   <p>Besides this, practically all news originating in Europe is unfavorable to <span class="page-break">\4</span>Germany, not excluding the reports of German victories. Hardly a day passes that American newspapers do not carry articles about occurrences in which the Germans have demonstrated how bloodthirsty, cruel, rough, and merciless they are, and how they are violating all agreements, treaties, and rules. Also, the tales of Americans returning from Europe are seldom favorable to Germany, and all agree that Germany's state of preparedness plainly shows who has brought about the war. To this, we must add editorials in leading American newspapers in the country which plainly blame Germany for the present murdering and state that the war must end with the fall of German imperialism with the Kaiser at its head.</p>
   <p>The Germans in New York have so resented the outspoken language of the editorials of the large papers that they called a huge indignation meeting against "biased newspapers" and agreed in this meeting to publish a periodical in English which would defend their viewpoint. This periodical is appearing in New York under the name Fatherland, and its boastful chauvinism is ridiculed by all serious pressmen in the country. On August 27 the Chicago Tribune <span class="page-break">\5</span>pointed out in an editorial the absurdity of such pro-German propaganda and suggested to the Fatherland not to aspire to be taken seriously when it writes trash, such as the article saying that the French Army is composed mostly of Arabs and other African soldiers. In the same article, the Tribune gave recognition to the fairness of the American Slavs, admitting that they are complying without any unnecessary ado with President Wilson's desire, and that they, though numerically and politically an important element, maintain an exemplary reservedness and restraint, and, with the exception of a protest against being called "barbarians," they abstain from all public manifestations.</p>
   <p>On August 28 the Tribune predicted that there must be a turn and that the Germans will finally be vanquished by the Allies, especially by England on the one side and Russia on the other, even if their [German] present military successes should conquer all battlefields. All this naturally causes a mood of desperation in local German patriots, which results in innumerable letters to the American press.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>On August 11 the Česko-Americká Tisková Kancelář, together with the Česko-Americká Národní Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), in a letter to the editor of the Chicago Examiner, declared that his newspaper is not just to the Slavs and favors the Germans. Mr. Chas. Michelson, the editor of the paper, replied with a long letter, in one part of which he says:</p>
   <p>"In times like these, it is not at all surprising that the countrymen of some of the warring European nations believe that one group is receiving fairer treatment than the other. We assure you that we have been receiving many more condemnations from Germans, who complain that we hardly ever publish anything but anti-German news, than from your countrymen, who complain about partiality.</p>
   <p>"On August 27 the Examiner published an article by Mr. Ludwig Ripp which starts as follows: 'In the name of justice, and in the name of every citizen of German origin, I, as such, protest most vigorously against the shameless, obnoxious lies in all news from the battlefields furnished to the people of the United States by England, etc.'</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"The Chicago Herald has been receiving a deluge of letters, such as this written by Reverend C. Pobb of Charlotte, Iowa: 'What devil causes you to publish in the name of decency and truth such infernal lies as I find in your today's issue--lies which you will have to retract tomorrow? How dare you maintain that the Herald is an impartial newspaper? Is this not proof that your paper also belongs to the majority of English language papers in this country which are under the influence of England, or perhaps even in the pay of the perfidious Albion, etc?'</p>
   <p>"Another letter: 'To the Editor of the Herald: Please advise your agent in Hammond, Indiana, to discontinue delivering your yellow journal, whose subscriber I have been for many years.</p>
   <p>"'E. W. Andree, President of United</p>
   <p>German Associations in Hammond, Indiana.'</p>
   <p>("The blood of the son of Germania started boiling in this way when he read an article in which the German Kaiser is painted as a new Nero.")</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>And thus it seems to be with all American newspapers. The Germans are much more dissatisfied with the spirit of news and articles than we Slavs, and they have reason to be. For us it is, of course, somewhat of a satisfaction to observe the faces they make while swallowing the kind of medicine they have been administering to us for years.</p>
   <p>The times, however, are much too grave to permit merrymaking at the expense of our enemy. In these times, so propitious for such national propaganda as we have in mind, where publications otherwise rather indifferent to our cause are comparatively accessible for our informative articles, the Česko-Americká Tisková Kancelář will put forth every possible effort to gain friends for our Slavic interests, and it urges all our countrymen to use every opportunity for organizing collections and to keep on contributing funds for those who suffer in the old country, where such a great deal of help is so badly needed.</p>
