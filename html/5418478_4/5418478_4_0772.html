   <p>Last Sunday, in Chicago, there was started a new Sunday School to teach children the Bohemian language.</p>
   <p>The class room was fitted out by generous minded citizens of the 6th Ward. There was an immediate enrollment of (50) fifty children. Mr. August Geringer is the teacher.</p>
   <p>The Northwest side Sunday School, which is under the supervision of Mr. Reisla and Mr. Volenske is progressing rapidly and has bright prospects for the future.</p>
