   <p>Beginning tomorrow the printing of the Denni Hlasatel will be delayed a couple of hours. A wish to bring our daily newspaper to perfection is the only reason which led us to this decision. By doing so we shall be able to print the latest general news and the latest news from our Bohemian circles. We also will be able to publish advertisements which are received by us early in the morning, and in many other ways we shall be able to comply with the requirements of our readers and patrons. Therefore, we beg our subscribers to accept our good intentions, and we beg for their continuous support of our efforts, because our only interest is to place before them a newspaper which, considering the possibilities, will be almost perfect.</p>
