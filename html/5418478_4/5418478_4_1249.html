   <p>It is no more than three years ago that initiative was given to the foundation of a Sokol unit in the young, but rapidly growing Bohemian community of Morton Park. The unit adopted the name of the keen journalist and one of the most progressive Bohemian Americans of all times, Karel Jonas.</p>
   <p>Soon after its foundation, the Sokol Karel Jonas became a member of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Sokol Association) and started developing quiet but persevering activities in the gymnastic and patriotic field. After three years of this, it gave a public exhibition of its results yesterday.</p>
   <p>This was on the festive occasion of the laying of the cornerstone of its own gymnasium, a building which will be not only a modern Sokol structure, but also a stately national shrine for the promising Bohemian colony in Morton Park.</p>
   <p>The cornerstone celebration of Sokol Karel Jonas was one of the events to which <span class="page-break">2</span>a lively public interest and co-operation of the many members of the community impart the character of a national endeavor. It may be said without overstatement that all of Morton Park participated in yesterday's festival.</p>
   <p>A large majority of the buildings were richly decorated with garlands and flags in national colors, and the streets through which the parade that preceded the ceremonies marched were crowded with people. An important contribution to the success of the celebration was the large attendance of brother members of many other Sokol units and Bohemian societies. The charms of an afternoon, when the departing summer does all it can to impress on us what we are losing when it says good-bye, added to the afternoon's success.</p>
   <p>Such was the setting of the event marking the goal toward which the Sokol Karel Jonas, with its 157 members, has been working for the last three years.</p>
