   <p>The Farragut Public Grammar School's social center has arranged an educational program for our noncitizen countrymen on Friday, April 30. The evening will be devoted to all those who are preparing themselves for the citizenship examinations. With the aid of moving pictures they will see the procedure by which foreigners become citizens, how applicants for second citizenship papers and their witnesses are tested and examined, etc. Every noncitizen should see this picture. A regular examination of one of the pupils from the citizenship class will be held on the stage by a representative of the naturalization bureau.</p>
   <p>Otto T. Pergler, well-known Bohemian national worker, will speak on the subject: "Why Every Foreigner Should Become an American Citizen." Admission is free, and since the Farragut assembly hall can accommodate only about seven hundred people, it is necessary for every non-citizen to be there before the specified time. The Farragut Public School is located <span class="page-break">2</span>at Spaulding Avenue and Twenty-fourth Street. The program will start at 8 P. M.</p>
