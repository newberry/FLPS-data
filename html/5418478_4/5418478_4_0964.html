   <p>Our foremost Bohemian sport club, Sparta Union, achieved a high rank when placed in the first division of the Chicago Football League. This recognition accorded Bohemian sport is most heartening and our Czech public will surely receive the news with much pleasure. There is no doubt that this recognition has great significance both as regards Bohemian sport events and the Bohemian people generally. First class matches are thus assured the teams of the Sparta Union whose efficiency will be increased thereby. It is to be expected that the manager of the first team, Mr. J. Krejcha, will send only the top-ranking men on the field, men who will, after several matches, be able to face the strongest opponents.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian public, which so often in the past attended events in great numbers on other and foreign athletic fields, will now have the best possible opportunity to witness a game on a Czech athletic field. The following teams now belong <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the said first division: Pullman, Harvey, North Shore, British Legion of America, the Gary Young Mens' Hebrew Association, the 102nd Field Artillery, and the Sparta Union. The second team of Sparta has been placed in the first division of the International League, and the third team the second division of the same league. The Sparta Union club will start the season off this coming Sunday on its own field, thanks to the efforts of the Alderman Anton J. Cermak, who is a great friend of sports. The first game of the season will be played by the second team of the Sparta against Jugo-Slavia at 1:30 P.M. on Sunday, and at 3 P.M. the first team will meet the famous Harvey team. The first team, which won the championship in the International League last year, has decided to repeat the performance in its new division. Our boys know very well the strength of their rivals whom they are to meet next Sunday; they will be compelled to play according to higher standards if they are to compete with any hope of victory. The Sparta Union is going to do its utmost to gain such a victory; the match is going to be tough but interesting. We anticipate a record attendance at the Sparta field due to the great interest aroused among the Bohemians who wish to see how their own team will meet the Harvey team. The field is located on</p>
