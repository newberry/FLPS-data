   <p>The great American sport finds many participants among our countrymen so that we have each year several baseball clubs. Last year, however, Bohemian ball players complained that Svornost did not carry reports of their games in the same manner that the English newspapers did of the play of American Clubs.</p>
   <p>In order to overcome this apparent misunderstanding we wish to remind our Bohemian Athletes that we gladly publish any such report about the games as is given us. We are willing to dedicate space in our paper for our ball players the same as the other papers, when the results of games are sent to us in time for publication.</p>
