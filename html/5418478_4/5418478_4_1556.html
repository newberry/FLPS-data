   <p>For the Karel Havlicek Borovsky monument unveiling ceremonies, it will be necessary to thoroughly and minutely inform the public about who Havlicek was. At least, we notice interest about the monument among strangers. People, unfamiliar with the Bohemian language, who stop in Douglas Park to examine the monument, and eagarly inquire about it. When the time of unveiling the monument has arrived, it will be necessary to give the English newspaper a complete biography of Havlicek, and chiefly an evaluation of his activities and influence. The Bohemian-American Press Bureau could start working toward that end now.</p>
