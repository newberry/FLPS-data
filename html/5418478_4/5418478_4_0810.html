   <p>An interesting lecture, which was attended by 2,500 students, was held in the large assembly hall of Harrison High School, last Friday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. P. Pecival, president of the Czechoslovak National Alliance, was the speaker. At the request of the principal of Harrison High School, Dr. Pecival spoke on "The Future of the Bohemian Nation". This is Dr. J. P. Pecival's third lecture within a short period before American youngsters, and surely it is of great significance that the American people are informed about us.</p>
