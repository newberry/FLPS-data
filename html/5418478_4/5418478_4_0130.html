   <p>The first day of May is a most memorable one for the Denni Hlasatel, its readers and friends. It was on that day in 1891 that the Czech newspapermen and editors who were in the vanguard of a fight for better living conditions organized and founded the Denni Hlasatel. From humble beginnings, but supported by Czech labor and the public, both morally and materially, and with well-managed economy, it was possible to develop this newspaper so that today it is the largest and best liked daily in Czechoslovak-America.</p>
   <p>When we look back at the thirty-one years just passed, we cannot but feel grateful to our Czech countrymen for their hearty support, and at the same time we express the wish for a continuation of it. As far as we are concerned, we will show ourselves worthy of their confidence by discharging the duties <span class="page-break">\2</span>which we have assumed toward the Czechoslovak people in America; we wish to continue to point the way toward a real American citizenship and a loyalty toward that nation which gave us our us our origin. We wish to continue to point to those ideals held by labor and humanity. And while doing so we shall continue to work for the betterment of our paper, to strive so that its high tone, the wealth of its news and other reading matter may continue to remain a source of interesting and educational reading.</p>
   <p>With such a program we hope that our thirty-second volume will be equally successful as all of its predecessors have been, and that it will become a forerunner of innumerable volumes to come.</p>
   <p>With an expression of our deepest respect, we are</p>
   <p>The publishers of the Denni Hlasatel.</p>
