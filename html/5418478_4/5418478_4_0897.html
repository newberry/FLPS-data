   <p>Mr. Dongres' lecture was so well attended yesterday that even the space between the seats and the walls of the large auditorium in Dvorak Park was completely filled, and the younger people of the audience had to sit on the floor in the front of the hall, right up to the speaker's platform. Mr. Dongres showed a beautiful collection of photographs of mountain lakes, and national parks in the heart of the California Sierras. These photographs were lent him by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Another showing of these slides will take place next Wednesday, December 11, in the Bohemian Settlement on Center Street, between 18th and 19th Streets. Yesterday's huge attendance proved again the popularity of travelogues with our public.....</p>
