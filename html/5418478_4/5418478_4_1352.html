   <p>Soon there will not be a team in the National or the American Baseball League, in which there will not be a Czech. In order to strengthen their weakened position, the Cubs have secured a countryman of ours, Mr. Slapnicka. Mr. Slapnicka probably will not participate in any games this season, but we hope that he will be of considerable assistance next season, so that the Chicago team may regain the championship of the National League, which seems to be hopelessly lost this year.</p>
   <p>Mr. Slapnicka was a member of the Rockford ball team which belongs in the Wisconsin-Illinois League. Of the twenty-eight games in which he pitched, he won twenty-four for his team. He is to report to the Cubs for duty next week.</p>
