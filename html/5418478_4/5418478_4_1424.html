   <p>Large contingents from our Sokol societies and an immense gathering of Czech-Americans will appear before the monument in Douglas Park today to pay homage to that great protagonist of Czech liberty, Karel Havlicek-Borovsky. This year's celebration will be more significant than ever before, for our people are nearing the realization of Havlicek's fondest hopes and purest ideals, and they will therefore, be able to grasp more perfectly the meaning of his efforts. Today Chicagoans of Czech descent will undertake the pilgrimage to draw new hope and gather strength for the struggle for the liberation of our people from the claws of the Hapsburgs.</p>
   <p>The commemoration, as in previous years, will be held under the auspices of our Sokol societies. Every Czech in Chicago should appear at the memorial services and thus demonstrate his patriotism. The main speaker will be Dr. J. Rudis-Jicinsky, one of the best known, selfless workers of the Sokol community.....</p>
