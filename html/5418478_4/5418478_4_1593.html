   <p>On the premises of the Bohemian-English Liberal School on 18th Street, there was held a meeting yesterday afternoon, at which time a report was made by the temporary committee on preliminary arrangements for the purpose of providing a suitable memorial for our national martyr, Jan Hus.</p>
   <p>The objective which some of our citizens have decided upon is surely noble and it is regretted that many of our prominent citizens who could effectively work for the accomplishment of this purpose have thus far remained aloof. We hope that the present movement will not die out before the purpose is definitely accomplished.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to order by the temporary chairman, Mr. J. Vilimovsky and the committee-shairman, Mr. J.V. Matejka reported on previous efforts of the committee. He also mentioned the sending of telegrams to Bohemia and recommended the appointment of a permanent committee and a committee for the collection of contributions and the issuance of a suitable proclamation to be published in the English papers.</p>

   <p>The report was accepted, following which there developed a debate as to the best method to establish a permanent committee. Citizen Pondelicek moved that our various lodges be requested to send delegates, as only in that manner would the objective be successfully carried out, when the committee is set up as is the committee for the construction of the memorial to the Bohemian Veterans. The motion was resisted by citizen Matejka, who asked that the committee be appointed immediately. The majority being in favor of this, there was named a committee of twenty-five. Some of the speakers advanced the opinion that if the fulfillment of the entire purpose were left up to our Liberal Thought Societies, the entire Bohemian population of Chicago would not be able to take part. We must differ with them.</p>
   <p>Our nationalistic efforts are centered in our Lodges--they are at the focus of our national life. Whatever good our Lodges have thus far accomplished, they have done for the benefit of all Chicago Bohemians--of this we have an example in the National Cemetery, and they would do likewise in this purpose.</p>

   <p>The Lodges will have to be called on for aid in the matter eventually and it is our opinion that it would be very tactful, if we expect to receive any help from this source in the successful accomplishment of our objective, to invite them to work with us from the very beginning.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Novak--contributed fifty dollars toward the memorial. Mr. Vanek, the secretary, gave some of those present credentials for the cellection of contributions and the gathering disbursed.</p>
