   <p>Some time ago the Chicago Daily Tribune began publishing the translations of editorials of some of our local foreign-language newspapers. It is satisfied that with one exception, all of them were loyal to America, in fact, that there can be no doubt about their loyalty. The Chicago Daily Tribune made this fact known in one of its editorials, saying that all of our Chicago foreign-language newspapers, with one exception, show a proper interest in American ideals, and that they perform an important piece of work among its people who otherwise would have no opportunity to become acquainted with our American way of life and our institutions.</p>
   <p>It is certainly heartening to know that a foremost American local daily appreciates the efforts of the foreign-language press and its endeavors to further good American citizenship.</p>
