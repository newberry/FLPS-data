   <p>In these times of war parents should consider it their duty to see that their children have contact with their mother tongue as well as some mental recreation after school. These two opportunities present themselves in the Ceský Delnický Pevecký Sbor [Czech Workmen's Singing Society]. This club conducts a singing school under the direction of that excellent musician, Mr. J. Houdek. Parents may come and hear the progress made by the pupils either on Sundays or during the school hours. The location of the club's headquarters is 1721 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
