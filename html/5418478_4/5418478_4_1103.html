   <p>The capability of our sokols was again confirmed yesterday evening at the Pilsen Sokol Hall where the annual contests of the International Gymnastic Union were held under the direction of the well-known and popular Sokol instructor, Mr. Frank Paul. In this international competition, our boys again easily carried away the laurels. The contests, which started at 7 P. M., ended with the following results:</p>
   <p>First prize of class A was won by the team of the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Plzen (Sokol Pilsen Gymnastic Association of Chicago), which team gained 420 7/10 points; first prize of class B was won by the Lincoln Turnverein. [Names and scores of individual winners are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The attendance was satisfactory, and more than fifty men took part in these contests. The arrangements committee consisted of J. Nemec, E. Schubel, H. Berz, J. Matejka and Forst.</p>
