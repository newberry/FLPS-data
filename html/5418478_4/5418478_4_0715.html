   <p>P. 4--We Chicago Bohemians are expanding satisfactorily. Our wealth is visibly increasing, and the apprehension about our national existence is receding more and more. Our knowledge is increasing, and Bohemian business and industry are increasing; in fact, if we compare the past with the present, we find that we have steadily progressed, and that the fears which many had expressed have proved to be groundless. Yes, our wealth is increasing, and with it our power increases also.</p>
   <p>Now we have repeatedly rejoiced over the success of the Bohemian school, this national institution of ours which has reared for us many loyal and sincere Bohemians. The Vojta Naprstek Bohemian School in "Bohemian California" has provided us more than once with reasons for hearty rejoicing. This school has been developed from small beginnings; many difficulties had to be overcome, and it often seemed as if all the sacrifice, the efforts, and the labor of individuals enthusiastic for a good cause would be in vain. However, thanks to those brave people who concerned themselves with the <span class="page-break">2</span>Vojta Naprstek School, it not only has survived but has acquired prestige and is the pride of Chicago Bohemians to-day.</p>
   <p>We have abundant proof of the esteem in which it is held by the Bohemians in "California." This is indeed good; they are justified in their pride, and it should be so everywhere, not only in Bohemian California. What a joy it must be for the father of a Bohemian family when he comes home from work, and his child reads a Bohemian newspaper or book to him! With what pride must the breast of a Bohemian father swell when the son, born and educated here, tells him of the glory of the Bohemian nation, pictures the battles and suffering of the Bohemian people for truth and justice, and with radiant eyes promises that he also will be such a Bohemian,--that he also is ready to do for his people everything that national duty commands!</p>
   <p>Children learn this in the Bohemian school; this is being taught in the Vojta Naprstek School in Bohemian California. Is it any wonder that this <span class="page-break">3</span>school is loved, that Bohemian parents are ready to make every sacrifice for the school? Only this made it possible for the sponsors of the Vojta Naprstek School to purchase a valuable piece of property at Homan Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street, where a building will be erected as soon as possible for a national school, a Bohemian school.</p>
   <p>We are expanding satisfactorily, and our wealth is visibly increasing.</p>
