   <p>Mr. Kenneth Miller, a native American, who is active as an assistant to the Reverend Doctor V. Pisek in New York, came to Chicago a few days ago for a short visit. He is returning from Texas where he stopped at eighteen communities of a strong Czech population. The main purpose of his travels is the formation and extension of branches of the Bohemian National Alliance. He succeeded in founding four groups in Texas. On his tours, which he finances himself, he collected up to $250 for the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Though a born New Yorker, Mr. Miller speaks and writes the Czech language perfectly. He acquired this knowledge during a sojourn in Moravia. Being financed by a scholarship there, he studied the country. While traveling in Moravia and Bohemia, he learned to know, to love, and to respect the Czechs. Mr. Miller studied at the Princeton University, where President <span class="page-break">\2</span>Woodrow Wilson was at that time active, and one of his teachers. He later continued studying theology in New York. On the strength of his particular knowledge of the Czech element, he is in a position to frequently deliver lectures on the subject, highly appreciating the interest of American audiences. He expects to hold one lecture for the general public upon his visit to Chicago next fall. He will then travel through the West where he is engaged for a considerable number of public appearances. He did not stay long in Chicago this time, having left last night for New York.</p>
