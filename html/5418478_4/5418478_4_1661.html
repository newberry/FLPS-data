   <p>At a surprise party organized in honor of Dr. O. F. Jelinek and his wife Blanche, who have moved from their residence at 1855 South Millard Avenue to Wilmette, Illinois, our charitable organizations were remembered, and a branch of the Mysticky Spolek (Mystic Society) was organized. The nucleus of the Spolek was formed in Peoria, Illinois, at the time of the convention of the federation of aid societies held in that city. Fifteen new members were received at the aforementioned party, each of whom paid [the initiation fee of] one dollar. Of the amount [thus received] $7.50 was given to the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and an equal sum to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa (Saint Joseph's Orphanage [at Lisle, Illinois]). The gift which is to go to the Utulna was deposited with us by Mr. W. K. Pflaum.</p>
