   <p>Following are the minutes of the regular meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago), held May 18, 1921:</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Joseph Tichava, in the presence of all the officers and a large number of the delegates. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. Then followed the reading of the minutes of the meeting of the executive committee which also were approved as read.</p>
   <p>The chairman reported that he had overheard a remark to the effect that the delegates assembled in a regular meeting have nothing to do with the minutes of the meetings of the executive committee, and that they have no authority to <span class="page-break">2</span>pass any decision upon the same. But that, he said, is absolutely unthinkable because only in the regular meetings of the delegates may any change regarding the expenditures, etc., be decided upon. All these changes may be proposed and worked out only in the meetings of the executive committee and then presented in the regular meetings of the delegates where they are either approved or rejected, for only in the regular meeting of the delegates may any changes be decided upon, and only in the regular meeting may financial questions concerning the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol be authenticated. The explanation of the chairman was accepted by the delegates.</p>
   <p>The motion of Mrs. Radesinsky, who is willing to ask the Dramaticka Jednota (Bohemian Dramatic Association of Chicago) to arrange a theatrical performance for the benefit of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol, was carried, and Mrs. Radesinsky was authorized to ask the said Jednota to donate the net proceeds of the one theatrical performance to the above-mentioned purpose.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Dr. Antonin Mueller, reported that the treasury of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol is almost empty, and that he does not know if he <span class="page-break">3</span>will have enough cash on hand to pay the salaries of the teachers at the end of this month. He also censured the teachers and said that they should teach the children along such lines as to enable the pupils to acquire a better perspective for their future life. He also complained that the Svobodna Skola (Free School), a periodical, is full of fairy tales, and that more care should be taken that the material in the Svobodna Skola be more useful and more educational.</p>
   <p>A report on the conference of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America) followed. At the conference of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, held May 30, 1921, it was resolved that the entire, net proceeds of the freethinkers festival, which is being arranged for July 3, 1921, and one half of the net proceeds of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych 1921 (National Tax of Bohemian Freethinkers for 1921) be donated to the Bohemian free thought schools, provided that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol will refuse to arrange the Posvicenska Slavnost (Countrywake Festival) on August 21, in co-operation with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v America (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America).</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav Vohralik, member of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, inquired if two delegates of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych will be accepted, and deposited the sum of ten dollars as the initial fee. He further asked the chairman for the privilege of the floor, and his request was granted. He then expressed himself as follows: The Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol asked the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe for aid, and with the aid of this organization it intends to arrange a Posvicenska Slavnost. This action of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol is not approved by the Svaz Svobodomyslnych. The Bohemian free thought schools should not accept support from religious societies and national organizations, but, in the first place, should seek the aid of Bohemian freethinkers who have always built and supported the schools.</p>
   <p>The title itself, the "Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol," plainly shows that the Bohemian free thought schools should seek aid from the Svaz Svobodomyslnych and from the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni which has no intention of helping the schools, but is figuring that with the help of the Bohemian free thought <span class="page-break">5</span>schools the existence of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni could be prolonged. Mr. Vohralik further requested the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol to arrange its own Posvicenska Slavnost and to interrupt its connections with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
   <p>The chairman then took the floor and, regarding the matter of the Posvicenska Slavnost, replied as follows:</p>
   <p>"The delegates to the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol, in one of their meetings, instructed me to induce the Svaz Svobodomyslnych to donate a part of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych 1920 for the benefit of the Bohemian free thought schools. But in the meeting of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, it was resolved to use the collected money for the propagation of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), a free thought periodical. In that meeting I explained that we were expecting that part of the collected money would be donated for the benefit of our schools, but no attention was given to my appeal. Later on, at the second meeting of <span class="page-break">6</span>the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, Mr. V. Petrzelka expressed a wish that the children in our schools must be instructed only along the line of free thought. I explained again that more money is needed, and that without money we can do nothing. But no one moved to say: 'Let us appropriate some money for the benefit of the schools and help them out'. Afterwards I was requested to find out if the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni would be willing to help. In the name of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol, I appealed to the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni for aid. I was told that no financial aid could be given, but an arrangement will be made to benefit the schools. First, it was agreed to arrange a bazaar for the benefit of the schools. But not being able to secure a hall, it was finally decided to donate the proceeds of the Posvicenska Slavnost to the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol. The fault, therefore, does not lie with us but the Svaz Svobodomyslnych. If the Svaz is willing to take care of the schools now, why did it not take care of them at that time? The Svaz Svobodomyslnych must have known about the Posvicenska Slavnost a long time ago because the matter has been under negotiation since December of last year. The Svaz Svobodomyslnych did not take care of the schools during the <span class="page-break">7</span>period of the World War until now and, therefore, it has no right to encroach upon this Posvicenska Slavnost, which will be arranged for the benefit of the free thought schools, because it is too late now. But I urge Mr. Vohralik to work and see to it that plenty of money be made at the freethinkers festival, which will be held July 3, because the free thought schools are in need of money and will always be thankful to the Svaz Svobodomyslnych for any contribution."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dobias then took the floor and spoke as follows: "It is too late now to make any changes because the preparatory work for the Posvicenska Slavnost is in full swing. The school children of free thought schools as well as the children of Catholic schools have been collecting money for a contest which will be held at the Posvicenska Slavnost."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mrs. Stary, said: "We can do nothing now. The Posvicenska Slavnost must be held because the delegates of our organizations, lodges, and clubs <span class="page-break">8</span>have already been elected and will hold their meeting on June 22. At this meeting, which will be held at the Vojta Naprstek Free Thought School, officers will be elected and the program for the festival will be approved. The Svaz Svobodomyslnych should support the Bohemian free thought schools because we are the same people who belong to the same organizations and the same societies."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Machek,said: "The Svaz Svobodomyslnych could have helped the schools a long time ago and we will gladly accept every aid; but we do not want to destroy, we want to build. He further asked that the Svaz Svobodomyslnych be invited to participate in the Posvicenska Slavnost.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav Vohralik then asked if two delegates of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych would be accepted and if the right to speak and to vote would be given them. The chairman, Mr. Joseph Tichava, explained that according to the bylaws of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol only the delegates of those organizations and societies which pay assessments for everyone of their members shall have <span class="page-break">9</span>the right to speak and to vote at the meetings of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol but, he said, he will let the delegates decide the matter. The secretary, Mr. Karel Soukup, urged the delegates to accept the delegates of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych because the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol is obliged to accept these delegates if requested. The vote was taken and Mr. Vaclav Vohralik and Mr. Joseph Musil were unanimously accepted as the delegates of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol. Mr. V. Vohralik moved to appoint a committee which would explain the matter of arranging the Posvicenska Slavnost at the next meeting of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych. The following delegates were appointed as members of the committee: Mr. Dobias, Mr. Karel Soukup and Mr. Stromayer.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Cepelak presented her resignation from the office of financial secretary of the executive committee. Mrs. Mirovsky was then elected as her successor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The motion of Mrs. Radesinsky, that the day schools be opened in September and closed June 1,was carried through. Mrs. Stary reported that she had received the sum of ten dollars and fifty cents for a picture which was donated and sold for the benefit of the Bohemian free thought schools. We thank Mrs. Stary for her generous efforts which are worthy of being copied.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as there was no other business to be transacted, the reading of receipts and expenditures followed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>Karel Soukup, secretary.</p>
