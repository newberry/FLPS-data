   <p>Sokol Slavoj, one of the youngest, and at the same time the busiest, of units of the Zupa (District) Fuegner-Tyrs, arranged a public gymnastic exhibition at Pilsen Park.</p>
   <p>You could not expect better weather for such an event, and consequently the attendance was large. The exhibition was a success in every respect.</p>
   <p>Sokol Slavoj, in spite of its youth, has gained a large number of real friends who appreciate its work.</p>
   <p>A parade preceded the gymnastic performance. It started in Brother Semerad's hall in Merigold in the early afternoon, and marched to the music of Brother Povolny's band to the Park. After a short rest the program started.</p>

   <p>The participants assembled in the auditorium where an address of welcome was delivered by our chairman.</p>
   <p>This was followed by an exhibition of calisthenics by our little girls, a drill with wands by little boys, group drill by a team of older boys, and the dancing of the "Beseda", (a Bohemian square dance) by a class of older girls.</p>
   <p>The Sokolky (woman gymnasts) received great applause for their elegant mass drill with dumbbells. The Sokols proved by the performance of their calisthenics that they have given these exercises much study. Each formation was gone through gracefully with wonderful precision, and we may say faultlessly.</p>
   <p>The Sokolky now came forward with a dance, a mazurka, danced with precision, harmony and elegance.</p>

   <p>Then the Sokols showed their development in exercises on the apparatus.</p>
   <p>Sokol Slavoj may well be pleased with the moral and financial outcome of this yearly event.</p>
