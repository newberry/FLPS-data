   <p>The committee, which had charge of the counting of points scored by the sokol gymnasts who participated in the competitions held during Sunday's excursion of the Slovanska Gymnasticka Unie (Slavonic Gymnastic Union) to Driving Park on Twelfth Street and 56th Avenue, did not complete its task until late last night. There was a total of 110 competitors and, therefore, the committee had to work diligently throughout the day and evening to ascertain the results.</p>
   <p>We cannot, to be sure, list the name of every competitor and the number of points each reached; but we must limit ourselves to listing the three leaders in each division. The competitors were divided into three divisions according to weight. The first division included sokols weighing 150 pounds or more; the second division included those ranging from 125 to 150 pounds; <span class="page-break">\2</span>the third division included all those under 125 pounds.</p>
   <p>First prize in the first division was won by Bohumil Mikuta of Pilsen Sokol with 75.5 points; second prize went to Frantisek Knourek of Sokol Chicago with 70 points; third prize was awarded to Frantisek Bruna of Sokol Chicago for 60.8 points.</p>
   <p>In the second division the results were as follows: First, Joseph Gasper of Pilsen Sokol, 67.5 points; second, Ferdinand Vodak of Sokol Pokrok, 67.2 points; third, Richard Molcar of Sokol Chicago, 66 points.</p>
   <p>In the third division first prize was received by Jindrich Smidl of Sokol Chicago with 64 points; second, Frantisek Kunrad of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, with 52.5 points; third, Jiri Kolar of Sokol Chicago, with 51.1 points.</p>
   <p>Every expert on calisthenics must admit that great results were achieved, <span class="page-break">\3</span>of which the contestants and their instructors can be proud.</p>
   <p>The Slovanska Gymnasticka Unie is composed of twenty-five sokol societies whose members manifest a lively interest in that Organization. It is deserving of this, and also of the enthusiastic support of the public in the fullest measure.</p>
   <p>The Slovanska Gymnasticka Unie appeared before our people in a dignified manner, and proved that it is fulfilling the task which it took upon itself.</p>
