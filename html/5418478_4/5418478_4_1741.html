   <p>The fourth session of the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood [hereafter referred to in this article as the Jednota]) was opened at 9 A.M. by the president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek. The delegates had previously received printed copies of the minutes of the last session. After the slogan of the Jednota had been repeated by the delegates, the roll call followed, and it appeared that all of the delegates were present. The sister secretary then read the minutes of the Monday sessions. The minutes were approved after certain corrections and explanations. Various congratulatory messages were then read. [List of societies, lodges, and individuals sending messages to the Jednota is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Dr. Alice G. Masaryk, president of the Czechoslovak Red Cross, sent the <span class="page-break">2</span>following letter from Prague to the central committee of the Jednota:</p>
   <p>"Honorable ladies! I had a conversation with Mrs. Hrycha about the great work which the Czechoslovak Red Cross could accomplish with your aid. Mrs. Hrycha will surely report to you and tell you how grateful we are to you for your sacrifices which made all the shipments doubly precious. 'Co laska poji more nerozdvoji (what by love is united cannot by ocean be separated), as old Mr. Naprstek used to say. And your work in our behalf proved that he was right. We assure you that we do not wish to be the recipients only, and that we cherish the hope of showing you our love in some effectual way. I greet you most heartily,</p>
   <p>"Dr. Alice G. Masaryk."</p>
   <p>Another letter was sent by the Americke Narodni Sdruzeni Cechoslovaku v Clevelande (American-Czechoslovak National Alliance of Cleveland). It was <span class="page-break">3</span>signed by Mr. K. Bernreiter, president, and Mr. Joza Havranek, secretary. Congratulations were sent to the convention by the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Ladies' Union. A wish was expressed in this congratulatory letter to....Sister M. Simak, who, as one of the founders of the Jednota, is attending the present convention, and who (it was hopefully expressed) will in good health be able to attend the next one. The Jednota was also remembered by the following: The Ohio State Grand Lodge of the Jednota Taboritu (Taborites), Cleveland (letter signed by the president, Josef Stibr, and the secretary, Marie Kvet);....the Premyslovna (Premyslite) Lodge No. 5 of the Bohemian Ladies' Union, Chicago; the Frantiska Gregorova Lodge No. 47 of the Jednota of Chicago. The Cleveland Post of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires transmitted its good wishes to the convention verbally.</p>
   <p>All of the above congratulatory letters and telegrams were acknowledged in the convention by the delegates rising to their feet. Immediately thereafter the amending of certain articles of the constitution and bylaws was resumed <span class="page-break">4</span>as per recommendations made by the various lodges. The convention returned to the question of insurance policy provisions which was tabled in the previous session. A provision was made for cases in which the last wills and testaments of members were executed at a time during which the testator was mentally ill. The question of sick benefits was also debated for some time. It was further decided in this convention that any member in good standing may not only nominate but be nominated [for any office], provided she attend at least four regular meetings in a year. It was pointed out that a sister who does not regularly attend the meetings of her lodge does not manifest any great interest in the [work of the] Jednota.</p>
   <p>The convention decided that any member who would wish to resign her membership or who would like to transfer her membership to another lodge, must first pay all of her past dues to the lodge of which she is a member. Any member who changes her membership in lodges on two successive occasions and then desires a transfer to another lodge, ceases in effect to be a member of the Jednota, <span class="page-break">5</span>and shall not be permitted to join for the third time. The article dealing with the support [of minors]in case of the death of a member, came up for discussion and was to be resumed in the afternoon session. The convention adjourned and the delegates were invited to attend a joint luncheon.</p>
   <p>The fifth session was started in the usual manner at 1 P.M. All of the presiding officers and all the delegates were present as was ascertained by the roll call. The president of the convention stressed the point that all congratulatory telegrams and letters would be read in the morning sessions only. Consequently, the previously mentioned article, dealing with the support of beneficiaries in case of the death of a member, was taken up. The amount of such support was hitherto $600. Fourteen lodges voted that the death benefit remain the same; six lodges favored an increase of $100 in the benefit; ten lodges recommended that the amount be raised to $800.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Sister Stolf (secretary of the convention) was for raising the said death benefit to $800, pointing out that such a raise would have its advantages while it would not require any great sacrifices on the part of any member. The Jednota would gain thereby, for by increasing the amount of its death benefits, a great number of new members would join who now feel that the death benefits are too low. This problem led to a lively debate in which the delegates interpreted not only the wishes and opinions of the members of their respective lodges, but also their own personal views of the matter. It was finally decided to put the matter to a vote, that is: Shall the present amount of the death benefit remain the same, or shall it be increased by $200? A large majority of the delegates was for letting the old amount stand. The question of voting to increase the said amount by $100 was, therefore, dropped entirely. The amount of the benefit shall stand at $600.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In the event that a member die and is survived by no blood relations, the case is to be referred to the Czechoslovak consul who will institute a search for such relatives in the old homeland. In case of the death of a member who leaves minor children, the money shall be delivered to their legally appointed guardian who must show proof of such guardianship (issued by the court) and a legal guarantee. Such legal guarantee must also be furnished by the father of such minor children. The death benefit shall be paid out within ninety days of the date on which the claim arises. An opinion was also held that it would be advisable to urge every member to make provisions for her own funeral, so that the amount of her insurance, for which she pays dues to her lodge, would cover her funeral expenses. It sometimes happens that after the death of a member, her husband is left with the bequest of only $5 and the care of several minor children. Such a father then comes to the lodge to borrow $50 for the funeral. The lodge is not covered since only $5 was left to him, and the lodge has no right to touch the orphans' fund. The lodge officers were therefore counseled to carefully read the text of the insurance certificate before making a loan for a funeral.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The question of making cash loans to the members was then taken up. It was argued that since the Sisterhood is a benevolent and protective union, it should pay benefits to its members but make no loans. Also, in case of a sister who, harassed by age and misfortune, finds it impossible to continue to pay her lodge dues, and has no relatives, but was a member of the Jednota for more than twenty years, the lodge may pay the dues for such a member out of its fund, and in case of her death be reimbursed for the amount owed by her from the death benefit due her [estate]. In case of need, and after having investigated her case, a lodge may render financial aid to such a member from its own fund and according to circumstances. Should there be someone making claims of the death benefit of such a deceased sister, the person making such a claim shall pay to the lodge all unpaid dues of the old member. In the case of any member becoming insane and committed to a hospital for the insane, such a member shall, provided her lodge dues remain unpaid by her relatives after the expiration of three months from the time of her becoming insane, be excluded from the Jednota. All other provisions touching upon this matter shall remain in force as before. (The recommendation was made by the secretary of the convention.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Article 11 of chapter V, dealing with lost persons whose whereabouts are unknown, shall be stricken from the constitution and bylaws of the Jednota. Every lost sister who whereabouts, after a repeated search, remains unknown, and who fails to communicate with her lodge within the space of four months, shall, as indicated in one of the previous articles under the same heading, [Chapter V] be excluded from the Jednota as any other sister for nonpayment of dues, provided such payment is not made by some other person.</p>
   <p>This concluded the fifth session. The deliberations will be resumed today. There will be no afternoon session because a large picnic arranged for the entire Jednota will consume both the afternoon and the evening. The picnic will be held in Pilsen Park. There is not the slightest doubt that the picnic will be attended not only by all of the members of the local Chicago lodges, but by all of the out-of-town members, be they delegates or not. The festivities <span class="page-break">10</span>and the picnic committees have made extensive preparations to provide good entertainment and a program full of varieties. Mr. Brousek's orchestra will play. Consequently there will be many friends and admirers of the Jednota who will attend this picnic. Allegorical marches will be performed in the evening under the leadership of Sister Josefina Sedlacek and with the help of the local drill team of the Jednota. The admission for both afternoon and evening is 25 cents.</p>
