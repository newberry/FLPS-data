   <p>To our people! The united sokoldom of America will hold its first slet (mass meet and exhibition) in Chicago, August 25 to August 30, 1921. This slet, just as all the sokol slets which were held in our old country, shall manifest the sokol idea and invigorate the American Czechs.</p>
   <p>The value of sokol activities has not decreased; sokoldom has preserved its national pride. The sokols of America remember their native land, and the bequests of Bohemia are very dear to them. The soil of free America occupies an equally warm spot in our hearts.</p>
   <p>What is felt at the bottom of our hearts cannot be expressed by word of mouth, but recognizing the necessity of a public manifestation of our longings, we have undertaken this task, in order to impel ourselves and everyone to action.</p>

   <p>A large attendance at the slet will give strong proof that, while loving our new country, we do not wish that the American branch of our nation be left to its fate. For those reasons the slet committee, being proud that its dream became a reality, hereby invites sokols of our old country, the sokols of America, and all of the Slav people to the slet so that they, by their participation, may help to increase the splendor of our celebrations and help to make the slet more impressive. This slet, just as those held in our old country have taught thousands and thousands of Bohemian people to hold up their heads and to proudly say: "I am a Bohemian, and who is more!" The far-reaching significance of the slet will be felt over all of Czechoslovak America.</p>
   <p>Please do accept our fraternal greetings, and we do hope to greet you at the slet. The Bohemians of Chicago will greet you joyously and will welcome you enthusiastically and fervently.</p>
   <p>Do come, all of you! Let us meet in August!</p>
