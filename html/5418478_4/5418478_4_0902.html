   <p>The second lecture on Mr. Vaclav J. Klofac's Chicago program was held yesterday at the Zdrubek School in the neighborhood of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery). In view of the size of the Bohemian colony in that part of Chicago, the attendance should have been much larger.</p>
   <p>The speech dealt with the Slavonic nations in the Balkan Peninsula, their aims, characteristics, and hopes as to the results of the Balkan War--a lecture very similar to that which he gave the day before.</p>
