   <p>Three years have passed since the days of the beautiful, unforgettable, and inspiring moments when not only the Bohemians of Chicago, but also American Bohemians from near-by and far-away cities of the Union met in Douglas Park to participate in the first truly great and important national festival--the unveiling of the monument of an intrepid fighter for the rights of the Bohemian people, the Brixen sufferer and prisoner, Karel Havlícek-Borovsky.....</p>
   <p>Among the most faithful of his admirers are our Sokols, for whom the Havlícek celebration has become a national pilgrimage and an occasion for recalling before his monument not only the past in which Havlícek lived, worked, and suffered, but also for planning our present-day and future activities, which should always be in keeping with his principles and convictions.</p>
   
   <p>Such pilgrimages are nothing unusual, even in our old country, and nobody would consider them an occasion for pretentious display and parades of splendor on the outside and emptiness on the inside. These pilgrimages have a deep meaning in our old country--a deep moral and educational significance, the evidence of which we should like to see not only in today's pilgrimage, but on any occasion where our red-shirted Sokols lead our youth to Havlícek's monument in Douglas Park. Each such pilgrimage should strengthen us, should put new life into us, and, if it is just watery lemonade that flows through our veins, should change it into healthy, vigorous blood so that we may function to greater advantage, particularly in our national life. That life is by far not as intensive as it should be. Perhaps the circumstances under which we live account for our inertia. We seem to lack opposition that would provoke anger--opposition and perhaps oppression which would stimulate our instinct of self-preservation and thus awaken our best abilities, our best efforts to prove that we have a past, that we have a present, and particularly, that we have a future. Here we are not persecuted as the Bohemian people were persecuted in Havlícek's times; nobody is baiting us as the great Karel [Havlícek] and his contemporaries were baited; nobody is trying to impede our progress, our peaceful development, as was the case when Havlícek was one of our principal leaders. For these reasons our life here does not show such zeal, such intensive activity as it used to show and still shows in the old country, where the life of our brothers and sisters is actually a struggle, and each step forward is a great victory--a great victory won not by the force of arms, but by spiritual forces, by knowledge, and by national pride which refuses to be trodden upon. Victory is won by stern and spirited opposition to all that is unjust, by a strong reaction against oppression and persecution.</p>
   <p>Here we are not being persecuted, and therefore there is no need for struggle. But there is a need for showing that national duties can exist where no struggle is necessary, and that by doing them, a very great deal can be accomplished. A faithful performance of our national duties here will have the most beneficial effect in the old country. When our people there see that we not only live, but also feel and work as Bohemians, and--most important--that we are rearing our children as Bohemians and thus preserving our youth for the nation, then the fulfillment of national duties by Bohemians in America will strengthen the Bohemian nation in the old country and stimulate it to still more efficient, more intensive national work.</p>
   <p>We did not build the Havlícek monument for ourselves. We erected it in Douglas Park for Americans, and especially for our children, in order that the former may learn something about our struggles in the old country, and that the latter may learn how to feel like Bohemians, a thing for which there is an imperative need. This need we shall meet by taking our children to this memorial every time there is an occasion for a national pilgrimage; by telling them who that man Havlícek was, how he lived and worked, how he died, and what examples he left us in the memory of his noble, resplendent deeds.....</p>
   <p>By 1 P. M. yesterday, the first groups of Havlícek's friends began to assemble around his monument for the festive ceremonies which were inaugurated by the arrival of the members of Sokolská Župa Fuegner-Tyrš (Sokol Unit Župa Fuegner-Tyrš) who came, led by Starosta (Commander) [title of the head of every Sokol Unit] Brother Hák. They came with their banners and formed a cordon around the monument.....</p>
   <p>Brother Hák greeted the audience and explained the reason for the presence of Sokols at the celebration, saying that it is not enough to build monuments to the great leaders of the nation. It is necessary every year to refresh our memories with the meaning of these monuments. He introduced the speaker of the day, Brother Jóža Dittert, who in simple words painted a picture of Havlícek's sorrowful life and his work; his activity during the absolutistic régime of Bacher [Austrian Prime Minister] when only people in small villages did and dared to speak Bohemian, and when the language was being used only by the lowly and simple; why Havlícek became the beloved leader of the whole nation.</p>
   <p>"It was not the martyr's crown which the reactionaries pressed upon Havlícek's brow [reference to his imprisonment in the fortress of Brixen] that made him so popular with the whole Bohemian nation; long before that he was more popular in all strata of the nation than any other journalist before or after him. He was popular because of his unusual talents and abilities, because of his sterling character which neither promises nor threats could move from following the goal he set up for himself. Not fully twenty-seven years of age, Havlícek stood like a mature man; a man of cool deliberation; a man of serious purposes who knows how to reach his aims; the head of the nation in the political arena; a man in whose heart burned the fire of indomitable zeal for the ideal of civic liberty."</p>
   <p>The speaker compared Havlícek with John Huss and Johannes Amos Comenius, for he deserves recognition for the survival of the Bohemian nation in the heart of Europe, against the will of Europe, against the will of the whole so-called civilized world, which did all it could to annihilate a nation of "barbarians," whose only crime was to strive for truth and light when the rest of the world was living in the darkness of the Middle Ages.</p>
   <p>The speaker talked about our obligations to Havlícek's memory, and coming to our American conditions where Havlícek's tenets are easier to realize because we live in a free country, he concluded his address by quoting Havlícek's slogan:</p>
   <p>"Let them threaten, let them sue</p>
   <p>Let them flatter, let them boo,</p>
   <p>No matter what they do</p>
   <p>Will make me betray</p>
   <p>My 'loved native land.</p>
   <p>White and red's my country's flag</p>
   <p>Honesty and strength my saw."</p>
   <p>Following Brother Dittert, Brother Jarka Košár spoke and explained why it is that just the Sokols particularly cherish the memory of Havlícek and try to have him remembered by the whole nation. He linked him to the two shining stars--Fuegner and Tyr s--the first of which instilled Havlícek's democratic spirit into Sokoldom.....</p>
   
   <p>This year's attendance of both the Sokols and the general public was at least twice as large as last year's.....</p>
