   <p>Few Bohemian schools in America can boast of a greater success than that achieved yesterday by the Vojta Naprstek School. On New Year's day the pupils of this school went through the annual public examination exercises, held in the hall of the Sokol Chicago on Kedzie Avenue. The exercises, consisting chiefly of classic and humorous speeches, poems, declamations, songs, and plays, were held during the afternoon and evening.</p>
   <p>How great is the favor the Vojta Naprstek School is held in, was evidenced by the large number of persons that came to the exercises. The hall was so crowded that there were no seats for many of the visitors.</p>
   <p>The school is attended by almost three hundred pupils. Classes are held all day on Saturdays and during the morning on Sundays in four well-arranged classrooms in the Sokol Chicago Building. Yesterday's success will surely be the signal for continued public favor toward the school and its teaching staff.</p>
