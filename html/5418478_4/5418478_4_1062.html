   <p>p. 265... From every city of the United States where there is a Sokol organization, athletes keyed high and trained to the minute came to Chicago to take part in the first all-American Sokol competitions arranged by all groups except one. The city decked in gala attire, in which the flags of America and Czechoslovakia predominated, received the contestants, as well as the visitors, with open arms.</p>
   <p>An outstanding feature of this celebration was the presence of a team of Sokols from Czechoslovakia under the leadership of Mr. Rudolph Bilik.</p>
   <p>This is the aggregation which captured every event in which it was entered in Europe during the past year. Incidentally,it is the first visit of free Czechoslovak Sokols, which organization did such Herculean work for the freedom of Czechoslovakia.</p>

   <p>The Czechoslovakian government sensed the importance of this occasion and sent an official representative in the person of Senator Vaclav Klofac, former Minister of national defense.</p>
   <p>Arrangements were in the hands of Dr. A. Mueller, chairman of the committee in charge of this year's competitions, and Mr. Josef Placek, the president of the Central Sokol Organization.</p>
