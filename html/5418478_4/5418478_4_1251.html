   <p>Today's two soccer matches among three Bohemian and one English-speaking team will be played for the benefit of the Cesko-Slovansky Cervenky Kriz (Bohemian-Slavonic Red Cross), and it is therefore to be desired that our sport-loving public will attend the matches in large numbers.....</p>
   <p>With these matches, our "Slavia" bids good-bye to its present playground. It will move to the new, fenced-in ground at Twelfth Street and 54th Avenue, where it will play next Sunday.....</p>
   <p>"Slavia" will play the "Campbell Rovers, Jr.". "Slavia's" second team, which now calls itself the "West Side Bohemians," will play a team of our brave Sokols, the "Cechie".....</p>
