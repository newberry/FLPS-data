   <p>The overseas delegation, led by Brother Rudolf Bilek, were guests of the Sokol Pilsen and its ladies' auxiliary last night. This old and worthy Sokol unit gave their guests a splendid party which, although exclusively for members of Sokol organizations and especially invited guests, enjoyed an excellent attendance, in fact, in view of yesterday's tropical weather--unseasonable in September--an attendance surprisingly large.....</p>
   <p>The program consisted of speeches.....The dancing numbers....started the artistic part of the entertainment.....</p>
   <p>The success of the evening was made still more striking by selected songs.....</p>
   <p>Equally successful were the Russian dances that formed the later part of the program.....</p>
   
   <p>There was a midnight supper....excellent enough to satisfy the appetites of the most finicky gourmets.....</p>
   <p>The delegation spent the day sight-seeing in Chicago, using cars kindly supplied by....members of the Sokol Pilsen.....</p>
   <p>Tonight they will be guests of the Sokolska Zupa Ludevit Stur (Sokol unit called Zupa Ludevit Stur), a member of the Telocvicna Slovenska Jednota Sokol (Slovak Gymnastic Union Sokol)....</p>
