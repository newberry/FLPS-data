   <p>Doctor Shaller Mathews, president of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, extended an invitation to a group of prominent Chicago Czechs to be guests at a supper in Hutchinson Hall of the University, May 28. The affair is intended to be a get-together at which the present situation, with particular reference to the question of Czech independence, is to be discussed. Professor J. J. Zmrhal will be one of the speakers. He has been asked by Doctor Judson, president of the University of Chicago, to deliver two lectures this Fall on the subject, "The importance of the Czech question for world peace." Accompanied by the Reverend V. Kralicek, Mr. Zmrhal is now on his way to Cleveland, Ohio, to attend the Northern Baptists convention. They will submit to that assembly a memorandum of the Czech Baptists in behalf of the liberation of the Czechs and Slovaks from the tyrannical rule of the Hapsburgs.</p>
