   <p>Sokol Slavsky, one of our most active and most self-sacrificing Sokol associations, is very busy preparing for a public gymnastic exhibition which its teams will give this evening in the Pilsen Park pavilion, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. This event deserves the attention of everyone who appreciates the activities of our Sokols in the educational field. The Sokol Slavsky is universally acclaimed for its patriotic labors, for the many sacrifices it made during our liberation of Czechoslovakia, and tonight it will appear before us to give account of its activities for the whole year. It is therefore expected that our people will attend this performance in great numbers.....</p>
