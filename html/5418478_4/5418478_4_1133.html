   <p>That the activity of those organizations which are deserving of credit for the growth of our national life, which have been working unselfishly for noble causes, is carefully watched by our people, was proven at the anniversary celebration held in Pilsen Park Pavilion yesterday. The spacious Pilsen Park Pavilion was crowded with our countrymen who came to manifest their thanks for all that which Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Slavsky (Sokol Slavsky Gymnastic Association) had accomplished during the period of thirty long years, and at the same time to encourage its members to further energetic work.</p>

   <p>The principal speaker, Sokol Jarka Kosar, whose reputation as a famed orator cannot be questioned, was then introduced. There are only very few speakers who can touch the hearts and souls of their listeners as he does.....</p>
   <p>Sokol Slavsky received a great number of congratulatory communications from many of our national organizations and individuals. But because of the impossibility of reading all of them, only one, from the Ceska Obec Sokolska v Americe (American Sokol Union), was selected and read.....</p>
