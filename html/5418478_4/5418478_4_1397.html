   <p>That friends of the Sokol movement in Chicago have not diminished in numbers is but proven by the fact that since the organization of the National Sokol Union, both of our older local units the "Telocvicne Jednota Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) and the "Cesko-Americke Sokol" (Bohemian-American Sokol) have added many new an and active members. Also there has been organized a new unit of Sokols on the Northwest Side known as "Cechie" (Bohemians) which already has quite a large membership.</p>
   <p>On all sides the movement is being ardently carried on, but even so it is not as strong as should be expected from close to 25,000 Bohemians. Our youth, who should seek not only entertainment, but as one of their foremost requirements the acquisition of a healthy body and mind through Physical Culture, remain away to the detriment of both the movement and themselves. No youth who cares about a healthy body and decent entertainment should remain away from this organization, but should at the earliest possible opportunity become a member thereof.</p>
