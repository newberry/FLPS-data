   <p>A most interesting meeting which assured the future erection of the John Huss Memorial was held yesterday afternoon in the Cesko-Anglicka Svobodomyslna Skola (Bohemian-English Free-Thought School) on 18th Street. It was a special meeting of the Druzstvo Jubilejniho Husova Domu (John Huss Memorial Association) called for the purpose of deciding whether it is advisable that, under the greatly changed conditions and because of the constant collection of funds for war relief in the old country, the Druzstvo Jubilejniho Husova Domu should disband.....</p>
   <p>Many replies to letters asking the opinion of several organizations have been received....and only two lodges were for keeping the Druzstvo as it is now. All other letters expressed the thought that in case it should prove impossible to build the Memorial in the planned proportions, the Svobodna Obec (Free-Though Community) should take over the idea and build a memorial which would be smaller, but at the same time serve the purposes stated in the <span class="page-break">2</span>original proclamation and in the constitution and bylaws of the Druzstvo.</p>
   <p>The Svobodna Obec of Chicago submitted a written statement to the effect that it neither advocates nor opposes the dissolution of the Druzstvo. If, however, the Druzstvo should disband, the Svobodna Obec agrees, in accordance with a decision made in advance in one of its September meetings, to build a John Huss Memorial in proportions commensurate with its means......Since the Memorial should be a monument erected to John Huss on the five hundredth anniversary of his death, its erection cannot be postponed.....</p>
   <p>After a protracted discussion, the meeting adopted the following proposal formulated by Dr. Frantisek Iska:</p>
   <p>"The Druzstvo Jubilejniho Husova Domu agrees that it will disband. But this agreement will not be in force, nor will the disbandment take place until the Svobodna Obec will furnish a binding proclamation that it will take upon <span class="page-break">3</span>itself the building of a John Huss Memorial, to which end it will issue shares guaranteeing to all member organizations of the Druzstvo and such other organizations as will purchase such shares, the right of co-ownership and co-management of the Memorial....."</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Druzstvo will be held Monday, November 2.</p>
