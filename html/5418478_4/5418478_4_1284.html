   <p>Representative of the Narodni Jedncta Sokolska (National Sokol Union), the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Sokol District Fuegner-Tyrs), and the Americky Delnicky Sokol (American Workingmen's Sokol) met to discuss unification of the three bodies. This issue of Denni Hlasatel contains a complete report of the meeting.</p>
   <p>The Americky Delnicky Sokol agreed to a "federative" unification (to keep its own administration and through delegates participate in deliberation of matters concerning all the Sokol organizations). The unification of the two other bodies could not be brought about because of a disagreement as to what name the new organization should carry. Two were suggested: "Narodni Jednota Sokolska" (National Sokol Union) and "Americka Obec Sokolska" (American Sokol Community). <span class="page-break">\2</span>The discussion is to be continued. The final outcome of the meeting is to be published in Denni Hlasatel of December 3, 1913.</p>
   <p>During session, the representatives kept in telegraphic communication with the executive committees of the three bodies. When asked for its opinion concerning the name of the proposed organization, the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs replied from Cleveland as follows:</p>
   <p>"Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs will accept N. J. S. [Narodni Jednota Sokolska] under no condition. Will accept Ceska Obec [Sokolska] or nothing."</p>
