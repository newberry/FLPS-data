   <p>Yesterday at midnight an ordinance went into effect changing the names of 567 streets in Chicago. Several names have been changed in sections where many Bohemians live.....Nutt Street now carries the name of Loeffler Court to honor the memory of William Loeffler, the deceased leader of Bohemian Democrats.....Fourty-first Avenue is now Karlov Avenue; 43rd Court, Kolin Avenue; 44th Avenue, Kostner Avenue; 44th Court, Komensky Avenue; 45th Avenue, Kral Avenue.....It is through the influence of Alderman John Toman that these streets have been given Bohemian names.....</p>
