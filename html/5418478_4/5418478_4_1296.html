   <p>The recent convention of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Gymnastic Union), attended by almost seventy delegates and held last month in Baltimore, adopted a number of important resolutions.....Among these the most significant is the transfer of the seat of the Jednota's executive committee from New York to Chicago. This was a very fortunate move.....New York had had that committee for over twenty years, and the work done from New York as pivotal point of the Jednota has always been fully appreciated.....</p>
   <p>It is evident that Chicago must be considered as the center of the Sokol movement.....While in New York there are only two units of the Jednota, Chicago has twelve of them; hence, if for no other reason, the seat of Jednota's ruling body should be here by right of majority.....</p>
