   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Fraternal and Benevolent Association) is rather busy these days preparing for a splendid picnic which is to be held on Sunday and attended by all of the local lodges of the Association. One may be sure that all the members and their friends will attend and spend a few very pleasant hours enjoying this entertainment.</p>
   <p>The picnic will take place in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. The members will thus have an opportunity to meet again, to get acquainted, and to gather fresh energies for the future work of the Association. That this entertainment will be of the highest order is assured beforehand by the committee, and one may expect, too, that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>attendance will be large. Mr. Broz's orchestra is to furnish the music for the program. The picnic begins sharply at 2 P. M. The admission is fifty cents per person.</p>
