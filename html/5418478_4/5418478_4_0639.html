   <p>The trustees of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society School, in the Town of Lake, announce that beginning December 1, 1911, there has been established in the Town of Lake a daily Czech school in place of the former Saturday and Sunday school. Classes are being held from four o'clock until seven o'clock in the evening (each class lasts one hour).</p>
   <p>The school opened on December 1, at which time new pupils were registered. Subjects taught are: reading, writing, grammar, orthography, composition, geography, history, rationalistic ethics, and singing. The teacher is Mr. Bretislav Jonáš, who will gladly give further information during the above-mentioned hours. The trustees and the Associated Czech Liberal [Free-Thought] Schools of Chicago, having in view the great significance of the mission of the Czech school in America, approved this step unanimously. It is the third daily Bohemian liberal school in Chicago and it is now up to every liberal Czech father and mother to send their children to this school, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and to aid in its development for the honor of our liberal community.</p>
   <p>For the trustees of the Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society School in the Town of Lake: Anton Bohaty, president; Joseph Musil, secretary.</p>
