   <p>The eleventh session of the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) was opened at 9 A.M. yesterday by the president of the convention, Mrs. Marie Hajek. The president announced to the delegates that the proceedings of the convention were drawing toward a close, and it devolves upon them, therefore, to pay very strict attention to its final deliberations, and to be as co-operative as possible for the ultimate good of the Jednota. After waiving the [usual] pass word ceremony, the roll was called and revealed that all the delegates except one were present. The one tardy representative having arrived later, the attendance was one hundred per cent. Since the minutes of the previous session were not on hand [Translator's note: Not delivered by the printer], the reading of incoming correspondence was taken up. These were chiefly congratulatory messages sent by various organizations. [List of congratulatory messages sent by lodges, societies, and individuals is omitted in translation.]</p>
   
   <p>The work of amending the constitution and bylaws was resumed, and it was decided to place the article dealing with funeral expenses under the heading of house rules and to abide by it accordingly. It was argued that hitherto the sum of $100 was allowed for funeral expenses, whereas now most things having increased in cost, [the above sum was not considered adequate]. Since the orphans' fund may not be used except for its avowed purposes, it was recommended that things be so managed as to be in agreement with the state laws in every respect. It was further decided that any lodge may use its own judgment in regard to attending church funerals on which the relatives of a deceased lodge sister might insist; that is to say, the lodge may or may not attend a church funeral, and no other lodge has the right to censure the procedure of the members who would or would not attend it depending upon their own judgment in the matter. This question, by the way, was very rationally discussed by Sisters Stolf, Liska, Brychta, and Bubak. It is obligatory to place flowers upon the coffin of a deceased lodge sister, but should her relatives refuse any floral offerings, the sum of not more than $5 should be left to the mourning relatives. In cases where the lodge members do not attend a funeral, the money which would otherwise be spent for the hiring of vehicles shall be left in the treasury of the lodge. All final dispositions as regards the funeral [of a lodge sister] are to be governed by the house rules.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, copies of the minutes of the previous session were delivered by the printer. The minutes were then read.... and approved after some minor corrections. The work of amending the constitution continued as follows: Any lodge may continue to function provided it have at least eight members. Should there be less than eight, the funds of such a lodge may not be equally divided among them, but the members must seek admission to another lodge [of the Jednota]. The funds [of a dissolved] lodge shall be turned over to the central committee. Lodge sisters who voted for the dissolution of a lodge may not be [readmitted to membership in the Jednota. In the case of a lodge being dissolved, its members who have passed the age limit [stipulated by the constitution and bylaws] may be accepted by another lodge under the same condition as any other member of such a lodge. There shall be no reserve fund; all such money shall be diverted into the charity fund, and every member of the Jednota shall pay five cents quarterly to that fund. The charity fund shall be used for the support of aged and destitute members.</p>
   <p>A debate followed concerning the time to be set for the next convention. Shall the [seventh] convention be held six, eight, or ten years hence? Since the majority of the delegates desired it to be held in six years, it was so ordered .... The next convention shall be held in the city in which the central committee is to be located.</p>
   <p>A lively debate ensued when the official organ of the Jednota came up for discussion. Up to now that organ was the Zenske Listy (Woman's Magazine). The delegates were divided in their opinions as to an independent publication, and the following periodicals and newspapers were suggested: the Zajmy Lidu (People's Interest), the Svet (World), the Zenske Listy, the Svornost (Concord), and the Duch Casu (Spirit of the Times). Bids were received from the Svet Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio and from the Zenske Listy. Sister Stolf requested that the contract be awarded to any one of these, but for a period not exceeding four years. She also desired that a publications committee be appointed to take part in [all future] conventions of the Jednota and co-operate with the Sesterska Jednota Ceskych Dam (Sisterhood of Bohemian Ladies), the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union), and the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood). [Translator's note: The full names of the three large women's organizations were intentionally given here and translated to avoid confusion and to point out certain similarities of nomenclature.] It was suggested [by Sister Stolf] that the three organizations have a common official organ. She herself was for retaining that publication as the official organ of the Jednota, the managing of which led to the death of its publisher. [Translator's note: The publisher was a woman who devoted all her energies to her work, the great strain of which probably led to her death. No name is given.] Sister Stolf declared that she was well acquainted with all the phases of publishing a woman's paper; at one time she was well acquainted with all the phases of publishing a woman's paper; at one time she was interested in publishing such a paper for the Bohemian Ladies' Union, and having made inquiries from the Narodni Tiskarna (National Printing House), she ascertained that the publishing of an organ similar to the Zenske Listy and having the same format as the Zenske Listy would cost about $24,000 annually. Since the cost of publication was too high, the idea of publishing an independent organ was abandoned for the time being. It was chiefly the Cleveland delegates who objected to having the Zenske Listy as the organ of the Jednota. It was finally decided to put this question to a vote. A motion was made accordingly. Five delegates voted for an independent publication, and 476 voted to have the Zenske Listy [Continued]; the Svet received 190 votes. The Zenske Listy will, therefore, remain the official organ of the Jednota.</p>
   <p>All decisions reached at [this] convention shall be in force ninety days after the adjournment thereof, and the copies of the amended constitution and bylaws shall be printed within that period. A discussion followed concerning the future location of the central committee. The Cleveland delegates announced their resignation from that office according to the constitution and bylaws. The Nebraska delegates were not desirous of holding that office. The other candidates were the St. Louis delegation. Chicago was suggested.... The matter was put to a vote. 628 delegates voted for Chicago and 42 for St. Louis.... The office of the central committee shall, therefore, be in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The morning session ended. A beautiful floral piece was sent to Sister Katerina Vokurka by Mr. Eduard Baumruck and family. That sister, who is a member of the Zofie Podlipska Lodge, has been very ill for some time. Mr. Baumruck sent his best wishes to the convention, congratulating it upon the work achieved. The delegates' picture was then taken by Mr. Pavlik whose studio is located at 2618 South Lawndale Avenue. The delegates then assembled for their twelfth (afternoon) session..... After.... the usual roll call, suggestions for the good of the Jednota were in order. Also during the afternoon session the new officers of the central committee were elected. They are as follows: Marie Liska, president; Anna Brichta, vice-president; Anna Stolf, secretary; Alzbeta Lisy, financial secretary; Antonie Mazac, treasurer; Antonie Denemark, sergeant at arms; Antonie Velik, custodian; Marie Pitsa and Antonie Hofreiter, members of the economics committee; Katerina Gruenwald, Emilie Uxa, and Anna Tomasek, members of the auditing committee.</p>
   <p>The last session of the convention will be held tomorrow, at which time also the new officers of the central committee will be duly installed. Some suggestions and recommendations will be received, and the convention will then adjourn.</p>
