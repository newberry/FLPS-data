   <p>The Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood), which may be justly regarded as one of the most active and self-sacrificing women's benevolent associations in Czechoslovak America, launched its sixth convention yesterday morning. Delegates from seventy-three separate lodges of the Jednota were in attendance. The convention, from which much is expected, is being held in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>There was much activity going on at the Park even at 8 A.M., when the delegates began to arrive. The Chicago members accompanied the out-of-town delegates, acting as hosts. Delegates from out-of-town were welcomed on Friday. On this day the members of the various local lodges spent their time in the Chicago railroad depots in order to meet the incoming guests. The....delegates were received with open arms and were housed by members <span class="page-break">2</span>of the local lodges. There can be no doubt that the local ladies will be helpful not only during the regular business sessions of the convention, but in every way, so that the out-of-town members may take away with them upon leaving Chicago the best impressions. Good impressions may be made on these out-of-town visitors by being as hospitable and obliging as possible to them when taking them around Chicago and particularly through the Czechoslovak sections of it. Thus it devolves upon all of us, and not merely on the members of the Sisterhood and the local branches of the Jednota, to care for the comforts of our guests during their stay here. The entire Czechoslovak population of Chicago must prove that it is cognizant of its duties as host of the Jednota.....</p>
   <p>At 9:30 A.M. all the delegates were in their places, and....Mrs. Marie Hajek, as chairman of the central committee, opened the convention. She welcomed all those present with a few well-chosen and sincere words. (Representatives of the daily [Bohemian] press were present.) She expressed <span class="page-break">3</span>her best wishes for the success of the work of the convention, and pointed out that its success will be guaranteed if every delegate will pay strict attention to the business at hand. She then paid pious respect to all the workers of the Jednota who had passed away, and at her request the whole convention rose to its feet in their honor.</p>
   <p>The president then introduced one of the founders of the Jednota--Mrs. Marie Simak of Cleveland, Ohio--and asked that lady to be seated at the president's table. No sooner did this happen than the whole convention rose to its feet cheering. Mrs. Simak, in spite of her seventy-six years, undertook the long journey to be present at the convention of the Jednota which she helped to found by joining the Laska Vlasti (Patriotic Love) Lodge No. 1, the nucleus of which consisted then of twenty-eight members.</p>
   <p>At the request of the president the report of the last meeting of the central <span class="page-break">4</span>committee was read and approved....This was followed by the financial report of the Jednota covering the past six years. At this juncture also a report was made on the receipts of fees of the entire membership of the Jednota for the past six years, and since its last convention which was held in Cleveland, Ohio on June 21, 1916. From this report it became apparent that the wealth of the Jednota is growing rapidly, as is also its membership. It was gratifying to learn that the Jednota, during the last six-year period, gave a rather large sum of money for various charitable and national causes. The president declared that the central committee did all it could, and if the financial state of the Jednota is not such as the committee would wish, the committee hopes that the Jednota will, in the near future, attain its aims with the co-operation of all its members.</p>
   <p>The following delegates were present: [Translator's note: Names of participating lodges and their delegates omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>A motion was made to have the entire central committee sit in during the <span class="page-break">5</span>convention. The chairman of that committee is Sister Marie Hajek, the alternate Sister Anna Mulac, the second alternate, Sister R. Dvorak, and the treasurer, Sister Marie Ruzicka. Since the regular secretary is on a visit to Czechoslovakia at the moment, Sister Anna Stolf was elected secretary pro tem. Sister Kristina Huspasek was appointed assistant secretary. Sister Marie Wolf is sergeant-at-arms. The secretary was ordered to be responsible for all the reports of the convention and to have them published in the daily [Bohemian] press. The presiding committee of the convention hails from Cleveland, Ohio, with the exception of Sister Anna Stolf, who is a Chicagoan.</p>
   <p>Various committees were then appointed. Thus, for instance, a five-member committee on the order of the day; a five-member committee for the auditing of books; a three-member committee for the inspection of credentials; a three-member committee on resolutions; and a committee on constitutional amendments.</p>
   <p>On motion made by Sister Marie Liska the convention officers shall receive <span class="page-break">6</span>the same pay as they did at the last convention. The chairman shall receive for the whole duration of the convention the sum of $60; the first and the second secretaries shall receive $75; the assistant secretary, $35; the alternate, $25; the second alternate, $15; the sergeant-at-arms, $15. It is quite possible that this matter will be discussed again on Monday, that is, tomorrow, at which time a definite decision will be reached. After settling these matters....the session was temporarily adjourned.</p>
   <p>At noon the chairman of the festival committee, Sister Smrcek, introduced Dr. Anton Mueller, asking that he be permitted to say a few words to the delegates. Dr. Mueller stated that he was grateful to be present in a hall which brought memories to him of the days of the war when the progressive and nationally conscious Czechoslovak women were so active and accomplished so much by their work....He introduced himself as the president of the Stredni Zupa Sokolska (Central District of the [American] Sokol Union), and after wishing the delegates great success in their work....he asked them <span class="page-break">7</span>to attend....the Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage) which is being held today, both afternoon and evening, in Pilsen Park. To explain the purpose of the festival he pointed out that the Baltimore Sokols have a summer athletic field and the Chicago Sokols need such a field also. He emphasized the fact that two thirds of the net proceeds of the Narodni Pout will go to the Sokols for the purchase of the [needed] athletic field, and he again asked the delegates to attend the Pout in the greatest possible numbers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mueller's brief talk was received....with enthusiastic applause....Sister Smrcek then announced that dinner was waiting for all the delegates in the rear hall [of the pavilion]. This ended the first session of the convention which will reassemble next Monday morning. There was no session in the afternoon, the hall having been rented to another society. On Sunday evening the delegates were officially welcomed and introduced in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on West 18th and South May Streets. This was also a soiree <span class="page-break">8</span>given in their honor. Many beautiful addresses were delivered, and the entire evening program was characterized by a great variety of attractive numbers.</p>
   <p>We wish to correct an error. This newspaper announced that there would be a banquet in honor of the delegates in the Sokol Chicago this afternoon.... The banquet, which is to be given by the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union) is to be given a week from today. We therefore remind the ladies not to come to the said hall this afternoon but to come one week from today. The festivities of the convention will continue tonight, when a gala performance will be given in Ludvik's theatre.</p>
