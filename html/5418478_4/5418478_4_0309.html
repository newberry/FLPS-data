   <p>The Sokol Americky (The American Sokol), organ of the American Sokols, in reviewing the Sokolsky Sbornik (Handbook for Sokols), says: "We welcome any new book for Sokols, every new effort to instruct our ranks. If its aims concern Sokol activities proper, we take still more interest in it, in order that we may learn to know ourselves. The American Sokol is just such a manual. Messrs. Vonasek and Paskovsky are the publishers and editors. We are glad to concede that the edition for 1918 excels all others in outward appearance and in contents.</p>
   <p>The calendar part is located right in the beginning. It is permeated with true Sokol spirit. There follows a short history of Sokol organizations in Chicago. Then we find a review of Sokol activities all over America, Rieger's article on the Sokol organizations, and a discussion of group <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>gymnastics. Next, there is a dramatic sketch, "Tyrs's Dream"; it is followed by a discussion of simple gymnastics and health hints for the instructor. Again, there are suggestions on proper grouping at public appearances, professional jumping, amateur theatricals, miscellanies, and an epilogue. A daily memorandum section is attached.</p>
   <p>The price is only fifty cents. This is the third edition of the handbook, which is being given a send-off in a very attractive cover and is embellished by ample illustrations. The main point, however, is that the price is within the reach of all of us. The book was printed by the Ceska Tiskarna (Czech Printing Company), 2234 South Kedzie Avenue.</p>
