   <p>The Board of Trustees of the Bohemian School Frantisek Palacky, in New Tabor [Bohemian district in Chicago], must continually struggle for its existence, and although it is supported by all of our organizations, further support is still needed in order that the school may carry on succesfully. For that reason, the Board of Trustees resolved to arrange a bazaar on April 18, 20, 22, and 24, in the hall of the Sokol Slavoj at Crawford Avenue and 14th Streets. For this patriotic enterprise, the hall will be given free of charge and our Sokols surely deserve our thanks and acknowledgment for it. Gifts are also coming in, but not so plentifully as to guarantee desirable results. Therefore, our dear readers, you are requested to assist us by sending in your gifts, and your handiwork [knitting and crocheting] is also welcome. Further, we appeal to our Bohemian mothers to send their children to our school because you do not know when and where the knowledge of the Bohemian language may become useful to them in the future. Do not make the excuse that they do not wish to attend the Bohemian School, because when they nature they could say to you: "Why didn't you have brains, if we didn't have them?" We should be proud that our children are able to speak the Bohemian language. It must be sorrowful for a Bohemian mother when she must openly admit that her children do not know the Bohemian language. At home, speak only in Bohemian to your children, teach them the correct pronunciation and the rest will be taken care of by our Bohemian School. When a child cannot speak Bohemian, the school is usually blamed for it; but it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that sometimes as many as eighty children attend the school and you cannot demand that the teacher teach them everything at once, when the teacher gets no help from the parents in the home. What the child learns in his young days, no one can take away from him.</p>
