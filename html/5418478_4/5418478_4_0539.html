   <p>According to reports from Washington, D. C., the proposal placed before the House by Congressman Sabath has an excellent chance of becoming a law. When it passes, Czechoslovaks, who are nominally Austro-Hungarian subjects, will be admitted as citizens of the United States, despite the existence of a state of war between our Republic and the Dual Monarchy.</p>
   <p>Citizenship will be of great value to our fellow countrymen. They will thus be admitted as workers in public works and important industries. It is, therefore, to your best interest, as well as your duty toward this country, to wake up, shed the black and yellow Austrian shackles, and become citizens of this Republic. Yes, it is your duty to show America that you do not want to be called Austro-Hungarians, and that you want to prove your loyalty to this country, which is now battling on the side of the Allies.</p>
   <p>In order to facilitate the acquisition of second papers, several classes in <span class="page-break">2</span>citizenship will be opened at the community center in the Farragut school, 24th Street and Spaulding Avenue. Experts will lecture on civic sciences and will show you how to fill out documents. Hundreds, in fact, thousands of our fellow countrymen should enroll in these courses. Do not miss this last opportunity; if you miss it, you will have to wait another year and--wonder what the next year may bring for you.</p>
   <p>Those of you who want to take advantage of this splendid offer tendered to you now should not fail to register at the Farragut school on March 15 at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>Let us demonstrate our loyalty to the starry flag under which sons of America are fighting for the liberation of Czechoslovak lands!</p>
