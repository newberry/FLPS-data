   <p>P.1--Many of those patrons of good things who regarded with smiles of compassion the Ceska Straz (Bohemian Guard) and its friends while they were endeavoring to have a public library established in our Pilsen section, believing the realization of the idea to be an impossibility, and who even after its establishment did not predict a long future for it, will be astonished at the data published by Mr. Fred Rex, the manager of this branch.</p>
   <p>According to his records the total number of persons visiting the branch in November was 6258, in December 6253, and in January 7882; and in February, according to preliminary estimates, the attendance will be in the neighborhood of 9000. According to the reports of the library board it is one of the most frequented reading-rooms in the city.</p>
   <p>The number of readers will surely increase when the books purchased by the management of the Bohemian National Cemetery, at the request of the Ceska Straz, are delivered. Two hundred dollars' worth of books were purchased, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and they will be placed in the library as soon as they are bound. It is a fine collection, which will surely please Bohemian readers and will be an honor to the Cemetery management.</p>
   <p>The public library recently received a rich legacy, and therefore the Ceska Straz held a special meeting on last Friday in which it was resolved to send a deputation to the library board at its meeting next Monday to urge it to include Bohemian books in stocking the library. A list of Bohemian books will be submitted to the board for this purpose, including new publications which are lacking on the shelves. We hope that the library board will take the requests of the deputation under advisement, for it knows that Bohemians appreciate everything which it does for them.</p>
   <p>The average Sunday attendance at the Blue Island Avenue reading-room was 211 persons, in November, 192 in December, and 245 in January. However, the report indicates that the men's better halves have thus far neglected their reading, for in November the library was visited by 4924 men and 1334 women, in December by 5232 men and 1021 women, and in January by 6741 men and 1141 women. The ladies will no doubt rectify this apparent neglect in the near future. There are about 400 library cards outstanding at present, and in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>January 1531 books were lent.</p>
   <p>It is evident from these data that our library is growing, and this must be a source of great satisfaction to all those who worked for its establishment. It should also teach those who regarded these activities with compassion that it is not always proper to condemn a good idea in advance.</p>
