   <p>The Melrose Lodge No. 48 of the Cesko Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union) consists of young Bohemian-Americans, and it is therefore easily imaginable that their entertainments are first-class in every respect. The ball that is being planned by this group will possess characteristics which will be both Old Czech and American. [Translator's note: The word "Old" in Old Czech must be capitalized in the same sense as we capitalize the term "Old English".] It is certain that everyone attending the ball will be highly satisfied. The entertainment committee prepared a program consisting of excellent music and other very interesting items, and our public should therefore show its appreciation and friendship to this young lodge which just started on its life course by arranging this fine ball for our people.</p>
   <p>The affair is to be held in Mr. Svoboda's hall on Blue Island Avenue and West 19th Street. Doors open at 8 P.M. sharp.</p>
