   <p>The movement for the unification of all Czech schools in America has reached a stage, today, where the task appears to be almost completed. About one hundred schools are now under the guidance of the Cesko- Americka Matice Skolska [Czech-American Central School Organization]. Those few that are not, still profit by our work..... The job of equalizing the level of our schools is the next one to be tackled. For this we need a monthly publication which is to contain school news and also give helpful hints to the teachers about instruction in classes and in the Klub Mladeze [Youth Clubs].....This monthly should indicate to the delegates what they may expect from the teachers and also tell the parents how to prepare their children for entrance into our Czech schools.</p>

   <p>No competition with other papers will arise in this publication, not even to the Svobodna Skola [The Free Thought School] published in Chicago, for the latter is designed for children. The name of the monthly has not yet been decided.....</p>
