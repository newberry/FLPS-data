   <p>The election of the Board of Directors for the World's Fair of 1892 has been completed. The ranks of Directors have been filled with the rich people who subscribed the most; even at that, it was expected that some Bohemian would be elected to the Board of Directors, but this did not happen, but in spite of this we do not see any reason why we should be antagonistic to the affair.</p>
   <p>It is well-known that at a meeting, such as was held at Battery "D" any names that do not sound American are not given much consideration. To bring honor to the name of Bohemian we would suggest to Chicago Bohemians another and, we think a better method, if we wish to provide for a wider currency of the Bohemian name at the World's Fair. Let there be organized among Chicago Bohemians a Committee whose purpose it will be to arrange for a Bohemian Section in the Fair. At all previous fairs the work of Bohemians has been shown in the Austrian Section and this can be avoided this time.</p>
   <p>The Directors of the Fair would give consideration to a Bohemian Fair Committee and our committee could then advise our country-men across the sea.</p>

   <p>Bohemia can take pride in its' manufactures which are unequaled by any other nation. The needlework of our country-women is much admired throughout the world. Chicago Bohemians should provide for a Bohemian Section at the Fair, entirely separate from the Austrian Section. In that way they will serve Bohemian industry as well as the Bohemian name.</p>
