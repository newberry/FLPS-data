   <p>Six years ago an uncounted multitude witnessed the unveiling of the statue in Douglas Park of our greatest journalist, the undaunted protagonist of the century-old rights of the Czech nation, Karel Havlicek-Borovsky. At the time a solemn vow was taken that the monument would become a Mecca whither Chicago Czechs would journey to do homage, in a dignified manner, to their national hero. These memorial celebrations have been held since that time under the guidance of the Sokol societies who justly see Havlicek as the early defender of their great ideals.</p>
   <p>A similar celebration took place yesterday, the sixty-first anniversary of his tragic death. This time the combined Sokol societies took charge of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the arrangements, and it is to be regretted that this year's twenty-ninth of July was not remembered by a larger group. The event was nevertheless a highly dignified one, characterized by awe-inspiring piety befitting the name of the greatest Czech hero.</p>
   <p>A parade began at the home of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, moved north to 24th Street, then to Kedzie Avenue, where it was joined by members of Sokol Chicago, proceeded to Ogden Avenue, and then northeast, directly to Douglas Park. A squad of mounted police and the bugle corps of the Sokol Jan Amos Komensky headed the procession. A guard of honor was stationed close to the monument, while the main body of the Sokols with banners raised formed a lane.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jan Rudis-Jicinsky was the main speaker. He is the editor of the Americky Sokol (American Sokol), and he was introduced by a brother Sokol, Mr. Jarka Kosar, well-known patriotic worker. Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky is a speaker of flaming words. He said in substance:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"When I visited Athens, Greece, three years ago....and gazed with admiration upon the masterpieces of sculpture....I understood why our great Tyrs [one of the founders of the Sokol societies] turned to ancient Hellas for the figures which later became the models of strength and beauty for the Sokol societies.....Tyrs visioned the Sokol as man, husband, father; as a sturdy defender of his people; as a teacher of truth. Among the finest specimens was Havlicek, the defiant publicist, politician, satirist, poet, most prolific writer and observer, who taught in speech and in print, directing his people in the fight against the most rabid foe of the Czech nation....." The speaker continued with a biographical sketch, encompassing the life of Havlicek from October 31, 1831, his birth, to July 29, 1856, the day of his death.....Jicinsky held him up as a shining example of Czech manhood and urged our fellow citizens of Czech descent to emulate him and endure in the struggle for the independence of the old homeland.</p>
   <p>"There are no Sokols in our motherland now, but there are strong Sokol arms in the United States ready for the moment when action is needed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Let us be good Czechs and just as good citizens of America, of which our Havlicek has written numerous articles praising the American Constitution..... We are proud of our aims.....If we fulfill our duty, we shall have honored the name of Havlicek."</p>
   <p>After the enthusiastic applause which followed the address, a small Sokol girl placed a wreath at the monument, and the multitude sang the Czech folk song, "Spi Havlicku".</p>
   <p>Jarka Kosar, one of the most enthusiastic workers for Czech national aims, spoke a few words, after which the participants sang the Czech national song "Hej Slovane!" [Ho! All ye Slavs!]. Dr. Anton Mueller delivered the address which closed the celebration.</p>
   <p>The board of representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery contributed a tremendous wreath with a ribbon and a dedication. The offering was placed at the monument by Mr. Sedlacek.</p>
