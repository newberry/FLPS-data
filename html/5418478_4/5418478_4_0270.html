   <p>The French and the British Governments have officially recognized the Czechoslovak National Council as the organ of the future government of the independent Czechoslovak state. This is of paramount importance to us. We shall have to grasp the full significance of this event, and we shall also have to make it comprehensible to our American friends. When the American Government inclines in the way indicated by the French and British Governments, the American people will not be surprised, but will stand behind the President, once it has learned to understand the significance of this move.</p>
   <p>Thus it will be our duty to support and disseminate understanding of the fact that the Czechoslovak National Council was officially declared to be the provisional government of the independent Czechoslovak state. The authority which has been conferred upon the council should be made known to the American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>public, and to this end, every one of us can contribute his part.</p>
   <p>Send in an order for the July number of the Bohemian Review, official organ of the Czech National Alliance. This organ is edited by Dr. Jar. Smetanka, director of the Bureau of the Czech National Alliance located in New York City. In this issue you will find a treatise on the import of this recognition of the Czechoslovak National Council by the Government of the Republic of France. After reading it, you will be better able to inform your American acquaintances, on the gist of Czechoslovak efforts and demands.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Review also offers other articles which supply excellent propaganda information. You should, for instance, show to your American friends the article describing the demonstrations and manifestations of the Czechoslovak people in the old country when they acclaimed the policy of the United States and our President. Show American women the report on the rally of Slavonic women in the city of Prague. There is also an article on the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Czechoslovak Armies in France, Russia, and other countries. By doing this, you will render valuable service to our nation.</p>
   <p>Every one of us must become a fighter; some with arms in hand, and others by spreading information about us. A copy of the Bohemian Review costs ten cents, and can be obtained by mail from the offices, 2324 South Central Park Avenue, Chicago, Ill. One year's subscription costs only one dollar. The copies will serve as a nice souvenir of the war in which the Czechoslovak nation is playing a great part, and in which all sincere Czechs and Slovaks must participate.</p>
