   <p>Classes in drawing and modeling for Czech boys, have been established in the Svatopluk Czech park, upon permission of the Park Board. Two young and gifted Czechs have been procured as teachers: Mr. M. Mrazek for drawing and Mr. Joseph L. Patek for modeling. Their excellent qualifications are evident from the samples of work exhibited by the pupils in the park building, open to the public until January 8. The school affair will be closed on that date by a lecture on "History of Architecture," delivered by Mr. J. M. Mrazek. Due credit for the success of the educational enterprise is given Mr. W. Kolacek, president of the Park Board, Mr. Karel Vopicka, Mr. Kaspar, and also to Mr. Triner, Mr. Hajicek, and Mr. Novak for generous contributions to the prize fund, out of which the prizes for outstanding achievements of pupils were purchased.</p>
