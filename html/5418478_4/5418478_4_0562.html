   <p>The performance given by the children's theatre of the Czech Liberal schools in the hall of the Sokol Chicago last Wednesday not only provided a pleasant evening for the many friends of the institution, but served as an irrefutable proof of the progress made by the little ones. We did not have to listen to mere dry recitations with an incorrect accent, but we enjoyed pure, delightful, Czech words. Here the influence of the Czech Liberal school upon our adolescence is conspicuously exhibited, as well as the sincere endeavor of the teachers to instill into the children the sense for the beauties of their maternal language.</p>
   <p>"Pohadka O Kryspinkovi" (The Tale of Little Crispin), that enchanting story, demanded much time and toil, but its success was an honest reward.</p>

   <p>Everything ran off smoothly, the singing and the dances were performed flawlessly, and the costuming and staging were very good. To note that the audience was large and appreciative was gratifying.</p>
