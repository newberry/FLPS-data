   <p>The fourth Chicago lecture by Mr. Klofac was held in the hall of the Cesko-Slovenske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) at West 48th and Honore Streets last night. Again he talked about the Serbs, Bulgarians, and Montenegrenes; the causes of the Balkan wars; and the intrigues of the Austrian and German diplomatists who are responsible for the last war there--the Serbo-Bulgarian. In spite of a tropical heat, the attendance was satisfactory.</p>
