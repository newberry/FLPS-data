   <p>The well-known Bohemian-American writer and traveler, Mr. E. St. Vraz, had contemplated a trip to Moravia where he had made a number of speaking engagements since the beginning of the summer. The war has prevented him from leaving the United States, however, and thus our dear Vraz has stayed at home. He will not be idle here. In the next few days, he expects to make a tour of a number of Bohemian-American settlements, and since his talks will be on the topic, "The European War and the Bohemian-Slavonic Nation," it is certain that they will arouse the keen interest of all our countrymen.....</p>
   <p>A part of the admission price to his lectures will be sent to Bohemia for those who need help most.....</p>
   <p>Already forty-three Bohemian communities in the West have asked Vraz for a lecture. His first and second lectures will be in Wisconsin--in Manitowoc on Saturday, October 31; in Melnik (sic), Sunday, November 1. From there he will go west to Iowa and Nebraska.</p>
