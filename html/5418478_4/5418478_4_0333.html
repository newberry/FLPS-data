   <p>A memorial booklet, edited by Doctor Jar. E. S. Vojan has been published by the Association for the erection of a monument to Karel Havlicek. It is a pamphlet which fully serves its purpose. It acquaints the reader with the significance of Havlicek, calling attention to the most important data of his life. It recounts all the work necessary so that the Havlicek monument in Chicago should become a fact. The booklet is valuable not only because of its contents, but for its make up. It will have a permanent value for all those who revere Havlicek and for all the participants in today's celebration. It is sold for twenty-five cents. In order that young countrymen who are not able to read Bohemian may learn something about the fame of Havlicek, the booklet contains some paragraphs in English, also translations of some of Havlicek's epigrams. We are convinced that the Memorial Booklet will find the widest distribution which it so richly deserves.</p>
