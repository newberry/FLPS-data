   <p>The halls of local Bohemian Sokols have been newly decorated and general building repairs have been completed. The Bohemian-American Sokol Hall has been repainted both inside and outside. The ceiling is beautifully decorated; the outside is likewise painted. The most important change is that new rest rooms are being installed. This new installation is to be completed this week, because there will be a dance held at this hall on Saturday. Work is proceeding in a like manner at the Tel. Jed. Sokol (Gymnastic Union Sokol) Hall, the Proscenium has already been finished, it is a work of art and is a credit to the Bohemian artist, Mr. E. Hasse. The women's quarters in the building are to be refurnished and redecorated also.</p>
   <p>With all the redecorating and refurnishing completed, we can only wish both of these organizations success.</p>
