   <p>The Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslne Skoly v Cicero (Board of Trustees of the Bohemian Free Thought School in Cicero), after preliminary activities, recently started to build a Bohemian school. At the present time, when immigration is so restricted and further progress of our Bohemian-American branch so endangered, the erection of a new Bohemian school surely is a project which deserves all of our attention, especially in Cicero where the Bohemian element predominates.</p>
   <p>An important matter with which the building committee is confronted is the problem of finance. Although there were various organizations and individuals that contributed toward this purpose, much more is needed. Therefore we let our countrymen who sympathize with this project know that whoever contributes the sum of ten dollars will become an honorable contributing member, and by contributing the sum of fifty dollars will become a member of the Board of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Trustees. In the past meeting of the building committee, a special committee was appointed. Members of this committee are authorized to call upon our businessman and collect these contributions. Should some of our countrymen not be visited by these committee members and should such countrymen be willing to make contributions, they may communicate with the secretary, Mr. Vaclav Kesl, 5321 West 25th Place, Cicero, Illinois, or send his contribution directly to the treasurer, Mr. Frank Suchy, 5522 West 24th Street, Cicero, Illinois. All carpenters and bricklayers who would be willing to donate work on the building for a day or more should communicate with the general contractor, Mr. Julius Kinst, 2213 South 59th Avenue, Cicero,Illinois, who will give them more detailed information.</p>
   <p>The members of the Board of Trustees firmly hope that their drive for new members will not be in vain inasmuch as there is no business project involved, but our children are to be considered. And if we preserve those children for our mother tongue we will thus insure the continuing of our Free Thought <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>organizations, which are such important factors in our public life.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the building committee will be held Monday, March 14, 1921. All members are requested to attend.</p>
