   <p>The first Nedelni Beseda (Sunday Get-Together), an innovation introduced by the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of Chicago, was held at the John Huss Memorial Sunday morning. The event was an unexpected success, and the lecture hall was filled to capacity. Among those who attended were many ladies and also several of the oldest pupils of the Free Thought school, accompanied by their teacher, Miss Zeman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tichava, chairman of the local alliance, opened the program promptly at 10:30 A. M. Miss Tana Vojan, piano virtuoso, then played the famous Rachmaninov composition, "Prelude". This piano solo, the meaning of which is usually interpreted as the struggle of a man with his fate, was a fitting introduction to the speech of Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, who spoke upon the theme, "Ernest Denis and the Significance of His Life Work".....Next Sunday Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, an editor, will speak on "Blue Laws".</p>
