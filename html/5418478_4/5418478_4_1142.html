   <p>Yesterday in Chicago dawned dull and rainy. The day dragged along and only toward evening did the clouds disappear and the sun's bright rays spread over our city. Street life in our Bohemian settlement was seemingly dull and lifeless, but inside of the houses feverish activity and nervous excitement reigned. To a stranger this commotion would seem odd, but to us Bohemians it was completely understandable. Such a mood always reigns everywhere before a long voyage is to be undertaken, and our countrymen were preparing themselves for an expedition to the Seventh Sokol Slet (Gymnastic Festival) to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Last minute preparations, calls, goodbyes to those who would not be able to say bon voyage at the railroad station; greetings <span class="page-break">\2</span>and messages to loved ones in the old country: all these things must be done on the last day. Also there is plenty of advice and warnings from older and more experienced people--but you yourself know it very well.</p>
   <p>Bohemian-America is dispatching its fifth Sokol's expedition to our native land. Four times the official representatives of Bohemian-American Sokols have shaken hands with their brothers in Bohemia; four times they have been pompously greeted in Prague; four times they have brought back the enthusiasm to their own Sokol units--but this year's expedition should excel them all! At the time of the previous visits, our old country was under the cursed yoke of Hapsburgs, under whose cruel rule our Sokols were unable to spread their wings according to their own wishes and desires. This Seventh Sokol Slet will be the first one held in our liberated old country. Thus, the prophecy of Jan Amos Komensky has become a reality. The great educator of nations almost three hundred years ago had said that the time will come when the Bohemian people will again govern themselves.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Thus today, the Bohemian-American Sokols are going to visit an independent Czechoslovakian Republic which they helped to build and which they have dreamed of ever since the outbreak of the World War. Today the Bohemian-American Sokols can proudly step upon the dear soil of our forefathers because--notwithstanding the fact that the great Atlantic Ocean separates us--the true sons of Bohemia did not forget their native land. They were among the first ones who awakened and brought forth the greatest possible sacrifices for its liberation: their estates, blood, and lives. The Bohemian-American Sokols in the struggle for liberation of our native land gave distinct proof that they are not a commonplace organization; that in times of necessity they are ready to change from words to deeds; that they are worthy of the famous glory of the old Slavs!</p>
   <p>How much interest this expedition created among Bohemians of Chicago was evidenced by the colossal participation of our people who appeared at this final <span class="page-break">\4</span>parting. Before 6 P. M. groups of our countrymen hurried to the Sokol Chicago Hall at Kedzie and 24th Streets, the place of departure. At 7 P. M. Mr. Jurena's band played a swift march, after which Sokols Joseph Paskovsky and Antonin Dolezal gave final instructions concerning the expedition. Then the crowd moved out to the street where the band, in front of the Sokol Chicago Hall, played the "Star-Spangled Banner". Sokol Frantisek Horlivy, in the name of the arrangement committee, spoke to the participants. He spoke of how joyfully the Bohemian-American Sokols traveled to the Sokol Slets in former years,and how they brought home some of the enthusiasm of the homeland. The participants in today's expedition can be twice as proud and happy because they will attend the first Sokol Slet to be held in our free native land. In conclusion Mr. Horlivy asked the participants to deliver the message from Bohemian-American Sokols to the Sokols in Prague that as long as there is a single Sokol in the United States, the Bohemian-American branch will not die out. His speech was applauded and rewarded with boisterous "Na Zdar!" (Good Luck).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The band then played the Bohemian anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home). Sokol Antonin Dolezal explained to the participants the importance of this Sokol Slet in Prague. He further called the attention of the participants to the aid which the Bohemian-American Sokols are bringing to Prague in the form of $50,000 worth of certificates of the American Food Administration in Czechoslovakia. The subscription of a $50,000 voluntary loan had not been as successful as was expected; and therefore the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union) was forced to borrow enough to make up the difference. In view of that fact Mr. Dolezal asked the brothers and sisters who remain behind, as well as all friends of the Sokol idea, not to stop collecting, but to endeavor, as soon as possible, to keep their pledge of honor given to the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze (Czechoslovak Sokol Union of Prague), a pledge which was voluntarily given by the Sokols of America.</p>
   <p>The participants then marched to 24th Street via Homan Avenue, then to 26th Street, east to Kedzie Avenue, and north to the Douglas Park elevated station.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Mr. Jurena's band played to keep the marchers in step. Near the elevated station part of the participants entered waiting automobiles, of which there were many; the rest boarded the elevated trains, and they all hurried to the La Salle Street Station. The parade was accompanied by a squad of regular and motorcycle policemen. According to our estimation, several thousands of our countrymen witnessed the parade. The streets were so crowded that it was almost impossible to keep order--the street resembled a great forward-moving wave. Not only those who accompanied their relatives were around, but also many of our people who came to sight-see. There were many parting scenes, some of which were very impressive.</p>
   <p>The crowd at the railroad station was no better. Although not all of those who were in front of the Sokol Chicago Hall came, the La Salle Street Station was overcrowded. Individual travelers pushed through the throngs with difficulty. Two special Nickel Plate railroad trains were waiting for the participants to carry them to the New York harbor. Almost one hour elapsed before <span class="page-break">\7</span>all were entrained and parting scenes were repeated. In the meantime Jurena's band played selections before both trains which stood along side of each other. Finally at 9:10 P. M. a command was sounded, a locomotive bell started to ring, and wheels began to turn; travelers bade a last farewell to their friends and relatives; the band played "Kde Domov Muj"; and the train pulled out of the station. Five minutes afterward a second command sounded, the band played "Hej Slovane" (Ho, All you Slavic Peoples), then the Slovakian anthem "Nad Tatrou Sa Blyska" (Above the Tatra Mountains Lightning Flashes), and the second train slowly moved forward. Hundreds of farewell cries, hundreds of smiles, many tears, and the fragrant scent of floral gifts drifted through the atmosphere created by the parting scenes. Suddenly both trains disappeared beyond the railroad bend into the darkness.</p>
   <p>Even the station attendants and policemen who are accustomed to various scenes, gazed after the trains which carried the Czechoslovaks to New York--brothers <span class="page-break">\8</span>of those Czechoslovaks from Siberia who traveled during the past two years to Czechoslovakia across the American continent, and to whom all America tendered its compliments.</p>
   <p>According to information received, the expedition will reach New York on Saturday, May 22, at 5 A. M. and will board the ships the same day. Over 700 of the participants will board the ship Mauretania, the others the Norddam. Including those who came from Western and Northern states, 365 participants departed from Chicago to New York yesterday. The entire Sokol expedition, according to reports of the Sokol Slet expedition office, numbers 715 persons. It is, in fact, the largest Bohemian-American expedition undertaken to our old native land.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the expedition and wish them bon voyage, much success and--a happy return. "Na Zdar!"</p>
