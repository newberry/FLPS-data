   <p>Professor T. G. Masaryk, who is being given brilliant receptions by the most influential circles in America, has come to Chicago again. The Czech and Slovak people of Chicago rejoice greatly over this visit.</p>
   <p>Professor Harry Pratt Judson, renowned president of the University of Chicago, has extended to Professor Masaryk an invitation to deliver a lecture on May 27, at that seat of high learning.</p>
   <p>There will be a select American audience, which is going to hear about the significance of this war in regard to the Czechoslovak problems. The University is making elaborate preparations for the lecture, which will give the Americans of Chicago a rare opportunity to listen to a man whose influence on current political developments has been so markedly felt.</p>
   <p>The lecture will be held at Mandel Hall at 4:30 P.M. The United Czech choruses <span class="page-break">\2</span>will sing under the baton of their leader, Mr. Houdek.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance will give away a few tickets for the lecture. Those interested may apply at the office of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Another lecture for the masses of the Czech and Slovak people will be held Tuesday at 8 P.M. in Pilsen Brewery Park or, in case of bad weather, at Harrison High School. We expect that thousands of our people will come to hear our leader to whom, today, the whole world is paying close attention. Congressman Adolph J. Sabath is also expected to appear on that occasion. He helped prepare the brilliant reception given to Masaryk at Washington, and has been rendering most valuable service to the Czechoslovak cause by virtue of his position in the capital.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance, the Slovak League, and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics intend to make the lecture an occasion at which the Czechs and Slovaks can manifest their devotion to the American Red Cross. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>admission for the second lecture, for the public at large, is only ten cents. The entire proceeds will be given to the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>We have been expecting Masaryk for fully four years. We used to say to each other, "Oh, how we wish Masaryk would come among us!" Well, Masaryk is among us! He came in a turbulent time, in a time when gallows are again being raised above our pitiful homeland--in a time when the old henchmen are flogging our people with iron whips.</p>
   <p>Masaryk comes as spokesman of the nation; he comes as interpreter of ten million people, he comes to speak in the biggest community of the largest branch of our people outside of the homeland--he comes as our beloved leader.</p>
   <p>The Czech and Slovak people will come in immense throngs to hear their leader voice the hopes and wishes of the nation. On to Pilsen Park!</p>
