   <p>Citizens! All of you who are members of the Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek v Cicero (Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers' Association of Cicero, Illinois) are asked to attend the graduation exercises of our school for citizenship which are to take place next Thursday, September 14, at 7:30 P. M. in the T. G. Masaryk School Building (our club rooms). One hundred six candidates for citizenship will receive their diplomas, which are requisite before these men may apply for their final [citizenship] papers....It is, of course, known to you that the citizenship school was organized and conducted by our Spolek, and it is therefore desirable that we all be there to encourage the students by taking part in the ceremony. A pleasant surprise awaits every man attending the graduation exercises.</p>
   <p>Jindrich Krcek, president,</p>
   <p>Vaclav Rous, secretary.</p>
