   <p>The first league game of the season ended in an unexpected victory for the team of the Sparta-Union. The men on this team proved that they are really first-class players. The game was played at Pullman under ideal weather conditions and attended by a large crowd of Bohemian sports-loving people who followed every phase of the game with undivided interest.</p>
   <p>The Czech team on this occasion acquitted itself nobly in an extremely difficult game. The fondness for sport, and the agility of our players are, of course, acquirements which are understood by us. It is hard to describe the good points of each individual player, but the team as a whole worked with a machine-like precision, increasing its tempo as the game progressed. The Sparta-Union was represented in full strength by the following: Tajchman, Grunt, Turek, Simandl, Krahulec, Cunat, Trojanek, Planeta, Stejskal, Rubin, and Perch. The Czechs were favored <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by a strong wind but handicapped by the blinding rays of the autumn sun. They entered into the fray with great gusto. By a combination play they crowded their rivals into their own territory; the Pullman team was able to withstand this onslaught for twenty minutes; the Czechs were nevertheless able to gain the lead by Trojanek's direct shot. The defense technique of the Pullman players was thereby visibly disorganized, which was fully taken advantage of by the Czech team so that two minutes after Trojanek's shot, Planeta scored another one. Six minutes after that a penalty shot was ordered against the Czechs by the umpire, and Pollit, the Pullman right wing delivered a cannon-ball shot--the first one--between the Czech goal posts. The Czech combination plays continued to harass their opponents....but the score remained unchanged until the end of the first half.</p>
   <p>During the second half of the game the Czechs changed their position, and this time, playing against the wind, aroused much concern among Czech <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>visitors. After the kick-off Rubin saw his chance, however, and making a violent sally from the middle of the field, shot the third goal; being wildly cheered by the Czech people. Before the Czech audience could calm down, two minutes later, Rubin....shot the fourth goal between the posts of the rivals.</p>
   <p>After these gains were made by the Czechs, the Pullman team reorganized, and successfully prevented subsequent attacks by the Sparta-Union. With the wind behind them their play improved and they made several violent attacks on the Czech goal. The effective defense technique of the Czechs made their progress impossible, however. Twenty minutes after the kick-off Planeta scored again, but the umpire did not credit this off-side shot. Three minutes later Planeta made the last (fifth) shot from Trojanek's center position....Nine minutes following this Czech gain, the right halfback of the Pullman team, Black, scored for his team by a head shot. The excellent defense and reserves of the Czech team held the forward player of the Pullman team back until the finish. The score was 5 to 2 in favor <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of the Czechs. The boys went home overjoyed, for with them went two more valuable points which were gained by the Sparta-Union and an increased hope for their future. They fully deserved their victory.</p>
