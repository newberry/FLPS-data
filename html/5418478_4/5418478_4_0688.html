   <p>Chicago Bohemians celebrated an occasion yesterday which will be and must be remembered for all time as one of the most important historical moments of our life in America. It was the ceremonial laying of the cornerstone of the new Bohemian Liberal (Freethought) Vojta Náprstek school. Surely, there is not one single Czech in Chicago, in fact in all of America, who has not heard of this school, and from that which he heard, who is not convinced that the Vojta Náprstek school is one of the most advanced Bohemian institutions in America, which deserves to be looked upon with respect, and for which we must have great hopes. Yes, we look upon this school with respect, and it is also deserving of our respect. There surely are only a few Bohemian families in Bohemian-California, if indeed there are any such whose <span class="page-break">\2</span>children do not know how to speak, read, and write Bohemian correctly. And not only that, they also know Bohemian history, Bohemian geography and what means most, they feel themselves to be Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the assiduous trustees, thanks to the instructors, and thanks to that great love of our California countrymen toward the Vojta Náprstek school, it has been possible to reach the goal, that this school is bringing up our Bohemian children, and in that manner, it is preserving and elevating our Bohemian cause in America.</p>
   <p>It is not to be wondered that yesterday was awaited with almost feverish expectancy and that not only the Bohemians of California, but of the whole city of Chicago, gathered to take part in the celebration, of which, alas, we have not had very many of the kind and of which, we hope there will be many more. It was indeed too bad that the weather was not favorable so as to allow the ceremonies to proceed in accordance with the program.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It was unfortunate the fierce blizzard had to roar into Chicago yesterday morning just at the time when the cornerstone laying ceremonies for the Vojta Náprstek school were to take place. That circumstance harmed the superficial brilliance of the celebration, and if we are not mistaken, also materially damaged the trustees who expected a big, financial success, but still it did not keep the people from gathering in large crowds at Homan and 26th Streets, where the new school is being built. Hundreds of people gathered there before the arrival of the parade, disregarding the storm. After the arrival of the parade, it was seen that there was no use trying to hold the ceremonies at the place as everything was covered with snow. It would have been a risk of health of both the speakers and the listeners to try to remain and hold the ceremony in that bad weather. The arrangements committee decided to hold the ceremony in the Sokol Chicago hall on Kedzie Avenue.</p>
   <p>When the parade arrived at the site of the new building, the president of <span class="page-break">\4</span>the trustee board, Mr. Richard Dusil, appeared upon the speakers platform and announced that the main ceremony would take place in Sokol Chicago hall. The parade immediately set out for the Sokol Chicago hall, to which place the metal box was taken, and into which various coins, papers, and other mementos are to be placed.</p>
   <p>The celebration at the hall began with a prologue by the president of the trustee board, Mr. Richard Dusil, who warmly welcomed those present and thanked the Bohemians of California for all the favors which they showed toward the Vojta Náprstek school during the past fifteen years. He asked them to continue to do likewise in the future.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the trustee board then took the floor, and read some interesting notes on the activities of the school. He mentioned also that the construction of the building will be carried out according to plans of the architect, John Klucina, and that the cost will be about $27,500. The notes <span class="page-break">\5</span>which Mr. Topinka read are written on parchment, and will be placed in the metal box with the other mementos. The box will probably be placed in the cornerstone tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Then followed the festival oration by Doctor Iska. The speaker directed his words to the life and influence of the teacher of our nation, John Amos Komensky, and having briefly described his influence, he added that it was a striking coincidence that almost on the anniversary of his birth, March 28, the Bohemian-Americans celebrate this significant occasion. The speaker also spoke to the adolescents. He mentioned the significance of the name of Vojta Náprstek. His talk was heard with interest and understanding. Then followed several selections played by the band, after which other speakers were heard. The chairman then invited the delegates of the various organizations represented to speak. This they did, at the same time offering the contributions of their respective organizations to the trustees of the school.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The total amount of these contributions was $558. The celebration was terminated with a dance. The entertainment was delightful, thanks to Mr. Brousek's fine orchestra. Dancing continued, and no one wanted to leave until daylight began to creep in through the windows.</p>
