   <p>P.11--This school has been opened among the Bohemian people of Chicago because they sincerely requested it. They know that in order to progress in America, one must learn to speak, read, and write the English language. It has long been their wish to have a school where they could learn the language systematically and thoroughly. Their wish has been realized in Professor Steiner's school.</p>
   <p>Many students of the school have already progressed socially and in the commercial world.</p>
   <p>Professor Steiner teaches his students personally by day and in the evening. The school is located at Eighteenth Street and Ashland Avenue. There are also classes at Twenty-sixth Street and Homan Avenue.</p>
