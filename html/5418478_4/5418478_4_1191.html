   <p>The question of whether the Slavia or the Rangers are to be considered the victors in a recent soccer game was decided in favor of the former at the last meeting of the Czech Football League. Mr. Svarc thereupon announced that the Rangers, a club of Czech-American workingmen, as a result of the decision, would give up their membership in the Czech Football League.</p>
   <p>The sports editor of the Denni Hlasatel remarks about the controversial incident that the C. F. K. (Cesky Football Klub - Czech Football Club), in order to be fair to the two contending clubs, referred the matter to the Illinois League, which overruled the Rangers' protest, declaring the Slavia the winner.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The name "football" used in the Czech language means "soccer"; hence the ambiguity.]</p>
