   <p>In the last meeting which was held by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol V Chicagu (Associated Bohemian Free-Thought Schools of Chicago) on Sunday, November 19, 1911, a letter was read from the Svaz Svobodomyslnych V New Yorku (Free-Thought Organization in New York) in which they refute the accusation that the Chicago delegate to the recent convention of the Rationalist Society which was held in New York, in the proceedings dealing with questions concerning the Czech Liberal Schools in America completely ignored the Czech schools of Chicago. However, in this letter there was not a single proof advanced which would really prove the contrary of the above assertion. It was resolved to ask the New York organization for a notarized excerpt from the minutes of that convention. If it shows that the delegate was wrongfully judged, he will no doubt receive satisfaction because the Association recognizes all meritorious work, whether done by an individual or an organization. Until this proof is received, the Association cannot retract any charges.</p>
   
   <p>A letter was received from the Grand Lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Society), containing the contribution for the third quarter from its thirty-two lodges, in the amount of $223.89. This was accepted with thanks.</p>
   <p>A summary of the year's activities together with a letter of explanation will be sent to the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-American Foresters.</p>
   <p>The trustees of the school in Town of Lake have requested the Association to maintain a daily school after December 1, because the teacher at that school has so many pupils this year that it is impossible to teach all of them. More than one hundred pupils have made application for instruction. The request was unanimously approved and the school committee will take care of necessary arrangements. The school committee was entrusted with the investigation of the conduct of the instructor of the Irving Park school. The members of this committee request that the committee be enlarged so that it will be able to handle properly its many duties. This request was approved, and two additional members were elected to the committee.</p>
   <p>One of the delegates complained about the false assertions of a certain Mr. Martinek, who, by the way, is a Sokol, and who injures the interests of Czech schools by his incorrect statements. The Association has, of course, more important work to take care of than to give publicity to someone to whom Bohemian-American schools are unknown, and who wants to criticize something which he does not understand of does not want to understand. However, in order that such an incident will not be possible of repetition, the Association expects to make public in these columns a detailed report of a year's activities of the Association, its various receipts and disbursements, the mainteneacd of schools, salaries of instructors, etc. From this report the entire Bohemian public interested in the Czech schools will see how the work has progressed, and it will find that our schools have improved decidedly of hate, even though use was not made of any magnum ballyhoo.</p>
   
   <p>The committee which had charge of the arrangements for the picnic for the children of all Czech Liberal Schools which was held during the month of July, presented a revised report, from which it is found that receipts were $357.50 and disbursements $291.01, leaving a clear profit of $66.49, which was turned in and for which the committee was given a vote of thanks.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Doctor Mueller, is authorized to receive from the committee for the arrangement of the festive ceremonies for the unveiling of the Karel Havlice monument one-half of the profit, as was promised.</p>
   <p>The local Unity of Liberals are respectfully requested to present a report in regard to the profits from the lecture given for the benefit of the schools.</p>
   <p>Mr. Linhard, an instructor, announced that he was written a comedy and that he wishes to donate the profit from the first performance for the benefit of our schools; this was accepted with gratitude.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes offered to make free of charge repairs which are needed at the Svatopluk Cech school. He was thanked for the offer. All teachers are requested to make monthly reports in duplicate, one copy for the trustees of the school where they teach and one copy to be sent to the Association and addressed to the secretary of the central scholastic committee. When the Association, in which are represented <span class="gap">[gap]</span>7,047 members, asks for the approval of an increase in quarterly assessments from three cents to five cents for its schools in Chicago (of which it has seventeen with thirty-two classes in which are registered 153<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Czech children, taught by twenty teachers), it has in view only the good of those children already attending school and likewise those children who continually apply but who cannot be accommodated because there is not enough room. The contributions now an hand are only sufficient to take care of the children already attending the schools. If these other children are to be considered, and if they are not be sent to schools of various religious sects, it is urgent that the above requested increase in assessments be accepted by all members. If people are found in your societies who would protest against this increase, let us call their attention to the significance and purpose of our schools for our future. Remember that by approving the increase of these assessments, and other support you are not doing good for the delegates, you are doing it for these fifteen hundred children registered in the Czech Liberal Schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Receipts of this meeting, $543.29.</p>
   <p>Disbursements, $715.74.</p>
