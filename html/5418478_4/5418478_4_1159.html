   <p>The Slovak Sokol community comprises seven groups which are in Chicago, Chicago Heights, Hawthorne, and Cleveland, Ohio. It had planned to give a public exhibition of drills in Atlas Park, a well-known resort near the Bohemian National Cemetery, last Saturday. This affair came to naught, for most of the Sokols are now in the Czechoslovak or the American Army. The whole performance boiled down to drills executed by twelve senior and eight junior Sokol girls. None of the seven groups were in a position to send a single regular team or even individual seasoned gymnasts. Paul Podmatersky directed the exhibition by the girls, and some of the Czech Sokols present acted as judges. In the afternoon there was a group drill with music, as practice for today's public drills, in which all members including pupils are to participate. The managers hope that, not withstanding the handicaps, the day will result in a presentable showing.</p>
