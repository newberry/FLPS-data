   <p>The Bohemian Review [Possibly the Czecho-Slovak Review, published in Chicago, is meant here] will be kept on the shelves of the main Library of Taylor, Texas, and in the University Library of that city, in order to enlighten students on the history of the Czech nation. Doctor Law, dean of the English department of the University, has promised that all the books in use now and containing faulty information about us shall be eliminated. In some of them we are described as a nation without an history, and classified with illiterate Russians, Southern Italians, and neglected Macedonians.</p>
   <p>There will be also courses on the history of other oppressed nations, as Poles, Croatians, etc. All the professors in charge of the classes have been furnished correct data on the history of those nations.</p>
