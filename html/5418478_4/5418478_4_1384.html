   <p>A committee composed of delegates from local Sokol units held a meeting yesterday morning in the "Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) hall the purpose of which was to decide on preliminary steps for the arrangement of a world-wide international gymnastic exhibition during the existence of the World's Fair. After a somewhat lengthy discussion, it was decided to ask the local American Gymnastic Union to arrange for the election of delegates among the individual units, so that further plans may be worked up in a joint meeting. It is impossible to say definitely whether such a gymnastic exhibition will be given; nevertheless, our gymnasts, especially the older ones, should start training diligently, so that the appearance of Bohemians in this gigantic arena may be dignified.</p>
   <p>A meeting of delegates was called for yesterday afternoon in order to agree upon arrangements for a joint public exhibition to be held in one of the larger halls, such as was the one given in Battery "D" which all recall with such pleasure. It would be fitting that the "Sokol" clubs again give such an exhibition and with that we make known the wish, that they should meet on the gymnastic field with all their old time power and vigor, which adds brilliance to gymnastics, and brings many more followers to gymnastic ideals.</p>
