   <p>p.2--When the Czech Guard began the movement for the erection of a monument to the memory of Karel Havlicek Borovsky, and when at the same time contributions for this purpose were pouring in, no one could tell where the monument was to be located.</p>
   <p>The Guard assumed that some park would be selected; later however, this proposition proved to meet with difficulties. There arose the idea of placing the monument in the Bohemian National Cemetery, but even some of the most ardent of its advocates came to the conclusion that while the cemetery was a most beautiful resting place for the dead, a name of Havlicek's import could not be properly associated with a cemetery. The Sokol gymnastic associations thereupon took up the question with the Czech Guard, and from manifold conferences there issued the plan of buying a ten acre lot, in the center of which, upon an eminence, the monument should be posted in a commanding position.</p>

   <p>An afterthought reduced the size of the site to five acres. The location of the monument relative to our city, however, was not yet determined by a long margin. The other part of the question as to who was going to buy the site has not been given serious consideration; the time for the erection is still remote.</p>
