   <p>Bohemian Americans will read with great pleasure that the last obstacle in the way of the erection of the monument for Karel Jonash, the indecision as to its location, has finally been eliminated. The committees in charge, in a meeting at Racine, Wis., came to the conclusion that the choice of the site should be left to the judgment of a commission consisting of three artists: M. J. Korbel, the sculptor intrusted with the creation of the monument proper; the eminent architect Jens Jensen, and the painter, and professor at the Chicago Art Institute, our fellow countryman, A. Sterba. The decision of the commission will be final. After that, Sculptor Korbel can devote his entire time and energy to his work, which will be not only a decorative asset for Racine, but also a manifestation of the high artistic flight of the Czech spirit in America.</p>
