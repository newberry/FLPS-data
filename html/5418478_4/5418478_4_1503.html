   <p>The meeting of the preparatory committee for the erection of a Jan Huss memorial, held on May 5, 1912, in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolek (Czecho-slavonic Benevolent Society), was called to order by the vice-president, Mrs. Marie Pomazal. A large number of delegates from Chicago lodges were present. The minutes of the previous meeting of the committee and of the special committee were approved. The chairman, Mrs. Pomazal, then recognized Dr. Frantisek Iska, who explained at length the purpose of erecting the Huss memorial, and at the same time referred to the moral necessity of such a structure. He then pointed out in what manner the means for the erection of the memorial could be secured. On the motion of Mr. Joseph Hejno, it was resolved to include in these minutes a brief excerpt from Dr. Iska's speech. He said:</p>
   <p>"The idea of building a Huss memorial in Chicago through the joint efforts of all American Freethinking Bohemians originated in the recognition that the five-hundredth anniversary of the burning at the stake of Jan Huss should be commemorated in a dignified and lasting manner.</p>
   <p>"It is certain that in 1915 the interest of the whole civilized world will be concentrated upon Jan Huss. Here in America, also, much will be written about the person, significance, and death of Jan Huss. However, few people in non-Bohemian circles will remember the Bohemian origin of the man who is commemorated by the whole world. Here in this land, inhabited by a mixture of peoples, it is up to our American-Bohemians to turn the attention of non-Bohemians to the Bohemian origin of Jan Huss. If the Bohemians of America build a dignified Huss memorial in Chicago, they will have publicly emphasized and reminded everyone of the Bohemian nationality of this world celebrity, and at the same time we shall have acquired a building in which we will be able to work in the spirit of Jan Huss.</p>
   <p>"The Huss memorial would be an institution from which would come not only encouragement, but also moral support to all our communities where there is the will to work toward national and progressive trends. Periodic teachers' courses could be given here for persons from rural Bohemian-America who are willing to take upon themselves the position of teachers in their schools.</p>
   <p>"The Huss memorial could be the center for all of our public and community life. The Huss memorial could be used by singing societies and amateur actors for material suitable for production in their communities. The Huss memorial at the same time would be a social headquarters which rural countrymen arriving in Chicago would use as a home.</p>
   <p>"The Huss memorial will have its own source of revenue and its own friends. It will be built! What the expenditure will be is impossible to say, nor is it necessary to set a figure in advance. It will be built in accordance with the means at hand. Upon a simple proclamation in which the purpose of the Huss memorial was only briefly set forth, over 150 lodges and organizations have volunteered to participate. In more than fifty places, they have today a special fund for the erection of a memorial, and many of these funds have passed the fifty-dollar mark. The Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Society) of Chicago has on hand almost twelve hundred dollars, which includes the one thousand dollar gift of Frantisek Zdrubek. I do not wish to guess at the total amount of the funds thus far available for this purpose, but I dare say that it surely is more than two thousand dollars. If this fund increases to five thousand dollars or more before July, 1913, then we will set up a legal building committee, and the entire activity will thereby come to a stage of rapid and enthusiastic development."</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the president, Mr. Vaclav Soukenik, arrived and took over the further conduct of the meeting. Several other speakers took part in the discussion.</p>
   <p>Communications were read and referred to the secretary for reply. Bonds for the officers were presented, approved, and turned over to the keeping of the president. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
