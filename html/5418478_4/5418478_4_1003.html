   <p>It was only recently that the Dorostovy Klub Sokola Karel Jonas (Adolescent Club of the Sokol Karel Jonas) was organized under the sanction of the board of directors of the Sokol and the instructor, Mr. Brouk. It is progressing satisfactorily. In order to pay off the mortgage on their building, the members of the club are busy rehearsing for their first theatrical performance which is to be given tomorrow. The play is taken from the legend, "Kasparek Krajankem" (Kaspar as a Countryman), a fairy tale. There will be an accompaniment of songs and dances. We expect that you brothers and sisters of Cicero will attend this performance and thus give aid to a good cause.</p>
