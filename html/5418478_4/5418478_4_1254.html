   <p>Next Saturday, Independence Day, will be celebrated by the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Sokol Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs) by a Slet (Sokol mass meeting) in Cleveland, Ohio. Preparations for this Slet have been under way for some time, and it is expected that it will be the most successful one which this steadily growing Sokol organization has ever held. All constituent bodies of the Zupa will send their best gymnasts to Cleveland, and there is no doubt that very keen competition will develop around all events of the contest. Chicago, which is the central point of the Zupa, will send a large number of men and women and many non-competing members to Cleveland. A special train carrying the Chicago delegation will leave tomorrow morning.....</p>
