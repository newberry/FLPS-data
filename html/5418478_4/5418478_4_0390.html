   <p>The school board of the Ceske Svobodne Skoly (Bohemian Free Thought Schools) requests all teachers to bring the children of their schools either to the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs or to the Vojta Naprstek [Bohemian Free Thought] School this Sunday, September 17, at 1 P. M. The children attending the Pilsen and the Town of Lake schools are to be taken to the Vojta Naprstek School; those of the west and the north sides are to come to the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs [at the time specified]. The procession will start at 1:30 P. M. sharp.</p>
   <p>Attention is also called to the school contest which will end on Sunday on the occasion of the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Country Festival) at 6 P. M. Prizes will be awarded to the school which has the highest relative enrollment. We believe this to be the most equitable way of dealing with the situation. Au revoir till next Sunday, then, when all of us are to meet at the Posviceni! Those schools which are to take part in the procession will dismiss their morning classes.</p>
