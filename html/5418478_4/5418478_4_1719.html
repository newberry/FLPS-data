   <p>Yesterday the seventh and eighth sessions of the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) were held. The morning (seventh) session was opened by the president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek at 9 A.M. All of the officers and delegates were present. After repeating the slogan of the Jednota, the reading of the minutes of the previous sessions was to have taken place, but since printed copies of the minutes were not yet available, the reading was deferred until a later hour. Instead, such congratulatory messages as reached the convention [since yesterday] were read. Sister Anna Kother of the Laska K Vlasti (Patriotic Love) Lodge No. 1 of the Jednota sent her congratulations. At a sign from the president,who reminded the delegates that Sister Kother is a member of the mother lodge of the Jednota, a loud "Na Zdar!" (To Success) was voiced by the assemblage. [List of letters <span class="page-break">\2</span>and telegrams from various lodges, societies, and individuals is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Mr. A. J. Cejka, of St. Louis, Missouri, sent a message in verse. [Translator's note: I have not attempted to translate the verse and retain the original rhyme; instead I have given as close a translation of the twenty-nine lines in prose as possible to convey the full meaning:]</p>
   <p>"Honored and dear sisters: The time of worthy labors and industry is past, and with it the manifold sorrows which life had allotted. For you that grand moment hath come this day in which the love of goodness can wonders perform. It is a love for people who suffer in their misery; a love for orphans who vainly call for their mothers. Condemned to be members of the poor classes, forever such, they [the orphans] see in you their dear benefactors. Robbed of their fathers who would give them their daily bread, these children now confront you. There is no one who would earn that bread for them but you.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>They would have to hunger were it not for you.</p>
   <p>"Such love as you now show was never lacking among you; it did not cease to shine, as the rays of sun do not cease to shine. Because many among you cared for these poor orphans, your faces shine, adorned by their gratitude. And now you flew as so many bees around their hive to gather sweetness from your own blossoms, the sweetness of love which you are ready to bestow wherever needed, and if needs be to make the gift of love immediate. And that dear Mother country ['mother' was capitalized] of ours, she, too, rejoices far beyond the seas, enjoying with us all your fruitful work. You have saved her for a buoyant life. Now she, too, celebrates with you her family reunion, and cultivates anew your good and prideful work, a mighty work and a firm one, so full of beauty and so full of love which you will bequeath to your own children.</p>
   <p>"Your admirer wishes you plenty of success!"</p>
   <p>The convention rose to its feet to signify its appreciation for all of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>messages.</p>
   <p>The work of amending the constitution and bylaws was resumed. A lively debate was started by the question of whether a convention delegate may represent more than one lodge. It was pointed out that a lodge which is not strong enough and the financial condition of which is not good enough to permit the sending of a delegate to a convention, could be represented at a convention by the central committee. The delegates decided [however] that this matter be allowed to remain as before. It was further decided that in case of the death of a lodge president, that office shall be filled by a vice-president. It was decided that the central committee should not consider and [use] the occasion of death [of a member] to collect funds for national purposes....This is to be done only by levying a special tax. When the question of duties of individual officers of the central committee came up for discussion, it was decided that the chairman [of that committee] be a deciding factor, and that she, together with the rest of the presiding committee, be responsible <span class="page-break">\5</span>for the transaction of the convention business and the induction and installation of new lodges into the Jednota.</p>
   <p>The amount of bond which a treasurer of the central committee must furnish was fixed at $5,000 instead of the previous $3,000. The salaries of the future officers of the central committee shall be as follows: president, $100; vice-president $35; secretary, $300; financial secretary, $375; treasurer, $50; sergeant at arms, $15; custodian, $15. In the committee on property (consisting of two members), each member shall receive $20 annually, and the members of the auditing committee (three members) shall receive $15 each for the same period. Hitherto the annual salaries of the above-mentioned officers were the following: president, $75; vice-president, $25; secretary, $250; financial secretary, $325; treasurer, $40; sergeant at arms, $10; custodian, $10; members of the committee on property, $15 each, members of the auditing committee, $10 each.</p>
   <p>It was further decided that country lodges be given the privilege of being represented in the Grand Lodge by a sister residing in the city in which the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Grand Lodge is located. In case such country lodges should not have among its members a sister who resides in or near the place where the Grand Lodge is located, it must deal with the Grand Lodge directly. (As special examples the towns of Coal City, Illinois, East St. Louis, Illinois, and certain other such places located in the state of Ohio were cited.)</p>
   <p>The seventh session ended at noon and the delegates repaired to the dining hall for a joint dinner. The eighth session was opened at 1 P.M. again by the convention president, Sister Marie Hajek. Immediately before the convention started, Mr. John A. Cervenka, president of the Pilsen Brewing Company, was introduced to the assembled delegates. He desired to say a few words to the assemblage, a request which was gladly granted. Mr. Cervenka greeted the delegates, especially the out-of-towners, and asked the sisters who are members of local lodges to co-operate with other organizations and clubs in propagandizing a protest mass meeting and demonstration to take place next Wednesday at the Coliseum in the interest of permitting the sale and manufacture of light wines and beers. The president of the convention expressed her hopes that the local <span class="page-break">\7</span>lodges will surely co-operate in this respect, and the chairman of the festivities committee thanked Mr. Cervenka in the name of all the delegates for his hospitality.</p>
   <p>After raising the slogan banner, the roll was called. Every officer and delegate was in her place. [The work of] amending the constitution and bylaws was resumed. Chapter X included a new (seventh) article which reads as follows: "It will be the duty of the Grand Lodge to arrange for educational lectures and noble entertainment at appropriate times with the co-operation of local lodges. Should such work require financing, and should the majority of lodges agree that it be financed, it will be the duty of all local lodges to contribute equally to this end according to the number of members each such lodge will have. The Grand Lodge shall likewise have the right to use an appropriate sum of money for these purposes out of its own treasury, provided that the aforesaid purposes are for the good and the development of the Jednota."</p>
   <p>The transactions were briefly interrupted at this time to admit the delegation <span class="page-break">\8</span>of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) which sought admittance. After being so admitted, the president of the Federation, Mr. A. Cada, gained the floor. He congratulated the convention upon its work and expressed his good wishes for the [continued] growth of the entire Jednota. He thanked the delegates for the aid and support given to the Svaz and requested that it continue, for all such aid and support shall now be used chiefly for the publication of a weekly periodical titled Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason). The president of the convention thanked him for his remarks, whereupon another member of the delegation of the Svaz, Mr. Josef Musil addressed the assemblage in the name of the Illinois Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers. His remarks, too,were congratulatory. He was thanked by the president of the convention who also assured both speakers that the convention would deliberate upon the matter presented by them.</p>
   <p>After this delegation left, the work of amending the constitution and bylaws continued. Chapter XI, descriptive of the duties of the officers of the Grand <span class="page-break">\9</span>Lodge, received few and imperceptible changes and corrections. A hot debate ensued when the determination of the language to be used by the Jednota as its official medium for transacting business came up for discussion. Shall it be Bohemian or English? The Cleveland delegates, especially, were strong for permitting the use of English as the official medium of transaction in certain lodges, and the right to organize new lodges in which the official language would be English. They declared that such lodges would benefit the entire Jednota. The opposition argued that if the Bohemian character of the Jednota was good for a Bohemian mother, the same Jednota must be good for the daughter of a Bohemian mother who....certainly should endeavor to have her English-speaking daughter speak Bohemian so that that language would not be forgotten. The president of the convention, Sister Marie Hajek, who spoke in favor of retaining Bohemian as the transaction medium of the Jednota, put this matter to a vote. An over-whelming majority of the delegates voted that the language of all present lodges and all future ones too, as well as the official medium of transaction for the entire Jednota, remain Bohemian.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>In amending the constitution and bylaws, certain changes and corrections were made in sections dealing with the duties of officers of the Grand Lodge, the management of local lodges, and in part also the duties of local lodge officers. Some of these were to be changed, others merely to be corrected. The committee on constitution and bylaws is to work on these changes and suggested changes and will submit its draft to the convention today so that [further] action may be taken.....The [eighth] session of the convention ended before 4 P.M. because of the great amount of work of individual committees.</p>
   <p>Tonight, as we have already announced in our previous issue, there will be a soiree in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. This will be an affair arranged in honor of the delegates of the several lodges of the Jednota. [Names of lodges omitted in translation.] An interesting and varied program has been prepared for this soiree which will surely be found satisfactory by the guests.</p>
