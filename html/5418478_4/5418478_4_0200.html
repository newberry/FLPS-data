   <p>We have just finished the twentieth year of our journalistic activity, and with today's issue, Denni Hlasatel begins the twenty-first year of its existence. Twenty years is a long time in the life of man. Many changes occur in that time and much is accomplished. An infant becomes a young man, or woman in twenty years, and those who twenty years ago were in their prime are old men and women today.</p>
   <p>If twenty years means much in the life of an individual, it has a still greater significance in the life of a newspaper, especially such a newspaper as Denni Hlasatel, was and still is. Important work must be done every day, there is no resting here, no stopping, ever is it necessary to go forward.</p>
   <p>The publishers of Denni Hlasatel have many reasons for looking back with pride <span class="page-break">2</span>and satisfaction upon the twenty years which they have behind them. The establishment of Denni Hlasatel was difficult, more difficult than that of any other newspaper. If money is necessary for any business, there is still more need of it in the newspaper business. The publishers of Denni Hlasatel did not have money; they had only a great desire and strength for work. They had a magnificent goal before them, and so they were able to overcome all obstacles and achieve the success which fills them and their friends with joy, their enemies with envy.</p>
   <p>Like every other good, successful business, Denni Hlasatel had to contend with enemies, people who were narrow and envious, but gained one victory after another over them. It tore the mask from liars and hypocrites, called attention to people who were unfit and selfish, while at the same time it gladly helped all those who seemed to be capable, and had the good will to be helpful to the Bohemian people, and to the working class. For that reason, <span class="page-break">3</span>Denni Hlasatel has thousands of sincere friends today, and with their help hopes to continue to go forward and continue the work which it has been doing for the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>Those were trying times twenty years ago, when a group of young typographic workers decided to publish a newspaper which would be the champion of everything good and noble; which would fearlessly fight for the greatest good of humanity, the Bohemian people, and the working class. workers' organizations were still in the breech-cloth era at that time. The Bohemian people were agitated and divided into groups which mutually hated each other, and in that way destroyed every really nationalistic work. Hlasatel took it upon itself as a task first of all to unite the Bohemian people, to remove or render harmless those who were misleading or agitating them. At the same time, it kept Bohemian workingmen informed about current trends, pointing out to them the importance of organization, and guarded them against unconscionable people, seducers, self-appointed saviours, having in view, not the workingmen's interest, but only their own gain.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The knowledge that it fought for a good cause always filled the publishers of Hlasatel with enthusiasm, gave them endurance from which they continually drew new strength, and that helped them to be victorious.</p>
   <p>To be sure, great credit, for the fact that today Hlasatel can look back upon the past twenty years with such satisfaction and pride and toward the future with hope, belongs to the Bohemian public, the Bohemian workingmen, to our countrymen, who knew how to separate the grain from the chaff, who overwhelmed Hlasatel with their friendship, and helped it to reach the height upon which it stands today.</p>
   <p>That it was often a thankless, bitter work which the publishers of this paper had to perform, that to many it often seemed futile, and without result, is proven by the fact that many weak and timid people abandoned the original publishing company. However those, who had sufficient strength and energy, those who continued to have an unshaken determination to fight for ago cause which they considered good and in the final victory of which they firmly believed <span class="page-break">5</span>in, persevered, and today they are happy in the knowledge that they did not work and suffer in vain. They have accomplished a feat, which is recognized by all people of good will. They have built the largest and most complete newspaper in Bohemian-America.</p>
   <p>The publishers of Denni Hlasatel at this time consider it their duty to thank all of their friends, all of the Bohemian people for their generous and effective support in the past, and to beg of them to continue their friendship in the future. The publishers will continue to strive so as to be deserving of this support. When Denni Hlasatel, after a new twenty years has elapsed, renders an account of its activities, we hope that it will be able to do so with the same feeling of pleasure as it does today.</p>
