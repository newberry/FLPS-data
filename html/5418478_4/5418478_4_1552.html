   <p>The committee for the Havlicek celebration held a meeting in Mr. Welky's Hall last night. The meeting was sparsely attended and was presided over by the chairman, Mr. Sedlacek. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. Martinek, announced that the publicity committee held a meeting and that Dr. J. Vojan withdrew his resignation as chairman of that committee, and at the same time agreed to edit the souvenir book.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kopecky, a member of the arrangements committee, read the program which was proposed for the Havlicek monument unveiling ceremonies. The plan of the program was approved in its entirety. Mr. Kopecky announced that the parade will be phenomenal, because almost all the societies have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>responded and so far as is known there will be fourteen bands taking part in the parade.</p>
   <p>The Socialist section has complained that thus far it has not received an invitation to the celebration, although it is considered as belonging to the liberal-minded party. The secretary, Mr. Martinek, excused this because the Socialist section and the gymnastic societies do not have their addresses in the papers and that several letters were returned to him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zednik, a member of the financial committee, announced that the committee's work is progressing and that henceforth meetings will take place weekly so that all preparations will be completed. It was also announced that advertising posters are ready and will be posted next week at street corners and in public places by Mr. Hladky.</p>

   <p>The Federation of Musicians has decided that the band will cost $280 for the Sunday at the monument. No one will play for less. Mr. Brousek's band will be hired for that day.</p>
   <p>All persons who subscribed for any contribution toward the erection of the monument were requested to please live up to their agreements and remit the sums due from them to the Monument Association. This also concerns all societies and corporations no matter what sums they agreed to contribute. There are many who subscribed to contribute various amounts toward the monument, and also some corporations who subscribed contributions, but the financial secretary's call has thus far remained unanswered and the money to pay for the monument must be on hand.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes took upon himself the duty of asking Mr. W. Kolocek, chairman of the West Parks Commission, for the loan of a platform for the use of the speakers and a screen for the showing of stereoptican pictures.</p>
