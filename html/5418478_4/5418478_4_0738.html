   <p>An unusual experiment was conducted by the Czech-American school on 18th St. when there was a tour of inspection by the parents and patrons of the school. The purpose of the visit was to ascertain what progress was being made by the children and to distribute presents to the children. From 10 to 12:00 A.M. the 2nd grade was tested in English, reading, and arithmetic and proved to the parents that they were sufficiently versed in these subjects. After the second and first grades showed their ability and sang "My Country 'Tis of Thee", then the crowd adjourned to the assembly hall where the older children were given a chance to show what they knew.</p>
   <p>The session lasted until 5 o'clock in order to give all the children an opportunity. Arithmetic and reading in Bohemian was also featured in the program. The program was an inspiration to the those present as it showed conclusively what can be done with good teaching.</p>
