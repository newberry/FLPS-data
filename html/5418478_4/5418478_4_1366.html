   <p>When it was formally announced at the general staff meeting on Saturday, that the Bohemian sokols had decided to participate in the parade arranged for Thursday, General Miles' aide-de-camp stated that he heard that the Bohemian sokols make a "nice body of men," so he had looked up the addresses of their officials, in order to send them a special invitation to take part in the parade, because such organizations are ornamental to every parade. The report that the Bohemian sokols would participate in the parade aroused praiseworthy remarks from all present and the wish was expressed that as many as possible should attend. It can readily be seen that the good reputation of the sokols is wide-spread even in strange circles, and it will be quite proper to further strengthen it by participation in the parade.</p>
   <p>Let the number of those participating be as great as possible.</p>
