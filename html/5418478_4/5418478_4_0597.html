   <p>From the report of the Cesko-Americka Matice Skolska (Bohemian-American Scholastic Union) for October, 1914:</p>
   <p>The Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola (Bohemian Free-Thought School), Elizabeth, New Jersey, which was to be closed because of unemployment among the pupils' parents, has started classes and will continue regularly. Schools that have lately applied for, and been admitted to, membership in the Cesko-Americka Matice Skolska include Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola, Passaic, New Jersey; Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola, Loyalhanna, Pennsylvania; Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola, Racine, Wisconsin. Schools which are not yet members are urged to apply for membership. Communities which are able to support Bohemian schools are requested to communicate with us and secure helpful suggestions.</p>
   <p>We herewith call the attention of the Patronaty (trustees) and boards of representatives of Bohemian Free-Thought schools to the only periodical for <span class="page-break">\2</span>children of Freethinking parents, the Svobodna Skola (Free-Thought School). It is published by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicago (Federation of Bohemian Free-Thought Schools in Chicago). It has been struggling to keep alive for more than eighteen years, although it costs only fifty cents a year. There can therefore be no excuse for not subscribing for it because of the expense involved.....Write to the Svobodna Skola, 1408 South East Avenue, Oak Park, Illinois.</p>
