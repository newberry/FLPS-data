   <p>Those countrymen [of ours] who desire to become citizens [of the United States] should come [today], October 26, 1922, to the T. G. Masaryk School in Cicero, Illinois. The registration fee is one dollar, but those who have attended these citizenship classes before will be permitted to attend gratis. The school is being conducted under the supervision of the Bureau of Naturalization and the school management of the J. Sterling Morton High School.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen will thus have a good opportunity to [study the duties of a citizen,] and are hereby requested to make application for enrollment.</p>
   <p>The Committee of the Rohac Club.</p>
