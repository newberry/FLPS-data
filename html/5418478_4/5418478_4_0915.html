   <p>Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal gave a lecture in Morgan Park in which he spoke of the importance of Count Frantisek Luetzow.</p>
   <p>The best indication of progress which we as a nationality have achieved in this country is the continually increasing interest of exclusive American circles from which the Ceska-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) is constantly receiving requests for speakers who are capable of lecturing about the Czechs in an interesting and accurate fashion.</p>
   <p>A significant lecture was given last Sunday in Morgan Park, an aristocratic section of the city settled mostly by university and intermediate school professors, many of whom came in order to hear the truth about Cechi (Bohemians). After the lecture so many interested people gathered around the speaker, that he had to stay for dinner with Professor Anderson in order to have time to answer all the questions which were asked. To be sure, everyone regards <span class="page-break">2</span>Count Luetzow as the foremost authority on Czech problems, and many people are looking forward to his lecture on Friday at the University of Chicago. To those who asked about good English books about the Czechs, the works of Luetzow and Monroe were recommended. A large attendance is expected on Friday in Mandel Hall.</p>
   <p>The Ceska-Americka Narodni Rada has several other requests from Cornell Park, the Farragut High School, and from about six other elementary schools for speakers. These requests will be granted as quickly as possible.</p>
