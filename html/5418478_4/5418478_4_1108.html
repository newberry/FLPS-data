   <p>A reporter's job is not as easy and pleasant as some would imagine. A reporter must be an agreeable person, ready to please and satisfy everybody. It was my intention to write today an article which would please everybody, in order to dispel a mood of pensiveness which weighs upon many a sokol and which clouds their view of the future. The sokol activity today left its regular course and is above normal. A new life developed everywhere, the sokol halls enlivened with fresh activity, and everywhere more liveliness can be seen. The Slet (sokol mass meeting and exhibition) aroused much interest. It may be that the people who never visit the sokol halls have no idea of how industrious some of our brothers are. Let them once visit the library of the Sokol Chicago where the office of the Slet is located, and they will see how the Slet is growing. There our brother secretary works every day until the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>late hours of the night. With a group of enthusiastic helpers, he takes care of the correspondence which is already quite extensive. Hundreds of letters, countless invitations, and packs of Slet posters have already been mailed, and more and more correspondence is accumulating, waiting to be taken care of. The real sokol atmosphere of honest work and generosity prevails in the entire library. When the morning sun peeps into the library it usually finds our Slet's strategist and general, brother Jarka Kosar, already at his work. So on all sides a new life is being born with members diligently working upon the sokol idea. Not only in Chicago, but all over the United States sokoldom prepares itself for its Chicago Olympiad.</p>
   <p>Even persons who are not members of our organization are interested in our preparatory work. The Czechoslovak Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Bedrich Stepanek, in his special communication, announced his sympathy for the Slet and wants to support it to the best of his ability. He asks that regular reports on the Slet be sent to him. It will be not only our holiday, but by its significance <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it will be a holiday of our whole nation. This is good news, and it is a pleasure to report it. But no summer, no matter how beautiful it may be, is without storms and tempest; even our sokol life is not secured from weakness and personal dishonesty. Today, while we prepare ourselves to give an account of our accomplishments in America, few individuals appeared who would be able to disrupt the peaceful progress of the sokol work. I have no intention to touch this matter at all, because this article was written with the purpose of pleasing everybody. I only remark to all those who are heading the other way, that they should join us in our forward march and remain true and honest in their hearts. There is no room for hypocrites in sokoldom. Our sokoldom must not stand for, and neither must permit, this dangerous play with its ideals, but must boldly and fearlessly oppose all these crapehangers and sokol moroses. The country of sokoldom, which for a period of three hundred years was beaten and oppressed by her enemies, today in glorious and great in her sublimity and surrounded by her Slav children, looks at you, brothers and sisters, with her eyes full of motherly love, and is spreading her arms anxious to hug you to her <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>heart which feared for the safety of her children who are scattered all over the world. The warm breeze blowing from the east brings her greetings and a group of high-spirited sokols is preparing to visit us. Would you refuse them? Would you deny your country in whose sacred soil lies the bodies of your dear ones? Do you hear the voice of victorious bells? Are you for the crapehangers who preach the destruction, or are you for a strong and inseparable sokoldom? These are the thoughts which every honest sokol has in his mind today. That is the black cloud which eclipses the joyous view of the future.</p>
