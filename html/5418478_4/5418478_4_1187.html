   <p>Czech-Americans and Slovak-Americans are beginning to fear that there will not be enough young reinforcements to fill the ranks of their Sokols which are being depleted by enlistments in Uncle Sam's military service. A considerable number of Slovaks have volunteered, and compulsory service is rapidly emptying the gymnasiums.....</p>
   <p>Strong efforts are being made to fill the gaps with older men and children .....The Slovaks are sending out appeals through their newspapers, entreating those who cannot enlist at least to do their bit by sending their children to the gymnastic organizations. The older men, the papers say, do not have to engage in neck-breaking drills. They should practice body culture at a more moderate pace and yet continue to be zealous members. In this way the Sokol halls will be filled, and we can set a good example for others....Membership in Sokol societies is a sacred national obligation.....</p>
