   <p>Our public will certainly like to attend the picnic excursion which is being arranged by the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs for next Sunday. The Sokol members and their friends will meet in the cozy garden of Mr. Zdenek, Stickney, Illinois, to enjoy the end of the summer season. Since this will be an excursion of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs it should be regarded as an event not to be overlooked by anyone who loves good and friendly entertainment. The Legionnaires' band will play, and there will be other forms of entertainment to heighten the good humor of the guests. Admission is 25 cents.</p>
