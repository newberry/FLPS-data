   <p>In the preface of the Czech-English dictionary, the second edition of which appeared in 1896, Karel Jonas, the author, then living in Racine, Wis., expressed his hope that his work would establish a better understanding between his country-men and the people of their adopted country, the land of liberty.</p>
   <p>The dictionary, now in its ninth edition, contains over 38,000 words with explanations, and 624 pages. Though the price of paper has almost doubled, the dictionary is still sold for $1.75, and may be obtained at Slavia, 2544 So. Millard Avenue, Chicago, Ill.</p>
