   <p>Our famous traveler and ardent national worker, Mr. E. St. Vraz, delivered a lecture yesterday in the Bohemian-American Hall on the topic "Picturesque Travels through Bohemia and Moravia". The Hall was crowded with our public who always welcome the lectures of Mr. Vraz.....</p>
   <p>Yesterday's lecture was particularly interesting because Mr. Vraz's colorful narration was accompanied by 250 stereopticon slides, many of which were brand new and shown for the first time.....</p>
