   <p>In Mandel Hall, one of the largest halls on the University campus, a lecture was given last evening by Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, aged leader of our ideals, which are embodied in the conception of an independent Czechoslovak state. The realization of this lecture is one of the greatest achievements that we ever could have hoped for. This could not very well be termed our own affair, because the University itself had a hand in its arrangement. Professor Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University, and a sincere friend of the Czechoslovaks, had invited Masaryk to speak specifically to members of the faculty and to the student body. The lecture was designed especially for the American intelligentsia, although Czech singers, and some of the Czech leaders, were in the audience.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk delved into the meaning of the war from the standpoint of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Czechoslovaks. He emphasized the necessity of remodeling Central Europe, and the fulfillment of the just demands of our Slavonic nations, first of all the Czechoslovak. His exposition was received with general agreement and enthusiastic acclaim. This was the most significant moment of the evening. Masaryk is going to speak to our own Czechoslovak people at Pilsen Brewery Park tomorrow, but it is to President Judson we must turn with undying gratitude for having given us the opportunity, through our "Daddy" Masaryk, to advance our cause before an international audience, assembled at one of the highest seats of learning in America.</p>
   <p>Masaryk's name occupies a prominent place in the esteem of scientists here, and that is why their attention is centered upon him just now, when he appears as the spokesman of our oppressed nation, and as protagonist of that great idea contained in President Wilson's memorable message to Congress. It is, therefore, fully comprehensible that Masaryk's lecture excited the liveliest interest, so that long before the beginning, the spacious hall was filled to capacity. Besides members of the faculty, a large number of prominent <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>men were present, among them Messrs. Swift, Dickinson, and McCormick, and consuls of the Allied nations.</p>
   <p>It was nearly five o'clock when two aristocrats of the mind appeared on the platform, President Judson and Professor Masaryk. Not until the enthusiastic applause which greeted them had subsided, could President Judson introduce Professor Masaryk, as the undaunted fighter for Czechoslovak independence, and the organizer and leader of the Czechoslovak Army. In closing, President Judson expressed the wish that perhaps, in the near future, the Czechoslovaks will belong to the family of free nations, liberated from their shackles. This last remark brought forth a new storm of applause from the audience.</p>
   <p>Masaryk first gave a brief outline of what was to be the essence of his lecture, i. e., the war, and its significance for the Czechoslovaks. From his point of view, the war is nothing but the high point of the German endeavor. The Germans have been preparing for this war for a long time, because it is in the program of their plan to advance against Bagdad. Pan-Germanism is not <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>precisely a new idea, for it dates back to the eighteenth century. The advance toward the East has thus become the German national purpose, around which revolved their whole national life, interpreted by the German intelligentsia and by German genius. The German people were brought up with the conviction that they are destined to organize Central Europe and use it to strengthen themselves. The application of this policy by the Germans has grown in intensity, and was adopted so openly that one cannot help but wonder why the rest of the diplomatic world has not paid due attention to it. Even the alert English did not discern its full, dangerous extent.</p>
   <p>This Pan-German scheme is nothing new. The Teutons adopted it from the ancient Roman Empire. They first began to follow its procedure in the eighth century. They pushed toward the East, and partly assimilated, partly banished, various tribes which peopled that territory, which is part of the German Empire today. To elucidate this, Masaryk pointed to the conglomeration of various states in the map of Europe. He divides this map topographically into three zones. The large states are west, gigantic Russia is east, the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>small states fill the center. From far northern Norway and Finland, south to Greece there are nineteen of these small states, and Germany wants to absorb them one after another. They made a start by annexing the Russian provinces, and Roumania, too, is today nothing but its helpless tool.</p>
   <p>The Allies explain that their war aim is the annihilation of autocracy and imperialism but imperialism may have a many-sided meaning. To the Germans, imperialism means merely an effort to strengthen themselves. To them it is some sort of theocracy, the effort to create something gigantic in which the state and religion would represent one whole. This is simply a reflex of the dreams of ancient Rome. It means putting into practice the teaching that one ruler is needed to transform all of Central Europe; that one vassal should arise who would enslave all others. Germany should simply be a sort of nation by the grace of God. For this reason, the Germans preach autocracy, theocracy, and militarism, in glaring contrast to the Allies, who have made democracy and the interests of small nations their slogan of the war.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The Germans scorn the conception of a nationality. They deny to the small nations any right to exist. They would like to see a large nation rule and absorb the smaller nations. That one nation should be precisely their own Pan-Germanic nation. Such efforts are in contrast with the very development of history. In perusing the history of mankind, you will find that it was always the small nations to whom protection was given. It suffices to point to the liberation of the individual human being, to discern how history always tended to liberate whole nations.</p>
   <p>This is the true conception of nationalism. It is not egoism or chauvinism that this yearning for independence means; it is, indeed, an emanation of intrinsic strength and a struggle for existence. Where there is no nationalism, even internationalism becomes impossible. Socialists spread internationalism by their teachings, but this war has demonstrated how poorly these teachings were followed. The best one can do is to look upon this internationalism as an interstate condition.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Genuine internationalism will be possible only when all nations are free and able to deal with one another on the basis of their own self-determination.</p>
   <p>It will, therefore, be the task of the Allies to organize the small nations. The reorganization of Russia, too, is absolutely necessary, Masaryk emphasized.</p>
   <p>Among the small peoples, Masaryk's own, the Czechs and Slovaks, take, of course, first place. One look at the map will explain why the Czechs and Slovaks, at the very first opportunity, hurled themselves into the thick of the fight on the side of the Allies. Their country forms an island which lies in the path of the Germans toward the East. It was precisely this geographic position which prompted Bismarck to remark that whoever possesses Bohemia will become the master of Europe. Some of the best German brains worked hard to remove this obstacle. Even Mommsen declared that Bohemia has to be Germanized at any cost. To accomplish this, many attempts were made. They proved futile, of course, and that is why the Germans call us bullheaded.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>"We are bullheaded," Masaryk called out, adding with unconcealed pride, "and we are not going to give in." This remark was followed by salvos of applause. In a prophetic tone Masaryk declared that should the Czechs fall, others, such as the Poles, Roumanians, and Yugoslavs, would go the same why because there would be nothing to stem the German tide. "And that is why we organized for defense."</p>
   <p>Paid agents, sent by Austria all over the world immediately after the out-break of war, disseminated the contention that the monarchy of the black and yellow was drawn into the bloody strife against its will, that it does not relish carrying on this war, and is only pursuing it from sheer necessity. This is, however, glaring faithlessness. Austria has essentially the same aims as Germany, and is in substance nothing but its forerunner in the march against the Near and Far East.</p>
   <p>Masaryk declares that the just demands of small nations may be confirmed in many ways, e. g., from the Declaration of American Independence, from President <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Wilson's manifesto, and from Lincoln's utterance about government "of the people, by the people, and for the people". Another fact speaks in favor of the small nations. That is the gruesome act of the Austrian Government, by which they had 30,000 to 60,000 civilians executed, en masse, for high treason.</p>
   <p>The Austrian Government represents nothing but organized crime. It is a geographic formation where a minority, consisting of Germans and Magyar's, persecutes the majority, consisting of Slavs.</p>
   <p>Masaryk lays stress upon the urgency of exposing the Austrian Government, before the whole world, for its bloody business. This should first be done in the United States.</p>
   <p>The main goal of us Slavs in this war is the organization of a new Europe. The Allies go even farther. They proclaim the necessity of organizing all mankind. The Germans, quite contrary to this, have one main purpose: to <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>subjugate small nations to the advantage of the Germans themselves. No one denies, even to the Germans, the right of self-determination. If they accepted this as a directive nobody could find fault with that. But because they attempted to extort from others, the whole world is incensed against them, and they have to be stopped. After their arrogant designs had failed, they began to cry for peace, but we, who made every effort for peace long ago, now say that the war must be continued in the interest of humanity.</p>
   <p>Masaryk does not believe in Tolstoy's teachings, that evil should not be opposed. He, therefore, had one alternative, that of going to war, a war of defense, to be sure. There is an immense difference, in substance, between defensive and aggressive warfare, which latter type was employed by the Germans. They had been provoking the whole world for years, and when, according to their estimate, the propitious moment had come, they, with the aid of Austria, forced nearly all mankind to participate in the war. This circumstance forces the Allies to pursue the war with the utmost energy.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>From the Allied viewpoint there is still another aim in this war: To organize humanity, so that its principles become the foundation of a better and safer future. Millions of mothers and daughters are asking today, just as we, and millions of soldiers ask: Why this murdering, why is the world fighting? There is only one answer. It is the impact of two different ideas: either Jesus or Caesar. In other words, either humanity or brutality, either love or madness. We stand on the side of the good. This is our ideal, and we hope that in the course of time it also will become the ideal of the Germans whom we now have to defeat.</p>
   <p>But in order to attain victory, there is something more necessary than power and philosophizing. We will have to assert our ideals. And we shall do it.</p>
   <p>These are the rough outlines of Masaryk's lecture, which took about one hour. Though it was mainly destined for the staff and students of the University, it frequently became popular in its appeal. It was highly interesting throughout, and evidently appealed to the audience very much. Numerous outbursts of <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>applause testified to that.</p>
   <p>After due reflection, one may say that Masaryk's English is excellent. Discounting his decidedly foreign accent, one marvels at his discriminate selection of words.</p>
   <p>After the lecture, fifty of our Czech singers, grouped on the platform around their leader, Mr. Jos. Houdek, rendered Smetana's ravishing chorus, "Veno" (Dedication). They were rewarded with stormy applause. "The Star-Spangled Banner" was their next number; the audience rose from their seats and chimed in enthusiastically. Our singers were so vigorously acclaimed that they had to give audience begin slowly to disperse.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening our aged leader was feted at a brilliant banquet given in his honor at the Michigan Club by Professor Pratt Judson. Today, May 28, Masaryk will lecture for our people in Pilsen Brewery Park or, in case of <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>inclement weather, in the hall of Carter Harrison High School. The largest crowds in the history of the Park are likely to attend.</p>
