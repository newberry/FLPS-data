   <p>It is greatly desirable that every secretary who thus far has not sent in the notification of attendance of the Borovsky Monument celebration do so within one week, for we will start with the final arrangement of the parade.</p>
   <p>However, today we can say that according to the application received, we will prove that we are a power which should always be reckoned with for such celebrations. The past has convinced us that we know how to appreciate the significance of such an occasion, and so will also the present, especially upon this occasion when we are to demonstrate that we know how to appreciate a man who sacrificed everything in order to contribute to the happiness and liberty of our people.</p>
   
   <p>From among various letters received, even from out of town, we publish here one from Edwardsville, Illinois, dated June 8, 1911.</p>
   <p>"Dear countrymen, the time has arrived when everyone of us Bohemian-American can be proud that a monument of such a great man as was our Karel Havlicek Borovsky will glory in its beauty. We feel as you do, and will say also that July 30 will be the greatest holiday of the American-Bohemians. We regret that we are so far away and cannot come to this celebration. However, that day will be a beautiful remembrance about which we will tell our children and our grandchildren. We will celebrate the 30th of July, though quietly, nevertheless, with dignity. We send our best wishes and wish success for your work, success for freedom, and frustration for reaction. With Taborite Greetings from Lodge Vlasta No. 35, Rosalie Vavra, president, Marie Pfeifer, Secretary."</p>
