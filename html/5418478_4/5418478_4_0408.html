   <p>When years back some of the members of the Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek V Cicero, Illinois (Czechoslovak Taxpayers Association of Cicero, Illinois) predicted that the membership would some day reach the number of one thousand and more, it was thought to be an impossibility. That seeming impossibility, however, will, it now appears, become a fact in the nearest future, for there is not a meeting in which new applications are not received, a fact which bears witness to the increasing interest with which our citizenry views the Czech taxpayers' associations. The members of the Spolek are very much pleased by its successful increase, and almost every one of them is busy securing new members.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting, held Saturday May 6, ten new members were received and several applications were read by the secretary, Mr. V. Rous. In spite of the beautiful spring weather, the meeting was well attended. It was opened by the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>president, Mr. H. Krcek. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. A report on the installation of the new members of the school board followed. The members seemed to be satisfied with the result of the last election, a result brought about by the energy and zeal of our taxpaying bodies; and although the enemy's camp tried hard to defeat our candidates and get control of the school system, we won. It was also indicated that, due to an increase in the population of Cicero, there is a corresponding lack of school rooms for the number of pupils has likewise increased. Additional buildings are necessary, and the present school board is in a quandary as to how to secure new buildings during the present inauspicious times. It seems that appropriate steps will have to be taken at Springfield to influence the legislature to increase the income of the school board and thus enable it to build school annexes. Mr. Suchy, who is our delegate to the local Svaz Svobomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers), announced that the local Federation will hold a protest meeting against prohibition. The meeting will be held in the T. G. Masaryk School on Saturday, May 13; members of the Spolek are invited to attend....</p>

   <p>At the invitation of Mr. Langer, Mr. A. B. Holecek attended the meeting of the Spolek. Mr. Holecek is a lawyer and a candidate for the office of state senator. The president of the Spolek invited him to say a few words to the assembled members Mr. Holecek signified his pleasure in being able to address a body of men who, through their organization, accomplished so much for the common good, and acknowledged openly and sincerely that it was only with the help of the voters of Cicero that he was able to defeat his rival candidate. He mentioned the inordinately high taxes which the citizens of Chicago are compelled to pay, and expressed the opinion that steps should taken to prevent public servants from wasting the people's money.....To this end he pledged himself....Frank Novak, who is a candidate for the office of commissioner of the County Board of Commissioners, made similar promises.</p>
   <p>Matters concerning our school for the training of citizens were taken up and explained by Messrs. Svoboda and Langer. According to the original plan, these two citizens were to give the required instructions in the English language to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>such candidates for citizenship who desired to take out their first citizenship papers. After making inquiries in the United States Department of Labor, Langer was advised that it would be better if things were done in the official way. As soon as both of these gentlemen will have secured a sufficient number of candidates for citizenship, they are to inform the Department which in turn will provide a place where such instruction will be given. The teaching personnel will be furnished by the local high school. The candidates will be given an opportunity to learn English, and as soon as the required course of instruction is completed, they will be issued certificates that will make it easy for them to obtain their citizenship papers. These results could not be accomplished by private instruction, and it was decided, therefore, to leave the whole matter in the hands of the government. After this matter was cleared up, several new applications for enrollment in citizenship classes were received.....In the next meeting of the Spolek, Mr. Frank Matousek will explain the zoning system of Cicero.</p>
