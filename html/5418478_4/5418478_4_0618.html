   <p>The meeting of the Patronat Skoly Vojta Naprstek (Trustees of the Vojta Naprstek School) held on March 3, 1913, was opened by President Rudolf Mulac. All the officers and a large number of delegates were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago) sent its decision concerning the method of paying the teachers. The teachers will be paid directly by the Sdruzeni. The Sdruzeni is also taking over the responsibility of appointing and dismissing the teachers.....The Patronat objects to these decisions and maintains that it is to the best advantage of the schools if each Patronat continues to deal with its own teachers. The question will again be taken up with the Sdruzeni.....</p>
