   <p>The convention of the Bohemian Sisterhood will be opened tomorrow at 9 A.M. in the Pilsen Park pavilion on Albany Avenue and West 26th Street. Most of the delegates from other states will, by tonight, be safely ensconced in Chicago, and ready to begin their important convention proceedings. The convention committee has the task of meeting and welcoming members on their arrival. There will be representatives of lodges from the states of Ohio, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Michigan.....The housing and other comforts have been provided for by the Chicago members, who will take great care to make the sojourn of the delegates as pleasant as possible. Although the convention opens tomorrow, it is probable that the actual work will not begin until next Monday, and the convention will probably last until the end of the week. In tomorrow's session the convention officers will be elected and committees appointed....; it is possible that some business of the <span class="page-break">2</span>main branch will also be taken up in order that the way may be clear to start the actual work of the convention on Monday....</p>
   <p>The formal welcoming of all the delegates will take place tomorrow night, for which occasion all the necessary preparations have already been made. It will take place in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on West 18th and May Streets.</p>
   <p>The following will be the program: 1. a musical overture played by Mr. Brousek's orchestra; 2. the official welcome to be extended to the delegates by the chairman of the festival committee. Mrs. Marie Smrcka; 3. a allegorical march of the local drill team of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) led by Mrs. J. Sedlacek; 4. a vocal solo by Miss Tyka; 5. an address by the chairman of the grand lodge of the Jednota, Mrs. A. Brychta; 6. recitation of a poem by the youthful Miss <span class="page-break">3</span>Jirinka Roucek; 7. an address by the chairman of the central committee of the Jednota, Mrs. Marie Hajek; 8. music by Mr. Brousek's orchestra; 9. an address by the delegate of the Illinois grand lodge of the Jednota, Dr. M. R. Urbanek; 10. a vocal solo by Miss Albina Sailer; 11. a cornet solo by Mr. A. Brousek; 12. "Ve hvezdach je to psano" (It is Written in the Stars), a song by Mrs. Ruzena Lorenz. The cost of admission to this soiree is but twenty-five cents. Refreshments and ice cream will be free.</p>
   <p>Sunday will be a festive day for the delegates and for all the members of the Jednota. In the afternoon there will be a splendid banquet in the Sokol Chicago hall....in honor of the delegates, and here the Chicago members will have an opportunity to become acquainted with our dear guests; and since the program for this occasion will be varied and gay the entertainment will surely be a good one. In the evening the delegates will have another pleasant diversion. This will be a theatrical performance which, under the auspices of the festival committee, will be given by the Ludvik	<span class="page-break">4</span>Dramatic Association. The play will be given on the stage of the Sokol Chicago and will be the timely and laughter-provoking comedy "Bobecek Pana Ministra" (The Cabinet Minister's Sweetie".) This play gained great popularity last season.....We are convinced that on both occasions (afternoon and evening) the Sokol hall will be filled with our people.</p>
   <p>The convention of the Jednota is a significant event in which thousands of Bohemian-American women will be represented by their delegates, and the results of the convention work will, therefore, be meaningful and important for our entire Czech public.</p>
