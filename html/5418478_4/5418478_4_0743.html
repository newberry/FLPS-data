   <p>The cause of the misfortune is unknown. The loss was big and the insurance on the school building was small. Yesterday, at 10:30 A. M., the Bohemian inhabitants of the so-called Pilzen district were terrified by a dense smoke which suddenly gushed from the roof of the building on 18th Street, where the Bohemian-English school is located. There was not the smallest sign of a fire before this happened and nobody foresaw the slightest danger when, suddenly, there was heard a terrific explosion, at the same time destructive flames flared, from the windows and other places of the building. It was evident that the fire had started much before the explosion occurred. There was plenty of material for the fire under the roof; the attic was filled with different articles, such as small flags and other requisites used in celebrations and other occasions. The fire spread quickly through the whole attic and the tin roof in a few minutes was glowing red.</p>
   <p>The fire department came a little late, without any reasonable explanation, <span class="page-break">2</span>and after half an hour of strenuous work succeeded in confining the fire to the second floor. But what the fire did not destroy the water did, and the whole lower part of the building is now under water. The ceilings are falling down, the inside of this expensive building is ruined, and the repairs will be great.</p>
   <p>It was lucky that the school was closed yesterday. The teacher, Mr. Pitte, having some business to perform in the city, had sent the pupils home at 9 A. M., and announced that the school would start in the afternoon. At 1:30 P. M. the whole building was in flames. The people say that the insurance was extremely low at $2,500 on the building and $1,000 on the furniture. The origin of the fire seems to be a mystery. We have heard many different judgments and opinions but no serious attention can be given to them. It is considered that even if the insurance company pays the whole amount of insurance, the managing committee will take a considerable loss. The building was used as a meeting place for other societies, as for instance, the Taborits. The mechanics and others were badly hurt and their personal property was badly damaged. Tonight there will be held a meeting of the school committee, in which future steps will be deliberated upon.</p>
