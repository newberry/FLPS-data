   <p>To all friends of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies)! It was only recently that a dramatic department was organized by the [combined] societies. The department will be of inestimable service to us in our propaganda work as well as in our cultural efforts. The young organization will make its first public appearance tomorrow, November 19, 1922. It will present a comedy called "Pojd na Me Srdce" (Come to My Heart). The comedy will be staged in the Spolky Hall, and judging from the rehearsals made by the members of the young organization it will be a success and will amuse the audience no end. The curtain goes up at 2 P. M. All seats are fifty-five cents. It is advisable to come early, for "first come, first served". Friends and members of the Spolky, prove your love of the theater by attending this performance. We hope that every Cespesak will come. [Translator's note: <span class="page-break">\2</span>This is the current name given to every member of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies and is a coinage resulting from the combining of the four initial letters--C. S. P. S.--of the organization].</p>
