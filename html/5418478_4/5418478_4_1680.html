   <p>At a convention held by the Zapadni Cesko-Bratrska Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Association) at Omaha, Nebraska, a recommendation was made that the Jednota merge with the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). The recommendation was received with great enthusiasm. There were similar attempts made in Chicago several years ago, but those attempts failed because of a certain lack of co-operative spirit. New steps, therefore, are being taken to unite at least two of the largest fraternal and bhevolent associations, the names of which appear above.</p>
   <p>The real impetus was given this move at Cleveland, Ohio, recently by the delegates to the seventeenth convention of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies. A three-member committee, consisting of Otto T. Pergler, president of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Illinois grand lodge of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies, Josef Ptak of Omaha, Nebraska, and the Cleveland lawyer, Josef E. Peck, was appointed to go to Omaha where the Western Bohemian Fraternal Association was in convention, to present to it the recommendations made at Cleveland. The delegation returned to Chicago yesterday and, accompanied by Professor Bohumil Kral, made a visit to the editorial offices of the Denni Hlasatel to be the first ones to give us a dependable report on the results of their mission.....</p>
   <p>The delegation was assured that the Western Bohemian Fraternal Association will elect a committee to work on the details of the proposed unification, and to co-operate to that end with the central offices of both associations....The main office of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies will be located in Chicago beginning January 1, 1923. Its president will be Mr. Otto T. Pergler.</p>
   <p>The merging of the two great Bohemian organizations would thus become one of the most significant and successful expressions of our national and public life. The Zapadni Cesko-Bratrska Jednota has 21,000 members, and the Cesko-Slovanske <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Podporujici Spolky 23,000; thus an organization with 43,000 members would result from the union of the two; this would compare favorably with the membership of some of the large American organizations. It is also worth mentioning as a historical fact that the Western Bohemian Fraternal Association had its origin among the charter members of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies, which it later abandoned to start an organization of its own.</p>
