   <p>The Zupa Stredni Sokolska (Federation of Sokol Units [in the central part of the United States], in co-operation with the executive committee of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Sokol Unity), is offering a course for Sokol instructors in the building of Sokol Chicago for which Mr. Jan Sedlak, a good and sincere Sokol, an excellent instructor, and a man thoroughly familiar with gymnastic systems, has been engaged as teacher...He was teacher of physical culture in Moravia and his first job as Sokol instructor was in Cedar Rapids...</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago August 20.....</p>
   <p>Since then he has given instruction daily, three hours in the afternoon and three in the evening...</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Cermak will give instruction Sunday morning. He will teach dance steps ...and Mr. J. Skalsky will give swimming instructions....</p>

   <p>The course will last to September 7, after which Mr. Sedlak will be visiting various Sokol halls to give free instruction in gymnastic systems. Thus, it is believed, a very large number of Sokols will be reached. When he has finished in Chicago, he will go to Omaha and visit other Bohemian colonies in Nebraska.</p>
