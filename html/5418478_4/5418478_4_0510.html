   <p>Recently a collection for the benefit of the fund for the erection of a new Bohemian school, which at present has no desirable premises and the progress of which is not such as could be desired, has started in every Bohemian community of Cicero.</p>
   <p>A considerable number of generous ladies are calling upon every Bohemian family, and it is hoped that their efforts will result in the desired success. The extensive campaign will undoubtedly be closed within the next few days, and it is only to be wished that it will bring in a sufficient amount to enable the community to make further steps to secure a permanent home for the Bohemian school of Cicero.</p>
