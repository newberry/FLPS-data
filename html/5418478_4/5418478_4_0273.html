   <p>The Bohemian Review, a monthly printed in the English language and published in Chicago by the Czech National Alliance, is very carefully edited by Dr. Jaroslav Smetanka; it is in high favor with the American newspapers, which frequently reprint articles from it, or give them a friendly comment.</p>
   <p>It is especially this month's issue of the Bohemian Review which has given the native press another opportunity to define the political status of the Czech nation, thus bringing the questions concerning our right to liberation, and our fight for freedom and democracy, before the eyes of the American public. The recent issue contains a number of articles dealing with matters highly important for our national efforts, and also certain historical documents dealing with early activities of the Czech people. There are, for instance, interpellations of our Czech representatives in the Austrian Parliament, an article by the American writer Curtin on "Police Rule in Bohemia," etc.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily Journal, a newspaper enjoying great popularity and a publication of high standing in intelligent Chicago circles, printed an editorial, dated August 13, under the caption, "Political Prisons in Austria," which shows the interest aroused for our cause. It reads:</p>
   <p>"The Bohemian Review, published in Chicago, has been doing a great service to the cause of our country by translating speeches made by Czech representatives in the Austrian Parliament. The speeches are documents of the stubborn resistance the Czech race is offering to Austro-Magyar tyranny, to which the subjects of Slavonic nationality are being subjected; they are also cries for the liberty of the Czech nation. Tens of thousands of Slavonic people, who have been found guilty of no real offense, but are merely under suspicion of disloyalty, are herded into horrible concentration camps, compared to which the Weyler camps in Cuba held no terror. (Denni Hlasatel editor's remark: Bestialities perpetrated in the Cuban camps were one of the reasons for the declaration of war by the United States against Spain)....."</p>
   <p>The Journal's article dwells upon other cruelties to which the Czechs are exposed in Austria, and closes by declaring: "There can be no peace until the Hapsburg and Hohenzollern autocrats are downed, and when this is done no negotiations will be necessary."</p>
