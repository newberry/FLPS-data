   <p>The competition of the Gymnastic Union, composed of Bohemian, Croatian, Slovak, and Polish Sokol groups, which took place in the gymnasium of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs yesterday morning, was quiet but purposeful. Over one hundred Sokols took part in the competition which lasted from 8:30 A. M. until way past noon. The Sokoldom stresses physical education in its system, and what was shown in this respect yesterday would fill every friend of the Sokols with genuine pleasure.</p>
   <p>The competition consisted of drills on the apparatus, both for teams and for individual gymnasts.....</p>
