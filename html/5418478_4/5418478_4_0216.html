   <p>Mr. J.A. Hospodsky, editor of the newspaper Pritel Lidu, (People's Friend), of Wilber, Nebr., visited our establishment yesterday. This man is one of the oldest workers in the thankless field of Bohemian-American Journalism, and it pleased us to become more closely acquainted with him. Mr. Hospodsky stopped in Chicago on his journey to the Old Country. We wish him a pleasant journey and a safe return.</p>
