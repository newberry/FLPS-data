   <p>The Chicago district of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America) will introduce something new and essential on January 9 at the Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial)--the Nedelni Besedy--(Sunday Get-Togethers)--which will be a substitute for Sunday church services for our Freethinkers and their grown daughters and sons. The American Freethinkers already have several such places downtown, where well-known speakers give lectures every Sunday afternoon. And our Nedelni Besedy will be arranged in the same way. The name selected is purely Bohemian. "Pobesedovati" means to "get together" for the purpose of social intercourse and entertainment. Our Nedelni Besedy will be held from 10:30 A. M. to 11:30 A. M. Half of the time will be devoted to lectures and questions concerning the subject of the lecture. The speakers will alternate. Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan will always lecture on the first Sunday; Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, editor and speaker of the Bohemian Free Thought Community, the second; Dr. Antonin Mueller, the third; and Mr. Jan. Jelinek, editor, the fourth.</p>
