   <p>This year was certainly a convention year. During the summer several of our foremost fraternal unions held their conventions; now, another one joins the ranks of the important organization events--the seventh convention of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union). The convention opened yesterday morning in Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) Hall, Ashland Avenue near 18th Street.</p>
   <p>The delegates started their deliberations with the firm hope that the convention would bring much good to their prosperous Union which, though its field is limited mostly to Chicago and vicinity, is growing and enjoying a prosperity which strengthens its foundations. The Union may therefore look to the future with satisfaction. The Union is composed of 66 lodges with a total membership of 5,886.....It also has a children's insurance department of 900 members.....Financially, too, it is in good condition, having capital of $148,870.31 according <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to its last financial statement.</p>
   <p>The convention opened at 9 A.M. with the presidential address delivered by Dr. Karel Neumann, president....who, after having greeted the delegates, read his report.....The report will come up for discussion during the course of the convention. The reports of the chief officers of the Jednota and all others were approved. Various committees were formed and members elected to them as follows: Committee on credentials: Mr. Anton Zrust and Mrs. Frances Mrazek; Committee on parliamentary procedure: Messrs. Julius Urban and Vaclav Vokac, and Mrs. Frances Mrazek.</p>
   <p>After these committees were duly installed the convention recessed for a brief period to give the committee on credentials an opportunity to examine the papers of the delegates. The committee returned to the convention hall, stating that the credentials of all the delegates were in order. All lodges, with the exception of three....were represented, but since one of the absent delegates--Mr. Frank Legros, representing the Martha Washington Lodge No. 36--came later, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>only two lodges were found to lack representation. This matter having been settled satisfactorily, the next item on the program was the report of the committee on parliamentary procedure. That committee reported as follows:</p>
   <p>The morning sessions of the convention shall begin at 9 A.M. and end at noon; the afternoon sessions shall begin at 1:30 P.M. and end at 4:30 P.M. The convention shall proceed in the following order: (1) Opening of session; (2) Roll call; (3) Reading of the minutes of the preceding session; (4) Reading of correspondence; (5) Reports of committees and discussion; (6) Discussion on amendments to the constitution and bylaws; (7) Suggestions and recommendations.</p>
   <p>Each delegate shall be allowed to speak only twice on the same subject, each speech lasting not more than five minutes. If necessary the convention shall be asked to extend the time....Voting on all questions relating to any change in the constitution and bylaws shall be by acclamation or, if delegates so desire, by roll call.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The committee further recommended the election of a president of the convention, two vice-presidents, and two secretaries. Election was held immediately, and Dr. Karel Neumann was elected president; Mrs. Ruzena Fivek as first, and Mr. August Kopta as second vice-president; Mr. F. Lukes was elected first secretary, and Mr. Antonin Turek, second. It was further recommended that various committees be set up, which was done as follows: Constitution and bylaws: Messrs. Josef Zelenka, Vaclav Hrabanek, Karel Souhrada, K. Studnicka, Emil Cajthaml, and K. Rabas, and Mrs. Frances Mrazek; Complaints: Messrs. V. Vales, B. Jahoda, and J. Volek. Finance: Messrs. Josef Wittek, Vaclav Sticha, and Jan Hribal; Press and publicity: Messrs. Josef Turecek, Josef Spinar and Josef Belica. Organization: Messrs. Ferdinand Kouba and Anton Nesladek, and Mrs. Antonie Rezac. Charities: Mrs. Rosie Lapka, and Messrs. J. Kara and Josef Vitek. Resolutions: Messrs. V. Koslac, M. Blazek, Frantisek Gregor, and Julius Urban, and Mrs. Sylvie Studnicka.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the appointment of the above committees, the question concerning the proposed amendments to the constitution and bylaws came up for discussion.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>These amendments were presented to the convention in printed form, and some of the delegates opined that they should have been examined prior to being printed. The president stated that this would not have been practicable, and that since a committee on constitution and bylaws had been appointed, it devolved upon that body to accept or reject any of the amendments. The amendments were made in such a manner as to be perfectly clear to the delegates.</p>
   <p>This matter having been adjusted, the question concerning the delegates of the Jiri Podebradsky Lodge No. 29, which also represented Augustyn Herman Lodge, came up for discussion. It was evident that by representing two lodges, each of the said delegates was entitled to two votes. This matter aroused lively interest among those present, but Mr. Hrabanek was given the right to represent both lodges and to vote for them. The convention recessed until the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 1 P.M. the hall began to fill up with delegates.....One could see small groups of old friends discussing the early beginnings of the Jednota. And these were bitter! But from a relatively small group of charter members a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>mighty union grew, later becoming an important factor in all of our national activities as well as our Free Thought movement. The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota is today one of our most popular organizations; it is, indeed, one of the pillars of our national culture. And it gained its many friends and its renown because of the generosity it displayed whenever any national cause presented itself. The Jednota became quite popular during the time of our national revolution in Czechoslovakia; indeed, by its zeal, the Jednota could serve as an example to other rather lackadaisical organizations. The Czech Free Thought school system also finds the Jednota to be its staunch supporter, and this fact endeared it to many of our progressive countrymen.</p>
   <p>Among the delegates one may find a large percentage of women who, like their brothers, interest themselves actively in all matters pertaining to the convention.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session began at 1:30 P.M., as was indicated by the committee <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>on parliamentary procedure.....The minutes of the morning session were approved after some minor changes were made. The reading of correspondence followed. The letters and telegrams were all congratulatory in content. They were sent by the following organizations and institutions: The Grand Lodge of the Jednota Taboritu (Taborites), the Patronat Besidky A Detske Opatrovny (management of the Bohemian kindergarten and Creche), the board of directors of the periodical Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), the Statni Svaz Svobomyslnych v Illinois (State Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of Illinois), Ceska Typograficka Unie c.330 (Bohemian Typographical Union No. 330),....Narodni Hlavni Rad Cesko-Americke Jednoty (National Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-American Union), Odbocka Svazu Svobodomyslnych (Local Branch of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) of the Town of Lake, and the board of directors of the Ustredni Jednota Cesko-Americkych Zen (First Central Union of Bohemian-American Women).</p>
   <p>All of these expressions of good will were received with gratitude, and the president, turning to the press gallery, asked the representatives of the press <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to express the thanks of the convention to all these well-wishers.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the well-known resolution made by the Ceskoslovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) which condemned the proposed amendment to the Illinois constitution, was read. The fate of the proposed amendment to the constitution will be decided this coming Tuesday. After a debate this matter was turned over to the resolutions committee.</p>
   <p>An announcement was made that a delegation from the central board of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) had arrived at the convention and desired to be heard. This request was granted, and the delegation was admitted to the convention. After being greeted by the president, the delegation from the Svaz was told that due to an unusual amount of work awaiting the convention, the purpose of their mission should be stated as briefly as possible. The spokesman of the delegation was Mr. Vasku. In a brief but hearty address he greeted the convention and asked for continued support for the Svaz from the Jednota. Similar remarks were made by the other members of <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>the delegation, Messrs. Musil and Strunc. This matter settled, and the delegation from the Svaz having left the hall, the convention proceeded with its own business.</p>
   <p>The committee on constitution and bylaws made its report; its many recommendations were discussed and the following changes made:</p>
   <p>Chapter I, page 5: Paragraphs 1 and 2 were struck out and the following substituted:</p>
   <p>1. "This organization, founded May, 1892, in Chicago, Illinois, shall hereafter be known as the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota ve Spojenych Statech Americkych, (Czecho-Slavonic Union of the United States of America), incorporated on May 9, 1895."</p>
   <p>2. "The insignia of this Jednota shall be the lion of Bohemia and the letters C.S.J. The Jednota consists of the Grand Lodge and of subordinate lodges."</p>
   <p>Paragraph 7 of the same chapter was partially changed and now reads as follows: <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>"This Grand Lodge represents all subordinate lodges by its own authority, and is the supreme, executive, and responsible body of the Jednota."</p>
   <p>Chapter II, paragraph 1: The age requirement of candidates for membership in the Jednota was changed. Hereafter persons 16 and not 15 years of age may become members of the Jednota.</p>
   <p>The whole of chapter VII (page 8) was referred to the committee on constitution and bylaws for reconsideration. On page 10, paragraph 2, dealing with the duties of the vice-president, the words, "he has no right, however, to sign bank checks," were struck out. The ruling dealing with the secretary worded, "he shall inform insured members by registered letter that they have been excluded from the organization," was also struck out. (Secretary, page 11.)</p>
   <p>This ended the session for the day, and the convention adjourned.</p>
