   <p>P.1--Denni Hlasatel begins its fifteenth volume with today's issue. It has performed its mission among American Czecho-Slovak people for fourteen years, keeping our compatriots informed of current events and endeavoring to teach and to educate them so they may more easily survive the fierce struggle for existence in which individuals and national groups must participate.</p>
   <p>Those who remember the beginning of our enterprise know that we have lain on no bed of roses, and that we have carried burdens which have often seemed excessive. We have had to endure many bitter disappointments inflicted by people for whom we had done most, and whom we had most trusted. We have warmed many serpents in our bosom, who have repaid us by biting us at the first opportunity. We have had to pass through a period of bitter want and deprivation and to see the vultures flocking together in expectation of a feast. But we have endured it all, and to-day, after fourteen years of effort, we stand on firm ground and can look upon the past with satisfaction and on the future with great expectations.</p>

   <p>For the success which we have achieved we must primarily thank the sound judgement of our people, who have realized where their best friends were, and where they were sincerely esteemed. Our people have observed our work for fourteen years and have recognized its worth, and they have showed their recognition by supporting it. The number of our subscribers continually grows larger, and the most gratifying thing about this is that we still have on our list the majority of those who subscribed in our very first year. This is eloquent proof that we have not disappointed them, and that we have consistently endeavored to do what we promised to do in the very beginning, that is, to labor for the good of all working-people of Czecho-Slovak origin.</p>
   <p>However, we are only human, and we have our faults and imperfections. What we produce is not altogether what we could wish, but we can assure every one that our intentions are the best. By reading our newspaper one can best see how it is being improved and perfected. The selection of reading material, the arrangement of it, the size of the paper,--everything attests most eloquently our sincere endeavors.</p>

   <p>If we continue to enjoy the favor of our people in the future, and we firmly hope to do so, we shall try to make our readers better and better satisfied with us, so that our work for the Bohemian people will be even more effective and beneficial. In so far as news reports are concerned, we can say without exaggeration that there is not another Bohemian newspaper in America which prints so much news so carefully selected and so well arranged as does Denni Hlasatel. We spare no expense when it comes to keeping our readers informed about happenings in Chicago, in America, and in foreign lands. We have a special correspondent in the old country so as to keep Bohemian-Americans posted, from the working-men's viewpoint, about the most important events there. We have a countless number of correspondents and fellow-workers in almost all important Bohemian communities in America.</p>
   <p>So we hope that we shall be able to retain the favor which we have gained and increase it and with its aid continue to progress along the road which we have followed for the last fourteen years. Our undertaking is not organized for profit; when it guarantees us suitable working-man's wages-- <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and there is not a drone among us who would, without working, draw on the honey gathered by others--we are satisfied and enthusiastically engaged in the struggles of which the journalistic profession involves so many. Furthermore, we shall continue to support all movements and enterprises which promote the welfare of our people, to uncover the selfish and the dishonorable, to praise that which deserves praise, to express our scorn of that which merits it, to point out the right way, and to shun the path of ease which, however comfortable, leads to ruin.</p>
   <p>In the firm belief that we shall continue to enjoy the confidence and receive the help of our people, we remain respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>The publishers of Denni Hlasatel.</p>
