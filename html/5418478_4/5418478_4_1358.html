   <p>To be sure, we are pleased with the Sokol expedition to Bohemia, but at the same time it strikes us that our expedition is not awaited there with the same interest as before. Newspapers are bringing long reports about Sokols, but nowhere do they mention American Sokols. A sort of coolness has developed in Bohemia in regard to us--a coolness that is positively staggering.</p>
   <p>However, we do not wonder about it too much, nor is it especially surprising to us. We all know how many slanderers there are among us who have nothing else to do except to send heart-rending reports of our national decline, etc., to Bohemia. That these slanderous reports are spreading throughout Bohemia like a plague is also well known to us. Therefore, no one need wonder why the Bohemian mission from America is not welcomed in the old country as warmly and enthusiastically as it was in former years.</p>
