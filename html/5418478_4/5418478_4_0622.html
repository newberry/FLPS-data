   <p>The colony of our countrymen in the so-called Crawford district, situated west of Bohemian "California", had a momentous celebration yesterday. It was the festive laying of a cornerstone to the building of the Bohemian Free Thought School Jan Neruda, named after the immortal humorist, poet, and novelist whose works will always cheer those who find the time to read them.....</p>
   <p>The celebration started with a parade....led by two marshals....followed by a gala squad of Bohemian policemen, secured through the kindness of Alderman John Toman, and by pupils of the Jan Neruda School,....the Ceska Prodavacska Unie Cyslo 2 (Bohemian Salesmen's Union No. 2) with their own military band....Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs with a band....Mr. F. Karas' band, and delegations of several Bohemian charitable, benevolent, and fraternal societies....marching to the corner of 27th Street and 41st Avenue where the school will stand.</p>

   <p>While the assembled group sang "Hej, Slovane" (Ho, All You Slavs!), a memorial box was put into the cornerstone containing a copy of the historical review of the Vzdelavaci Spolek Ceskych Sousedu (Educational Society of Bohemian Neighbors), a brief story about the Jan Neruda School, and issues of various periodicals.......</p>
   <p>.....The cost of the building is estimated at $6,000. All of the work is being done by Bohemian contractors.....At this time, the Jan Neruda School is attended by one hundred pupils, and there is not sufficient room for the additional fifty who have matriculated.</p>
