   <p>P. 2 - When Professor Masaryk had been introduced to the chairman, Mrs. K. Honomichl, and to all the delegates, he spoke to the gathering as follows:</p>
   <p>'I take the privilege of speaking to you, but it should be just the reverse - I should sit and listen and you should speak. Rather, than that I should speak to you about women in comparison with men. As you probably know, the famous Bohemian professor, Professor Albert, expelled the women from college, because he was convinced that ordinarily they were unsuited for surgery, that they were not strong enough for it. Personally I opposed him for this. I wrote an entire treatise about it, because he asserted that as nurses women were excellent.</p>
   <p>You maintain, I wrote, that women as nurses are excellent, that they do not require as much strength as a doctor, who performs a single operation occasionally.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Is a nurse working from 5 o'clock in the morning, weaker perhaps, than you, who work merely a few hours daily in the practice of medicine? According to my judgement it is a downright farce, the way many believe that woman being more delicate than man is considered as an idol and the woman herself believes it. However, I maintain, that man governs because of this sentiment and if a woman should be a good mother, the man should be a good father, by which is understood, that if the man works from morning till night, in order to provide for the family financially, it becomes the duty of the woman to manage the entire financial budget and to count the pennies so as to be able to manage on that, which he earned, and in addition she looks after, and raises the whole family. When I compare it, the man does not do one half, not even one tenth as much as the woman. According to my opinion, even educated men, in the broadest sense of the word, have no precedence over women. Because education is pounded into their heads for twenty-five years or more, and if they know when the Greeks arose, at what time they dressed or in which century they dressed this or that way, it cannot be called any superiority, but a learned trade, the same as any other. Therefore the woman is far stronger than man, or at least his equal, because without preliminary study she must adjust herself to him. That women are indifferent, is a very erroneous opinion. It is demonstrated by the fact that men have retained for themselves the ministry, priesthood and missions - in short the most <span class="page-break">3</span>lucrative channels. If woman was obliged to take care of and participate in everything, in a religious sense, woman would also have to be in the pulpit, at the altar and, the various spiritual works would have to be in her hands. It is said that women are taking men's jobs, creating great competition, and this according to my idea, is a mistaken and unjust accusation. For instance I am the father of a boy and a girl. The boy dedicates himself to study and preparation for life so that he may be able to support himself, whereas the girl finishes her education in some convent (as is customary in Europe). She learns to play the piano, a little French, in fact a little of everything that belongs to a little better standard, after which she diligently begins to gather material for a trousseau and some sort of dowry. Then she must wait to see if some foolish man can be found, who will take this poor little idol, this foolish little goose, into his household. I see competition there, where the father must strive to dispose of three or four daughters or as many as he has; whereas if they were raised so as to be self supporting, they would lessen the competition among the fathers and they would better repay for their existence here. On the other hand, if the young ladies belong in the household and are not to work because of the competition this would create, then those hundreds upon hundreds of other women <span class="page-break">4</span>workers who are employed in unhealthy factories, should not work either; their place is also in the home. (applause)</p>
   <p>I could say a great deal more, but your time is limited therefore I close with the wish that you may mature spiritually as much as possible. If you provide your children with an education it will bring you more than the wild chase after the dollar."</p>
   <p>The chairman of the convention, Mrs. Kristyna Honomichl, stepped over to Professor Masaryk, presented him with a beautiful bouquet of fresh cut flowers, bound with a costly bow, of national colors, on which was inscribed, "In remembrance of the Sixth Convention of the J. C. D. from the delegates at the convention in Chicago. The Professor expressed his sincere thanks for the honor.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Honomichl then addressed the professor as follows: "I wish you would answer and explain the following: Liberalism is continually preached to us, but at no time is the meaning of that word explained to us. I beg of you, give us a correct definition."</p>
   <p>A 11 of the listeners were eager to hear the famous scholar on this subject, which is of such importance to us Bohemian-Americans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Taking the floor again Masaryk said, "Liberalism has a far reaching significance. I think however that you are asking me about liberalism in the religious sense. From my standpoint I do not belong to any church. None will suffice for me. I have read and meditated over much and I have my own special opinion on the matter. If I may express myself about liberalism as it is understood by you, here in America among Bohemians, then I must say with sorrow, that you have taken an erroneous view. Genuine liberalism means unwavering conviction. In the honorable dealings of a liberal--minded person there must not be found even the shadow of prejudice toward the believing man, no matter what he believes. Equally dear to me are honorable Catholics, Protestants, Jews or Mohammedans, and likewise repugnant, dishonorable believers of whatever faith. I find that you liberals here provide poorly for your young people, that you seek liberalism by blaming this or that other side. The way you err, so err those in the opposite camp, and both of you stand in harsh opposition to each other. If the other side calls you names, you can with your generosity and culture show that you are their betters. You must convince them, preach to them. Your duty is to convert them to your convictions, but you cease being liberal-minded, just as soon as you throw stones at anyone because they do not believe in that which you believe in and are not of the same opinion as you. Especially you who <span class="page-break">6</span>are the most liberal-minded, you must excuse me, when I tell you the truth, you do not educate your children in liberal-mindedness. You wanted to know the truth and I have given it according to my judgement."</p>
   <p>He was then entertained by the ladies.</p>
