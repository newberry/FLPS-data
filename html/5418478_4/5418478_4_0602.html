   <p>Today in the Bohemian Settlement House, 1813 South Racine Avenue, at 8:30 in the evening, a course in American citizenship will be started. Attorney Jaroslav F. Smetanka, whose articles on citizenship published in the Denni Hlasatel were read by thousands of American Bohemians, will be the teacher. In the first place the course is planned for the benefit of those who intend to apply for citizenship soon. Bohemian women especially are invited, because in most instances they are citizens by virtue of the fact that their husbands have become naturalized. Here they will be informed about American institutions so that they may use their newly-acquired voting privileges intelligently. Instruction will be given every Tuesday evening from seven-thirty to nine. Admission to these lectures is free.</p>
