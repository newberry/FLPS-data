   <p>The first Chicago edition of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason) as a monthly organ of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) will be published in Chicago on August 15, 1920. The Vek Rozumu, according to the resolution of the last convention, has been transferred from New York to Chicago. The publication will be printed by the Bohemian National Printing Company, which promised to do all in its power to give the organ a presentable appearance.</p>
   <p>All subscribers become regular members of the local branch. The subscription may be sent to any local branch or to the headquarters of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych v Americe (V. K. Soukup, Secretary, 2000 South Albany Avenue, Chicago, Illinois,) which will keep that part of the subscription fee to which it is entitled, and the rest will be sent to the local branch. The membership fee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych V Americe is four dollars a year or one dollar quarterly. Any other member of the subscriber's family who wishes to become <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a member of the organization may do so by paying only one dollar a year. But in such a case, the family will receive only one copy of the Vek Rozumu. The headquarters will keep $2.50 of every subscription and will send the rest to the local branch if such a branch is in existence already, and if not, as soon as such a local branch is founded.</p>
   <p>The Vek Rozumu will bring not only articles of educational Free Thought character, but it will also carry important reports on the Bohemian-American, American, and European Free Thought movement. Until the new year, the organ will be published as a monthly, afterward as a weekly.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, who is known as a sincere and enthusiastic worker, agreed to become the editor of the Vek Rozumu, which in itself is a guarantee that the organ will be of permanent value.</p>
