   <p>Fifteen Chicago Sokols were recruited in the ranks of the Sokol Legion last Sunday. Sixty Sokols had already joined before. Applications are steadily pouring in, and it is to be expected that the numbers in the Sokol Legion will soon be in the proper ratio to the numbers of the active Sokols who appear at the regular drills. We learn that there is to be a gathering next Wednesday of the enlisted Sokols. There will also be a parade. Workers for the cause will deliver addresses at that meeting. The presence of great numbers of Sokols is desirable, also of men intending to enlist, even if they be not members of a Sokol organization. These should include our fellow-countrymen from the outlying districts who want to fulfill their patriotic duty "down to the throat," conforming to an old Czech motto. This motto was also used by our great leader in his appeal to the Czechs living in Russia.</p>
