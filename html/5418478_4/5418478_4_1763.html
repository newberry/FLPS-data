   <p>As already announced in yesterday's issue, there was held on Saturday a festival of welcome for the delegates of the Sixth Convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood). The festival took place in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on 18th and May Streets....This welcoming festival was arranged by a festival committee consisting of the following members: Marie Smrcek, chairman; Marie Mitrovsky, alternate; Marie Stepanek, treasurer; Marie Hora, financial secretary; and Ruzena Lorenz, secretary. It was chiefly for the out-of-town delegates that this festival was arranged. Long before 9 P.M. the spacious upper hall was crowded. Together with the members, who gave evidences of joy at being so well received, a great many of the friends and admirers of the Jednota were also present. The hall soon took on the semblance of a veritable beehive.</p>
   <p>The program arranged for this occasion consisted of musical numbers presented by the orchestra of our countryman, Mr. A. Brousek, who deserves great merit for the performance. Sister Smrcek welcomed the delegates,.....pointing out their great interest in the Jednota, not only as regards their local units but also the central office, and stated that the success of the convention depended upon the work which the delegates, under the leadership of the ficers of the convention, are to perform. She then expressed her conviction that the work will be well done, and that the results of the convention will be satisfactory. After greeting the delegates once more in the heartiest manner possible, Sister Smrcek yielded the floor to a drill team of the local units of the Jednota which was led by its captain, Sister J. Sedlacek. This team, consisting of thirty-two members, performed a series of allegorical marches to the strains of Mr. Brousek's music....The team was enthusiastically applauded. The next number was a solo by Sister Tyka, who was accompanied on the piano by her own sister. This was followed by an address made by Sister Anna Brychta, the chairman of the grand lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union).</p>
   
   <p>As a representative of that great sister organization, Mrs. Brychta greeted the ladies of the Jednota, and especially its out-of-town delegates, and expressed her pleasure at the growth and work of the Sisterhood, which has now convened for the sixth time. Very relevant and to the point was also the speech of the president of the central committee of the Sisterhood, Sister Marie Hajek of Cleveland, Ohio, who expressed thanks for the address of welcome, and indicated the amount of work still awaiting all of the members of the Jednota. She enjoined them to do their convention work well and to overlook nothing that could serve the good of the Jednota and bring benefit to the organization. The alternate of the grand lodge of the Jednota, Sister Marie R. Urbane, spoke to the delegates in the same tenor as Sister Hajek, urging the members to bend all their efforts to one end, which is continually to increase the public's familiarity with the work which the Sisterhood is doing. The Sisterhood certainly deserves to be fully known and its work appreciated.</p>
   <p>The addresses of all these speakers were not only attentively listened to, but the speakers themselves were warmly rewarded by long applause.</p>
   <p>The vocal solo by Miss A. Sailer was very successful. Equally successful was the recitation given by the youthful Miss Jirina Roucek, who bids fair to become a talented ballet dancer. Mr. Brousek obliged the audience by a truly artistic and beautiful cornet solo. The good humor of the guests was considerably heightened by Sister R. Lorenz, whose comic poem, "Ve hvezdach to stoji psano" (It is Written in the Stars), was much appreciated. After listening to the program the whole assemblage repaired to the lower hall, where excellent cakes, cookies, sandwiches, coffee, and ice cream were served. The members of the party stayed until almost midnight, being detained by this most hearty and interesting entertainment.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon the delegates of the Jednota, especially the out-of-town ones, attended the Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage), which was held in Pilsen Park, west 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. A goodly number of them came to the Pout, and it is certain that they contributed to the financial success of this venture; in this respect our tireless and self-effacing women workers have not been invited in vain. The day was concluded by a gala theatrical performance which was arranged especially for the delegates by the festival committee of the convention. The play chosen for this occasion, which also served as a rendezvous for the members of the Jednota and their friends, was Balda's musical burlesque "Bobecek pana ministra" (A Cabinet Minister's'Sweetie-pie'). The play was brisk and well performed by the permanent stock company of the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Ludvik's Dramatic Association). The attendance, which was large, and the fine feeling which pervaded the audience, are proofs that the festivities committee pleased all those who came to see the play.</p>
