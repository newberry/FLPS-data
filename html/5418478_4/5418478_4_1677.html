   <p>The Chicago delegates who returned from the seventeenth convention of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) a week ago, are submitting their reports to their lodges today. Although the main office [which is to be located in Chicago] will not begin functioning until January 1 of next year, it will not be long before the newly elected officers of the National Supreme Lodge will begin looking for a suitable location for their new office and making preparations for the beginning of their activities. The work of the last convention is fully appreciated by the Chicago members of the Spolky, and the impression is that it was one of the most successful thus far. The Chicago members are, of course, pleased with the idea that the central office of the Spolky will be located in our city; they are aware, on the other hand, that a serious task is awaiting them, and that much hard work will be their lot in insuring the future development of this mighty fraternal organization.</p>
   <p>All of the executive officers of the National Supreme Lodge are well known in our circles and the Spolky. They are, according to reports received from the convention, the following men: Messrs. O. T. Pergler, president; A. J. Smejkal and Bohumil Kral, vice-presidents; A. J. Cejka, secretary, (Mr. Cejka is also a past president of National Supreme Lodge) ; A. J. Jambor, second secretary; Jan Klaus, treasurer....The chief merit of Mr. Pergler, the president, was his indefatigable work as president of the Illinois Grand Lodge, an office which he held for three years. He organized a propaganda committee and was always its most zealous member. The said committee visited the meetings of the local lodges of the Spolky with the result that it always gained more new members, young people in particular. These new members were the sons and daughters of the members of the Spolky of our local lodges such as the Jungman, Garfield, Lincoln, and Vysehrad. In a short space of time two hundred new members were thus gained in Chicago, and eight hundred more in the state of Illinois during the last year.</p>
   <p>We have no doubt that Mr. Pergler, as president of the main office of the Spolky, will develop its work to a high degree of efficiency by his ability and experience, and that during the term of his office he will gain the largest possible number of young people for membership, mainly those young people who were born in this country.</p>
