   <p>In times of depression and limitation of immigration, our Bohemian Free Thought Benevolent Societies place their hopes in the younger generation, in the children brought up by Bohemian Free Thought Schools. But the upkeep of these schools requires considerable money, that is, if the schools are to remain at their present high level.</p>
   <p>It is for this reason that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) arranges entertainments and festivals in order to give Bohemians an opportunity to contribute to the success and development of Bohemian Free Thought schooling.</p>
   <p>One of the most beautiful of such festivals will be the "Staroceske Posviceni" ("Old Czech Country Festival") which is to be held on Sunday, September 17, in Pilsen Park, Albany Avenue and West 26th Street.</p>
   <p>Our children have recently re-enrolled in our schools and are now engaged in a popularity contest which is to culminate just about the time of the festival at which time the results of it will be announced.</p>
   <p>This will be an exciting moment for our youngsters and not less so for their parents and friends. We shall withhold the description of the most beautiful surprise until the very end.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that the day of the seventeenth of September belongs to the Bohemian Free Thought Schools.</p>
