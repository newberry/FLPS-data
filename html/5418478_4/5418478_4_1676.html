   <p>Preparations are being made for the last picnic of the season, which is to be held in the Pilsen Park pavilion next Saturday under the auspices of the patronat (board of managers) of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) Hall, 18th and May Streets. No friends of this historic national building should miss this picnic. They will no doubt meet many of their age-old friends and co-workers who have always endeavored to develop that great national shrine, and spent many joyful hours under its hospitable roof. It will surely be pleasant to spend some time in their company, and we may take it for granted that the picnic entertainment will be agreeable and hearty in every respect.</p>
   <p>The patronat fully deserves the support of our members, and it is desirable, therefore, that the Pilsen Park pavilion be crowded with our gay countrymen next Saturday. The picnic begins at 4 P. M. Admission will be fifty cents.</p>
