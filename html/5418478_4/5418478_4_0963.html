   <p>The Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) is training for a public gymnastic exhibition which it will give at its own summer camp at New Buffalo, Michigan, next Sunday, September 3. The New Buffalo city authorities have also advertised this event. The Pilsen Sokol has used the New Buffalo camp for eighteen consecutive summers and is therefore well-known to the American people of that part of the country, but since the Camp Sokol has been chiefly known as a summer camp, the Pilsen Sokol decided to give this public exhibition chiefly for the benefit and information of their American neighbors. The top-ranking teams only will drill. These will consist of junior boys and girls. Since there are not enough paraphernalia in the summer camp the teams will have to resort chiefly to precision drills, thus somewhat curtailing the usual program procedure.</p>
