   <p>The powerful association of Slavonic sokol and gymnastic societies of Chicago, "Slovanska Gymnasticka Unie" (Slavonic Gymnastic Union), from which the participating groups expect so much not only in the field of gymnastics but in Slavonic reciprocal co-operation, held its first competitive meet on Sunday, March 24, in the magnificent new Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall located on Lawndale Avenue at 26th Street. Two hundred and eight competitors from twenty-six societies participated in the meet. This imposing figure is the best proof that the significance of this great and promising Slavonic association is fully understood and appreciated, and therefore it is not an empty phrase if we say that we can expect splendid accomplishments from the Slovanska Gymnasticka Unie in the very near future.</p>
