   <p>Copies of the special issue of the Cesky Svet (Bohemian World), in which the work of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Federation of Bohemian Catholics [of America]) is described and accompanied by a number of successful illustrations, are still available in the main offices of the National Federation, 3207 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois. A copy costs twenty-five cents. Every Bohemian Catholic should own a copy as a souvenir. Secretaries of societies are urged to order them in greater numbers and then sell them to their members. Do not delay because the supply will soon be exhausted, and you will seek in vain to obtain additional copies of this memoir. It will be a beautiful reminder of the stirring days of the national revolution when we all aided in liberating our native land.
