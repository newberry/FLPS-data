   <p>Recently, we published a report, based upon information furnished to us that the Czech branch of the public library on 26th Street was enlarged by nine hundred new works of Czech literature. Now we are informed by Mr. Phelan that these books are still at the main library, and must be bound and catalogued before they are turned over to the branch library for circulation. Mr. Phelan advised us that it would be at least a month before the books are available to the public.</p>
