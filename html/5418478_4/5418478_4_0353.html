   <p>p. 1--Moving pictures of the gymnastic exercises, which were used by Mr. Newman to illustrate his Balkan lectures at Orchestra Hall on Michigan avenue, will be shown again tonight, because they were so enthusiastically received by the public.</p>
   <p>They are the most attractive photographic pictures of their kind, showing seven hundred gymnasts performing various exercises in perfect unison and grace.</p>
   <p>Another interesting moving picture, presenting the Bosnian National Dances, will be added to the program.</p>
