   <p>Today we begin the fifth volume in the existence of Svornost, the first Bohemian daily newspaper in America which Chicago Bohemians received from its humble beginning with friendliness and pleasure and thereafter each year, under all circumstances, friendly or unfriendly, the same confidence and friendship was extended, acknowledging its sincere efforts, the sacrifice and work, dedicated through patience and self sacrifice in behalf of its principles and widening its favor from year to year.</p>
   <p>In order to bring it up to the high degree of success upon which it stands to-day there worked in behalf of this newspaper besides the Editor and Publisher, our national lodges and many individuals. We believe that this is not the highest degree that a newspaper may achieve among Chicago Bohemians for we can see where there are still many imperfections; but this much we can say to Chicago Bohemians, that is, that we have managed to build up a newspaper which can represent our nationality in a dignified manner, in our struggle for life and happiness, before other nationalities here.</p>

   <p>Though many difficulties were encountered in the beginning, no one can say that this newspaper stooped, to shameful profiteering in politics, to dishonorable methods in its business affairs, to reactionism, whereby it could have widened its circle among less progressive citizens; but everyone knows that the principles as represented and defended by it have always been those of the most progressive citizens.</p>
   <p>Let it be said in all honor to Chicago Bohemians, that throughout the entire four years of existence of this newspaper they have proven themselves to be wide awake, cultured and fond of progress; because without those countrymen readers of ours it would be impossible to publish a newspaper, much less to have it prosper and grow. Therefore it is not strength alone that plows the fields and sows the seed, but that which utilizes it and gives life and growth which is deserving of acknowledgement and thanks.</p>
   <p>With our fellow-workers in the national field, with the rest of the newspapers "Svornost" remains on relatively friendly terms. The majority of the Bohemian Newspapers are convinced that Chicago has a real need for a Bohemian daily paper, and that it is not detrimental in any manner to them when all efforts are made to assure the prosperity of this paper but on the contrary that it is beneficial <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to all, especially to our national life and to local culture. Svornost, cheerfully accepts the occasionally deserved criticism for some error, which it is said may befall any honorable man seven times daily, and when requested in a dignified manner for an explanation of its viewpoint has not failed at any time to comply.</p>
   <p>We have a firm belief that so long as Svornost continues to progress as heretofore without seeking to advance its own self interests, but supporting and expanding the interests not only of our nationality in America but the interests of citizenship,of social improvement and welfare of local Bohemians, it has a clean existence before itself.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that our honorable readers will stand behind us in this battle and work of ours for a long time and that they will never urge us to step backward from hard earned gains, but that they will with their friendship and with joy in their duty support this newspaper which is dedicated to their service and to the honor and success of Bohemian Nationals in Chicago and in all America.</p>
