   <p>Two valuable books on gymnastic drills have just been published by the Czech Sokol Community in America. One treats of "Drills with Dumb-bells," the other of "Drills in Groups". The first is written by brother Joseph Cermak, the second by brother Jos. Paskovsky, instructor at the Sokol Chicago gymnasium. Both books make distinct contributions to the technical literature on Sokol gymnastics. They are going to be copyrighted.</p>
