   <p>p. 1, Col. 3 - We are bringing to the attention of Bohemian parents the reopening of Bohemian Class School, which will be opened as usual, beginning tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The classes will be held on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M. on Saturdays, from 9 A. M. to 12 A. M. and on Sundays only from 9:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M.</p>
   <p>The subjects taught are: Reading out loud, enunciation. Writing and translating by use of the Bohemian and English dictionary; domestic and foreign history, singing and dramatics, and moral teaching in the rational sense.</p>
   <p>We are certain the parents will not hesitate sending their children to our school. The tution fee is but 25 cents a week which can be afforded by any of our Bohemian parents. It was decided by the executive board of the school to have Mr. Frank Veverka as teacher.</p>
