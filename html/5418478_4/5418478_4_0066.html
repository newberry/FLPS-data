   <p>The Reading Club commemorated the one hundredth Anniversary of the death of Voltaire, exhibiting a large portrait of him and reading several of his shorter works. Because of rain, attendance was small.</p>
   <p>We were much surprised at the skill of our young and modest artist, Miss M. Koupalove.</p>
   <p>Using a small portrait as a model, she completed, in two hours, a large painting for the club. She is certainly deserving of recognition and encourgement to proceed to further success.</p>
