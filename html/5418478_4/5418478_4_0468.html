   <p>Following are the minutes of the regular meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago), held July 16, 1921:</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Joseph Tichava, in the presence of all the officers and a large number of the delegates. The minutes of the previous regular meeting were approved as read. The minutes of the special meeting held July 2 were also approved. In the special meeting it had been decided to politely ask the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) whether it would be willing to transfer the use of Pilsen Park to the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol because the Sdruzeni decided to arrange the Posvicenska Slavnost <span class="page-break">2</span>(Country-wake Festival) independently. Should the request be denied, the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol will call off the Posvicenska Slavnost and arrange another festival later on under its own auspices.</p>
   <p>The reading of communications followed. The arrangements committee of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union), in its communication,sent five complimentary tickets to a picnic which will be held July 31 in Mrs. Matas' grove, located near the Bohemian National Cemetery, and Mr. Machek asked the delegates to attend this picnic because twenty-five per cent of the net proceeds of the picnic will be donated to the Bohemian Free Thought Schools. The receipt of this letter was acknowledged and the delegates were requested to attend the picnic.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood sent a gift of $2 instead of buying tickets to a festival. The receipt of the letter was acknowledged and a letter of thanks will be sent to the Grand Lodge.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Patronat Skoly F. B. Zdrubek (board of trustees of the F. B. Zdrubek Free Thought School) announced that the tuition for the pupils of this school was increased, and at the same time asked that our people be notified about the change before the beginning of the next school year. The receipt of the letter was acknowledged and proper notification of the change will be given through our daily newspapers.</p>
   <p>A letter sent by the Patronat Skoly T. G. Masaryk (board of trustees of the T. G. Masaryk [Bohemian Free Thought School of Cicero, Illinois]) was read. The Patronat informed us that in one of its meetings it had unanimously decided to establish a fifth grade in its school, and at the same time asked for permission to set up that grade. The teacher, Mrs. Raeck, did not recommend the fifth grade because, as she said, an educational program for the fifth grade must be prepared and worked out.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Dr. A. Mueller, said: "In the first place we have no money. Recently we were forced to sell $500 worth of bonds in order to pay the teachers' <span class="page-break">4</span>salaries. Fortunately we did not lose anything while selling these bonds because Mr. James F. Stepina paid full value for them." Dr. Mueller did not recommend and was not in favor of additional expenses because, as he said, we still have to pay $800 for school books. Mrs. Radesinsky then moved that the letter be tabled and the Patronat Skoly T. G. Masaryk informed that, as long as we are not prepared for the fifth grade, permission for the establishment of the same will not be granted. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>In a letter received from the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, the Chicago district announced that the request of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol, regarding the Posvicenska Slavnost, was rejected because the Chicago district considered it a duty to carry out the planned activities; the Sdruzeni also asked the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol to act according to its former resolution and support the project to the best of its ability so that success may be achieved.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Matejka, said: "In the special meeting it was resolved that we would not join the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe in arranging the Posvicenska Slavnost if the Sdruzeni would not let us arrange the festival independently. The Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe refused to transfer the use of Pilsen Park and therefore, as it was resolved before, the festival is called off and we will arrange something else later on."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mrs. Soucek, said: "The special meeting should not have been called. The delegates who would represent our societies and organizations on the committee for the Posvicenska Slavnost were already appointed in the meetings of our societies and organizations, and the delegates to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol also agreed to arrange the festival."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Jelinek, said: "The special meeting had to be called, and I am surprised that you are saying that it is too late now. At the conference of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of America), <span class="page-break">6</span>held some time ago, eighty delegates of various societies voted against the proposal to arrange the festival with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni. At the meeting of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych of Chicago one hundred and twenty-five delegates unanimously voted against the same proposal and, therefore, the calling of the special meeting was justified. And when the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni refused to comply with the request of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol, the festival is being called off, as it was resolved before."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Hudecek, inquired whether the special meeting was called in compliance with the bylaws, and who was responsible for the meeting being called.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. Karel Soukup, replied: "I called the special meeting after a consultation with seven delegates who signed a petition that an order for the calling of a special meeting be issued. The bylaws of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol direct that the chairman and the secretary have the right <span class="page-break">7</span>to call a meeting, or that upon the request of five delegates a special meeting must be called. The special meeting therefore was lawful and valid."</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Musil, then reported on the result of negotiations with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni. His report read as follow:</p>
   <p>"Brothers Mikolas, Cada, and myself visited the meeting of the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Sdruzeni v Americe but we had to be satisfied with just listening; we could not get the floor. At the meeting one of the delegates to the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni expressed his surprise at the situation, saying that he was sure a resolution had been passed to the effect that if the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol entered a protest the Sdruzeni would be granted the use of Pilsen Park. But the rest of the delegates refused to consider the proposition. The special meeting was called through the efforts of the secretary and the delegates; the chairman, Mr. Joseph Tichava, did not act properly as an officer of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol when he, after the meeting, reported through our daily newspapers that the festival would be held. He published this report in spite of the fact that at the <span class="page-break">8</span>special meeting it was resolved that the festival would be called off if the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni refused to transfer the use of Pilsen Park to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol and permit it to arrange the festival independently."</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. Tichava, then took the floor and said that no other chairman had done more for the schools than he, and for that he is being criticized. The delegate, Mrs. Dobias, said that although Mr. Tichava acted hastily when he published the report in our daily newspapers, his work for the benefit of our schools must be recognized. The delegate, Mrs. Radesinsky, then said that the chairman had no right to publish a report that we are willing to arrange the festival with the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni when it had been decided that the festival would be called off. Now the people are criticizing us because we voted to call of the festival and then permitted a proclamation, signed by the chairman, to appear in the newspapers announcing that the festival would be held. Such an act is not befitting an officer of the <span class="page-break">9</span>Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol. Such assumption of authority is belittling to the delegates.</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mr. Karel Soukup, then said that he was present at both meetings and was surprised by the action of the delegates of the Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslnych Skoly T. G. Masaryk (board of trustees of the T. G. Masaryk Bohemian Free Thought School who represent the said Patronat in the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni. Both these delegates expressed themselves very forcibly, stating that the Patronat of Cicero never consented to remove the name of the Chicago district of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni as the arranger of the Posvicenska Slavnost. The Patronat of Cicero is affiliated with the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol and cannot legally oppose the decisions of the Sdruzeni; therefore such action deserves denunciation. Further debating was discontinued. The Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol will not participate in the festival as it was resolved at the special meeting before.....</p>

   <p>The delegate, Mrs. Stary, presented the financial report on a children's theatrical performance, given May 22 at the Sokol Chicago Hall. The net proceeds of the performance was $512.51.....</p>
   <p>The delegate, Mrs. Dobias, presented the financial report on a theatrical performance given for the benefit of Bohemian free thought schools at the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall. The net proceeds of the performance amounted to $47.52.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as there was no other business on hand, the reading of receipts and expenditures followed and the meeting was adjourned by the chairman.</p>
   <p>Karel Soukup, secretary.</p>
