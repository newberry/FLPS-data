   <p>Our nation succeeded in gaining its independence, and with it a road to the highest culture is wide open. Our nation had to fight the old Austrian Government for every new school, because the Government's intentions were to keep our nation in the shackles of not only physical but also mental slavery. The Austrian Government's intentions were to ruin our nation.</p>
   <p>But now everything is different. The tyrants have fallen and the sun of liberty shines brightly upon our old homeland. The Bohemian people have a brilliant future ahead of them and will soon regain everything in the cultural field of which they were robbed by their enemies, who are now defeated and removed.</p>
   <p>The greatest instrument for the liberation of our nation has been the Bohemian school, where our children have learned to know the glorious past of our forefathers and have thus learned to discern the enemies of the Bohemian people. The school has proved that only a nation having the power of thought is able to survive.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak nation is now politically free and soon will become economically independent. The result of this will be that it may become a Free Thought nation, because with the help of Free Thought schools, it will get rid of all its superstitions and social prejudices.</p>
   <p>We here in America have helped with all our power to liberate our brothers and sisters in Czechoslovakia. We have proved that we are still alive and able to survive. The contacts with our native land are again substantially strengthened. We will again be encouraged to preserve the Bohemian language among our children, to whom we can proudly point out that the old spirit of the Taborites is still living within us.</p>
   <p>Our motto must be the following: Let there not be a single child of Bohemian parents who will not be educated in the Bohemian mother tongue.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago and vicinity is urging Bohemian Free Thought parents to perform their national and human duties. It urges them to send their children to the Bohemian Free Thought schools. There is no reason why they cannot do so. The Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools is concerned with providing good teachers and good premises. In these efforts the Federation is supported by all Free Thought organizations and individuals whose generosity will be best rewarded if our Bohemian Free Thought schools are filled and we shall be able to establish several additional schools.</p>
   <p>Our Bohemian Free Thought schools will open on Tuesday, September 7. Therefore, bring your children to the nearest school and register them.</p>
   <p>The Saturday and Sunday classes will open on September 11 and September 12, respectively. It is presumed that everybody will perform his duty as a Freethinker!</p>
