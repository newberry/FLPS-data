   <p>Yesterday's meeting, called in the interests of the Bohemian English School of the 8th Ward, was fairly well-attended and it seemed apparent that this important matter still has some encouraging supporters.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate as to ways and means of keeping this school active, it was decided to let the entire matter rest in the hands of a committee composed of Mr. G. B. Reisl, Karl Soldat, Hrejsy, Karl Novak, and Fr. Dvorak.</p>
   <p>The committee reported the following resolution which was accepted.</p>
   <p>"We, citizens of the 8th ward, gathered in a mass meeting, recognizing the importance and need of a Bohemian-English Liberal School promise to do all in our power to maintain and provide for it.</p>
   <p>Further be it resolved to invite all national lodges and societies which still honorably consider themselves Bohemian societies to be of help to us to the utmost of their ability, and that they should elect to the committee their own representatives."</p>

   <p>It was further resolved to hold another meeting next Sunday and the meeting then adjourned.</p>
   <p>The committee held a short conference and decided to begin work without further delay. Today and tomorrow the notices will have been sent out and it is hoped that the various lodges and societies will give them consideration as soon as possible and make some sort of a decision in regards to them.</p>
