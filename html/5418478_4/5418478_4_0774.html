   <p>The Northwest side Bohemian School will hold classes this afternoon from 3 to 5 o'clock. The reason for this change of time is the picnic to be held to-morrow by the Bohemians National Benevolent Societies and the fact that children of members of these Societies will no doubt be absent.</p>
   <p>Hereafter classes will be held on Sunday regardless.</p>
