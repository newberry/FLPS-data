   <p>The main event in last Sunday's sport activities of our Czech-American clubs was the game played by the Slavia against the Swedish-Americans. The score was 2:1. One of the causes of the defeat may have been the fatigue of the Slavia's team. Several of the best men had played in its representative team of the Czech Football League on the same day.</p>
