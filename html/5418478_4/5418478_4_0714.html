   <p>P.1--The sponsors of the Bohemian-American Liberal School on Eighteenth Street have become convinced that the present building no longer meets the School's requirements, and that it will be necessary to plan for the erection of a substantial structure. A committee which sent appeals for co-operation to all Liberal societies has received replies from over twenty-three of these organizations. The proposal to erect a new building worthy of the cause was discussed in several meetings, and in each of them the conclusion was reached that such an enterprise is not only desirable but also feasible if carried out in a practical, well-directed manner. The new edifice must not become a burden on the Liberal element, but must be erected on a commercial basis, so that it will not only pay for itself but yield a profit as well. The possibility of this is proved by similar enterprises in other cities and also in Chicago; co-operation is needed, however, from more organized units than those which up to the present time have agreed to support the project.</p>
   <p>On last Friday, June 9, a meeting of representatives was held in which the general outlines of the problem were defined. There will be a directorate of eleven persons, with Tom Polivka as president and Anton Dolezal as vice-president.</p>
