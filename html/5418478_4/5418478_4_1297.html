   <p>The news reaching us from the Sokol congress at Baltimore, according to which the unification of Sokol Unions seems assured, has caused a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction in Sokol circles. The new organization will embrace the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Sokol Society), the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Fuegner-Tyrs Sokol District), and the Delnicke Sokolstvo (Workingmen's Sokols) and will be known as the Cesko-America Obec Sokolska (Bohemian-American Sokol Community). According to the adopted plans, the new organization will leave a great deal of independence to the original three bodies, and at the same time it will become a powerful federation which will no doubt contribute immensely to the growth and further progress of the Bohemian-American Sokol.</p>
   <p>The plans have been approved not only by the delegates of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska, but also by accredited representatives of the other two bodies. A committee composed of representatives of the three bodies is expected to meet in Cleveland within the next three months. It will work out all necessary details and complete the unification, making it binding and definite. If the <span class="page-break">2</span>plans adopted in Baltimore receive the final approval--and we do not doubt that they will--the new organization will start functioning January 1, 1914.</p>
