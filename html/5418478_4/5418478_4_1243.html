   <p>If every boxing match would end like the recent fight in Gary, Indiana, where one of the contestants was killed, this noble American sport would gradually disappear by itself, and the state legislature would not have to bother passing laws for its "regulation". But, anyway, what is the use regulating. Boxing, when indulged in sensibly and for the purpose of developing a healthy, strong body, may be as excellent an exercise as any other kind of athletics. But when it becomes professional and is indulged in for money, it immediately reverts to brutality and debases the contestants below human dignity. The desire for money--cupidity--awakens the vilest passions and complete ruthlessness toward an opponent, and that cannot be prevented by any "regulating".</p>
   <p>Professional prize fighting is a brutal outgrowth of sport and should be prohibited altogether. If some one kills a man in the ring, it is no less a crime <span class="page-break">\2</span>than if he shoots and kills him in the street without any provocation.</p>
