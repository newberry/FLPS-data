   <p>Karel Prchal, reporting on the results of the various competitive events in the Sokol convention meeting held at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania last week, announces that the Chicago teams were blessed with good fortune and won first prizes (both as individuals and as teams). The Zupa Stredni (Central District [of the American Sokol Union, located in Chicago]) was likewise very fortunate in wresting away the laurels formerly held by other teams. This they did by their general bearing and specific performance, gaining 989.25 points. Among the individuals who competed, Jindrich Smidl, of the Sokol Chicago finished with 203.55 points. He also won the first prize in a group of Sokol champions, having 132.40 points to his credit.</p>
