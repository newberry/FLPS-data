   <p>Pupils of the Free Thought school Jan Neruda gave proof of their knowledge of the Czech language at a performance in the Sokol Havlícek-Tyrš hall, Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street. "Stríbrná Labut'" (The Silvery Swan), a fairy tale, was given under the direction of Mr. Vaclav Fuks and drew an audience which filled the hall.</p>
   <p>All the pupil-actors gave an excellent performance in this play by Gustav Klika, which, though only a fairy tale, nevertheless voices the longing of the Czechs and pictures the suffering which our nation had to endure after the battle on Bílá Hora (White Mountain), and echoes the hope for liberation.</p>
