   <p>Svornost, when we step on her corn - which happens quite often, because she travels over crooked paths and accumulates many corns - does not have any other answer, except that our paper is the property of Loeffler and other Jewish and non-Jewish politicians. To people, who are a little better informed on the matter, it is not necessary to prove, that this is an impudent lie. However, because there might be found among us, and especially among the readers of Svornost, some people, who might also take the stories of this smart aunty about us as current truths, we reply to yesterday's attack and the again repeated old lies, simply so much: When Svornost proves, that Loeffler or any other Jew or Politician has the smallest share in "Hlasatel", we are willing to pay, to any national or workingmen's charitable undertaking, such sum as Svornost itself may direct. If it proves, that besides the members, working in the establishment, and the widow of a former member, that some one else is a member of the corporation publishing this paper, we are willing to do likewise. Because we know, that Svornost does not seek after anything else except to overpower and ruin Hlasatel,we believe, that she will grasp this opportunity with pleasure and that she will try in every way <span class="page-break">2</span>possible to give this proof, so that she may be able to dictate the punishment which would ruin us forever and ever. If however Svornost does not accomplish this, she will stand before the Bohemian public as a convicted liar and slanderer. If the question is, who represents the Jewish press among us, we can easily prove that it is only Svornost. There are employed by Svornost, yellow-sensation seeking Jewish reporters; it has a Jewish agent, in the advertising department, who was married in a Protestant Church. It's chief patron is the Jew Krause, by whom this young Jesus was consecrated into the secrets of the art of twisting paragraphs; the Jew and Politician Loeffler helped with his influence at the inquest over one of the close relations of old August, so that the honorable family was sheilded from disgrace and did not lose the insurance. Such and other connections with Jews Svornost had and still has. Where then is there here a Jewish paper other, then that which is published on 12th and Clinton Streets, in the center of Chicago's Jew-town.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's Svornost points towards us, because we did not publicize some gossip and lies, which appeared in the English newspapers, about <span class="page-break">3</span>Loeffler and Ed. J. Novak.</p>
   <p>We have enough insight and good sense to be able to recognize, which report in the American sensational newspapers could be truthful and correct and which could not, we know, what is simply a partisan attack, of Republican newspapers, upon Democratic office holders. That they do not know this at Svornost and that they can not distinguished between the truth and falsehood, for that we are not responsible; the blame for that must be carried by the corns, which Svornost, an its crooked paths, accumulated and which have now spread to the brains of her"fighting editors."</p>
