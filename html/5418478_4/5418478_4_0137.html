   <p>We have published new regulations, issued by the War Board, concerning newspapers. One of these ordinances demands that subscribers who have not paid up before October 1, 1918, are to be stricken off the list, and no papers are to be delivered to them. No promises or excuses will be accepted for an exemption from this rule. Our subscribers will please take notice of this measure, and send in the money at their earliest convenience.</p>
