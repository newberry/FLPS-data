   <p>The managing board of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) announces that the registration in these schools will be held on September 2 and 5, 1922. On September 2, the pupils attending the Saturday and Sunday morning classes will register at 9 A.M. The registration for the day classes will be on September 5, at 3:30 P.M. All Bohemian parents are hereby notified to register all eligible children in our schools. It certainly will be of advantage to these children to learn their mother tongue, to become acquainted with the history of their native land, and to receive training by means of which a national consciousness can be preserved in their young hearts.</p>
