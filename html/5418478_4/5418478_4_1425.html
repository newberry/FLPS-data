   <p>Several years ago we erected a monument in Douglas Park, dedicated to one of the greatest sons of our nation--Karel Havlicek-Borovsky. Next Sunday we should again observe the anniversary of the tragic end of the undaunted protagonist of Czech state rights and liberty. We think that a few words are necessary to remind the Czechs of their national and patriotic duties here in America. The words with which we address the Czech-American public are not intended to chide anybody--their purpose is merely to inform, exhort, and admonish.</p>
   <p>When we worked for the realization of a monument for Karel Havlicek-Borovsky, we intended to accomplish something more important, more profound, than merely the erection of a statue in a haphazard manner upon a public spot somewhere in Chicago. We certainly did not erect it for a parade--we knew that anything conspicuous or garish was loathsome to Havlicek himself. Had we attempted to honor the memory of Havlicek by a show-piece of some kind, Havlicek <span class="page-break">\2</span>would have felt himself dishonored. It would have been better to assign to him a hidden spot where he could be unseen--a place in the hearts of the Czech people.....</p>
   <p>More serious and deeper emotions were at the bottom of our desire to perpetuate the memory of Havlicek.</p>
   <p>It may not have been the multitude of our people who first conceived the idea, but there certainly rose a small group of men who began enthusiastically and worked persistently toward the goal. They worked for a long time, encountering obstacles not only at the outset of their work, but even when the goal was in sight.</p>
   <p>We want to state clearly that there were two main impulses which furnished the motive power for their enterprise: the one impulse came from within, the other from without.</p>
   <p>The intrinsic impulse is to be found in the boundless love and admiration which the Czech people in America harbor in their hearts for Karel Havlicek-Borovsky. <span class="page-break">\3</span>Our land, America, was especially selected for the proposed manifestation, because it is the land of freedom where every man is at liberty to testify openly to his convictions. These American principles are identical with those for which Havlicek stood and fought; principles for which, like the honest Czech man, he did not shrink from giving his own life.</p>
   <p>The high esteem for Havlicek stirred Czech-America into action, prompting it to dedicate the monument to America, a beacon-light of principles steadfastly upheld. The loss of one's own life for a principle is a supreme sacrifice, true enough, but it may be a patriotic duty. Czech-America gave this monument to our people because it felt the urgent need for its own sake.....</p>
   <p>The other impulse for the promotion of the idea of a memorial was the necessity of making America and other countries as well, aware of our aims and the purposes of our patriotic struggle. It was extremely important to keep America perpetually informed. This country has been ever willing to give prominent recognition and admiration to men who have helped make it a great country; and the question of nationality never entered into its considerations. The rank given especially to those who sacrificed themselves for the independence <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the United States is supreme. We know that there is hardly one town in the United States where no statue of our American heroes can be found.</p>
   <p>Czech-America was on the right track when it placed the monument of one of its great men in the midst of American lands--a symbol of the fight for freedom of our old homeland. The American public, native or foreign-born, passes the monument of Havlicek, simultaneously gathers information about the man thus honored and about the Czech nation, its history, its distress and struggle to regain its inalienable state rights.....</p>
   <p>The monument now stands in Douglas Park. It is not there to be passed thoughtlessly by our people. The principles which it symbolizes must not be forgotten, and the patriotic duties incumbent upon the Czech-Americans must not be neglected or even shoved aside. We should assemble there regularly, at least once a year, just as our people in the old country assemble annually to pay homage at the statue of Rieger [a Czech veteran statesman]. This should be done for the sake of Havlicek's significance for us, and for the purpose of gathering strength and courage for the continuation of our struggle.</p>
   <p>An opportunity for a pilgrimage to our national shrine in Douglas Park will <span class="page-break">\5</span>present itself next Sunday.....All classes of our people should be there--all orgainzations and every individual. No one should try to excuse himself by words such as we have overheard rather often: "I have worked fully twenty years in the pursuit of patriotic aims! Let others take it up now! Let the younger ones do their bit!"</p>
   <p>Friendly conversation before the monument should not relate to Havlicek's life and activities alone; it should also contain a sound comment on the situation of our people in the old homeland, on their misery and oppression. This will fortify us for further action and will give definite, efficacious direction to our endeavor.</p>
