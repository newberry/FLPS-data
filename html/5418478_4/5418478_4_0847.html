   <p>The spiritual superintendent of the Czech Presbyterian church, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, sees to it that people are informed on all important current events. Not only his flock, but wider circles of the Czech group assemble in the Hubbard Memorial Church, 2520 South Lawndale Avenue, to attend the lectures.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Soucek is to be ordained in the Hubbard Church, and for this occasion Reverend Vanek has arranged for the assistance of one of the best orators in the pulpit, Reverend Joseph Krenek, of Silver Lake, Minnesota. The guest will deliver two lectures in the church. The first, today at 8 P. M., will be "In the Present Deluge of the World;" the second, tomorrow, on the subject, "On the Way through the Tempest". Since they promise to be very interesting talks, a large audience is expected. The admission, of course, is free.</p>
