   <p>In conformity to the example of their compatriots of the former "Homeland", the Bohemians intend to erect a monument in Chicago in honor of Johann Huss, precursor of the Reformation. In Prague, Bohemia's capital, a life size statue will beautify a place opposite the National Museum, and a similar monument to Johann Huss shall find a niche in Douglas Park, say the local Bohemians. The Bohemian newspaper editor, J. V. Matejka has been the main cog in this propaganda and he succeeded in arousing the enthusiasm of all the Bohemian National clubs. Within the near future a meeting of the delegates is to be arranged to consider the practical aspects of the plan. A model of the Prague monument is expected....within a few weeks. The cost is estimated at $15,000; to be paid by contributions.</p>
