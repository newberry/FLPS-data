   <p>A new central body of Liberalism has been created here recently, which took upon itself the task of working for the enlargment and the strengthening of the liberal movement. This organization calls itself the Central Liberal Community; it's main purpose is indicated by its name, that is to organize liberal-communities in Bohemian-American settlements. Meeting dates will be announced in the newspapers. The Central Liberal Community will come before the public for the first time on Jan. 6th in the Bohemian American Liberal School hall on 18th Street, where it has arranged to hold a demonstration meeting on this subject the Iroquois Theatre Catastrophe. Thus far Messrs. Bittner, Iska, and Zdrubek have agreed to speak.</p>
