   <p>We reported some time ago that there was under consideration the establishment of Branch Libraries in several sections of the city. This thought has many friends and it is also favored among the Directors of the Public Library, so that there can be no question, but that it will be accomplished soon. The Bohemian member of the Board of Directors of the Public Library is also in favor of the establishment of Branches, and especially, that at least one should be established on the west side where the majority of inhabitants are working people who do not have so much time to come down to the Central Library. There are to be found at the Library many volumes of more than one copy and these can be turned over to the branch to be established on the west side. Many Bohemians are now borrowing books from the library and if we had a branch out on the west side they would use it even more.</p>
   <p>It is quite probably that at the next meeting of the Board of Directors, the matter may be decided.</p>
