   <p>In the Bohemian Settlement at 1831 South Racine Avenue, through the efforts of the Board of Education, Bohemian classes will be opened on March 22, for the purpose of teaching the English language and principally to give necessary information to those people who will apply for citizenship papers. The school will be open only two days a week, Monday and Thursday. It will be a great advantage to our Bohemian countrymen who are preparing to submit themselves for citizenship examinations. The day of registration is set for next Monday and many applications are expected.</p>
