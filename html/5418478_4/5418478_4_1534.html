   <p>Chicago is called the metropolis of the Czechs in America. We are convinced that this is fully correct. As in our homeland, the eyes of all Czechs turn toward golden, centi-spired Prague, so in the United States the sons and daughters of Bohemian descent turn toward Chicago. This city is their rallying point, a place where not only the largest number of our people live on this hemisphere, but from which place Bohemian culture spreads in all directions. It is where plans originate for the preservation and uplifting of the American branch of our people, and where the most active work is carried on for the realization of all our national ideals.</p>
   <p>If Chicago is always the axis around which revolves all Czech-American <span class="page-break">\2</span>life, it is especially so during these days of the great celebration in honor of Havlicek. None other could have been thought of. From among the great men in the more recent history of our people, there is no one whose memory would merit celebration on our part than the one in whose honor we should erect a monument, Harel Havlicek. When our people groaned in spiritual and political subjection, it was Havlicek, who taught them to value their liverty, to seek it, to struggle, to suffer for it. Liberty, such as was Havlicek's ideal, we have and enjoy here.</p>
   <p>Though far from our native land, the scene of Havlicek's activities, we are able to appreciate for what precious treasure this great, farsighted, and enthusiastic spirit fought. When we in this new homeland govern ourselves according to the words of Havlicek, When we have his glorious example before our eyes, not only will we be content and happy, but we will gain the appreciation and respect of all respectable fellow-citizens of America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>That Havlicek's spirit continues to be with us is proven to us in a manner which allows no doubt to exist. All Czechs of Chicago are on their toes, each one endeavoring to contribute his or her share toward the dignified celebration of Havlicek, and everyone strives upon this occasion to enter as deeply as possible into the spirit of Havlicek. Havlicek's spirit abides with us these days. Let us see to it that his spirit remains with us always.</p>
   <p>Today, when the Czechs of Chicago are building a monument to Havlicek, the Czechs of all America are turning their gaze upon them. They do this not merely because they are in the habit of looking upon the Czechs of Chicago as their leaders, but because they recognize that a greater or better man could not have been thought of when it was decided to demonstrate it by a magnificent public monument. The Czechs of Chicago and America in general honor the great men of their people, and that at the same time the value those precious possessions, which this land offers to all who come, so that upon its free soil they could freely develop and perform their duties toward themselves and others. Havlicek is the paragon, the darling of all the Czechs in <span class="page-break">\4</span>America. Today, the Czechs of America observe with joy those uncountable legions, which are making their way to Havlicek's monument. They rejoice with the many thousands who rejoice there, and with them swear that they will not be satisfied with the building of a great bronze monument, but that they will build a monument to Havlicek within their hearts and that they will honor his memory as long as the Czech name exists in this land.</p>
   <p>If we have in this land a better opportunity to carry out the sublime principles of Havlicek, we have a more binding duty to do so. Here we are not opposed by government officials, here they do not persecute us, we are allowed the greatest expansion of which we are capable. We love truth, we defend it, and fight for it. Let us strive to justify our national and humane rights here and everywhere. Let freedom be our greatest possession, and let us never sell it for material advantages.</p>
   <p>If we govern ourselves accordingly, we will prove that we are today unveiling the statue of Karel Havlicek Borovsky, not only because a few enthusiastic thinkers brought out the idea and worked toward its realization, but because we wanted to give expression to our innermost conviction, <span class="page-break">\5</span>to our desires and endeavors, the greatest exponent and defender of which we consider is Havlicek. If we look upon Havlicek's monument unveiled today from this viewpoint, we will not see in it a mere lifeless figure, but we will see in it a living pledge of joyous, happy home life.</p>
   <p>The parade which will be held before the unveiling ceremonies will be really gigantic. Societies will gather in Ceska Plzen (Pilsen District) centering at Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol Hall), from which place it will move toward Douglas Park. According to applications received thus far, it is estimated that there will be between fifteen and twenty thousand persons in the parade. The program at the monument will consist of suitable speeches by our national leaders and official representatives among them being Mayor Harrison, Governor Deneen, and the president of the West Parks Commission, Mr. V. Kolacek. The program will be supplemented by a choral sung by the Jednota Pevecka, (Singing Unity) and band selections suitable to the significance of the celebration. Leaving the monument there will be a parade to Pilsen Park, where the <span class="page-break">\6</span>celebration will be continued with a program suitable to the mood.</p>
   <p>The monument, of Havlicek, which we are unveiling today, is made after the model used by the artist sculpture, Joseph Strachovsky, for his Havlicek monument in Kutna Hora, and the monument at Ziskove near Prague, which was unveiled this spring..................................</p>
