   <p>A fellow-countryman, who is interested in seeing Czech-American lovers of sports well represented before the public, writes to us:</p>
   <p>"A remarkable interest for soccer is visible among our Czech men. It is conspicuous in the part taken in the games; also in the joy with which any news concerning the sport is received.</p>
   <p>"The Peel Cup Commission is arranging international contests among groups of various nationalities. The endeavor of this commission deserves the hearty support of every soccer player. It aims at extending aid to players injured in games. Next Sunday the Czech players are going to meet Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish players; the game will take place in the playgrounds of the Czech-American Club Slavia, which were gladly placed at the disposal of the contestants. The Czech players, in recent games sponsored by the Peel Commission, have committed the error of delegating too many Czech players without considering whether these were properly qualified to take part in international contests. The result was mediocre representation, with frequent defeat.</p>
   <p>"As I am sure to know the sport, I would propose the following players to be chosen to represent our teams on the Commission: Svarc, Svarckopf, Prchal, Wilson, Varys, Fucik, Ton, Oulicky, Simandl, Stejskal, and Brozik.</p>
   <p>"Hoping that my suggestion will be accepted as sincerely as it is offered, I am yours truly, V. N."</p>
