   <p>The question of the erection of a new building for the Czech-English Free-Thought School is being broached again in circles of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czechoslovakian Aid Society). The administration of the School sought to reach an agreement with all societies on the problem of erecting a new modern building on the site on 18th Street, where the old School had burned down. The administration claims that a great many societies have lost their homes as a result of the fire, and many others miss the place where they used to gather and hold various social affairs. The grand lodge of the Aid Society has resolved to take steps immediately to erect the building in the near future, and has sent out appeals to all sublodges asking their consent. The question of financing the enterprise comes next, but no one knows when the work can be begun because it is not easy to get building materials during wartime. The Government is not in favor of building going on at the present time, except in cases of urgent need, but we do not think that it will apply restrictions to the rebuilding of the School.</p>

   <p>The Sokol Americky (American Sokol) complains in its latest number about the lack of interest shown by our people in Sokol affairs--and with justice. The Sokol ranks have been thinned to fifteen per cent [of the former enrollment] by enlistments and conscription into the United States Army and Navy. The Sokols today, more than at any other time, need the full support of our people, so far as their active membership and social activities are concerned.</p>
   <p>The official organ of the Sokols comments on the rally and public contests of the Middle Group, held in Chicago recently. It says, "The public contests showed that our organization is built on firm ground. They proved that our Sokol halls offer rich material to our men, women, boys, and girls. We must continue to work. We must not deviate from the path clearly designated for our future. Our Sokol organizations have had to overcome many obstacles. They will face the future, undaunted, and will survive even in wartime. There is no oppression here, and no sworn enemy of our people. All that is necessary is sincerity of purpose, without dillydallying, coyness, or pomp and circumstance."</p>
   <p>And there is the rub! At the recent Sokol rally, many people were conspicuous <span class="page-break">\3</span>by their absence, who, on other occasions, were [not only present], but unduly vociferous. We need not mention the so-called prominent people; all of them were absent. Only the old-timers, the ever-faithful friends of Sokols came!</p>
