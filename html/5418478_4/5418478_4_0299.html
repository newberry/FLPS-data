   <p>Chicago has a new humoristic paper which is peculiar in that its true character has been discerned by the entire public save the publishers themselves. These believe their sheet to be an indispensable aid to the work of all serious papers who are "The most ardent," "most altruistic," and the ablest" protagonists of the right of the oppressed proletarian; all other people, meaning those who are still wasting their time in reading said publication, see in it a buffoon, trying to put on an appearance of seriousness, while executing somersaults of the most preposterous kind. In the long run nobody gets hurt, everbody enjoys a hearty laugh, only one thing cannot be forgiven to this journalistic Merry Andrew:</p>
   <p>That it attempted to pull down to its own level men of the caliber of a Massaryk and a Haywood. For this arrogance, it deserves, of course the sound lesson it has been given by the public. It is to be regretted, however, that the administering of the lesson has simultaneously hit an honored guest from Prague, who could not, naturally, have perceived in an instant the true character of the men who had seized upon him.</p>
