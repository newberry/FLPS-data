   <p>Yesterday, June 22, 1922, at 7:30 P. M. the Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek V Cicero (Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association of Cicero, Illinois) formally opened its school for citizens. Those who desire to become citizens of the United States may enroll in this school which is located in the T. G. Masaryk school building, 22nd Place and 57th Avenue, Cicero, Illinois. Thanks to the efforts of the Spolek, the United States Government furnished...teachers for this school. The teachers were recruited from the staff of the J. Morton Sterling High School. Therefore, those who intend to become citizens of this land should not overlook this opportunity, but should enroll at once. There are few opportunities of this kind where one may obtain citizenship rights without a difficult examination such as must be undergone by every candidate before final papers are issued to him. After having completed the course prescribed by this school, every candidate will receive a school certificate which he may submit when making his application for his final citizenship papers.</p>

   <p>Countrymen of Cicero and vicinity! Do not let this opportunity go by. If you have not yet enrolled in this school, report at once at the above-mentioned building where the secretary will gladly give you all the information as to time of instruction, etc. Here is a good opportunity, too, for our women who desire to become citizens and who, as such, will be enabled to take part in the political life of America. The school fee is only one dollar for the entire course. This money will be used for light, heat, and rent of the school building. There will be no other fees.</p>
