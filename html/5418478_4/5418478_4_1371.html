   <p>The Gymnastic Union Sokol "Cechie" held a celebration yesterday. The event was the laying of the cornerstone of its building which is being erected on Emma Street. A national Bohemian hall, which would not only be the center of the Bohemian element in that part of the city, but also a nationalistic inspiration, had become a necessity on the north-west side. Sokol "Cechie", which has always stood at the fore-front of nationalistic endeavors, took the first step and will build this hall.</p>
   <p>It now remains for the Bohemians living in that part of the city to give "Cechie" all the support possible, in order to help it carry the heavy burden, which it has imposed upon itself. The hall will not be the exclusive property of "Cechie" but will belong to the entire Bohemian element, and it is expected that all Bohemian Lodges will make it their headquarters, that they will work harmoniously hand in hand so that the hall will truly become the centre of all Bohemian elements.</p>
