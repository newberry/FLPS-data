   <p>The fame of the Bohemian people is spreading, strengthening and growing throughout the entire world; our artists are striving towards this end, and accomplisiing it by means of their singing and playing. After these great artists have lived among us Bohemian-Americans for a while they praise our people as being lively, sociable and intelligent. Only our scientists seem to know nothing about us, for when they arrive among us they do not stay long enough to become acquainted with us, yet they immediately write of us, that we are restless, unintelligent, etc. Where do they get their information? From what source? Where did Mr. Professor Masaryk learn to know us?</p>
