   <p>The lecture by Mr. E. St. Vraz, president of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), held last Wednesday in the Svatopluk Cech Park, was successful in every respect. The hall was filled to capacity, but those who could not get in last Wednesday will have an opportunity to hear Mr. Vraz next Wednesday. He very kindly promised to come again....and show us a large collection of stereopticon slides of Bohemian cities. The admission is free, and the lecture will begin at 8 P. M.</p>
