   <p>A new school year begins. Our youth will again be sent to schools to acquire the necessary education. But schools should not only teach subjects useful for making a living; they should uplift the mind, ennoble the heart, and fortify the character. Some schools sharpen the intellect, but neglect the heart, leaving it devoid of truth about the purpose of life; they do not teach about contact with man, nor about relations with one's own soul. Such a school does not make children better, but rather hardens their character, so that they ridicule and scorn good habits and decent behavior. This is why all good educators agree in the opinion that good morals are the result of a good upbringing, and a free thought education, which liberates the mind.</p>
   <p>Numerous parents send their children to our Czech schools, but frequently only for one or two years. The tuition their children may or may not get in reading the Czech language is insufficient to teach them even its rudiments. They cannot absorb, in one or two years, the same knowledge that it takes other children five or six years to acquire. Fathers and mothers! Do not deceive yourselves by thinking that you have done sufficient by sending your children to our schools for a short time. Experience teaches us that a child who has only a superficial knowledge of the Czech language will lack respect for it, and will associate himself in a different atmosphere at the first opportunity. He will join organizations of other nationalities. We repeat that even the brightest child cannot master in one year, with one lesson per day, what it took others several years to learn.</p>
   <p>We implore all Czech parents to keep this in mind now, at the beginning of the school year. Do not let your mind be changed for any paltry reason. Start out in the right way--the way which is dictated by your experience and your conscience!</p>
   
   <p>The school perpetuates the national sentiment which the parents have instilled into the soul of the child. The school takes up where the parents have left off through lack of professional equipment. The more the child progresses in our school the more help it is given. The very atmosphere of the class acts as a stimulant as it reads and recites Czech poems and stories. Its interest is further awakened by descriptions of the old motherland, remarks about its beauty, and by calling attention to fair traits in the character of the people of Bohemia. Also the accomplishments and the progress of Czechs in America are given credit. All of this teaching generates sentiment and national, patriotic consciousness.</p>
   <p>Some one may retort that the younger Czechs, who were educated in American schools, were brought up in an American spirit, and for that reason have more American ways than Czech. Against this we advance that if there had not been any Czech schools here, our second generation would not have preserved the individuality which is still theirs. In many of our settlements the Czechs would have been swamped and drowned by the foreign element. It is the Czech schools which oppose this influence. Any Czech ambitious to be worthy of his ancestors, our pioneers, should help to maintain and expand Czech schools in America. The most important step toward this end is to get the children to school. There they will obtain the education which is to inspire them with national sentiment and self-confidence.</p>
   <p>Another point worthy of emphasis: Any Czech who feels, even if faintly, that he belongs to our nation should regard its language as a precious heritage, which he should convey to his children in a state as perfect as when he learned the Czech language in the motherland. It is the patriotic duty of every Czech mother and father to bestow this heritage upon their children. For this reason you should send your youngsters to the Czech school where they will obtain a liberal, Free Thought education, and firm patriotic convictions as well.</p>
   <p>When parents begin to be careless about their national duty, the danger approaches, and threatens the annihilation of all patriotic feelings.</p>
   <p>There are, alas, parents among the Czechs, who fail to send their children to Czech schools--and the consequences are terrible--the very thought of them fills our eyes with tears! The children do not know how to read, write, or even think in the Czech language, and cannot make themselves understood by their parents--a situation created by the fault of their parents, who did not give any thought to the Czech schools!</p>
   <p>It has often been said that the Czechs of America will drown in the sea of a foreign atmosphere, and their Czech language will perish with them. They would certainly vanish if they did not grasp the importance of Czech schools, as is the case with some Czechs. Signs of denationalization are already visible on their horizon.</p>
   <p>Many have been compelled to introduce the English language in their clubs and other organizations, for the simple reason that they do not know Czech.</p>
   
   <p>These people are forgetting the language of their forefathers, and disavow it. All this is proof enough that the perpetuation of the Czech language, and the maintenance of Czech organizations and social life, is unthinkable without our Czech schools.</p>
   <p>Czech schools teach children the language of their parents, and only children educated in them are prospective members for Czech organizations, brotherhoods, educational clubs, etc. If a child is to become a sincere Czech, it must get a national patriotic education, which is needed to build up love and enthusiasm for the Czech cause--it will then not only read and write, but also feel Czech. When a Child such as this grows up, it will not look upon organizations and clubs with indifference and join at random wherever it is introduced, but will choose a Czech club, giving it preference over others. These boys and girls will join, conscious of the fact that, for instance, our aid societies are not just brotherhoods that are good for life insurance. They will know that our organizations are also institutions for the maintenance and perpetuation of national spirit, which represents their ultimate objective.</p>
   <p>This truth should be kept in mind by both male and female members of our societies. They should send their children to Czech schools for the benefit of their organizations. So long as we continue to build our future upon national foundations, we shall not have to fear getting lost in a foreign atmosphere, and shall always have our Czech societies and Czech schools.</p>
   <p>Our Czech Free Thought schools teach not only sincere adherence to the Czech nation, but they also instill love for our new free homeland, and have given it many thousands of worthy Czech-Americans, who are good citizens of our glorious republic.</p>
