   <p>The Gymnastic exhibition given by the active members of our "Telocvicne Jednota Sokol" (Gymnastic Society Sokol) last Saturday was successfully produced and afforded the guests a great deal of pleasure.</p>
   <p>The acts of the performers were remarkable because of the fact they were carried out within a limited area; particularly pleasing were the Pyramidal and Buck performances.</p>
   <p>The singing of Mr. Len<span class="gap">[gap]</span>och, Zajicek and Jurka was also greatly appreciated by those present. Later dancing was continuous till early morning.</p>
