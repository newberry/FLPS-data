   <p>The children's celebration in the Bohemian English Liberal School last Sunday was a very successful affair. It was arranged by the Associated Liberal Schools, under the direction of the teacher, Mr. R. Bubenicek. The program was unusually varied, and embraced musical numbers, recitations, songs, and the children appeared in folk dances. Of the musical numbers, the "Medley of Bohemian National Airs," and the "Medley of American National Airs," so beautifully played by Mr. F. Svoboda's orchestra, are deserving of mention. The singing of the pupils of Svatopluk Cech school was very well liked. The program was concluded by the children performing the peasant dance, which was probably the best liked number of the entire program.</p>
   <p>The whole affair was the unmistakable proof of the diligence of the children, and the conscientiousness and ability of the assiduous teacher.</p>
   <p>The attendance was befitting, and it can, therefore, be expected that the celebration brought to the Associated Liberal Schools both moral and financial advantages. It should be mentioned that because of Mrs. Smid's efforts, several of the English newspapers carried reports about the occasion.</p>
