   <p>One of the oldest lodges of the powerful Czechoslovak Benevolent Society in the northwestern part of the city, Osveta Lodge #27, celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence in a grand manner in Cechii Hall, last Saturday night.

(Czechoslovak Benevolent Society). His words were received with applause, and he was presented with a bouquet. Twenty-five girls under the direction of choirmaster J.
