   <p>p. 1. Visitors of our reading room on Blue Island Ave., at 18th St., will surely welcome with pleasure the information that there is to be found here a considerable selection of Bohemian books, which were delivered yesterday. To be sure there are not as many as should be but we can easily hope that in a short time all deficiencies will be removed, because if the library board finds that there is a demand for Bohemian books, it will not hesitate to increase the number continuously. Also there has been created among our countrymen a society which will strive toward that end, that the reading room will continually be expanded with selected Bohemian writings.</p>
