   <p>In a special meeting of the Association of Czech Free Thought Schools of Chicago, held on October 25, the question dealt with was that of devising means to acquire the funds necessary for the maintenance and the improvement of the schools which come under the jurisdiction of the Association, and which are the only means of maintaining and expanding our Czech liberal element among the future generation.</p>
   <p>The support which the Association receives from societies and from the National Cemetery Association is insufficient to check the already rapid denationalization of our Bohemian youth [in Chicago]. We know that those of our youth who belong to societies of other nationalities almost outnumber those who adhere to our own organizations. This condition is the result of the indifference manifested by our leaders in the past toward our younger Bohemian generation.</p>
   <p>It is surely to be admired that our societies can boast of a fair amount of means. However, these societies would do much better to use this wealth [now] for their own benefit and for the benefit of their children. Of what use is it that this or that society can count its wealth in the hundreds of thousands when this wealth must sometime be passed on to the members' children, who not only do not sympathize with their parents but often scorn them, as we have witnessed.</p>
   <p>The only method of gradual emancipation from these wretched conditions is that the societies and individuals shall contribute a larger amount for the Czech Free Thought schools; for the schools can save many of the Czech youth for our people and for our societies.</p>
   <p>The contributions which the Association has thus far been receiving are not sufficient for the needs of all the Czech Free Thought schools, and for that reason the delegates to the Association have decided to increase next year's quarterly assessments from three cents to five cents.</p>
   <p>A special committee was elected which will make up an accurate report of all the expenses of the Association from its very beginning, so that the various societies may know that their money is really carefully managed. A report of the Association's activities will also be made up and sent to all contributing societies.</p>
   <p>There is no member of any [Czech] society who will object to increasing the assessments for the schools after he has examined this report, for that which the Association is doing is for the benefit of our children, and for that reason all individuals should be interested and contribute to this undertaking at every opportunity.</p>
   <p>The committee will also send letters to Czech business and industrial corporations requesting them to remember the Czech schools of Chicago with contributions.</p>
   
   <p>Whoever reads the reports of the European Czech newspapers, which publish every week the contributions deposited with them for the Central Scholastic Association, will discover that contributions for this noble purpose are made not only by wealthy individuals and corporations but also by the poorest people, by those who live on the wages of their daily toil.</p>
   <p>How painful it is to compare the contributions tendered to this institution with those offered to our School Association in Chicago, where more than a hundred thousand Czechs have their residence! We who live here recognize the need of the Central Scholastic Association of Bohemia, which has for the last ten years performed a very useful service in the cultural upbuilding of the Czech nation; however, we are deaf and blind to our own need, to the necessity of providing Czech schools for our own children, with whom we come into daily contact, and whom we expect one day to be the sole means of preserving our mother tongue, the Czech language, in this land of freedom. It would be a meritorious act on the part of those people who have the press at their disposal, and who use it to criticize Czech-American education, if they would take hold and initiate a movement to strengthen the financial resources of our Bohemian-American schools.</p>
   <p>If enough money is available, improvements can easily be made, such as providing better quarters and employing better teachers, teachers who would occupy themselves exclusively with the training and teaching of children, as teachers could afford to do if daily afternoon classes could be maintained.</p>
   <p>If our Czech societies and individuals are really sincere about our language, they will see to it that financial means are not lacking, so that our schools may be, as they are elsewhere, the educators of the next generation.</p>
   <p>For the education and the safeguarding of our youth against rapid denationalization it is necessary that besides the instruction imparted in school, an effort shall be put forth in the home. Parents should teach their children to speak Czech in addition to English. In order that the Czech child may read the Czech language outside school, the Association, from the beginning of its existence, has published a children's paper called Svobodna Skola (Liberal School), which will be enlarged after this coming New Year's Day to care for the needs of older persons. This journal will be a kind of central organ of Czech education in America. The administration and the editing of the paper will be in the care of a special publicity committee.</p>
   <p>If in this way we create a paper which is interesting and educational not only for little children but for the more advanced youth as well, and if the parents and the leaders in our societies will work hand in hand with the Association and its teachers in all school matters, then the loss of our young people will quickly cease, and the lamentations so often heard will cease also.</p>
