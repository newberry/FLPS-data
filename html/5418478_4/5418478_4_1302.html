   <p>The Olympic Games, which attract thousands and thousands of visitors daily to the lake front in Grant Park, continued in their colorful program yesterday afternoon. On the program there was a Bohemian number, Beseda (national square dance), which was performed by children of the Sokol Chicago and of Dvorak Park under the direction of Misses Helena Klaus and Anna Baumruk. We have been told by the Dvorak Park director, Mr. Kodl, that the dance received a great deal of attention, especially from American ladies who admired the characteristic national costumes in which the children were dressed. They danced to the music of the Dvorak Park orchestra.....</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that a Bohemian orchestra played during the evening program in Grant Park. Its conductor was the well-know Bohemian maestro, Mr. Lhotak.....</p>
