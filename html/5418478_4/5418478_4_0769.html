   <p>Yesterday there was a great celebration on 18th Street in the 6th Ward. The occasion being the completion and delivery of the building of the Bohemian English Liberal School. The whole of our so-called Pilsen carried a holiday air. From the majority of the homes, flags of national colors were flown and the streets were unusually decorated. Here stood a temple of freedom, the work and sacrifice of Bohemian Liberals. The membership of the United Lodges of "C. S. P. S. " ( Czecho Slovak Benefit Union) have built for themselves a lasting monument by doing away with the constant moving and kicking around from place to place of the Bohemian-English Liberal School and are deserving of the thanks of every fair-minded Bohemian.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the noon hour the surroundings of the building began to fill with people. The building is simply but tastefully decorated. The front of the building is of red-face-brick and the windows and entrances are of richly decorated stone work. Outside the large window just above the entrance there is an iron balcony, painted in green. Above this window there are carved the initials C. S. P. S. and above them are the words "Rovnost",(Equality) "Svornost" (Harmony)"Bratrstvi" (Fraternity). Above this there is the emblem of brotherhood, two hands clasped together, also the date 1879.</p>

   <p>All carved in stone. Toward three o'clock the parade of the various lodges, participating in the ceremonies arrived before the building. The band played "Kde Domov Miy". (Where is my home)? whereupon the chairman of the Bohemian-English School, Mr. Krejci addressed the gathering with a timely speech in reference to the occasion.</p>
   <p>The singing society"Lyra" under the direction of Mr. R. L. Pitte sang several selections. It is fitting to mention that there were 25 Lodges represented in the parade and that the streets through which the parade moved were richly decorated. The evening merriment was begun at 8 o'clock sharp with the band playing and the children of the school singing. During the evening Mr. Pitte sang several solo selections and the Misses Dusek and Heckner sang several duets.</p>
   <p>With the celebration as a whole everyone can be satisfied. The number of students attending this school has risen to 130 and it probably will grow much larger now, for the teacher, Mr. R. L. Pitte is not only qualified and one of the best Bohemian-American teachers, but he knows how to acquire the good will of his pupils.</p>

   <p>Furthermore and most important it is up to the parents to send their children to this school, for only in that manner will its successful existence be insured and our young people be kept from straying away.</p>
   <p>Let this first school dedicated with the spirit of liberalism also be first in successful influence.</p>
