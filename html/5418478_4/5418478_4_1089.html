   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman of the committee, Brother T. Tovarek, in the presence of the members of the administration, economics, financial and technical committees. The reading of the minutes of the last meeting, held April 8, followed. The minutes were approved as read. Up to the present time the economics committee had not received all the bids for small Slet posters, and therefore the decision concerning this matter was deferred. Brother Jarka Kosar reported for the technical committee that all the preparatory work for the Slet is finished and only a decision regarding the place for the public exhibition is now awaited. The number of sokols who will participate in the Slet is unknown as yet. He also gave a favorable report on his trip to Cleveland, Detroit, and Toledo. The sokols of those cities are diligently preparing for the Slet and send their best regards to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the committee. He recommended that no expense be spared for propagation trips of the Slet officers. It was agreed to send Brother Kosar to advertise the Slet in the West.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Brother Tovarek, explained the purpose of today's joint meeting and opened the debate regarding the arrangement of the preliminary program of the Slet. Upon the request of the chairman, Brother Kosar presented a sketch of the Slet arrangements. A motion that the Coliseum be rented for Saturday, August 28, was carried. The chief commander of men's classes shall work out programs for both principal days--Saturday and Sunday. Because of this change, alterations will have to be made on the small posters. Two thousand more posters will be printed in English only. These will be used to advertise the Slet among the American people. It was agreed to invite the United Bohemian Singing Societies of Chicago to participate in Saturday's program at the Coliseum. According to the report of Brother Strupple, the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society) intends <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to present "The Bartered Bride" during the time of the Slet. The day for the presentation of the opera was set for Friday evening, August 25. Brothers Prchal and Struppl were authorized to negotiate with the Singing Society and are to present the entire matter at the next meeting for reconsideration. The economics committee will take care of the sale of the tickets. It was resolved that Dr. Bedrich Stepanek, Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to the United States, be asked to deliver a speech at Saturday's festival. A motion that a friendly entertainment be arranged for the guests on Sunday evening was carried.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved that all sokols will march to the Coliseum on Sunday. The sokols will meet Sunday, 2 P. M., at Pilsen Sokol Hall. The Czechoslovak Legionnaires will be invited to participate in the Slet festivals. For the visitors of the Slet a pamphlet will be issued and will be used by them as a guide in Chicago. The pamphlet will be prepared by Brother T. Vonasek. The economics committee was ordered to secure a band for the parade and for the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>program at the Coliseum. A wish was expressed that the band of the American Legion be secured for the parade.</p>
