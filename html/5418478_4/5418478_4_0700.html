   <p>P.10, Col.3--The minutes of the meeting, of the Patronage of the Vojta Naprstek Liberal School, which was held on May 31, 1910. The meeting was called to order by the chairman Mr. Rich. Dusil at the regular time. All officers were present with the exception of the treasurer who was excused. Gymnastic Unity Sokol Miroslav Tyrs, sent a communication in which it announces a new delegate.--Mrs. Hrych explains how important and beneficial it is for the Vojta Naprstek school to join the Association of Patronages.--Delegate Mr. Masek then gave many reasons why we should work collectively along educational lines in schools. He added that every reasonable man must admit the advantages derived from union. Delegate Mrs. Hrych, further adds that this union should be accomplished chiefly for the purpose of doing away with the continual begging. Under present conditions, there are received at each meeting six or more requests for contributions and if all of them were granted the society would very often empty it's treasury. This begging and complaining will be done away with, for the association would take care of the needs of the various Patronages. Delegate Jind. Lednik, makes a motion, that it should be decided today, whether <span class="page-break">2</span>the Patronage of Vojta Naprstek shall join the Association of patronages. The motion was seconded and placed before the delegates for discussion. The motion was finally voted upon and carried.
