   <p>Professor Masaryk lectures in the National hall Monday evening on the present development of Marxism. The spacious hall was filled with listners and the professor's lecture was very interesting. He said, that he found that the labor movement in America was advancing in another direction than that in Europe, especially Austria and Germany. European socialism, according to Professor Masaryk, is much more theoretical than that in this land. Germany has the most adherents to Marxism, more than two million; who however are divided into two camps, one of which adheres to the original principles of Marx, the other adheres to the modified form as preached by Kautsky. The first camp has as its head Bernstein. The principles as preached by Kautsky are in the opinion of the professor more practical and progressive. His entire lengthy speech dealing with the relation of the workingmen and middle-class tradesmen to capital was carefully listened to and at the conclusion rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
