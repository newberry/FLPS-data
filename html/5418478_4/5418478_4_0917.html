   <p>Our famous traveler, Mr. E. St. Vraz, gave a very interesting and educational lecture yesterday in the Czech-Slovanic American hall, the theme of which was family life of various peoples. Though he travelled in many lands, and came to know many habits and peculiarities of strange people, he saw one thing in common everywhere: Woman is the focal point, about which revolves the whole family life. Women of all nationalities adorn and beautify themselves in order to attract men. The only difference is in the methods used to achieve their aims. The women of the cannibalistic negroes in interior Africa adorn themselves differently than do the women of our super civilization, though their aims are the same. With the Mohammedan woman, as a slave, she is more subjected the richer the husband is, and the more uncomfortable is her life in the harem. Only the wife of a poor man has more liberty. She does not have to <span class="page-break">2</span>cover her face before strangers, and has almost as much freedom as her husband. Woman is bought in the same manner as any other merchandise or domestic animal, which is the universal custom of all uncivilized people.</p>
   <p>The lecture was very well attended, and Mr. Vraz became so engrossed with his talk that it was past eleven o'clock before the listeners departed for their homes.</p>
   <p>(Mr. Vraz is the organizer of the Bohemian-American National Council, which recently came into existence.)</p>
