   <p>In its ninth session, the sixth convention of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood [herein after referred to as the Jednota])continued its work of yesterday. The session was opened by the president, Mrs. Marie Hajek, who, after ascertaining that the password was given by every delegate and visiting member, ordered a reading of the roll call by the convention secretary. The roll call revealed that all the delegates and officers of the convention were present. The reading of the minutes of the previous session followed, and except for a few minor corrections the minutes were approved as read. This was followed by the reading of congratulatory messages, telegrams, and letters. [List of congratulatory telegrams and letters from various lodges, societies, and individuals is omitted in translation.] The delegates expressed their appreciation for these telegrams, letters and messages by rising.</p>

   <p>A considerable amount of work was again achieved in amending and correcting the various articles of the constitution and bylaws. The work began with the reading of Chapter XIII which deals with the discharge of duties of lodge officers. Proposed changes were received from delegates, some of which were but corrections, while others were amplifications of the text. Some articles pertaining to this section were referred to the committee on constitution and bylaws for further elaboration. The results of the committee's work are to be submitted to the convention later. It was decided under this heading, however, that only those members who are fully capable of discharging their duties should be nominated for the presidency of a lodge. A lengthy and lively debate ensued concerning this point. It was recommended that a former secretary, financial secretary, or treasurer be nominated for the office of president, in other words, a member who is fully acquainted with the bookkeeping and management of a lodge. While these corrections and amendments were discussed, the morning session drew to a close. The delegates repaired to the dining hall where a lunch prepared by the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>festivities committee was served.</p>
   <p>The work of the convention was resumed after luncheon, and the tenth session opened at 1 P. M. Sister Marie Hajek, president of the convention, announced before opening the session that Mr. Pavlik, the photographer, would come to the pavilion on Saturday (today) for the purpose of taking the pictures of those delegates who wish to have a photograph of the convention. She requested all delegates and members to be prepared to have a picture taken. Immediately after this announcement, the session started. The giving of the password was waived, and the roll call followed. All of the delegates were present.</p>
   <p>The work of amending the constitution and bylaws continued. The debate concerning the fitness of a candidate for the presidency of a lodge was resumed. It was again recommended that only such person be considered who was fully conversant with the routine, in other words, a retired officer of a lodge. After <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>a discussion which lasted for some time, Article 25 was finally amended. Relating in essence to the said article, it was decided that minor offices and those of out-of-town representatives [delegates] may be filled by members who find it difficult to attend meetings.</p>
   <p>The convention sanctioned the organization of lodges having but twenty members of whom one could be fifty years of age provided she gain several young candidates for membership in such a lodge. A minimum of twelve members or candidates for membership is sufficient to start a country lodge, but with the same proviso as indicated in the previous item. The initiation fee shall continue to be $10, of which amount $5 shall go to the Grand Lodge and $5 to the central committee, for the said two bodies may not be deprived of their income. For the support of each of them, every member of the Jednota pays but sixteen cents per annum. A motion recommending rewards to founders of new clubs was deferred....</p>

   <p>It was decided that a lodge president should have the authority to call to order any member who uses indecent or defamatory verbiage, to deny the floor to such a member, to punish her, and to order her to leave the premises should she prove to be recalcitrant. In case the president of a lodge herself behaved in a similar unseemly manner, it devolves upon the membership of the lodge in question to have her censured by the Grand Lodge, and where such does not exist, by the central committee. Certain questions which have already been deliberated upon and sanctioned by individual lodges then came up for discussion. It was decided that a motion made, seconded, and carried, even if it becomes a part of the official protocol [minutes], may be deliberated upon anew provided there be another motion made which would prove of a greater benefit to the lodge and to the entire Jednota. Members who were not present at the meeting in which a motion was made, seconded, and carried, have no right to void a decision already entered into the record book.</p>
   <p>Officers of any lodge, when visiting any city in which a grand lodge or the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>central committee is located, have the privilege of attending the meetings of these two bodies and of taking part in the discussions. A great number of other important articles were subjected to the revision of the committee on constitution and bylaws. The convention secretary will work on some of them herself.</p>
   <p>The president of the convention then warned the delegates as to the work which awaits not only the secretary of the convention, but its various committees. Declaring that it would be far better for them to work in seclusion, she ended the afternoon session deferring all unfinished business until the following morning. By the invitation of the chairman of the festivities committee, the delegates....repaired to the dining hall where a joint tea was served.</p>
   <p>A soiree was arranged for that same night in the Pilsen Park pavilion in honor of the out-of-town delegates. The program of this soiree was very much worth while; the local lodges of the Jednota were responsible for the evening entertainment. [Names of local lodges are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The soiree was a dignified link in the chain of convention events. It was characterized by a large attendance, and its program of entertainment afforded all the guests with splendid and noble amusement. First the Delegates were welcomed, and the officers greeting them delivered some very fitting and exalted addresses. Next, the delegates from the various states expressed their views as to how one should work for the Jednota. The entertainment then followed. Mrs. Adamek-Trnka's singing of a lively number, "Vesele Zpevy" (Gay Songs) was conducive to a spirit of good humor among the guests; Mrs. Ethel Smith then recited a poem with great feeling. Our well-known and appreciated artist, Mrs. Matejicek-Ort sang a soprano solo, making a favorable impression upon all the listeners. Other remarkable items on the program were the following: piano solo by Miss Irene Minarik, a musical ditty sung by Mrs. Adamek-Trnka, a recitation by the youthful sisters, Marie and Bozena Pechous. The culminating feature of the program was a duet sung by Mesdames Ort and Adamek, both of whom were attired in charming national costumes. The solo singers were accompanied on the piano by Mr. Scnabl. After <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the regular part of the program was exhausted, the guests gave themselves over to a more general entertainment consisting mostly of dancing and conversation. The party lasted until the wee hours of the morning.....Ice cream and other refreshments were served....</p>
   <p>The next session of the convention will be held this afternoon. The main business of the convention will terminate this afternoon. It is our belief that the convention itself could be ended today, but it is prolonged chiefly to prevent the delegates' from leaving for their homes before this coming Sunday. For that day the Bohemian Ladies' Union has arranged a splendid banquet in honor of the out-of-town delegates to the sixth convention of the Jednota. The Illinois Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Ladies Union will act as host, and the banquet will be given in the....Sokol Chicago Hall, South Kedzie Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets.</p>
   <p>A fine program has been arranged for this banquet, and the entire responsibility <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>for it has been assumed by the entertainment committee, the chairman of which is the devoted national worker, Sister Bohumila Ludvik. Other members of this committee are Sister Frantiska Schejbal, secretary, and Sister Josefina Sedlacek, treasurer. There will be orchestral music at the banquet furnished by the inmates of the Orphanage of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). Mr. Rubringer, who is a conscientious teacher [of music] will conduct the orchestra.</p>
   <p>The banquest will open with the playing of the American national anthem, and while the hymn is being played, the president of the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Ladies Union and the representatives of the various lodges of the Union will appear on the stage bearing flags and accompanied by all of the presiding officers of the Jednota.</p>
   <p>The guests will be greeted in the name of the Union by the president of the Grand Lodge, Sister Anna Brychta. The second item on the program will be a <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>recitation by an inmate of the Bohemian Orphanage, followed by a soprano solo by....Miss Helena Weiner. Then our well-known dramatic artist, Sister O. Splavec, will give a reading. Mr. Milos Bezdek will sing a solo. The festive event will end with an address by the chairman of the festivities committee of the Union, Sister Bohumila Ludvik.</p>
   <p>The final session of the convention will be held on Monday morning. At this time all of the unfinished business will be taken up, and all the minutes of the entire convention approved. In this final session, the newly elected members of the central committee will probably be installed in office. It is expected that the convention will be adjourned at noon.</p>
