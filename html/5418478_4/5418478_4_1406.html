   <p>Since there are many Bohemians who wish to have some kind of military training and who have thus far been prevented from joining the Bohemian Sharpshooters because of the high cost of uniforms, it has been decided to organize a second company.</p>
   <p>The uniforms will be plain and much cheaper. The new company will be under the supervision of the regular Sharpshooters. Anyone wishing to become a member of the new organization will please call at Mr. Zahradnik's no. 125-19th Street.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
