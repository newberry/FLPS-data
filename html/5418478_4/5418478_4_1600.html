   <p>The unveiling of the portrait of Jungmann, painted by Chicago's Bohemian Artist, Mrs. Maria Koupalova - Luskova.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday at 2 P.M., in the Bohemian National Hall, on 18th Street, a large audience of prominent Bohemians, called in by the Chairman of the Lodge, was present at the unveiling of the portrait of Mr. Jungmann, ordered by the Lodge and painted by the noted Bohemian Artist, Mrs. Maria Koupalova- Luskova.</p>
   <p>The artist and her husband, the lawyer, C.D.Luser, were invited to the ceremony.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened with a speech by the Chairman, J. Rezny.</p>
   <p>The portrait was placed on a table on the side of the hall in a space very well lighted. At the last words of the speaker, the veil dropped and before us appeared Jungmann, life size, seated in a chair with a manuscript in his hand. The picture is 6 feet high and 4 feet wide in a richly gilded frame. It is a <span class="page-break">\2</span>veritable image of our patriot, Jungman, artistically finished by our young painter who is acknowledged in the highest art circles of America.</p>
   <p>This picture will be an adornment of our National Hall for many years and an artistic remembrance and pride for the Jungmann Lodge. Every educated Bohemian, visiting Chicago, should not miss seeing this beautiful and precious portrait. The artist, Mrs. Luskova was paid $75. However, it is worth $300. The frame cost $40.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lusek, in the name of his wife, expressed his thanks for the acknowledgment of her work and congratulated the Jungmann lodge on its progress and cultural work. A guest from St. Louis Father Fr. Masek praised the progress of the Bohemians in Chicago and the choice of the artist. The Committee and a few guests than passed downstairs, where refreshments were served.</p>
   <p>The celebration was finished with many toasts to the artist, to the lodges and to Jungmann's honor. We must confess truthfully that this celebration left a very deep impression and in our imagination we visioned the future of the Bohemian people in America. We can see at this time more and more glimmering lights, far <span class="page-break">\3</span>away from us, that are marking a long life for our nation. To-day's celebration marked the erection of one more monument, permanent and effective for the honor and memory of the Bohemians in America. We always can point to it with pride.</p>
