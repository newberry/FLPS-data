   <p>All Czechoslovaks of Chicago and surrounding districts should flock to the Czechoslovak Auditorium, 1440 West 18th Street, tomorrow. The First Slovak Sokol is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its birth.</p>
   <p>The work accomplished by this association, which is "the first" not only in name, but also in importance, is known too well to demand any further mention. It may suffice to say that this organization has always been in the front ranks in the pursuit of genuine Sokol ideals. Its untiring work in the field of nationalistic efforts has secured for it a brilliant page in the history of the Slavonic groups in Chicago.</p>
   <p>All sincere Czechs should participate in the celebration and strive to maintain the warm friendship which ties us to the nationally conscious Slovaks. We are certain that all of our fellow countrymen will become enthusiastic about what they will hear and see in that gathering.</p>

   <p>If the weather is fair, there will be a parade starting at the home of the Slovak Sokol, 1730 South Jefferson Street. Many Slavonic organizations are expected to take part in this parade.</p>
