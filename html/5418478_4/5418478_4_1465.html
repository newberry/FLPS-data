   <p>A regular monthly meeting of the Druzstvo Pro Postavení Husova Jubilejního Domu (John Huss Memorial Association) was held in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanské Podporující Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) last night.....</p>
   <p>.....Dr. František Iška pointed out that the European war is now occupying all of the public interest and that, naturally, all the charity work of our people is being concentrated on collections for our people in the old country. Consequently, there is no hope that collections for the John Huss Memorial could reach an amount sufficient to build the Memorial in such a manner and proportions as would be necessary to make of it an adequate tribute from all Bohemian America to the memory of John Huss. In addition to this, quite unfavorable comments on the undertaking were heard during the convention of the Cesko-Slovenské Podporující Spolky, even though a resolution was adopted recommending support for the Memorial by individual lodges and grand lodges.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. Iška is of the opinion that this resolution is not sufficient to obliterate the impression that the Memorial is not a unanimously approved proposition of all Freethinking Bohemians in America.</p>
   <p>Under such conditions, he recommends the calling of a special meeting of the Družstvo which would be held in October and would take under consideration the question of whether or not the Druzstvo should disband. If the Družstvo, which had been formed to build the John Huss Memorial with the co-operation of all Freethinking Bohemians in America should be disbanded, the Svobodna Obec Cesko-Americká (Bohemian-American Freethinking Community) alone would take it upon itself to bring the undertaking to successful conclusion, but of course in not as large proportions as had been planned.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate, Dr. Iška's proposal was accepted, and the meeting was set for October 11.....</p>
   <p>The general opinion was that if it should be impossible to spend at least $50,000 on the Memorial, it would be better if the Cesko-Americká Svobodná Obec alone built a Memorial....which could be enlarged and completed with the help of all Bohemian Freethinking organizations in America later on.</p>
   <p>There was no disappointment noticeable in the expressions of the representatives when the meeting adjourned. Just the opposite was true. Everyone seemed to be satisfied that even if the Družstvo should disband, the idea will not be abandoned, but adequately followed up by the Cesko-Americká Svobodná Obec.</p>
