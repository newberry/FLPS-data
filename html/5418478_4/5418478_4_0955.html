   <p>women almost caused a riot with their well-executed performance.....Fourteen male adults engaged in a variety of exercises both with and without apparatus. Discus throwing by a group of six adult males was a special feature. There were trapeze and horizontal bar exercises which convinced the public of the great degree of perfection attained by these men.</p>
   <p>The musical accompaniment was furnished by Jiri Zacek's orchestra. The audience was not at all reticent in showing its approval.....The evening attendance, too, was large. Worth mentioning is the drama department of this Sokol group which will present the play "Zmatek nad Zmatek [Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors"] next Sunday in the parish hall of the Saint Vitus Parish.....</p>
