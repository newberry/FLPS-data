   <p>Construction of the new Czech school in Irving Park, on Fortieth Avenue near the Bohemian National Cemetery, will begin very soon. This community is growing rapidly, and the Czech school there is having an excellent effect upon the community. When it has its own building, it will have still better influence.</p>
   <p>The plans were drawn by architects Messrs. Ludvik Novy and Son; the contractors, who will perform the construction work, are Joseph Rus and Son, brick and mason work; Joseph Mraz; carpenter work; Karel Stusek, cornice work.</p>
   <p>The building will be modern in every respect. The premises will be spacious with ample ventilating and lighting facilities. The health and comfort of the children will be well provided for in every way possible. The exterior arrangements of the building will be such that Irving Park Czechs can be proud of them.</p>
