   <p>The Mistni Sdruzeni Svazu Svobodomyslnych (Local Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) prepared the following lectures: Sunday, November 5, [1922] in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent societies), West 18th Street; Sunday, November 12, in the Vojta Naprstek [Bohemian Free Thought] School; Sunday, November 19, in the Jubilejni Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial Building); Sunday, November 26, in the F. B. Zdrubek [Bohemian Free Thought] School.</p>
   <p>Our freethinkers, both men and women, will therefore have an opportunity to attend one of these lectures in the neighborhood in which they live. The Mistni Sdruzeni expects all loyal freethinkers to appreciate this zealous activity of its local group by a large attendance at all these lectures. Our countrymen will prove thereby that they have a desire to think about timely questions and accept the motives which stimulate their mental life. A real freethinker is well aware of the fact the free thought philosophy loses its <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>freshness and becomes stale if it is not stimulated by new ideas which come to us from the outside or are engendered by constant reading. This is one reason why, because of a certain disregard of the above requirements, we have witnessed during the last few years symptoms of sluggishness within our ranks, a state of mind which we must overcome at all costs. The lecturer next Sunday will be Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan. The theme of his lecture will be "The Present Postwar Mental Confusion". Dr. Vojan will mention the social phenomena which appear in Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia. Such phenomena are also noticeable in this country, and it is necessary that we watch their course and development.........</p>
