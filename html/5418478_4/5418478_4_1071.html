   <p>Following are the minutes of the meeting of the slet committee of the first slet (sokol mass meet and exhibition) of the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union), held July 18, 1921:</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the first vice-chairman, Brother Stepan Sus, in place of the chairman who was not present and who sent in a notification that it was impossible for him to attend the meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read.</p>
   <p>Following is a report of the activities of the administration committee:</p>
   <p>An appeal was published in our Bohemian daily newspapers in which our sokols are urged to join a sokol mounted squad which, on the day of the slet, will lead the parade. The squad will be trained by Brother Rudolph Miller, a veteran sergeant of the United States Cavalry. The Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (United Bohemian Singing Societies of Chicago) declined an invitation to participate in the slet and, therefore, an invitation to fill one or two numbers of the program at the slet was sent to the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor Lyra (Lyra Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society). A cablegram was sent to the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze (Czechoslovak Sokol Union of Prague, Czechoslovakia) in which the Union is urged to send an exemplary sokol team to our Chicago slet. In the cablegram it was also stated that we are willing to provide financial aid to cover the traveling expense. A change was also made in the program of the slet. On Friday evening, instead of the proposed presentation of the Bohemian opera, "The Bartered Bride," an entertainment in honor of the guests will be given. Another change was made when it was decided to hold a sokol frolic Tuesday night instead of Monday night.</p>
   <p>All the Czechoslovak societies and organizations were invited and urged to participate in the parade. Individual sokol units and districts asked for the privilege of being hosts to the delegation of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze and, therefore, a motion was presented to appoint a committee which would take care of this matter.</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze has sent us a list of the members of the delegation. The list reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Karel Vanicek, leader of the delegation; Professor Jan Hiller, member of the educational staff of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze and editor of the Sokolsky Vestnik (Sokol News); Professor Josef Kraus, classical gymnasium principal and editor of the Slovensky Sokol (Slovak Sokol); Jan Havranek, chairman of the Rostislav district of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze; Jan Pelikan, secretary of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze.</p>
   <p>Twenty slides advertising the slet were ordered, and individual sokol units have been urged to call for them at the office of the slet and ask the owners of moving pictures theaters in their neighborhoods to project them free of charge.</p>
   <p>The following sokols were appointed as the members of the editorial staff which will take care of the contents of the Sletovy Pamatnik (a souvenir booklet): Frantisek Prchal, Vladimir Struppl, Vaclav Cipra, Jarka Kosar, and J. Dobias.....</p>
   <p>Following is a report of the activities of the economic committee:</p>
   <p>The Patronat budovy Cesko-Slovanskych Podporujicich Spolku v Town of Lake (board of trustees of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall of Town of Lake) announced that its entire building will be at the disposal of the slet committee during the days of the slet free of charge. It is not possible to make plans for locker rooms until just before the slet be-gins. Sister A. Vacek was hired to work in the office of the slet at ten dollars a week. The committee now is working on a detailed program of all the slet enterprises. Brother K. Maly, member of the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Plzen (Pilsen Sokol) was called to serve on the committee. Sister Emilie Jakoubek was called to serve on the committee in place of Sister Polak. The band for the parade was hired.</p>
   <p>The lodging committee reported that questionnaires regarding the lodging of the guests were sent to each member of the Americka Obec Sokolska who re-sides in Chicago. It was resolved that local units be asked to appoint special committees which would take care of the sale of the admission tickets. For that purpose each unit will be asked to call a special meeting. Those brothers who own automobiles will be asked to lend their cars for the use of the slet committee without charge. Negotiations have been made with the representatives of the railroads regarding special railroad fares, but no definite answer has as yet been received.</p>
   <p>The technical committee calls attention to the fact that it will be necessary to provide lunch for the contestants at Dvorak Park on Thursday and Friday.</p>
   
   <p>Besides that it will be also necessary to provide lunch for the junior classes at the Coliseum on Sunday. The contest of the lower division will be held Thursday and the contests of the intermediate and the higher divisions, Friday. The contest for the championship of the women classes will be held Saturday. Brother Jarka Kosar reported that he has been urged by the sokol units of Omaha, Nebraska, to visit them, and he asked that traveling expenses be paid for an instructor who would go along with him and who would demonstrate the sokol drills at the rehearsals. It was agreed to pay traveling expenses to Brothers Jarka Kosar and Tomes.....</p>
   <p>Brother Karel Spacek reported that the Slovak sokol units are actively preparing for the slet. He also reported that articles dealing with the slet have been appearing, from time to time, in almost all the Slovak daily newspapers and that all our consultation meetings will be attended by representatives of the press.</p>
   <p>Na zdar! (To success),</p>
   <p>Karel Prchal.</p>
