   <p>The meeting of representatives of various bodies which have offered their help in building a John Huss Memorial to commemorate the five-hundredth anniversary of his martyr death, and which have pledged at least twenty-five dollars for that noble purpose, was held last night. As was explained in our columns before, the John Huss Memorial is to be the headquarters of Freethinking Bohemians in the United States.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by twenty-eight accredited delegates and was opened by the chairman of the preparatory committee, Mr. Václav Soukeník, former president (sic) of the Grand Lodge of Taborites, who addressed the group as follows:</p>
   <p>"As chairman of the preparatory committee for the building of the John Huss Memorial, I welcome you, the accredited representatives or delegates of your <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>respective organizations. You are the men into whose hands will be entrusted the successful conclusion of the magnificent work with which we expect to commemorate the five-hundredth anniversary of the martyrdom of John Huss. We wish to build a memorial for this national hero of ours which will be the focal point of all endeavors of Bohemian Freethinkers in this country and in Canada.</p>
   <p>"Membership in our preparatory committee, organized March 4, 1912, upon the initiative of Dr. František Iška, was open to representatives of any organization interested in the undertaking, no matter whether or not the respective organization had or had not made any financial contribution to our project. We have considered ourselves merely as a group of idealists who are enthused with the project, whose purpose it is to make the public acquainted with the project, stir up the widest possible interest in it, encourage solicitation of funds, and enlist the co-operation of organizations who would agree to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>sponsor the project and who would in due time follow through with the work started by our informal committee.</p>
   <p>"We have endeavored to avoid the danger of having malicious people say that the John Huss Memorial was the result of an idea of someone who gathered together a few of his friends; that this clique kept everything to itself and for itself, and that all it wanted from others was money. What we want is to make the John Huss Memorial a collective offering of all Bohemian-American Freethinkers to the memory of John Huss on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of his burning at the stake. We want it to be a true and common cultural home of all Bohemian-American men and women. We consider our societies, lodges, unions, and other social organizations as legitimate representatives of our people, and therefore we transfer to them the leadership in and the administration of the project.</p>
   <p>You representatives--you are the delegates of bodies that have already done <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>something for the Memorial, have donated or at least collected funds for it, and have otherwise shown sincere and active interest in this noteworthy project. From now on, the project is yours. Our preliminary committee disbands today and is glad to give its place to a legally constituted body or board of representatives, the Druzstvo Jubilejního Husová Domu (Board of Trustees [or representatives] of the John Huss Memorial Building) which is to be set up at today's meeting.</p>
   <p>"I hereby dissolve the present preliminary committee and give my thanks to all its members, especially, however, to its officers and its press subcommittee for their splendid work. I welcome you again and would suggest that first of all you elect a chairman and a recording secretary."</p>
   <p>After these words of welcome, Mr. Jos. Komorous, delegate of Lodge Ríp, No. 41, of the Cesko-Slovenské Podporující Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), as the oldest of those present, was called to take the chair.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Mrs. A. Starý, representing Lodge Johanna Z Podebrad, No. 23, of the Jednota Táboritu (Unity of Taborites), was elected vice-chairman, and Mr. J. S. Zeman, delegated by the Svobodomyslna Obec (Society of Freethinkers), was appointed recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman asked Dr. Iška to explain how the idea of building a John Huss Memorial in Chicago in 1915 started, and to tell about its development. His report, together with a detailed account of the progress made so far, will be found in tomorrow's issue of this paper. Today we do no more than say that the list of organizations submitted to us that are members of the Druzstvo and the list of their contributions fully justifies Dr. Iška's claim that so far there has not been a single project in Bohemian-America that would have attracted such widespread interest and support among our Freethinking countrymen as has this. Membership in the Druzstvo has been acquired by lodges and units of all Free Thought organizations, (including twenty-two of the Cesko-Slovenské Podporující Spolky), five of the Jednota Táboritu, two of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Cesko-Slovanská Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity), four of the Cesko-Slovanská Bratrská Podporující Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Fraternal Benevolent Unity) and its Chicago grand lodge, two of the Jednota Cesko-Americkych Lesniku A Lesnic (Unity of Bohemian-American Foresters), the largest lodge, Plzen, No. 1, of the Cesko-Americká Jednota (Bohemian-American Unity), and thirty of the Zapadni Ceská Bratrská Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Unity); in addition to these there are several Sokol (gymnastic) units and eight organizations called Svobodna Obec (Freethinking Community). A special committee composed of members of the Svobodna Podporující Jednota Statu Texas (Freethinking Benevolent Unity of the State of Texas), the Texasská Jednota (Texas Unity), and the Cesko-Slovanske Podporující Spolky is at work in Texas.</p>
   <p>The report states further that 318 organizations have made purchases of John Huss Memorial stamps and are using them on their letters and documents. Among <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>these there are a number of women's organizations. Most of them have promised regular contributions as soon as the feasibility of the project is demonstrated.</p>
   <p>After Dr. Iska's report, the delegates' credentials were examined, and the delegates were again welcomed, this time by Chairman Komorous. A draft of the constitution was read, and the delegates approved the provision by which an organization subscribing twenty-five dollars is entitled to one delegate, and for each additional one hundred dollars, one additional delegate or vote is allowed. A computation based on this principle showed that at present, the 86 organizations that are members of the Sdruzeni are entitled to 108 delegates, of which 48 come from Chicago and 60 from elsewhere. Western States are very strongly represented.</p>
   <p>The meeting determined the amounts for which the officers of the Sdruzeni will be bonded.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Shortly after midnight the meeting was adjourned until next Monday, November 3.</p>
   <p>At the coming meeting, officers will be elected and the executive committee, whose first duty will be the selection of a suitable site for the proposed Memorial, will be appointed.</p>
