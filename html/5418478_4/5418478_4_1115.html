   <p>The efforts aiming toward the unification of two Sokol units, the Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy and the Sokol Slavoj, were crowned with success yesterday when, at the joint meeting held in Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy hall, members of both units approved the unification by a great majority. It was also voted that the newly created unit shall be known as the Sokol Tabor, and its president will continue to be the well-known national worker and Sokol, Brother Franka Klepal.</p>
   <p>The Sokol Slavoj unit was founded about seventeen years ago, and its last president was Brother Frantisek Vondracek. The Sokol Tabor now consists of three units, because just seven years ago it was joined by the Sokol Slovanska Lipa unit. By the last unification, the Sokol Tabor unit made tremendous gains in membership. Today, it has three hundred members, not including women Sokols. All property dealings in connection with this unification will be taken care of by Brother E. A. Kermes, a lawyer, who will settle all these <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>matters to everybody's satisfaction in the near future.</p>
