   <p>The Sokol gymnastic society, Slavoj, celebrated the tenth year of its existence last night. An exhibition of gymnastics was given on this occasion in the pavilion of the Pilsen Park Brewery.</p>
   <p>The Sokol Slavoj belongs to the most active of our societies. It has donated almost its entire assets to the Czech National Alliance for the pursuit of our patriotic endeavor, and when the call for volunteers for the formation of a Czech regiment was sounded, the Slavoj members appeared in the front ranks of the Czechs. One of these was brother Vaclav (Jim) Balaban, formerly instructor of the Slavoj.</p>
   <p>The exhibition, which produced excellent performances, was preceded by a parade. The public drill was directed by brother Liska, and the incidental music was supplied by brother Povolny's band. Beginners and experienced pupils, both male and female, took part in the gymnastic program.</p>
