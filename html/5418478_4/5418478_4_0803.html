   <p>On Thursday,April 6, 1922, a charter meeting of the Ingersollova Racionalisticka Spolecnost (Ingersoll's Bohemian Rationalistic Society) took place. In this meeting five trustees were elected for a period of one year. The trustees then chose Mr. James F. Stepina as their president, Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan as lecturer and secretary, and Mr. Otto Vasak as treasurer. The other trustees were Messrs. Karel E. Braun and Antonin Brose. The purposes of this Society shall be the arranging of systematic and thoroughly elaborated lectures based on free thought themes, the publication of brochures and books written in the free thought manner, the procuring of necessary funds for their publication, and the making of the most intimate contacts with other American rationalists. In this way the Spolecnost hopes to become a valuable addition to the already growing Free Thought movement among our people and develop an energetic activity, especially the fields that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>have not been considered for considerable length of time (for example the field of Free Thought literature). The ensuing months shall be devoted to thorough preparation for the above aims, and after the return of the president from his European trip, the Spolecnost will launch its activities in the fall by a series of lectures and publications. Information about membership will be given by the secretary Dr. Vojan, 2004 South Albany Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
