   <p>The present time is certainly the least propitious for agitation and instigation of ill will against immigrants. This is not the time to ask of what descent a man is, but it matters whether he is a decent citizen, and is doing his duty for the nation, whose member he became by birth or adoption.</p>
   <p>For this reason, we consider the lecture inappropriate which was held here by Henry E. Jenkins, director of the night schools of New York. It was delivered last night in the Auditorium hotel before the National Community Center conference. The lecturer advocates the quickest possible Americanization of the immigrant. This can be best done by opposing the clustering of members of one nationality in one settlement, and by making the immigrant study the English language intensively.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Jenkins said: "More than sixty per cent of the four millions of immigrants live in settlements of the large cities where they have no contact with genuine American life. More than five hundred thousand in New York are totally unacquainted with the English language. To Americanize them it is necessary to disperse them among the rest of the inhabitants and teach them our tongue. The condition they are in now constitutes a national danger. New York, probably because the issue is most acute there, has done much in the direction of righting the evil. We have seventeen high schools with eleven hundred teachers; in one thousand classes the English language is taught."</p>
   <p>We have always recognized the necessity and the advantages of the study of the English language. We have urged our immigrants to enroll in schools in the greatest possible numbers.</p>
   <p>Concerning immigrants, however, living in settlements, we are unable to <span class="page-break">3</span>see why they should be regarded as a danger, and why they should be "dispersed." They are a necessity; without them there would be no immigrants. The immigrants finds in the settlement a part of his old home, and his nostalgia is lessened by this. Experience has taught us that immigrants are not as dangerous as are many native Americans, who dodge every sacrifice for their native land and attest to their loyalty by word of mouth only. We have emphasized that creating adverse sentiment toward the immigrant is wrong in general. It is especially pernicious at the present time when all sincere Americans should unite for useful work with ultimate victory as a goal.</p>
