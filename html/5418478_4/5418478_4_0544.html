   <p>The time has come when everybody will have to show his colors and will have to prove that he is determined body and soul to defend the interests of his country. Our government is convinced that the Czechs are sure to do this, for the President has decreed that unnaturalized Slavs shall not be placed in the same class as Germans. In order to retain this exceptional status, these Slavs should show themselves worthy of the advantage granted to them.</p>
   <p>One of the best ways to do this is to acquire the knowledge necessary to understand the political institutions of this country, to acquire valuable information which is a prerequisite of obtaining second citizenship papers, for every prospective citizen must take an examination.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow evening at 7 P. M. a special course will begin at Farragut School, 24th street and Spaulding Avenue. Attorney Albert B. Holecek will lecture on the questions which are likely to be asked by the judge in the naturalization court. Tuition will be free and Mr. Holecek will give his services.</p>
