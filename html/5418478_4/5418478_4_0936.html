   <p>Masaryk has completed his lectures at the University of Chicago. He will undertake a tour of some of the more important cities where Bohemians are settled, and will return next week to deliver lectures which have been requested by Bohemian societies. Altogether he is to give four lectures under the auspices of those Bohemian societies which requested them. The Bohemian public will make up for that which they have thus far missed by so little attending the lectures of the professor at the university, by showing the greatest interest in the coming lectures. The previous two lectures and especially the last met with distinct success, and we are sure that the coming lectures will be in this respect even more successful. That, as a philosopher, scholar and speaker, Masaryk is unequalled by any one whom we have thus far heard, need not even be mentioned.</p>
