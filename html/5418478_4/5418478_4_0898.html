   <p>The last lecture by Mr. Vaclav J. Klofac was held in Atlas Hall at Emma Street and was received with more enthusiastic appreciation than any of the preceeding ones.....</p>
   <p>It was interesting to note that the very large attendance was composed mostly of Serbians and Slovaks, with only very few Bohemians present.....</p>
   <p>The subject of the lecture was conditions in the Balkan Peninsula and the present war.....</p>
