   <p>The Slovak Citizen's Club, "Kildare," is announcing its intention of organizing a school for those who wish to become citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>All Slovaks of the 30th Ward, who have not yet become citizens should take notice of this article. Every year, it is becoming more difficult to obtain citizenship papers. According to the local newspapers, the Congress is working on a bill which will require every individual to read and write English. In case this bill becomes a law, many of our Slovaks would be rejected, because of their inability to read and write the American language.</p>
   <p>The school is to open during the early part of January 1933, but only on one condition, if a adequate number of students register. For further information, write to the president of the club, Frank Kohut, 4248 West Iowa Street.</p>
