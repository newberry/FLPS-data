   <p>Thousands of Slovaks, men, women, and children, assembled in Pilsen Park on July 4th to celebrate the Second Slovak Catholic Day. The Slovak Catholics combined three festivals into one. These were the commemoration of the Slovak apostles, Sts. Cyril and Methodius; the two hundredth birthday anniversary of George Washington; and the anniversary of the independence of the United States.</p>
   <p>The Slovak Day was arranged by Slovak Catholics of Chicago, who once more announce that besides Catholics and good Slovaks,they are also loyal citizens of this country, not neglecting to assist their needy compatriots.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the day's outing were given to the treasury of the Slovak Catholic Charitable Organization, which takes care of Slovak widows and orphans.</p>

   <p>The celebration began at one o'clock, at the church of the Assumption, from which the procession moved to Pilsen Park. Policemen on motorcycles and horses, led the way. The parade consisted of: flag-bearers, both American and Slovak; the children's band from Whiting; a company of little girls dressed in red, white and blue, signifying American colors; the Sokols' bands and choirs from various parishes, and floats conveying men and women in native costume. Many followed in automobiles. When the procession approached the park, it was greeted with cheers by the people who had already assembled and were waiting for the program to start. Many national and religious leaders were present and delivered addresses.</p>
   <p>Dancing followed the speaking and continued until midnight. Thus ended the second Slovak Catholic Day.</p>
