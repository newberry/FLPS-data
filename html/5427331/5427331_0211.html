   <p>During the recent mission in Holy Rosary parish, a branch of the Third Order of St. Francis was organized, and is progressing very nicely. Last Sunday the order held a bunco party in the parish hall for the benefit of the Slovak Franciscan Fathers. The affair was well attended not only by our own parishioners, but by members of St. Josephs' and St. Simons' parishes also. Everyone had a pleasant evening, playing bunco and cards. There were thirty-two bunco tables and ten card tables. The prizes were many and beautiful. It was a successful event in every respect.</p>
