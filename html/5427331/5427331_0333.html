   <p>The Jednota Baseball Magnates met Friday night, March 1, at the Sacred Heart Auditorium, where they discussed plans for the coming season.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Chicago District and a number of the senior members are taking unprecedented interest in the youngsters. This was evidenced by the presence of Mr. Thomas, of Branch 489; Mr. Sulita, Mr. Stefanik, of Branch 647, and Mr. J. Steller, the newly elected energetic president of the Chicago District. A few well construed words by Jednota seem to have instilled new life into the youngsters.</p>
   <p>Interest is now focused on the selection of the "honor" team. This "honor" team consists of nine players who have conducted themselves in a sportsman-like manner on the field. The selection was made by the Umpires Association and the awards were donated by Reverend Joseph Job, moderator of the Chicago District for the past three years.</p>

   <p>We are waiting for Branches 629, 703, 717 and 718 to send in their representatives, for we know they have the material. The next meeting will be held Thursday, March 14. All teams will be notified by Mr. J. Churilla, sports editor.</p>
