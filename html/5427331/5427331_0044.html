   <p>The Alma-Mater of Slovak schools determined to send five American Slovak students who would prove their willingness to continue their studies in some city of Czecho-Slovakia. In this manner she wishes to assure the Slovak nation in America a certain number of strong men and women who would, after finishing their studies and after their return to America be able to participate in the national and religious life of the Slovaks.</p>
   <p>Those students who are interested in this offer, may write for further information to Gustav Kosika, 205 Madison St., Passiac, N. Y.</p>
