   <p>Last Friday, De Paul University held their graduation exercises in the Civic Opera House. Among the graduates was Miss Claudia Mika, of Slovak descent, who received her Degree, Bachelor of Music. Miss Mika received her teacher's diploma last year, which would permit her to teach in public schools but because of her interest in music, she continued her studies in music so that she might attain perfection in that vocation. She is well-known in Chicago because of her appearance at various public celebrations and other affairs. She is also secretary of the "Club Furdek."</p>
