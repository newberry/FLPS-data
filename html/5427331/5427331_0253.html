   <p>Slovaks of Chicago Heights are making arrangements for the celebration of an occasion which is the first of its kind. Among them there is great rejoicing. Why not? We felt the same way when our new parish was being dedicated. Let us all share in their joy and happiness, also in the fact that we added another Slovak Catholic Church to the great number we already have in America. Let us all, therefore, go to Chicago Heights on Sunday, September 15th, and share in the celebration of this great accomplishment.</p>
