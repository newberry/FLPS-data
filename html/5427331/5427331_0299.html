   <p>Many of our readers have been inquiring when we will discontinue the sale of Osadne Hlasy, at our local churches. We therefore wish to announce, that after the last Sunday in June, this year, our publication will be sent to subscribers of record, as second class mail matter.</p>
   <p>We are happy to say that during recent weeks we have received many new subscribers, which proves that the Slovak Catholic has become deeply interested in our publication.</p>
