   <p>Officials of the Illinois Relief Commission recently announced that plans are under way to put 17, 193 people to work in Cook County. By April 1, the Relief Commission will have finished its work. At that time the Federal administration will assume charge of all relief, and the work program will be known as the Civil Works Administration. Many of our local Slovaks will be benefited by this move.</p>
