   <p>We sometimes think that a heart-to-heart talk with our readers and advertisers would be advantageous. It is just recently that the circulation of Osadne Hlasy began to increase in the Middle West. This makes us realize that we are alive, organized and surging ahead, and that the Slovaks are getting better acquainted with one another. Consequently, we are proud of the fact that our newspaper has gained such recognition among the Slovaks of the Middle West.</p>
   <p>Our purpose is to keep on going right ahead as we started. We know the field is large. Slovak Catholics interest themselves more and more in the future of their people. Therefore, they need this publication to assist them in their efforts. We have hopes that in the future, as time goes on, Osadne Hlasy will improve.</p>
   <p>It is our motto to supply our readers with the best reading material available by publishing the activities of their organizations and touching upon all subjects concerning the Slovaks of the Middle West. The publishers of Osadne Hlasy entrust their future to their readers and friends, wishing to work hand in hand with them for a bigger and better newspaper.</p>
