   <p>For some time now we have noticed clouds of unrest and misunderstanding among our Chicago Slovaks. In our various newspapers, our people are constantly attacking and falsely accusing one another of wrongdoings. To climax it all, at this time just as preparations are being made to celebrate the third Slovak Day and the first Slovak Catholic Day, we have reached the height of our ignorance by constantly quarreling. How are others going to understand us and grasp our needs, when we do not understand ourselves? However, if some of our self-nominated and self-elected so called leaders, who use their offices to satisfy their own selfish wants, were pensioned, these misunderstandings which are so harmful to the well being of our Chicago citizens would not exist. We do not wish to criticize this one or that one, on the other hand, we are not praising anyone. However, every honest thinking Slovak, giving this situation a serious thought, will readily admit that there would be no division and no dissension in our ranks were it not for the third Slovak Day and the first Catholic Slovak Day, instead of which we should have one Slovak Day for all Chicago, Slovaks.</p>
