   <p>We consider it our duty to mention the fact there are four Slovak candidates running for public office.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Kubina, a Democrat, is running for state representative from the Fourth Senatorial District; Mr. Florian V. Tylka is a candidate for the same office from the Fifteenth Senatorial District; Mr. Michael Cerny is seeking re-election to the office of senatorial committeeman in the Fourth District, and Mr. Stephan Michuda is running for the office of ward committeeman in the 9th ward.
