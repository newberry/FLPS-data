   <p>J. C. Schiranka, editor of Slovak in America, recently suggested the calling of a World Congress for Slovaks, with the recommendation that a gathering of this find be held every five years in some city where there is a large settlement of Slovaks, and always in a different country. Catholics hold their Eucharistic Congress, students their Fax Ramana, chambers of commerce from all over the world hold their conferences; consequently, why shouldn't the Slovaks call a world congress of Slovaks? The reasons for such a conclave may be various; however, we should define the exact purpose before going into the matter any deeper. To find out just how our people live in other parts of the globe would not be reason enough for such a council. Therefore let us give this matter a little more serious consideration.</p>
