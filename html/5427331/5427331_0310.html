   <p>The parishioners of the Sacred Heart parish, realizing how great is the sacrifice being made by our Slovak Radio Hour, have decided to sponsor a bunco and card party for its benefit. The Slovak hour is directed by Rev. Milan Mlynarovic, and Mr. E. Radio.</p>
   <p>Only after realizing that the financial situation of the "Slovak Hour" is desperate, did the parishioners come to this decision.</p>
   <p>The Slovak public is cordially invited to attend this card and bunco party, since by participating in it they will help this noble cause. Rev. M. Mlynarovic has been asked to be present at this occasion as guest of honor. He will deliver a short lecture on the purpose of the Slovak Radio Hour. Rev. M. Mlynarovic is a very eloquent speaker, a fact whereby the public is assured that his speech will be very interesting and educational.</p>
