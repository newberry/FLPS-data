   <p>It was apparent at the meeting of the committee for the Third Catholic Slovak Day that they had aroused a deep-rooted interest in the hearts of Chicago Slovaks, regarding the annual Catholic Slovak Day. Chicago Slovaks are aware of the necessity of this annual festival, so that their dreams and hopes may be realized. This can be accomplished only through cooperation.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if the Catholic Slovak Day is to be an annual occasion, we should enthusiastically prepare ourselves for the work which is so essential to make this festival a success.</p>
   <p>We must, however, unite to show the public our strength. Thus, we will be able to participate in all local undertakings of the Catholic Slovaks. When the Catholic Slovaks will have established one strong organization, they will be able to undertake and accomplish more on the national field, because the assistance and cooperation of their fellow-brethren will serve as a credit toward success and recognition.</p>
