   <p>October 11th is drawing near. On this day, at Pilsen Park, the first Slovak Catholic Day will be celebrated. This is not the first time the Slovak Catholics of our city have had a national church festival. However, it is their first occasion to commemorate a day set aside for Slovak Catholicism of Chicago and vicinity, and should serve as an elixir in the life of our people. Therefore, let us forget all trivial happenings of the past, and go forward in carrying out our purpose.</p>
