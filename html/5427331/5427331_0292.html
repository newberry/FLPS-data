   <p>Osadne Hlasy was recently made the recipient of a $25 donation from St. Michael's parish. This is a very fine example of which should be followed by all our Slovak Catholic parishes, the interests of which Osadne Hlasy, so faithfully serves. On the front, as well as on the editorial page, it is specifically stated that this is a publication of Slovak Catholic parishes in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
