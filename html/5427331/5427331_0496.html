   <p>During the day, there will be various entertainments and athletic events given by the school children, such as foot races and jumping. There will be some short but interesting speaking. During the program, music will be rendered by Father Lach's band.</p>
   <p>This is the first time that the majority of the local lodges of the Junior Branch have gotten together for any kind of celebration. Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, in order to inspire our children further in their work, we must attend this festival, for the future fraternal life of our youngsters depends on it. We realize that economic conditions are bad at this time; consequently, all we ask of you is to try to be provided with the admission price. By so doing, we prove to our children that we value the interest they take in their work, and also that we are ready to help them.</p>
