    The fact that so many Slovaks subscribe to Bohemian daily newspapers is chiefly our fault, since we cannot maintain at least one Slovak daily. Even though someone ventures to edit a daily newspaper, our countrymen will hardly subscribe to it. They compare the new daily to a more older Bohemian daily, which has more experience. Thus, they lose interest, not giving the new periodical a chance to improve.

   <p>If the Bohemian newspaper would show some consideration of acknowledgment to the Slovaks, we would not be against it so much. Since they do not, it is our duty to mention the fact and state our point of view about the matter.</p>
