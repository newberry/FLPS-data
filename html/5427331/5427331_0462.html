   <p>Sunday afternoon the Club Furdek for the first time held a meeting in the "East Room" of the La Salle Hotel. The club had been looking for quite some time for a place to hold its meeting. A suitable place was finally discovered in the La Salle Hotel. To judge by the large attendance, it was apparent that the members were satisfied with the selection.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the president, Florian Tylka, under whose supervision it proceeded in a satisfactory order. Various matters were discussed and letters from the Slovak Catholic students were read. The students sent a petition to the club, requesting that they be allowed to join it.</p>

   <p>The members considered this matter and after a long discussion they decided to let it rest until the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Among other important matters was a report read by the entertaining committee, regarding the dinner and dance scheduled for next Sunday, February 12, in the La Salle Hotel. This affair is sponsored in honor of the new officers.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned after some other unimportant things had been discussed. Every individual left the meeting in the best of humor. Every one was of the opinion that a meeting similar to this had not been held for a long time.</p>
