   <p>Last Saturday and Sunday, a "field meet" was held in Soldiers' Field, which was sponsored by Chicago Police, who displayed before the public, their courage, dexterity and alertness. This program is an annual event designed to raise funds for the needy families of those policemen who lost their lives while on duty.</p>
   <p>Some very daring, but interesting exercises and stunts, were performed by the Policemen. The most feerless of which was that exhibited by a Slovak, John Balek, popularly known as the "flying cop", who proved, by various stunts, his skill in handling a motorcycle. About forty-thousand policemen participated in the activities of the "meet" this year.</p>
