   <p>The Slovak Bazaar was arranged to create funds for the furthering of the independence of Slovak lands. The first day of this affair showed that the Slovaks, our brothers, have fully grasped their national duties, and that unceasing efforts are needed if they hope to achieve--with the Czechs--what they are longing for, i. e., national independence. The Bazaar is being held at the Pilsen Brewery Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. Many Slovak men and women visited it on the first day, yesterday. It is to be hoped that the Czechs will also flock there in large numbers, thus supporting the cause of the Slovaks and our own as well.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee has done good preparatory work. There are twenty-one tents at which many objects, most of which have been donated, are being sold. The buying was brisk, and the "Golden Book" was given frequent attention. Most of the donations for the "Golden Book" are small, but there are many of them, so that the collection yielded seventy dollars the first day. The gross return <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for the whole bazaar on the first day amounted to five thousand dollars. The contest for the honor of becoming "Queen" of the bazaar attracted liveliest interest.</p>
