   <p>ask for their blessing. From the groom's home, the bridal party will visit the bride's home. The bride greets the people with tears in her eyes and her mother leaves her in the care of the lady-in-waiting. The bridesmaids lead her to a seat at the table and sing while crowning her with a wreath. The bride is then taken to her parents by her sponsors. Since she is not supposed to utter a word becaues of the sorrow and grief in her heart, her sponsors, in her name, thank the parents for their kindness and love. They ask them to forgive their daughter all the sorrows she might have caused them, and finally they ask the parents to impart their blessing.</p>
