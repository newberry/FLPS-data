   <p>Articles are being sent to Osadne Hlasy for publication by the Slovak World's Fair committee. They would be gladly published in the aforementioned paper but for the frequent mistakes in the article, where the word "Czechoslovak" is used without a hyphen. This fact has been stressed previously, but it has not been heeded. Many of these articles were corrected by the editors, since the committee did not take notice, but it cannot be done anymore. The by-laws of the committee state that the name is "Czecho-Slovak," and it seems a though they are not abiding by them.</p>
   <p>The Osadne Hlasy is willing to cooperate with the Czecho-Slovak committee but not with any "Czechoslovak." It is certain that there are other individuals who feel the same way about this matter.</p>
