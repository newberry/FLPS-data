   <p>In the East they have started a new Slovak publication. We congratulate them on their successful efforts in view of the fact that they already have a variety of newspapers and periodicals. Here in the Middle West, however, we do not find it so easy. Our own Osadne Hlasy is having serious difficulties in increasing its circulation. If a publication can increase its circulation in the East, why cannot the same thing take place in the Middle West? This question can best be answered by our readers. Will each who subscribes to Osadne Hlasy after reading the paper pass it on to his neighbor? Do this two or three times; then, if he does not subscribe for the paper, do not let him read yours any more. That sort of person does not have the principles of Osadne Hlasy at heart.</p>
