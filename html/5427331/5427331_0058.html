   <p>The most valuable acquisition, yet the most easily obtained, is good character. It encourages, uplifts and crystalizes; and laughs at troubles and discontent. Whoever is endowed with a noble character finds friends; the lack of it creates enemies. The smiling worker is like a ray of sunshine or a flower in bloom; he is always willing and ready to preform a good deed or extend a helping hand to his fellow men. That man possesses riches in more ways than one, and the community, as a whole, looks up to him for advice and as someone superior to themselves. Such a person sets an example and lends a spirit of co-operation which, after all, is most essential in the building of character and the community.</p>
