   <p>Scotus Viator, English writer and publisher, says that the Slovaks are a European race endowed with geniality by birth. Stevens, an American, says that if a person could choose his nationality at birth, he would choose to be a Slovak, because the average Slovak has no equal. The French artist Contee says that a nation born with such natural ability must be spiritually endowed. Former President William Howard Taft once said: "The Slovak is one of the most industrious, tender-hearted, and romantic of our immigrants; he is deeply interested in our American ways and customs and possesses a large measure of worldly wisdom. Therefore, I welcome him." This should be an inspiration to some of our Chicago Slovaks who sit back and watch the other fellow do it, and all he can offer is criticism. Unity and solidarity is what we need.</p>
