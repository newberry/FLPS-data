   <p>We finally found the opportunity to look over reports of the Czecho-Slovak social that took place at the National Carnival. According to this report, the proceeds from the social amounted to $880.50, which was distributed among the Bohemian and Slovak Charitable Institutions. The Bohemian Welfare Organization received $430.50; the Parish conferences of Saint Vincent de Paul received $350; and the Slovak-American Charitable Society received $100. The latter organization well merited the amount received because it is indisputable that members of this organization gave their moral as well as financial support, and in that respect, they helped to make the social a success.</p>
   <p>Slovak Catholics did not show much interest or enthusiasm in this affair because of its Czecho-Slovak influence.</p>
