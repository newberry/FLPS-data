   <p>The Illinois Relief Commission with the cooperation of local groups, is conducting educational classes for immigrants who wish to become American citizens.</p>
   <p>On recommendation of Governor Henry Horner, the weeks of May 24, and 31, have been set apart for this work. However, because of the large number of people enrolling for these classes, more time has been extended.</p>
   <p>In Cook county this work will be under the direction of Joseph Lisacka, who is a member of the Illinois Industrial Commission; the rest of the State will be under the supervision of S. Torka. There will be local committees to assist in this work.</p>
