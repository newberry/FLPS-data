   <p>It was also decided that the Club's officers should publicly declare their support of the Slovaks, who resigned from the Czecho-Slovak World's Fair Committee, when they learned the name Czecho-Slovak was to be used without the hyphen.</p>

    Much attention was given to the "Slovak Youths' Week." It will be held sometime during the period of the World's Fair. During that week, stage performances, concerts, dances, banquets, lectures, and other educational attractions will be held, and the entire Slovak youth will be cordially invited and welcomed. The purpose of the "Youth Week" is to awaken in our Slovak youth, Slovak consciousness and the love for their Slovak origin, and reveal to those youths, cultural achievements of the Slovak nation.
