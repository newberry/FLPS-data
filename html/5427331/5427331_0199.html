   <p>What we had advocated in Chicago at different times recently became a reality. Last Sunday, a two-act musical comedy was given by the members of St. Simon's parish. Although it was the first time for most of the actors to appear in a play, they gave the audience a wonderful surprise. We congratulate them on their success, and sincerely hope this achievement will give incentive to future attempts to produce entertainment.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us keep up the good work, and give our parishioners and friends more amusements of this kind.</p>
