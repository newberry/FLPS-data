   <p>Rain played havoc with our Decoration Day program, which was to take place at our Slovak Catholic cemetery. In spite of the inclement weather, a good number of people came out to pay their respects to the dead. Memorial services, however, had to be postponed.</p>
   <p>The next day, Sunday, the sun being nice and bright, our people again came out in great numbers. After dinner, memorial services were conducted by Monsignor Blahunka. The reason why memorial services were well attended as that other communities heard on Sunday morning an announcement made by the Church of the sacred Heart, inviting them to come.</p>
