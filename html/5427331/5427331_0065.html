   <p>"I was present," a certain priest, was saying, "with some children who were at play. They were boys in their second year at school. Everything was going along nicely and it did my heart good to see these young, healthy chaps, hopping and skipping about, when all of a sudden an argument arose and I heard one of the boys using profanity." Shocked as I was I looked at the guilty one and said: - 'Young man, do you realize you have cursed, which is a sin? Haven't you heard me say that cursing offends God!' 'Yes! replied the boy laconically 'but my dad curses, not only once in a day, but any number of times.' In great amazement the rest of the boys looked at each other as the young offender made this reply. Is it any wonder then that some of our young boys take to cursing, when the father sets the example! It is deplorable, fathers, the way you are raising your sons! Poor son, what is to become of you?"</p>
