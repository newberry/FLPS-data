   <p>Many of our people who receive relief either from the state or county are unaware that free medical attention is now available. Under the present arrangements a person who is ill and receiving aid, either from the Unemployment Relief Service, the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare, the Veteran's Service, or from the Catholic Diocesan Welfare Society, may get free medical aid, if necessary, and in most cases the clients can get the services of their own family physician. The doctors are getting a good deal less money for their services, but they are constantly on the job and always willing to do their part in relieving human misery and want. There are a number of our own Slovak doctors available and if they help others, they surely will help us.</p>
