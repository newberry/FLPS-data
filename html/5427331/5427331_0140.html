   <p>Many of our Slovak people and newspapers were in doubt about the work of the American-Slovak Citizen's League. We can now assure the public that the League is doing everything possible in order that the Slovaks receive the recognition due them. We are permitted to announce only this information to the Slovak public. The long-awaited recognition by political leaders is becoming an actuality. Just recently, with the assistance of the League, and the co-operation of the Czecho-Slovak Citizen's Club in Mayfair and Jefferson Park, and also with the help of Mr. S. Kruto, and Mr. T. Bowlers, who is president of the Sanitary district, Mr. Samuel Papanek, a young Slovak lawyer, was selected as an assistant to the State Chairman. Mr. Papanek is already functioning in his new position.</p>
   <p>We hope that in the near future we will be able to make more announcements of a similar nature.</p>
