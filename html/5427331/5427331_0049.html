   <p>Several weeks ago we mentioned the fact that the summer vacation of our school children would soon end, and we cautioned fathers and mothers to take the proper steps regarding the education of their sons and daughters. At that time we spoke only in low tones regarding this matter, because, we did not want our youngsters to feel badly about going back to school, but now we may speak louder, because everywhere children are saying to one another: "School starts Tuesday!" Some are glad, others are not.</p>
   <p>Parents, especially Mothers, emit a sigh of relief. They know that their boys and girls are far better off in the hands of good and patient nuns, than when roaming the streets. Their future depends on us. It is, therefore, our duty to guide and encourage them - give them an occasional smile and a pat on the back. These little acts of kindness will go a long way toward lessening little Johnnie's burden, and it will also instill in him a greater confidence in his own ability when he has so much ahead of him.</p>
   <p>We should bear in mind, that an apple seldom falls far from a tree, and, if our offspring is to inherit some of our traits, Why not select good ones?</p>

   <p>Let us, therefore, once more be reminded of our Christian Catholic obligations, and send our children to Parochial Schools.</p>
