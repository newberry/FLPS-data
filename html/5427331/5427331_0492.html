   <p>Our Slovak Catholic lodges are seriously considering the matter of buying a grove, where they can hold picnics and summer outings. In fact, they already have a place in view. We went to see it, and like everyone else, we like it very much. The location is ideal, with beautiful scenery on all sides. It consists of some timber, hills, and also some level ground. It is located along a state highway, far enough from the city where nature is in all its splendor, but not too far out to make the trip tiresome. It can be easily reached from any part of Chicago by our Slovaks. Now the main thing is how to finance this undertaking. We believe that with the good will of everyone, this can be accomplished. How nice it would be for our Chicago Slovaks to have their own picnic grove.</p>
