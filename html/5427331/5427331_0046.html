   <p>Graduation exercises will take place next Sunday at the parochial schools. Next week, there will be a repetition of these exercises in other parishes. Diplomas will be distributed to the graduates as a reward for their efforts during the year.</p>
   <p>During the exercises, many educational speeches will be made for the benefit of the graduates. It will be the last opportunity to instruct students in the manner in which they should conduct themselves in the future to become good Slovaks and Catholics. They are still under control, but as soon as they leave school, the control is lost perhaps, and in later years, one can determine whether they received the correct fact which will serve as the foundation of the future Catholic Slovaks.</p>
