   <p>The National Fraternal Congress, held during the earlier part of this week, gave opportunity to representatives of various organizations to visit our city. At this same period the president of the National Slovak Society asked for advice from these representative about the plan of the "Slovak Mother", in regard to the proposition for cultural needs of American Slovaks.</p>
   <p>Present at the meeting was a delegate of "Slovak Mother", who arrived recently from Europe, with the intention of aiding this cause.</p>
   <p>Non-representatives of various Slovak organizations were present, but those for whom the meeting was especially called were absent. The result of the meeting was a failure.</p>
   <p>Hence, as time goes on, we are further from making this plan a reality, which promises protection to American Slovaks.</p>
   <p>We trust, that all organizations will embrace this plan for its successful fulfillment.</p>
