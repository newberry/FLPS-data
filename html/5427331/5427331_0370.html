    In greeting the Sokols the "Denni Hlasatel" greeted both the Catholic and Non-Catholic performers. To them its the same just so they pay. We mention the fact for the reason that the "Denni Hlasatel" did not mention the Slovaks.

   <p>In the last issue the "Slovak Sokol" stated that the newspapers write very little about them and hardly consider them. Its nobody's fault but their own, they support that kind of a paper instead of supporting a paper that is their own and for them. The paeprs know their duties in the eyes of the Sokols, but they dont know theirs, to the Chicago organizations.</p>
