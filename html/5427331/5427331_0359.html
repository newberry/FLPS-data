   <p>Last Sunday the Catholic Sokols of Chicago and vicinity held a jubilee commemorating the twentieth anniversary of their fourth group in the county with beautiful services. Everyone who attended, whether he was a member or not felt himself honored as being among good Slovaks and Catholics. This is the way it should be. This organization is benevolent and welcomes its friends from all walks of life.</p>
