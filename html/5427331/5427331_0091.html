   <p>Statistics in a recent issue of one of our local Chicago daily newspapers, published in English, showed that the Czechs and the Czecho-Slovaks number about 200,000; Slovaks, however, were not mentioned. Alas! that is how much we Slovaks are known to the American public. Our inactivity reflects upon us. We must, therefore, take part in the coming Worlds' Fair by contributing our share toward its ultimate success, and prove to the world that we, as Slovaks, and not Czecho-Slovaks, are equal and fit for any occasion requiring undivided, and unselfish support. For, after all, a Slovak is a Slovak and a Czech is a Czech.</p>
