   <p>As previously mentioned in Osadne Hlasy, the St. Francis Catholic Foresters of the Assumption parish are rehearsing for a play called "Mr. Stork in Distress." The director, Mr. S. Omelka, is doing his best to make the play a success. Therefore, we consider it our duty to announce to the Slovak public that the stage performance will take place February 26 in the parish hall.</p>
   <p>The chief role will be played by Mr. Erwin Sipka, who is a tenor on the First Slovak Radio Hour. He will play the role of an ardent lover who is trying to win a girl's affection by his singing.</p>
   <p>The Slovak public has an opportunity to meet Mr. Erwin Sipka at the performance, which will commence at four o'clock. The play will be followed by a dance. Therefore, both young and old are invited to spend an enjoyable evening.</p>
