   <p>The moving picture shown by Club Furdek the day before Thanksgiving was so successful that many members and non-members made a request for an encore.</p>
   <p>At the Club's last meeting, when the members asked to vote for or against an encore, the vote was unanimously in favor of it and it was decided to have a midnight show Sunday, January 1, 1933, in the Acadia Theater, 55th Street and Fairfield Avenue. Admission is 35 cents, payable upon entering the show.</p>

   <p>Every member was sent five invitations to be distributed among his friends, especially those who sent a request for a repetition of the performance.</p>
