   <p>February being the month of the Catholic press, now is the time for us to take into consideration the significance of this Catholic institution and develop a greater interest toward its growth.</p>
   <p>Our interest should center exclusively in the Slovak Catholic press, as a matter of fact, we should spread it to cover all Catholic publications, but since the motto is "Support one's own," it is our duty to take into consideration first of all our own Catholic newspapers.</p>

   <p>In previous issues we have stressed the necessity for the propagation of the Slovak Catholic press. If every reader would obtain at least one new subscriber, he would be assisting us in this propagation.</p>
   <p>The Slovaks of Chicago require a newspaper if they want to carry out the undertakings which are expected of them. Besides our newspaper, there are others that deserve help. The other Catholic Slovak publications contribute also to the achievements of the Catholic Slovaks in both the national and religious fields. Therefore, our support should be rendered to them in every possible way.</p>
