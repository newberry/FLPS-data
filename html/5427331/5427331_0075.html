   <p>With the New Year approaching new hopes arise and new programs and undertakings are being considered. The Slovaks of Chicago have also taken a new lease on life and are working toward a better understanding with their fellow-men. With this purpose in view, let us all have a spirit of cooperation, and not of antagonism, by following the commandment of our Creator to love one another.</p>
   <p>By doing this we cannot fail. Not only do we gain the respect of our fellow Slovaks, but of society in general. Therefore, let us observe the golden rule: "Do unto others as you wish they should do unto you!"</p>
