   <p>The Slovak World, a publication of the Federation of Slovak Catholics, published a petition in which it requests Osadne Hlasy to give its entire support to the development of a stronger organization of Slovak Catholics.</p>
   <p>The Osadne Hlasy has made evident in previous issues its desire to cooperate with this organization and will continue to do so. But it is waiting for other Slovak circles to state their opinion regarding this organization. There is a field. There is willingness among the Slovak people. There are many individuals who are capable of performing great work. The thing that is missing is the actual activity which must be commenced by someone. Whoever starts the activity may be assured of the cooperation of the Osadne Hlasy.</p>
