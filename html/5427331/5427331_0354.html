   <p>The Saint George's Palcons, Branch 673 of the First Catholic Slovak Union, held its annual gymnastic public performance, Sunday evening in the Bohemian-American Auditorium. Just as in previous years, the St. George's Sokols received an honorary mention this year for their excellent performance.</p>
   <p>The directress of the women's division was Miss Pitak, and Mr. A. Stepuncik was the director of the men's division. Credit is due to these two for their untiring efforts in making the gymnastic exercises on of the outstanding features, in the Sunday program.</p>
