   <p>America is slowly but steadily nearing the greatest period of prosperity she has ever experienced, for which the present adminstration will be indelibly recorded in history. This is proven by the fact that the people have ceased to worry about their savings. This year, the American dollar will have five times the purchasing power that it had prior to the World War. The price of the average hog will be only a few dollars; our women's purses will be bulging with money; and every grocer will be wearing a smile because of the bargain prices he will be able to offer. Domestic stocks will rise from twenty-five to fifty points and will maintain their level. In this year, the anti-prohibitionists will beat their breasts and demand the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. Our senators and congressmen will be provided with a school, that they may gain a greater knowledge of the needs and wants of our people. The statue of Liberty will be burnished with a bright coat of bronze. Big business enterprises will distribute fifty per cent of their income among their employees. Anton Cermak will be elected mayor and will drive all the parasites who are leading our municipality into bankruptcy out of the City Hall. Crooks <span class="page-break">2</span>and racketeers will disappear, and the only worry which our police department will have will be to see that there is no gambling or beer in our saloons. That we may show our gratitude and appreciation to him who is responsible for this golden age, Herbert Hoover will be elected President for life, and within the period of his incumbency a new world-citizen will be born, who will become a greater president than any one before him. Let him who does not believe in these predictions wait for New Year's Day and the big boom in all lines.</p>
