   <p>After being closed for two years, the Kasper American State Bank, at 19th Street and Blue Island Avenue, on Tuesday, January 15th, again opened its doors to the public.</p>
   <p>Many of our Slovaks have resumed their banking activities with this institution, which had served them for many years in the past. Among the board of directors of this newly reorganized bank is a well known Slovak, Mr. Samuel Kostelny, local undertaker.</p>
