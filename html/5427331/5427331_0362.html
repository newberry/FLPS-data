   <p>Both games scheduled to be played last Sunday were postponed on account of rain and will be played later in the season as part of the regular schedule. Sunday, May 17, will bring St. Michael against Sacred Heart, and St. Cyril against St. Mary. The St. Michael nine, which has added power to its already powerful aggregation by the return of several stats of its 1929 championship team, should not find too much competition from the Sacred Heart boys. The game for Sacred Heart will be its opener, as its scheduled opener was rained out last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The St. Mary-St. Cyril game should provide the feature battle of the day. Both teams are about evenly matched and the outcome will depend upon the pitching. St. Cyril, an early season winner, seems confident of handing St. Mary its second defeat. St. Mary, however, is just as confident of winning its remaining games and will be out to set down the St. Cyril nine. St. Paul of Chicago Heights draws a bye.</p>
