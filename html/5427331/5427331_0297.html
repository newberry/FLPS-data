   <p>I wonder if we ever give a thought to the important subject: Whose activities help most in promoting the existence and progress of this publication? It depends mostly upon our advertisers. The very people whose announcements appear in this paper are our benefactors and make it possible for us to "carry on."</p>
   <p>Therefore, if we wish this paper to continue, then we should not only subscribe for it, but also patronize its advertisers whenever an opportunity presents itself. Such a policy will create a constant growth with all the favorable attributes which are derived thereby.</p>
