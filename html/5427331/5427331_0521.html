   <p>In the near future the Federation of the Slovak Student Body in Chicago, and the Slovak Student Youth will form one circle. This has been the desire of not only the Federation and the Student Body, but of the different Slovak communities in general. It is looked upon as a step in the right direction toward doing greater and better things for our people. With only a few minor obstacles to be removed its purpose shall be realized. In this we need not only the inspirational help of the parents, but they should encourage their children to be more active in organizational work, attend meetings and become members of the Federation of Slovak Catholic Students of America.</p>
