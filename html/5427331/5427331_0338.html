   <p>Due to the fact that the majority of golfers are attending the dedication at St. Francis, Indiana, on September 16th, the date of the finals for our golfers is changed to October 14th. This gives the golfers who have not had an opportunity to qualify, to play such rounds before the finals.</p>
   <p>Many golfers of the Holy Rosary, St. John's and Sacred Heart Parishes have failed to send in their names. Come on, get the sticks polished up and come out with the boys.</p>
