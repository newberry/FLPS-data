   <p>Continuing their hitting where they left off last Sunday, Assumption scored their second victory of the season by beating St. John's, of Pullman, by a score of 13 to 1. G. Beno started for St. John's but was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Westsiders. T. Biros starred on the mound for the Assumption team, holding St. John's to five hits and striking out ten men.</p>
   <p>J. Skriba led the attack with a homer, double and single, and A. Mestan counted a triple, double and a single to lead their teammates to victory over the Pullman lads. St. George, playing inspired ball after their false start last Sunday, gave the Steel district boys from St. Anthony a ten to seven setback. Playing errorless ball and aided by the good pitching arm of G. Patun, the Sokols turned back the Tonies time after time. Bastuga, Janec, Malobitsky, and Pitak showed excellent work with the bat.</p>
