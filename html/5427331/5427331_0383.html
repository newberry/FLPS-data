    Here in Chicago we have a lodge organized on November 7th, 1907 called Tatians Slovak Jednota. This Society was organized for the prime purpose of having the Slovaks remain with their own organizations.

   <p>This is the only society that for dues of One Dollar a month, gives sick benefits for thirteen weeks at $5.00 a week and thirteen weeks at $2.50 per week; and for death benefits, for the first year it gives $100.00, second year $200.00, third year $400.00 and fifth year $500.00; after five years you receive $1,000.00</p>
   <p>At the last meeting it was agreed upon by the high officers that beginning May 29th, 1911, they will give $200.00 the first year and $250.00 the second year, the rest will remain the same until 1912 when the convention will be held.</p>
