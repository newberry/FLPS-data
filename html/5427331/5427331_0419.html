   <p>In the year of 1897 when the capitalist operators opposed organized labor, twenty one Slovic persons were executed under orders of Sheriff Martin.</p>
   <p>The Slovaks, in our own country had inferiority complexes and were treated rudely by the Magyars, and Austrians, but even here in America where freedom reigns, we are not given our share.</p>
   <p>Thirty years ago when our Slovaks came to America the English papers scorned our presence and the people in fear, would not admit their own nationality but said they were Hungarians.</p>
   <p>With the aid of the National Slovak Society, which was organized sixteen years before this paper originated, the Slovaks, joining this freternity slowly began to pull together.</p>
