   <p>Yesterday was the last day of the bazaar conducted by our brothers, the Slovaks. It fulfilled its double purpose, i. e., to provide additional funds for the prosecution of the Czechoslovak aim, which is the liberation of the old homeland, and to encourage the Slovaks in their efforts. After the gigantic success which the Czechs had achieved with their bazaar, the Slovaks, also realized that something should be done to get us all together, to learn still better how to grasp our common purposes, and to make a mutual promise to do all in our power to arrive at the goal.</p>
   <p>From the time of the opening of the bazaar, large crowds thronged to the exposition.....</p>
   <p>The only note which marred the picture was the small attendance on the part of the Czechs. This should serve as a lesson for us in the future.</p>
   <p>The Marine Band from the great Lakes Naval Training Station, which played last Saturday, proved to be a great attraction. John Philip Sousa himself conducted.</p>
   <p>The contest for the title of "Bazaar Queen" also drew the interest of the crowd to a large degree. Mrs. Matusek won with 90,960 votes.....</p>
   <p>The Golden Book yielded approximately $370. The preliminary accounting shows gross receipts of $28,000.</p>
