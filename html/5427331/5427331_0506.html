   <p>The parishioners of the Assumption Church recently celebrated the tenth anniversary of Rev. Joseph Rondzik's service as pastor of their church. To him the Slovak Catholic owes an abundance of gratitude. It was he who conceived the idea of a parish weekly publication; and consequently, our Osadne Hlasy became a reality. We congratulate him on this tenth year of hard work, and may Divine Providence keep him alive for many more years.</p>
