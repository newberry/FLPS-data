   <p>The members of St. Michael's choir are sponsoring a comedy, "Fredie the Chief." They have been making preparations for this performance for quite some time, and finally, with the assistance of their organist, Mr. A. Suhany, they decided to set the date for Sunday, May 21, at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>In addition to the comedy, a very interesting program is provided consisting of Slovak folk-songs, musical comedies by amateur comedians, and various other entertainments.</p>
   <p>This program will be broadcast over station S.M.C. (sic) and will be announced by a well-known Slovak, Dr. Peter Hletko.</p>
   <p>Therefore, every Slovak is urged to attend this stage performance. By attending, he will help obtain a twofold gain, financial and moral; financial because the proceeds will be donated for the alteration of the St. Michael's church, and moral because it will serve as an encouragement to the choir members to continue in their noble work, which will be an honor to the Slovaks.</p>
   <p>Remember the date, May 21, in St. Michael's auditorium, 48th street and Winchester avenue.</p>
