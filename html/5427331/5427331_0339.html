   <p>You didn't forget about the game between St. Stephen and the Catholic Falcons, did you? The game will be played Saturday, Sept. 8th, at  Field, 47th and Aberdeen Sts. The lid will be knocked off at 3:00 p. m. You are in for a treat; both teams are making preparations and are not overlooking a thing. Just to remind you tickets may be had from managers of either team. You are given a chance to see a real game for only twenty-five cents.</p>
