   <p>Next Tuesday, April 7, every qualified voter of Chicago will have an opporunity to protest against the present corrupt city administration. Good citizens demand honest and faithful service from those whom they elect to public office. Chicago, after many years of misconduct among our city officials, is badly in need of a competent and responsible city government. On Tuesday, the voters of Chicago will nominate candidates for the office of mayor, city treasurer, city clerk, judge of the Municipal Court, and in some wards, aldermen. The Slavic race has several candidates in the field, running for nomination to various offices. Therefore, it is the duty of all of us, as good citizens interested in good, clean government, to go to the polls on Tuesday, April 7, and cast our votes according to the dictates of our conscience.</p>
