   <p>We have in Chicago at our various parishes several different sick benefit organizations such as The Catholic Slovak Wreath, The Western Catholic Union, The Society of St. Martin, an independent order; The Holy Name Society, also an independent body; and several other whose membership exceeds a thousand. It is true, however, that up to this time we have heard very little of them, each one being active only within his own parish or community. We believe, therefore, that amalgamation of these units, will be of great benefit to all. So far as we are not stepping on anyone's corns, this matter should be seriously considered. There is urgent need for an organization of this kind.</p>
