   <p>Our Slovaks, lodge members, and other individuals from Chicago and Joliet, are going to attend a picnic on Sunday, September 12, along with their families and friends, in the new Slovak Picnic Grove, which is owned by Mr. Joseph Tomala, a well-known Chicago Slovak real-estate man. This is to be the grand opening of a fifty acre grove put aside by Mr. Tomala for the benefit of his friends and patrons, in fact for all Slovaks of this vicinity, to be used by them as a place of recreation. There is no doubt in our minds that whoever sees this place will like it. So far, everyone has. The location and scenery are ideal. There are fifty acres in all, twenty-five of which are wooded. The rest is rolling hills and prairie, with a baseball diamond and an automobile parking lot. It is also an excellent place for those who love to hike. Being located at Archer Road and 135th St., it has easy access from Chicago and Joliet. The grounds will be opened at 10 A. M. Admission will be free and everyone is welcome.</p>
