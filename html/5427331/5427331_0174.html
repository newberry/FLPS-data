   <p>Slovaks in Chicago, especially in the vicinity of Saint michael's and Saint Simons' parishes, are well acquainted with the Funeral Home of Mr. John M. Kubina at 1938 West Forty-seven Street. Mr. Kubina, who is always willing to comply with the wishes of everyone, saw the necessity of enlarging and modernizing his establishment. He, therefore, re-modeled his entire home so that he might satisfy all modern demands of the present period.</p>
   <p>He is inviting the Slovak public to a formal opening of his Funeral home. It will have the opportunity to examine every part of the building in order to see and be convinced that it is the most beautiful and most modern building, the chapel in particular, among the institutions of its kind in the city. The formal opening will take place Saturday, December 10, and it will be opened to visitors until December 18.</p>
   
   <p>The Slovaks are urged to attend this formal opening because of its interest and worth to all concerned.</p>
