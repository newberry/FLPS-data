   <p>This coming Sunday will be a Federation meeting embracing all lodges of the First Catholic Slovak Union within the jurisdiction of Chicago and vicinity. The president of the Federation is urging other Slovak Catholic groups to be present to arrange for our presentation at the next Worlds' Fair. "Forget our past animosities-and work in unison for a better understanding and co-operation!"</p>
   <p>This Federation has already accomplished much in the way of social and religious work, and can accomplish even greater things with the assistance of conscientious workers. "Let us, then, work in harmony and attend the meetings of our Catholic Slovak Union in greater numbers!"</p>
