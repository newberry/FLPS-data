Everywhere one may see small groups of our Slovaks complaining to one another that we, in Chicago, have nothing to be proud of. This is an indisputable reality. On the other hand such lamenting will not help us. Therefore, instead of bemoaning the fact, let us interest ourselves in some cause that will advance our Slovak civilization to a higher plane. Be builders instead of destroyers; work with a willing heart and hand for the progress of our fellow men. Then,and only then, will our desires and ambitious be realized!"</p>
