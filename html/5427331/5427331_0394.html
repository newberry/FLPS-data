   <p>The Slovaks, not only in Chicago, but in the entire United States, and especially in the East, have endorsed the action of the Chicago Slovaks in withdrawing their support of the Czechoslovak World's Fair Committee.</p>
   <p>Numerous resolutions protesting the actions of the Czechs have been passed at various Slovak social meetings. Just recently a resolution, similar to the ones endorsed by Chicago Slovak organizations, was drafted at a meeting of Slovak men's organizations in Detroit.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, futile for the Czechs to claim that the Czechoslovak World's Fair Committee represents the "cooperative work of the Czechs and the Slovaks."</p>
   
   <p>Harmony does not exist between ourselves and the Czechs, and the brotherly understanding they talk about is a myth.</p>
