   <p>For the last three years Chicago has been without representation on the executive board of the Slovak Catholic Union, a fact for which we have been constantly reproached. However, it will be different in the future.</p>
   <p>At the last convention held in the City of Detroit, Mr. Adam Podkrivacky, a Chicagoan who for a number of years held the office of chief auditor, was elected chairman of the executive council. It is the first time in <span class="page-break">\2</span>history that a Chicagoan has been elected chief executive of the largest Slovak Fraternity in the world. As a matter of fact, we deserve this recognition.</p>
   <p>To Mr. Podkrivacky we offer our sincere congratulations and may the first Slovak Catholic Union rise to greater heights under his leadership.</p>
