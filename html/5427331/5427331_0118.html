   <p>We cannot resist the temptation of not meddling in politics. The reason is the small recognition the Slovaks receive in politics. During political campaigns the Slovaks endeavor in every possible way to make their party a winner, but there isn't any mention of the work they performed, not even a "thank you," after the elections are over. If this keeps up we will be forced to withdraw our support from the party to which we rendered our assistance till the present. We may then probably be recognized in the political field.</p>
