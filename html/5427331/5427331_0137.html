   <p>Articles have been published in several Slovak periodicals which make evident the enthusiasm and interest of the Slovaks, in Chicago, as well as in all over the country in the inauguration of the new president.</p>
   <p>The Slovaks desire to participate at the inauguration, to take place in Washington, but the means they are using to make this desire a reality do not meet with general approval. Why isn't there some sort of understanding among the Slovak political clubs of the East, West, North, and South? If all these political clubs would cooperate with one another, then we may be assured of a representation at the inauguration of President Roosevelt. Otherwise the Slovaks' desire will only be a dream, not a reality.</p>
