   <p>In the month of September, all parents must consider the question of whether to send their children to a parochial or public school.</p>
   <p>The answer should be in favor of the Catholic school, for the simple reason that public schools teach, but do not rear children. They educate the mind, but not the heart of the child. It is the teacher's duty to teach assigned subjects, and when that is accounted for his duty is ended; no more is expected of him.</p>
   <p>The public school can and does educate the mind, but religious principles are necessary to educate the hearts of children. It is here that our Catholic schools come to the rescue. To send children to Catholic schools demands sacrifices and self - denials. Nevertheless the moral bliss of your children is worth the price.</p>
