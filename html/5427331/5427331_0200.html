   <p>During the autumn months, committees of the various parishes work diligently, making preparations for the various entertainments for their fellow-parishioners and friends.</p>
   <p>We are happy to announce that the parishioners from Chicago Heights have succeeded in this worthwhile work. Congragulations!</p>
   <p>We believe it noteworthy to mentions that the committees are not working for material gain, but for the moral benefit of the Slovaks at large.</p>
   <p>Slovak youth-here is your opportunity -- attend these performances, and learn to master the Slovak tongue.</p>
