   <p>On Friday, February 2, Miss Petronella Rozbesky, 4133 Marmora Avenue, graduated with high honors from the Normal College, receiving a diploma which entitles her to teach in elementary schools. However, Miss Rozbesky is not satisfied with being an elementary teacher; she is going right ahead with higher studies, so as to qualify for a position, as high school teacher. We congratulate Miss Rozbesky, and wish her success in her future studies.</p>
