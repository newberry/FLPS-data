   <p>We all know that here in Chicago we have a great many Slovak lodges, but offhand very few seem to know just how many there are. Many of our societies are active, and everyone knows of their existence. However, there are some not so active and of the existence of which no one seems to know.</p>
   <p>Consequently, all of our lodges should see to it that they are listed in the Memorandum which is to be given out in commemoration of the First Slovak Catholic Day. Let all Chicago know of the existence of our lodges.</p>
