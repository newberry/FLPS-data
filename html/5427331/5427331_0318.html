   <p>Radio is a very significant invention of the present day. It greatly concerns us Slovak, especially since the organization of the first Slovak radio hour. The Slovak public should not be surprised at the attention it receives in our publication. We cannot resist criticizing the broadcast on the Slovak hour. The hour was organized for the purpose of uniting, entertaining, teaching and propagating the Slovak name before a larger public.</p>
   <p>The program, instead of remaining exclusively Slovak, began to offer musical pieces, songs and so positions from other nationalities, thus losing the Slovak public's interest.</p>
   <p>We hope that those to whom this concerns, will take heed and make amends.</p>
