   <p>With great interest we follow the articles of the intellectuals regarding the Student Circle in our great city. Comments, in a previous issue, by our beloved writer Dr. Peter Hletko, gave us something serious and interesting to think about. We see great deeds performed in the field of the Catholic Church, and by the Slovak people. Will this sublime step suffice our patriotic Slovaks? They are willing to work in the faithful circle, give their time and help in disseminating the knowledge which was obtained during their younger lives at great sacrifices. In our metropolis, however, we are sorry to say, many of our so-called intelligent individuals do not know enough of their mother tongue, and are, therefore, not loyal to their church and people. They join Free Masonry or some other group which has very little or no time for God and religion.</p>
   <p>This must not happen to our youth! There is only one solution; prevail upon them to join the Student Circle. Once they are united in one body, it will not be difficult to have them work for their church and their people. It is almost certain that much can be done for those, whose educational ambitions have been interrupted because of financial difficulties. In our various parishes are many noble and talented people who have already worked wonders among our parishioners, and are further willing to lend their generous assistance to the underprivileged, so they, too, can contribute to the glory of God and their people.</p>
