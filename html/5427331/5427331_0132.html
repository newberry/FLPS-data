    To be a Socialist means to give everybody the rights you expect yourself, weigh the facts for yourself, meaning that Socialists are now working against the present system and would like to better it. We want everybody to have plenty, not one man to have the whole amount. A Socialist fights against poiltical crookedness and the distinction between the poor and the rich man, also to have all of the people to help each other like human beings and have the same privileges and the same responsibilities.

   <p>Socialism does not mean to gather a strong party so they can control the country. No, but just to over turn the capitalistic system.</p>
