   <p>Oftentimes our Slovak parents, whose children attend Slovak Catholic parochial schools, say, "why teach Slovak in our schools; it is not used here, and as soon as our children leave school they speak English only." These remarks are oftentimes repeated in the presence of the youngsters; consequently, this causes them to lose interest in their mother tongue, with the result that from childhood on they deny they are of Slovak origin. It is true that English is universally used in this country; after all, it is America's national language. However, let us consider other nationalities which, wherever possible promote the use of their languages; in fact, some [of these languages] are being taught in our high schools. Then, why should we Slovaks be ashamed of ours?</p>

   <p>Not long ago, a certain American employer inquired of one of the women employed by him what her nationality was. When she told him that she was a Slovak, he asked: "What kind of nationality is that?" She explained as well as she could. He was so interested, that on the same evening he found time to read about this unknown race and country. There are many more like him. Our Chicago Slovaks have many schools of their own; therefore, they should not deprive their offspring of the opportunity to know their mother tongue.</p>
