   <p>The Third Catholic Slovak Day's Committee is making preparations to make the Slovak Catholic Day a success. We hope that it will receive assistance from all sides, especially from our organizations, dealers, and individuals, so that this year's Slovak Catholic Day be one of the greatest festivals we ever had. It will serve the Chicago Slovaks as a compensation for that which they lost because of their resignation from the World's Fair Committee.</p>
