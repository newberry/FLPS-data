   <p>Slovak citizens have, in the past, supported all candidates of the Democratic ticket. What did they gain by that? Very little; in fact nothing at all. The political power of the Slovak was not fully appreciated. We are, however, at fault, because we did not cooperate.</p>
   <p>At present the Slovak-American Citizens' League is making another attempt to show its strength.</p>
   <p>We are appealing to each and every individual to take this opportunity to heart and be present at the League's meeting. Your presence will enable the Slovaks to receive full recognition in the political field.</p>
   <p>If the Democrats fail to recognize us, then we will join the other side.</p>
