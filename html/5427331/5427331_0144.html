   <p>Our well-known citizen, Mr. Stephan J. Michuda, a Slovak, is running for ward committeeman of the ninth ward. Born in Pullman, of good Slovak parents, he was left an orphan when he was quite young. Left on his own, Mr. Michuda, through his cleverness and ability, elevated himself, and to-day he is an architectural engineer and a lawyer. Consequently, he is capable and deserving of our support. Therefore, fellow-countrymen of the ninth ward, it is our duty, as Slovak citizens, to support the candidacy of Mr. Michuda for the office of ward committeeman on April 10.</p>
