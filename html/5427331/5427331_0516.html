   <p>The thought of the disappearance of the venerable Nuns in our daily American lives strikes us with terror. In their quiet, but untiring way, they have covered the entire universe like the morning dew. Wherever humanity needs assistance, there you will find them; with the ill and the dying, with the aged and the invalid, or, beautifying our houses of worship. To all these endeavors the Slovak Nun has nobly contributed her undying will to help,and with the help of Divine Providence all her realizations shall be fulfilled.</p>
