   <p>Our young Slovak amateur actors and actresses are diligently rehearsing a number of splendid plays to be presented in the near future.</p>
   <p>All our Slovak citizens should attend the performances, and inspire our young people to continue their work.</p>
   <p>These performances are a part of our Slovak culture and are of great significance in maintaining interest in the Slovak language and the Slovak spirit among our people, and especially among our youth. Therefore, do your part and our national theatrical masterpieces will be preserved for the Slovak-Americans of our adopted country.</p>
