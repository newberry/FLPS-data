   <p>Since February, month of the Catholic press, is approaching, we must stress the fact of supporting, first of all, our own Slovak Catholic paper.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper serves the interests of the Slovak Catholic parishes in Chicago and vicinity. We are endeavoring to defend the interests of those parishes and of the entire Slovak Catholic people who form the Slovak Catholic parishes. Our principle is to preserve and defend matters which are Slovak and Catholic. From some of the parishes, that is, from the individuals who created them, we receive assistance and cooperation. We appreciate their help and value it immensely. However, to our regret, there are parishes which have very little consideration for our efforts and which do not show any cooperation. Why? We do not know. Perhaps the reason is their negligence and indifference towards the Slovak Catholic press.</p>

    There are various means whereby we can assist the Catholic press, especially our Slovak Catholic newspaper. First of all, we should propogate the paper among our own circles. Should every patron obtain one new subscriber annually, our newspaper would grow both in size and news coverage. We realize that at present it is difficult to obtain new subscribers. But there are still some Slovak Catholics who have not heard of this paper, and if someone would explain to them the purpose of it, we are sure they would be more than willing to subscribe.
