   <p>The choir of St. Cyril and Methodius parish, will give a card and bunco party next Friday, Jan. 19, at Harmony Hall, 4359 West Thomas Street. The proceeds will be applied to the purchase of a new organ. The old organ has been undergoing constant repairs and the parishioners have resolved to purchase a new one. Therefore, the parish choir is busy trying to make this a successful affair.</p>
   <p>We sincerely ask all our parishioners to lend a helping hand by attending this affair and donating some kind of prize. Remember, it is our duty to do this.</p>
