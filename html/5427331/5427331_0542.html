   <p>Slovaks! Would you enjoy looking at your native land, the beautiful Slovakia, from whence you have been driven? Who would not care to see the town in which he spent his youth? Apparently, there is not anyone who has had the opportunity to visit his homeland because the economic situation was unfavorable. Therefore, many were content with having work, at least, to make a living. How many were able to accompany the Sokols Athletic demonstration to Prague? We have heard much gossip about Russia. Some claim living conditions are good; others claim the contrary. Who tells the truth? You can all see and hear for yourselves on Sunday, at 2:30 or 7 P.M., when the first showing of a film appears at the Bohemian-American Auditorium, 1440 West Eighteenth Street, admission 25Â¢.</p>
