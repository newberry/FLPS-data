   <p>We, the Slovak Catholics, should rejoice because the time has arrived for our long awaited, Second Slovak Catholic Day. The fact that it is to be exclusively Slovak and Catholic makes us proud and shows our love for our faith and nation.</p>
   <p>There is no better satisfaction for the human heart than a sacrifice for one's religion and nation. Alas, sorry to say, there are some individuals, who are willing to accept a bribe to renounce their faith. Such an individual is a disgrace to his nationality.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Slovak Catholic nation is prepared to sacrifice and make the Second Slovak Catholic Day successful. The proceeds will be given to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Slovak Catholic Charitable Organization. In that manner, the nation is endeavoring to wipe away the tears of its orphans, comfort families who are stricken with proverty and who beg and call for cur help.</p>
   <p>We ask for your assistance in supporting this organization. You can do your share by participating in the Second Slovak Catholic Day, which is to be held July 4th in Pilsen Park.</p>
