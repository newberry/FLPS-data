   <p>The ladies club of St. Michael's parish was honored by a very large attendance at a card and bunco party held in the parish hall, on May 24. The prizes were many, and practically two-thirds of those present took with them some souvenirs. These prizes were donated by the following merchants; Arnold Miller, Andrew Pavlik, Joseph Tybor, John Tabor, Joseph Nemec, Mat Oklapek, Sophie Pardell, and many others whose names we do not have at this time. The parish sincerely thank the ladies club for their splendid assistance.</p>
