    The Jednota leaguers lost two games since the last issue of Osadne Hlasy.
   </p>
   <p>The two defeats started with the St. Stephens losing to the Catholic Falcons by a score of 14 to 4. The game was advertised for about three weeks through this column, but, as usual, our Slovaks stayed at home. The boys played before a crowd of ninety paid customers representing about 3,000 Jednotars and Falcons.</p>
   <p>The Jednota boosters, were outnumbered about 10 to 1 by the Falcon supporters. The game was a one-sided affair throughout.</p>
   <p>The Falcons showed their superiority both on offense and defense as well.</p>
   <p>The other game, played Sunday between Assumption and St. Simon, at 51st St. and Francisco Avenue, ended with a defeat for Assumption. The final score was 5 to 3. This was a pitcher's duel between Izrael, of St. Simon, and Mikos, of Assumption, the former yielding seven hits and the latter</p>

    ten hits. The pitcher's efforts were ruined by erratic fielding on both sides. Assumption blundered four times and St. Simons booted the ball twice. Assumption outfielders were handicapped by the condition of the outfield, for Vallach was lost several times amongst the tall weeds and sunflowers.

   <p>According to the latest information from the convention of the Falcons Catholic Slovak Union the protested game between Steelton and St. Stephen was awarded to the St. Stephen boys on a forfeit. The decision was made by the Board of Appeals and Grievances. Althoguh this is only a moral victory for the Chicago District, it is at least an indication that the people out west are not asleep and will not be buffaloed as easily as before.</p>
   <p>St. Stephen boys are seeking a game with the champions of the Midwest Catholic Slovak League. There is no doubt that the challenge will be accepted.</p>
