   <p>Professor A. J. Klain, the former organist of St. Michael's parish, has held the position of organist in an Irish-German parish, the Holy Cross, in Indianapolis, Indiana, for the past eight years.</p>
   <p>In a recent Slovak periodical, Professor Klain complains because he must work in a parish of mixed nationalities. It grieves him because many non-Slovaks are working in Slovak parishes and Slovaks are compelled to seek employment in parishes of mixed nationalities.</p>
