   <p>Now that the primary elections are over, we have an opportunity to rest awhile. From now until the end of the summer not a sign of ambition will be seen. In the early part of Autumn everyone will become active and participate again in the political campaign, especially in the election of the president.</p>
   <p>Slovaks should start making preparations immediately to build a foundation for their future political campaign.</p>
   <p>We have not been informed of the intentions of our Slovak Citizens League, but it is hoped that provision will be made to have the Slovaks stay together and show their unity and strength in the coming elections.</p>
