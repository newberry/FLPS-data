   <p>St. Stephen, the Jednota champions of Chicago, have accepted a challenge from the Catholic Falcons to decide the Slovak Catholic champions of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This will be the game of games. Every Slovak in Chicago should see it, for they are our boys playing for two organizations founded by our forefathers. Both teams are confident of being the victors and they are planning, talking, and practicing for this game of games.</p>
   <p>The game will be played Saturday, Sept. 6th, at Shewbridge Field, 74th and Aberdeen Sts.</p>
