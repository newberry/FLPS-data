   <p>On Christmas Day, our churches were all filled to capacity; in fact, some of them did not even have standing-room. It is at these anniversary feasts that we see the church-goer, who comes once a year to ease his or her conscience, but caring very little about the church or its existence. Very seldom does this type of person contribute anything toward the maintenance of his church, he is, nevertheless, always ready to criticise our clergy and their conduct. His presence in church is not due to piety, but merely one of duty. When life begins to ebb, his plight is a pitiable one; for his spiritual welfare has been neglected for those interests of a material nature.</p>
