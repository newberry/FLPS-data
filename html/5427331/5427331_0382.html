   <p>Presidents, auditors, and editors of all Slovak aid societies held a conference recently. The discussion revolved chiefly around the question of how to pay death benefits for members who are called for services in the Army or Navy. It was resolved that the payment of death benefits should continue, and that every member of the various organizations should be assessed ten cents per month for a "war fund" that is to become a sort of reserve in case there are too many death benefits to be paid. The measure may not prove sufficient, and the organizations will probably increase the assessment; this is expected to happen after the second levy.</p>
