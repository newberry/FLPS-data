   <p>This is the first time our publication is not being sold at the local parishes, and we can proudly say that our circulation has suffered very little, if at all. Subscribers responded generously, and receive their paper through the mail. Although the number of subscriptions received were beyond our expectations, there are some who have not yet subscribed, therefore, we urge them to do so at their earliest possible convenience.</p>
