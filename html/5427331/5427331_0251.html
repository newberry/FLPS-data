   <p>At last week's meeting of the Slovak Catholics a question of vital importance arose, namely, that of whether we were going to be divided into separate groups, in different directions. It was finally decided, that we work together in contributing our part toward the coming Worlds' Fair and its ultimate success.</p>
   <p>Again we must give the ladies credit, because they showed the most interest, and attended this meeting in greater numbers.</p>
