   <p>What happened at the convention of the Ladies Auxiliary of the First Slovak Catholic Union? Frances C. Jakabcin was re-elected president in spite of malicious opposition. We sincerely congratulate Mrs. Jakabcin on her splendid victory. However, we cannot see why Msgr. V. Blahunka, who for the last twelve years has done so much good for the Ladies Auxiliary, of whom he was Spiritual Adviser, was not re-elected. Our women keenly feel the loss of Msgr. Blahunka, We do not wish to censure anyone at the time; all there is to say is that this is the way we Slovaks express our gratitude to one who has done so much for us.</p>
