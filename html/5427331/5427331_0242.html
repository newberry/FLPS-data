   <p>At a recent annual meeting, the lodges of St. Cyril and Methodius parish, discussed plans for a huge entertainment to be given for the benefit of the parish.</p>
   <p>We have nine societies in our parish that are zealously working on a program for this occasion, every member putting forth his best efforts to make it a success. This proves that our labors have not been in vain.</p>

   <p>Some lodges have already sold as many as one hundred tickets. The membership in some of the lodges is not large; however, they are meeting with success; in fact, if the larger lodges can keep pace with them, the outcome will be splendid. Therefore, we sincerely ask all our brothers and sisters, in fact, all Slovaks from all Chicago and vicinity, to come to this entertainment, in which scenes of life in the homeland will be the main feature.</p>
   <p>The performance will take place May 17 in Harmony Hall, 4339 W. Thomas St., Chicago. Tickets may be obtained from the president of any of the lodges of St. Cyril and Methodius Parish.</p>
