   <p>The acting committee of the Third Slovak Day announces that certain matters pertaining to this occasion were left to the Slovak Catholic societies of Pullman. The Slovak Catholics of Pullman have always been ready and willing to lend their assistance to any good Catholic cause. Therefore, it is hard for us to believe at this time, when we are about to celebrate the first Slovak Catholic Day, that they should fail to cooperate with the rest of the Slovak Catholics in our City. Frankly speaking, it is their duty to attend the celebration of the first Slovak Catholic Day to be held at Pilsen Park on October 11th. We sincerely hope to see them there.</p>
