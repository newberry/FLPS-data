   <p>The do or die point in the lives of the Jednota boys arrived and departed. Last Sunday, Assumption, St. Joseph, and St. Stephen, contenders for the Chicago crown, staged their final stand at Fernwood Park, 104th and Wallace Sts.</p>
   <p>The first game between Assumption and St. Joseph was a one-sided affair, for Assumption outhit and outplayed the boys from the near North Side. Assumption collected 10 runs, 12 hits, and erred twice; St. Joseph could only muster one run out of 4 hits and booted the ball twice. The heavy hitting was done by Assumption. Cibira and Pes socked the ball for a double apiece and "Blackie" Adamcik smacked a homer. Roth started for St. Joseph, but under the heavy barrage was relieved by Kalasa, the former struck out 3 men and the latter fanned 2. S. Mikos, pitching for Assumption, gave the air to 9 men. The feature of this game was the fielding of Mestan and Adamcik. Only one double play was completed and that went to St. Joseph. This eliminated St. Joseph from the contest.</p>
   
   <p>The second game between Assumption, the winners of the first contest and St. Stephen was a nip and tuck battle interspersed with some football. From the first inning until the last ball was thrown, the fans roared, razzed, insulted and did everything a fan would to at a deciding game. Although St. Stephen's were outhit, they were not outplayed. It was just a tough battle. Contributors in the slugfest of Assumption were: Adamcik, Skriba, Vallach, and Mikos, with doubles; "Lefty" Skriba also socked a triple for good measure. Assumption made one double play; Mikula to Cibira to Skriba. St. Stephen had 2 double plays, the first was started by F. Sic, with the assistance of Dancik and J. Sic. The second double play engineered by "Shorty" Vasko was a corker, with 3 men on base "Shorty" caught a fly ball in deep left field and made a bullet-like throw to the plate, getting his man. Szany, St. Stephen 3rd sacker, played a marvelous game for St. Stephen, but was relieved by "Jumbo" Bojnansky. As Szany left the field the fans arose and cheered him lustily. Biros pitched 5 innings for Assumption, allowing 7 hits and striking out 3 Stephenites; Mikos in relief role allowed only 1 hit and struck out 5 men. "Durk" Duray allowed 12 hits and fanned 9 of the Assumption men. The final score was St. Stephen, 6; Assumption, 5. This game was witnessed by many Jednotars who have been following the game all season. However, the Slovaks were outnumbered by the total strangers who commented on the game, and the players' conduct afield. Those responsible for the ungentlemanly conduct should be ashamed to face the fans again.</p>
   <p>The champions are leaving for Youngstown, Ohio, Saturday, to play the Mahonning Valley champions Sunday, Aug. 19th. Those wishing to travel with the team can make reservations by calling Mr. Janetka, Canal 6380.</p>
