   <p>On April 2nd, we will again vote for city officers, and representatives. Shall we appoint men of the capitalistic group or shall we elect men of own class, the man for the working people? It has been proven that the Democrats and the Republicans and capitalists who live on pride and riches. They do not know our needs, they do not try to help the working class, they only know about their own welfare. The only time the working people are remembered is at election when our votes are needed to help.</p>
