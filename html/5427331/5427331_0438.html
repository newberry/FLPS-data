   <p>The cadets of St. Joseph's parish are going to hold their Annual Ball Sunday, November 25, 1934, in Harmony Hall, located at Thomas Street and Kostner Avenue. There will be plenty of entertainment for both young and old. The young folks will dance to the music of an excellent union orchestra. Our friends the Strako brothers, with their instrumental band, will furnish the music. To cheer the old folk, they will play their beautiful Slovak melodies. There also will be a raffle of one hundred and fifty articles. The cadets have been selling chances on these prizes for over a month. This will be a rare occasion; the committee on arrangements have been active for quite some time, and a good time is assured to all who attend.</p>
