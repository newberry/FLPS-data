   <p>At the annual meeting of the Federation of the Slovak Catholic organizations of the First Catholic Slovak Union held in Chicago, January 22, in St. Joseph's parish hall, the officers and representatives unanimously adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>We have watched the work of the Slovak and the Czech joint committee in preparation for the World's Fair, which will be held this year in Chicago, and we have approved their actions until recently; but cannot do so now, because of the strange attitude of the Czechs. Also, part of the blame goes to our compatriots because they assisted the Czechs in attempting to have us appear at the World's Fair as Czechoslovaks. The Czechs insist the name is not to be hyphenated and the "S" not capitalized. Some of the Slovak representatives protested and resigned from the committee which represented 50,000 Slovaks residing in Chicago, and more than a million Slovaks in America. We approve of the resignations and, therefore, we congratulate our representative, Dr. Peter Hletko, and give full credit to the other representatives who joined him in the protest. We are proud of the fact that they did not disappoint the Slovak nation.</p>
