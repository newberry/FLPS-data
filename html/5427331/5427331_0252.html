   <p>A new duty awaits our Chicago Slovaks, and that is the one regarding the coming Worlds' Fair. In this we need the united efforts of our various societies and Slovak citizens. Arrangements are being made for a huge mass-meeting, to be held in about a week. We know from past experiences how well our Slovak people respond to such occasions.</p>
   <p>It is imperative that we formulate plans in regard to our participation at the exposition. Let us, therefore, not forget that on Sunday, Oct. 27th, all Slovak Catholics of Chicago and vicinity are expected to attend this important meeting.</p>
