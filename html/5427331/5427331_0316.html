   <p>Last Sunday there was held a successful picnic sponsored by the directors of the First Slovak Radio Hour.</p>
   <p>The Slovaks proved by their large attendance their appreciation of the service of the Slovak Hour and their desire to further preserve this Slovak Slovak broadcast, which is dedicated exclusively to their interests. Many Slovaks of various religious beliefs and political convictions, attended the affair and in Slovak harmony amused themselves. It is therefore a proof that the First Slovak Radio Hour plays a leading role in the uniting of the Slovak people by reminding them of their Slovak consciousness.</p>
