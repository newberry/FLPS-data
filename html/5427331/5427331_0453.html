   <p>Slovakia, you are a sacred heritage of our forefathers. Who will understand, and through tradition show, your ancient glory? Who will delve into the victorious events and the heroic bloody battles which took place on your soil? Who will bring back the memories of the victorious and heroic battles of our deceased forefathers, so that we may learn from their bitter experience and example how to preserve our love for our country, our religion and homeland, and in case of necessity sacrifice for them our life.</p>
   <p>It is a pity that we know so little about our ancestors. No one wrote about them in the early centuries. It was in the ninth century that the history of the Slovaks began to be recorded. It was in the early part of the ninth century that news of the Slovaks existence became known. The Slovaks lived for their independence, for their faith, and fought heroically for their liberty.</p>
   <p>The information we receive about our ancestors come from foreign sources, from contemporary chronicles, history, legends, biographies, and letters in incompatible fragments.</p>

   <p>At last our famous biographers and historians undertook the task of collecting the true facts and compiled a history of the Slovak people and their ancestors. In reading this book one can visualize the events as they really took place.</p>
   <p>One of the episodes, which took place in ancient times when the seed of Christianity was just being sown among the Slovak people, was written into a drama called "Kysuca." This drama will be presented in Chicago for the first time by the Sokols' Dramatic Club, at St. Michaels parish, March 26, 1933.</p>
   <p>The drama is very interesting and touching. It carries us in spirit to our beloved Slovakia and introduces us to the battlefield on which our ancestors fought for their faith in the year 863. The drama will show us how an eight-year-old boy, with his six-year-old sister and their pious Mother, underwent persecution for their faith. We will see how the Slavonian apostles, Cyril and Methodius, were greeted and welcomed in Slovakia when they came to preach the Word of God.</p>

   <p>This drama will fortify us in our faith. It will elevate and rouse in us a national pride. Also it will kindle in us the fire of love for our Slovak nation, the land of our forefathers.</p>
