   <p>It is customary for us to make New Year's resolutions. Some resolve to quit smoking, others drinking or some other habit which they have formed. However, this is one time when every Slovak, man or woman should resolve to subscribe for Osadne Hlasy, the only Slovak Catholic weekly publication in our community.</p>
   <p>Always look to the sunny side of life. In this world we have two classes of people; one that always looks to the dark side of life, and the other to the bright; one is always downcast, the other on the contrary is like a ray of sunshine, always an inspiration to those around him. In our daily walk of life we are confronted with tasks that look rather difficult and gloomy; we should bear in mind, however, that everything goes well for those who love, and have faith in God. Therefore, no matter how difficult our work may seem, let us look at the bright side of things; our future undertakings will then be much easier.</p>
