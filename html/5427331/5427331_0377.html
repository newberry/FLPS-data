   <p>Slovak Catholic women in Chicago will unite to apply their efforts exclusively to Catholic charitable purposes. Their objective is to establish Slovak Catholic Charitable Organizations to give aid in case of need to Slovaks of their community.</p>
   <p>What a noble thought to be brought to reality! We believe that this idea will materialize because our women are determined to accomplish whatever they set out to do. They are, however, aware of the fact that many obstacles will have to be met with in this undertaking, but they will keep the following proverb, in mind: "Where there is a will, there is a way".</p>
