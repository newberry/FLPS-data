   <p>A very interesting article was recently published in a certain Slovak Lutheran periodical. It was written by a Lutheran minister, Rev. Andrew Rolik, who is known as an "American Razus" because of his public protest against the injustices which are being done to his national rights. Rev. Rolik writes: "Czechoslovakian politics brought the Lutheran Slovaks in America to almost a bankruptcy in the National, cultural, and moral fields. Czechoslovakian grafters have imposed themselves on all valuable property owned by the Slovak people. Our Slovak Lutheran public were robbed not only of thousands of organizations, but also of Slovak national consciousness, national feeling, and national character. With the unfortunate Czechoslovakism, they have hypnotized the Slovak Lutherans so that they nationally, politically, and culturally remain inactive. The Slovak Lutherans have resigned from all activities in national and political enterprises. They are sitting in a corner idly, crying that the Catholics took everything from us.'"</p>

   <p>If we, Slovak Catholics would have written this article, some of our neighbors would probably eat us alive. But since these words were spoken by a person of their own group, we consider them as serious words and we will not add any more to them.</p>
