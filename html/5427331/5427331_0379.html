   <p>Today, the majority of officers are complaining that the meetings of their clubs and societies are so poorly attended. In former days it was otherwise. Individuals did not have the opportunities of enjoying the various entertainments and clubs they have at present. They attended lodge meetings, hoping that perhaps they would meet an old acquaintance of by-gone days.</p>
   <p>In this age, however, the contrary is true; and as the years pass on, the world changes as do the customs of its inhabitants. Club meetings are evaded by members because no subject that would absorb their interest is discussed. The officers should therefore, endeavor to make these meetings sufficiently interesting to attract the individual. Discover ways and means, and you will see results!</p>
