   <p>A great multitude of Slovak Catholics assembled on Decoration Day in the Slovak Catholic Cemetery to pay respect to their dead.</p>
   <p>The cemetery itself looked beautiful and peaceful. One could see the progress that had been made since last Decoration Day. It is the pride of all Slovak Catholics of Chicago. One feels so content there, near one's beloved dead and living relatives, in a clean, undisturbed Catholic-Slovak atmosphere.</p>
