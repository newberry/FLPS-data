   <p>A man drowned himself after being unemployed for more than six months. A men shot 	himself after not being able to find lodging. A married couple were desperate because the man could not obtain a job and she was very sick, so in sheer desperation she poisoned the children and shot herself. This news was taken from the "Slovak Progress" newspaper on August 20th, 1908.</p>
   <p>We have only the Republican Party to blame for these tragedies. The papers having all these suicides listed on one side have a lot of good things to say about the Republicans on the other side of the paper. Is this not then against the Bible's teachings?</p>
