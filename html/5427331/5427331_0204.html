    On February 26th a play was given by the members of "Rovnost" which was attended by a huge throng and was a great success.

   <p>We want to make it clear that the dramas we sponsor are good and beautiful but they belong to the middle ages, not to the present day.</p>
   <p>Dramas are not played because some other people play them, but because they are educational and like a book or speech.</p>
