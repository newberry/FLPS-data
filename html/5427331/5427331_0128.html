   <p>The Slovak-American Citizens' Club "Pokrok" requests all its members in the 21st Ward to attend a joint meeting to be held Tuesday, February 17, at 7 P. M. Every Slovak believing in the right of free speech should present himself on this occasion. The aldermanic election is close at hand, and John J. Lagodny, a scion of the Slavic race, whose name is not a new one to the Slovaks of the 21st Ward, is a candidate. It is our duty to support Mr. Lagodny in his efforts to gain representation for our people in the City Council. Therefore, let us not forget this meeting, which will be held next Tuesday evening, at seven o'clock, in Marie Travnik's Hall, 2701 W. 24th Street, corner of Washtenaw Avenue.</p>
