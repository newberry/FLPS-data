   <p>As is known to most of us, the club Furdek will hold its annual banquet Sunday evening, February 3, at 7 P. M., in the main dining room of the Midwest Athletic Club, Madison Street and Hamlin Avenue. We were informed that the program during the course of the meal will be short but very good.</p>
   <p>After supper there will be a dance with music by the William Dvonc orchestra. Tickets can be obtained from any member of the club Furdek or from the secretary of the Banquet Committee, Miss Claudie Mika, 1529 West 18th Street, phone Canal 8637. There is no admission charge to the banquet and everything will be free.</p>
