    Members of the 1st Slovak Socialist Branch ended the old year with a banquet. The lodge hall was filled to capacity. The first thing on the program was the supper; after that a performance which was very satisfactory and then the red flag was raised. After the ceremonies, Mr. Slavik spoke about the hardships of the workingman, about socialist not being able to let down on account of the presidential elections, to fight for his rights and to show his strength at the polls. After the speaker, a humorist was presented who amused the throng. In conclusion there were fifty calendars distributed among the audience.
