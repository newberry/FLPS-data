   <p>Four of our largest Slovak Organizations; namely: The Catholic Sokol, The Catholic Union, The Catholic Ladies Auxiliary and The Pennsylvania Union, held their yearly meeting last month.</p>
   <p>The chief executives of these organizations gathered to hear the results of their work of the previous year, and to make preparations for the various undertakings for the coming year.</p>
   <p>Previous meetings have been successful, and we hope that, they will be of benefit not only to the aforementioned groups, but also to the Slovaks in general.</p>
