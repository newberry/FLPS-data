   <p>"The History of the Slovak in the United States," a book which was written by a Slovak Catholic priest of the Benedictine Order, will be published some time this year, by the First Catholic Slovak Union.</p>
   <p>Reverend Baska, the author, required four years to collect his material. He traveled across the entire United States, to obtain the essential facts about the Slovaks.</p>
   <p>We were informed, from a dependable source, that, there are many prominent Chicago Slovaks who received honorary mention in Reverend Baska's book.</p>
