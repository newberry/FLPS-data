   <p>The Chicago Sunday Tribune, of last Sunday, published a letter by Henry Hodeka which drew a vivid picture of conditions among people in Czecho-Slovakia. If his description is founded on actuality, then the Slovaks would be living in paradise. He writes that Slovaks are fortunate in having a university which was presented to them by the Bohemians; they have high schools, freedom, the right to vote and are masters of their own land - all on an equal political basis.</p>
   <p>The Tribune is aware, the same as we are, that the statements were false because it recently ended the series conducted by Mr. Sage, who revealed the ture facts about the Slovak race in its native land. What the Slovaks have at present was not given to them by the Bohemians; it is rightfully theirs; even more is due to them but their claims are, as yet, in alien hands.</p>
