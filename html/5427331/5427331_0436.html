   <p>St. Anthony of South Chicago traveled to Harrison High School grounds only to suffer another defeat at the hands of the strong Assumption team. After the smoke of the combat had cleared, Assumption led fifteen to two.</p>
   <p>Nemcek is steadily improving and the battle would not have been so one-sided if he hadn't given so many free bases. Adamcik and Mestan, both of Assumption, clouted the ball for extra bases. The batteries for Assumption were Mikos, pitching, and Mikola and Heretik, sharing the backstop position.St. Anthony used Nemcek, pitcher, and Cerverak behind the plate. St. Stephen, with "Durk" Dura doing the hurling, gave the St. Andrew's boys a merciless lacing at Humboldt park last Sunday. As usual "Durk" was stingy with the hits while his mates with a mixture of singles, doubles and four homers trimmed the St. Andrew's boys. The final score was 18 to 2.</p>
