   <p>We should take advantage of this Lenten period, and give our aid to the preparation of the future Catholic Slovak Day.</p>
   <p>Since dances and stage entertainments will temporarily cease, we will have time to ponder upon the elevation of the Slovak race. It is also essential that we consider the most appropriate methods for the success of clubs, parishes and other institutions. How to give a helping hand to the committee of the future Catholic Slovak Day; and prepare our youth for undertakings and enterprises in our national endeavors.</p>
   <p>When this Lenten period is over, we should be prepared to successfully carry out all those ventures which will serve Catholic Slovaks to greater honor and glory. The field is large, therefore we need a large number of workers to fill these enterprises.</p>
