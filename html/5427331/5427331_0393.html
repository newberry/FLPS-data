   <p>In accordance with an ordinance passed by the City Council, the census of the residents of Chicago began this week. Over twenty-three hundred persons were assigned to this task. The following are a few of the twenty-six questions asked: How many members are there in the family? How many in the building? How many rooms does each family occupy? Do you own your house or are you a renter? Does the rent include heat? Are you a citizen? What is the sex and date of birth of each member of the family? Can you read and write English or any other language? Are you employed at the present? How long have you been working?</p>
   <p>Those who are engaged in this work will be paid out of the funds of the Civil Works Administration. We advise our readers to see that they be listed as Slovaks and nothing else.</p>
