   <p>Last Sunday there was a federation meeting of Slovak Catholic lodges in Chicago and vicinity. About thirty groups were represented; all, however, were members of the Slovak Catholic Union, despite the fact that all other Slovak Catholic organizations were urged to attend. What a pity! What seems to be the reason? Is there dissension in our ranks? Let us not be pessimistic, nothing can be accomplished in this manner.</p>
   <p>Various matters were discussed at this meeting, the most important of which was the coming World's Fair, to be held in Chicago in 1933 and how and in what way the Slovak Catholics can contribute most toward its success. Let us all, Catholics and non-Catholics, get together, set aside our differences and help make the coming World's Fair a success.</p>
