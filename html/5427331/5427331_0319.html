   <p>Last Tuesday, December 15, the Slovaks of Chicago, for the first time in their lives, heard a radio broadcast in their beloved native language. This took place from nine to ten o'clock in the evening over station W H F C.</p>
   <p>The announcer was Vincent Malnik, through whose efforts the Slovak radio hour became a reality. Although this program was not announced, many of our Slovaks picked it up on their sets and enjoyed and appreciated every minute of it. The program was as follows: Talk by the announcer, Vincent Malnik; a polka and "Slovak Wedding," played by the studio orchestra; an address by V. C. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>latek, "When I was small"; "Beautiful Rose, "waltz; "On My Way Home from America," Solo; an address by Mr. M. S. Rehak, Station manager; "<span class="gap">[gap]</span>ukucka," waltz; talk by Dr. Peter P. Hletko; talk by Rev. J. Pelikan; "Stop Squeezing My Hand Young Man," a folk-song; and a closing speech by the announcer, Mr. Vincent Malnik. This is the first Slovak radio hour in Chicago, and we understand it will be followed by three more, can each Tuesday evening from 9 to 10 over station W H F C. We sincerely congratulate Mr. Melnik for making the Slovak hour possible.</p>
