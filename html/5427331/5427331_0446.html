   <p>On April 22, the Slovak Catholic Welfare Society will give an entertainment consisting of bunco, cards, and dancing.</p>
   <p>Every Slovak should try to attend this affair, since its purpose is to relieve human distress. Those who were given tickets to sell should do so. By doing this they will be contributing their bit to this human cause. The committee on arrangements has provided a good orchestra and refreshments, and everyone attending is assured of a pleasant evening.</p>
