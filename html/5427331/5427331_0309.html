   <p>This coming Sunday, we will again be able to listen to a Slovak radio program to be broadcast at 4 P. M. from Station WGES. The vocal selections will be sung by two popular Slovak artists, Fred Kissel, baritone, and Anna Vancura, soprano. The studio orchestra will be under the direction of Mr. Terlikow. The sponsors of this program are the General Credit Stores, 1163 Milwaukee Avenue, and the makers of "Skurolin," a healing salve.</p>
   <p>The program will be announced by and under the direction of Joseph Ondrejkovic, assisted by Mrs. Ondrejkovic. These programs should be heard by all, because their future depends upon the support of our listeners.</p>
