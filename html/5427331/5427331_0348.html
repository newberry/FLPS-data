   <p>Last Sunday Schultz's St. Joseph team trounced St. Anthony's boys with a score of 13 to 5. Ray Kalasa, St. Joseph's hurler, allowed only eight scattered hits, two walks, and struck out nine of Tonies.</p>
   <p>Fiolka and Dilla, of St. Joe, helped considerably with the stick and did some marvelous fielding, handling themselves like old timers. At this game the teams turned in two double plays apiece. St. Anthony tried their rookie hurler, Pasternak, for the first time, and considering the opposition he did some creditable hurling, but lost due to poor support by his teammates. W. Nemcek will probably be out for the remainder of the season on account of a fractured hip, caused by colliding with Kalasa.</p>
   <p>St. Stephen again displayed their superiority on the baseball field by a shutout over St. John's, of Roseland. The final score in eight innings was St. Stephen 11, St. John O. "Durk" did the chucking for St. Stephen, and how he can fool them. During the eight innings he did not permit a hit or a run to mar the day. "Durk"probably would not have been as effective were it not <span class="page-break">\2</span>for the receiving department which was ably handled by Gurican, a smart catcher, always studying the opposing batsmen to determine their weakness. Bojnansky put a home-run ticket on a ball, but Horny of St. John stretched far enough to pull it down for an out. It seems that St. John's are a trifle weak with their pitching staff, that just can't seem to get started. At Harrison High School grounds the St. George's infield was letting the ball go between their legs and hands and consequently remained on the short end after nine innings. Assumption's superior batting and fielding defeated the St. George 10 to 7. "Chuck" Derbas, another rookie hurler, did some fine twirling, but of no avail; he allowed only seven hits in eight innings. "Steve" Mirolak, St. George's centerfielder started the game by knocking the first ball pitched for two bases. He later scored on a hit by A. Vraniak, J. Pes, and "Lefty" Skriba contributed to the misery of St. George by smacking homers over the right field fence. Assumption played fine defensive ball, turning in three double plays. It is evident from what the Jednota fans have seen that Assumption and St. Stephen are real contenders for the pennant. The Jednota games are being well attended but the senior members <span class="page-break">\3</span>and officers of the organization have made themselves scarce and are not attending as they should. Sunday, June 10, is the last day for registering players; after that day no additions will be allowed.</p>
