   <p>We congratulate the new citizens who were able to obtain their citizen papers on January 12, 1933, through the aid of Club Kildare and its president, Mr. Frank Kohut. We are certain that they are proud to be citizens of the United States. It is their duty to feel loyal to their country because it is in this country where they earn their daily bread for themselves and their families. It certainly is an honor to be a citizen of the most progressive and prosperous nation, the United States of America.</p>
