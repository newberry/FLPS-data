   <p>On March 25th Reverend Kvitek and a church collector came to my home for donations. The priest entered my home and acted like a gentleman but the collector acted rather indifferently. Upon entering their first words were "Are You Slovak?" and telling them, "Yes," they told me they came to collect for the Church. I told them that I had no money to throw away and I was one of the members of the poor working army and while talking I handed him the Rovnost Ludu.</p>
   <p>The priest on reading the article was stopped by his associate who said, "Father dont read that Socialist paper; that is not the Equality of People but the Equality of Folly." Answering them I told them that it is the poor workingman's paper for the good of the people. The priest then turned to the door and left with his companion.</p>
