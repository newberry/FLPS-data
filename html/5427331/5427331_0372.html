   <p>The Slovaks have taken under careful consideration a project which will require many sacrifices and self denials. They are planning the erection of a memorial in honor of the unceasing labors of the Slovak nuns.</p>
   <p>They also plan to build a convent for nuns, where they can educate their children in the proper Slovak spirit. What more could be expected of the Slovak Catholics in the way of assistance to nation and their descendants? The aforementioned contribtuions to Slovak youth would be a most appropriate memorial, in commemoration of the untiring efforts of their ancestors.</p>
