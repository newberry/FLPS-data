    We Slovaks, especially those in America are very poor on literature. We have very little of it and the fact is shown where smaller nationalities outshine us in this respect and our comparison to them is zero.
   </p>
   <p>There are about a half million Slovaks in America and quite a few of them are interested in culture but our average in reading them is nothing. We have millions invested in Churches and Parishes but no-one gives one cent towards culture.</p>
  <p>Being weak in literature, our nationality loses its strength in aggressiveness and forwardness. The book "Our Slovaks" which protrays the gardens, cities and forefathers is a very good book to read for every good Slovak.</p>
