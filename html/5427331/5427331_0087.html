   <p>From a recent conversation with one of our countrymen, who belongs to the Czecho-Slovak group, we learned many interesting facts. This individual had visited Czecho-Slovakia during the summer. It gave him the opportunity to study the conditions and political situation of the country. He related his experience to us and did not deny the fact that Slovaks in their country are being treated unjustly by their brothers, the Czechs. He accused the Slovak leaders of being responsible for the deplorable conditions in their native land. He stated that if leaders would unite and take the matter into their own hands, they could send the Czechs into exile within twenty-four hours, and then the Slovaks would become rulers.</p>
   <p>What grieved this informer most was the fact that Bohemians, who are settled in the country and govern Czecho-Slovakia, give more consideration and time to other languages, and very little to the Slovak language. It seems, nevertheless, that the mentioned "Czecho-Slovakian mutuality" is only a fantasy of some individuals and exists only on paper.</p>
