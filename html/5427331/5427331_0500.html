   <p>As previously mentioned in Osadne Hlasy, Branch 150 of the Catholic Sokols of Sacred Heart parish will celebrate on Sunday January 25, the 15-th year of its existence. An evening program, beginning at 7:30 O'clock, will take place in the parish hall, Oakley Avenue and Huron Street. Once again we remind the Slovak public that we worked hard in order to give them the best possible program for this occasion. Speakers of the evening will be Mr. Michael Rehak, chief director of the Catholic Sokols; the Very Reverend Monsignor Victor Blahunka, pastor of the above mentioned parish; and Dr. Peter P. Hletko, chief staff physican of the Catholic Sokols. We wish to add right here that speaking will be only a small part of the program. After the speeches, there will follow violin selections by members of the orchestra and a one-act comedy entitled "The Substituted Wedding." In fact, there will be a variety of entertainment that will be enjoyed by all. Every lodge member belonging to the Sacred Heart parish, along with his fellow-Slovaks, is sincerely invited to attend. We promise he will not regret it.</p>
