   <p>Local politicians are indignant because of the strength shown by Slovak candidates in the recent primaries. At first they underestimated the power of our candidates and laughed at our campaign. However, as the time drew near, the old guards, with an organization behind them, had to dig down into their pockets in order to save themselves. Although our candidates were not elected, yet the fact that they displayed such strength, without any political machine to back them, proves that the Slovaks will have to be reckoned with in the future.</p>
