   <p>Initial steps toward building a home for our benevolent Slovak Nuns, were taken at a recent meeting of the Federation of Slovak Catholic Lodges of Chicago and vicinity. This is a very noble undertaking, and we hope it will be definitely realized. There is no doubt that the Federation has taken upon itself a large responsibility and will encounter many difficulties, but this should not be cause for discouragement in this noble enterprise.</p>
   <p>A meeting, of our local Slovak Catholic pastors, and board members of our various Slovak Catholic fraternal organizations should be called for the purpose of getting their view-point on the steps to be taken for its progress. All we have now is good ideas; let us, therefore, all get together and put these ideas to work; our efforts then, will bear fruit.</p>
