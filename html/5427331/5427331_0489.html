   <p>Last sunday, August 23rd, a huge mass-meeting, regarding the first Slovak Catholic Day, was held in St. Michaels' Parish Auditorium. This was by far the most interesting and enthusiastic Slovak Catholic gathering ever helf in Chicago. The assembly hall is a large one, but on this occasion it was filled to capacity. Present were priests from our various Slovak parishes, representatives from our lodges and their auxiliaries, business and professional men, in fact, citizens from all walks of life, not only from Chicago but from Whiting, Ind., Pullman, and Chicago Heights. Our Pullman Slovaks, with their strong representation and cooperation, proved that previous rumors in regard to their lack of interest in the first Catholic Slovak Day, were false and without foundation. Furthermore, other nondenominational groups voiced their willingness to assist in this celebration, consequently proving that this day will be purely a National Slovak Day and not Czecho-Slovak. Our Slovak Catholic clergy was also <span class="page-break">2</span>well representated and gave us their words of encouragement with the assurance that they would do everything in their power to make Slovak Day a success.</p>
