   <p>Five years ago, the Chicagski Dennik published its last issue. During its existence many false accusations fell on the heads of individuals who have not as yet completely recovered. Five years without a newspaper is a short period but it can prove very monotonous. Many were the painful sighs that came from individuals whose news of current events came only via newspapers written in Slovak.</p>
   <p>Then lo! and behold! like manna from heaven came Tylka Bros. to publish a newspaper covering the activities of all Slovak parishes in the Chicago metroplitan area - Osadne Hlasy.</p>
   <p>We have been deceived by other newspapers many times, yet we welcome this fighter into our ranks and hope that it will not disappoint us.</p>
   <p>We need your assistance. Without you we are helpless. Let each and everyone of you, therefore, lend a helping hand to this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>To the Tylka brothers, the best of luck. May you have an abundance of luck in this enterprise.</p>
