   <p>A school is the most important factor in bringing up children and showing them how to do justice to themselves and their fellow people.</p>
   <p>Schools should be erected where the teachings are not partial to any political parties, also free from any religious studies. Teaching should be such that, the children are taught to use their own knowledge pertaining to matters such as religion and politics.</p>
