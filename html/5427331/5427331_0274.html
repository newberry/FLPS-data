   <p>In previous issues of this publication, Dr. Peter P. Hletko pointed out the lack of interest the American Slovak shows in the literature of his own language. Some read these remarks with some degree of interest, others, however, passed it up with an attitude of indifference.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, the duty of all those who are interested in Slovak literature, to point out to their less thoughtful Slovak brothers the educational value of Dr. Hletko's pen.</p>
