   <p>Dr. Peter P. Hletko underwent an appendectomy last Saturday at the Deaconess Hospital. This is the second time he has been operated on; last year it was for rupture.</p>
   <p>His condition following the operation was very serious, but he is now slowly convalescing, and soon will be able to leave the hospital. We wish Dr. Hletko an early and complete recovery.</p>
