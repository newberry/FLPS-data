   <p>The Slovaks in Chicago may add one more lawyer to their list. He is Mr. Michael S. Rehak who recently passed the examination given by the American Bar Association, at De Paul University. He also passed the test given by the Chicago Lawyer's Association without difficulty and the previous week obtained both, a diploma and a state license permitting him to practice.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rehak was born in Czechoslovakia, and as an infant emigrated with his parents to the United States. He received his elementary education at St. Michaels, later he attended St. Procopious College, at Lisle, Ill; Crane College, and De Paul University.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Mr. Rehak! We wish him success and abundant support from the Slovaks. Until further notice his office will be at his residence, 2122 W. 52nd P1.</p>
