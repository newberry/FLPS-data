   <p>A banquet was held last Sunday in honor of the Reverend Joseph Job, recently appointed Slovak pastor of St. Simon's Parish. The attendance was great and the conduct of those present was of the best.</p>
   <p>Every parishioner was enthusiastic and proffered his ready assistance to the new pastor in his future work. This is a good example for other parishes to follow.</p>
