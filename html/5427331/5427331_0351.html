   <p>What a day of upsets in the Jednota League! The invincible Assumption aggregation, who appeared to be undisputed contenders for the pennant, suffered a setback at the hands of St. Stephen, the Jednota Champs of 1933. The game terminated in the 6th inning, because of permit regulations, with this final score: St. Stephen, 11; Assumption 5. Assumption started their half of the first inning with a triple by "Lefty" Skriba's scoring the runner ahead of him. However, tables turned in the fourth behind the relief pitching of "Durk" Duray, who allowed only three hits in three innings and whiffed six Assumption sluggers. Dancik, St. Stephen's second baseman, made a leap into the air for a ball which started a double play and saved the day for St. Stephens.</p>
   <p>Some spectacular catches by outfielders Mestan and Vasko kept the two thousand spectators on their toes. On the far south side, St. John's were taking St. Andrew's into camp to the tune of twelve to eleven. The day was marked with errors on both teams, which probably was the aftermath of the League dance held Saturday night. T. Balas, of St. John, did some wonderful relief work, <span class="page-break">\2</span>allowing only one hit in four innings, and that a home run by W. Matula. The heavy artillery consisted of Ed. Beno who had four hits out of five times at bat and R. Kapicak with three out of four. Another upset was the defeat of St. Joseph's by St. George's Sokol with a score of six to two. The game only lasted seven innings on account of time. Skanda, of St. George, contributed a home run with two men on in the first inning, thus putting St. George in the lead which they maintained throughout the game. Janec and Malobicky also sent the ball sailing into the far corners of the park with triples. Roth, the first St. Joseph's hurler, did not prove very effective and was replaced by Ray Kalasa, who pitched six innings and only allowed four hits.</p>
   <p>Apparently the season will be filled with some nip and tuck battles and if we should judge from the past performance, the games played by the Jednota boys will be worth seeing.</p>
