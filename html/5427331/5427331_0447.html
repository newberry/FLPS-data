   <p>Last Sunday evening, the Eagles Aerie of St. Simon's parish presented "Rose of Siberia," a four-act musical comedy. The attendance on this occasion was the largest in the history of the parish. Folks came from all sections of Chicago and were well pleased with the production. The dances, both Slovak and Russian, were beautiful. The performers were: Florence Jurecka, Alma Massura, Marie Vraniak, Helen Orth, Johanna Kostalik, Margaret Kolena, Julia Cigan, Myra Page, Maria Pavlusin and Anna Palischuk. Instructress, Mrs. Anna Kolena, who translated the play, deserves to be commended for her fine work. Credit is also due to Mr. Florian V. Tylka, Miss M. Zemko, Mr. J. Ivancik, and Reverend Father Vraniak, for their untiring efforts in making this play a grand success.</p>
