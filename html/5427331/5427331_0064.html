   <p>In these days of social unrest, of vice and immorality, disrespect for the law and the numerous suicides among our students of higher learning, it is high time that parents intervene and point out to our youth the great necessity for Christian education and training. This education should begin in our homes and continue throughout our schools, colleges and universities.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of parents to see that their children attend Catholic schools, colleges, and universities. In this respect we cannot be too careful. Parental obligation requires that their children are given the best possible training, as thereby we create a clean moral character which is the important factor in obtaining success.</p>
