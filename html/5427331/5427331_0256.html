    At the Annual May celebration a large crowd attended the affair being held on 51st and Hoyne Avenue at Kohuts Hall. A few speakers preceded the dance which climaxed the affair. A collection was made for the Rovnost Ludu and a total of $6.91 was collected. A donation of 25Â¢ was given by Joseph Puskas who could not attend the dance, which was the price of his admission ticket.
