   <p>Let us not forget that on Sunday, October 11, we shall have our First Slovak Catholic Day, dedicated to the Slovak people. On this day, all sons and daughters of Slovak mothers will present themselves as loyal citizens of the United States of America, with the sincere desire to pay homage to the nation of which they are a part. At the same time, it will be a day of celebration, enjoyment, encouragement, and better acquaintance. This is the main purpose of our First Slovak Catholic Day, and from it we expect to gain better morals. We also expect to profit financially, and whatever proceeds be gathered will go to the Catholic Welfare Society to be used in taking care of our needy families, widows, and orphans. Who would not support such a purpose? Therefore, let us <span class="page-break">2</span>not forget, and present ourselves at the First Slovak Catholic Day, Sunday, at Pilsen Park.</p>
