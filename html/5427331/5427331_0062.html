   <p>In some homes there seems to be no peace but a continual arguing and cursing by not only the husband but also by the wife who in many cases will go him one better. It would be difficult, in the course of a day to enumerate the different insults one hears. Of what avail are these family spats? What benefits do we derive from them? None! In many cases the children too acquire the habit; some of them are even tots who have not as yet seen the inside of a schoolroom. Many times these quarrels lead to separation and divorce. Lord deliver us from such a state of affairs. It would be far better to say a prayer and set a good example for our offspring; for as the older bird warbles so the young one will chirp.</p>
