   <p>In 1904 the National Slovak School in Chicago was organized. The teachings in this school are to help young Slovak children in their native tongue and give them the knowledge to go out into the world "on their own". Supporting this school was the Jednota Sokol "Slavia", a Slovak Society.</p>
   <p>About this time the funds and donations were diminishing and the papers made a plea for help, but there was little response. One reason was that one of the papers making the request was Socialist and believed that the school taught Socialism. Another reason was that the school did not have any religious teachings, which caused so much strife between the schools.</p>
   <p>A plea was made to the National Slovaks Society, which had a membership of twenty-seven thousand to lend a helping hand, saying that in their by-laws it said to help Slovak expansion. Mr. F. Lamos, in closing his plea said: "We do not want our children to be lost to us, we don't want them to say we did not think about them. We want them to know our ways and it is our duty to preserve the schools we have and build others".</p>
