   <p>As has been previously announced, the Alma-Mater of Slovak Schools, will publish the long awaited and essential Slovak - English Dictionary. It is expected to appear for public distribution about Easter time; and will contain no less than fifty thousand words, and will not exceed seventy thousand. The construction will be simple enough to be practical to both the average minded and the intellectual individual.</p>
   <p>To combine this type of material, the knowledge of both languages, English and Slovak was required. Joseph J. Konus has, for the past seven years, devoted all his time to the compilation of this dictionary. It is now ready for the press. The Slovak public, which needs this work as does a hungry person a piece of bread, is anxiously awaiting the first publication of this work. Her needs will be filled in the near future.</p>
