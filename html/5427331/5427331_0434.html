   <p>The eighth annual convention of the Federation of the Slovak Catholic Student Body was held during the early part of this week in the City of Detorit, Michigan. We regret, however, that we of Chicago, due to lack of organization, were not represented at this gathering. We are hoping, therefore, that our city will be well represented at future meetings. Active organizers are doing all within their power to bring the local student body into one circle. Progress has been somewhat retarded, because of the lack of definite support.</p>
   <p>We have among us men with a good deal of intelligence, which, if properly applied, will instill in our youth more confidence and enthusiasm. To those who are actively trying to promote this unification, we are calling to keep up courage, work hand in hand with fellow members of the Federation, and eventually their efforts shall bear fruit.</p>
