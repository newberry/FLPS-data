   <p>This summer, boys who are members of the Boy Scouts of America will be given the opportunity to go camping for three days, to concessions at Chicago's 1933 World's Fair. Meals and passes will be given free of charge. All boys are invited to join the Scouts. If there is no branch in your parish, join the troop of a neighboring parish.</p>
   <p>Do that however, this month, to permit ample time to meet with the necessary requirements. By joining the Boy Scouts now, you will not only receive the benefit of an outing without charge, but you will help Bishop Sheil fulfill his promise to enlist 8,000 new Catholic Boy Scouts in the city of Chicago, before the end of this year.</p>
   <p>For further information regarding this outing, write to Joseph Strelak, Scoutmaster of troop 283 at Assumption Parish.</p>
