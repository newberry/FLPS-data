   <p>program appeared in the June 13th issue of the Chicago Tribune, which stated that the Slovak Catholic Sokols of Chicago and vicinity will have the largest representation at this meet, with about one hundred delegates of both sexes to be present. The Tribune also gives a brief history of the Slovak Catholic Sokol organization, which was very interesting, mentioning with the highest degree of regard the names of Michael Rehak, Dr. Peter P. Hletko, and Miss Veronika Kalafut, head overseer of this body.</p>
   <p>The program will consist of drilling by the sokols, folk-dances of the various nations represented. The music will be furnished by a on-hundred-piece band.
