   <p>An influential and powerful press is necessary, but the Slovak Catholics also need a strong central organization. The Federation of the Slovak Catholics can become the ideal organization for the Slovak Catholics in America. This organization is in a position to bring about important accomplishments, not only in the religious field, but in the cultural field as well. Until all the Slovak Catholics organize into one strong group, our national achievements will not be recognized and the Czechoslovaks will continue to block our nationalistic undertakings.</p>
