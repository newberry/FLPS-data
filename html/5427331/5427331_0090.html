   <p>The census of the United States is scheduled to commence on or about April the first. It will inform the Nation about its increase or the diminuition of our population.</p>
   <p>This will be of particular significance to us, the Slovaks, because it gives an opportunity to display our numerical strength to our American neighbors, as well as the entire world. Thereby our influence in politics and our general participation in public life becomes apparent to others; we are judged accordingly. But it depends entirely upon us, on our accuracy to register as Slovaks and not Slavish or Slovish.</p>
   <p>Some even assert that they are Czecho-Slovaks. This is not true; there is no such nationality. A Slovak mother gave you birth, therefore Slovak is your mother tongue.</p>
