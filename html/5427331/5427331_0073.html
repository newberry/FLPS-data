   <p>Last Sunday we attended the consecration of the shrine at the home of our Franciscan Fathers. The weather was very disagreeable, raining all day. However, this did not stop our faithful people from paying their respects to our Sorrowful Mother and honoring our Slovak Franciscan Fathers, through whose efforts this grotto became a reality. Had the day been more pleasant, we can well imagine the vast throng that would have been present.</p>
   <p>Now that summer is near at hand, large masses of our people will make this pilgrimage. It is our duty to do this, instead of supporting some foreign undertaking.</p>
