   <p>Some time ago we mentioned that there were but a very few Slovaks in Chicago Heights. However, on the Sunday of the dedication of the Slovak Catholic Church, we learned the truth; many Slovaks live there. This was proved by the Mayor of the City, who spoke in person, and in terms that displayed a high regard and love for the Slovak people.</p>
   <p>They also hold him in him in high esteem. Therefore, if but a small number were expected to attend, his honor, the Mayor, would have been represented by proxy, which is customary on such occasions.</p>
