   <p>Individuals who are on relief are asked to read the bulletins posted at relief stations, by the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission.</p>
   <p>The latest bulletin reads as follows: "Those on relief may choose their own grocer and butcher."</p>
   <p>The district council forbids its employees to recommend names of grocers or butchers to the relief clients.</p>
   <p>Those receiving relief orders, therefore, cannot complain that they are compelled to take food from dealers they dislike. The Slovaks on relief should patronize their own Slovak dealers where they will be served in a most courteous manner.</p>
