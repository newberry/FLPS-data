   <p>Two books, that are very significant to us Slovaks, were issued this month, they are: "Sketches from Slovak History" published by the First Catholic Slovak Union, and the "Slovak Dictionary" edited by the alma mater of Slovak Schools. We are not certain whether they have, as yet, been placed on the market. We do know, however, that there is a great demand for them.</p>
