    On June 8th, 1912, the first edition of the Chicago Slovak Daily was issued by Editor H. Thiele who does not know Slovak very well himself.
   </p>
   <p>His assistant is Emil Mally who is a Chicago-born Slovak and also does not know the Slovak tongue well.</p>
   <p>The Slovak language used is so poor that the paper is not fit to be called a daily but a nightly at which time a paper like that should be read. Upon reading the first issue there were numerous mistakes in the paper from page one to page five.</p>
