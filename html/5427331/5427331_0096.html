   <p>The slogan, "Patronize the stores of your countrymen," is well known to us. However, we do not act accordingly. There are many reasons why we should patronize the stores of our own Slovak people. Give preference to them, and not to strangers, who will not come to your aid in time of need. These people may be your enemies. We can look at this matter from several different angles, but there should never be any doubt as to the decision to patronize the business establishments of our own people.</p>
   <p>Some of our people have their stores in other neighborhoods, or in the vicinity of various parishes. They are not only there to sell their products, but also to help us in other matters. As a rule, they serve us conscientiously. Their prices are the same as in other stores. But that is not all. They do things for us about which we are misinformed. Our patronage helps their business to grow and consequently our ideals become a reality.</p>
   
   <p>Our Slovak businessmen give liberal contributions to all our undertakings. We always turn to our business people to help us share the expenses. The proverb: "He who has, must give; while he who does not have, cannot give," explains the necessity of supporting our own people. If we expect help from them, we must help them also. This can only be accomplished by supporting and patronizing our own Slovak people.</p>
