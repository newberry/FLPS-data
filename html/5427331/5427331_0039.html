   <p>The first incentive of the Slovaks in America is building churches. What would the churches do if we had no schools? Nothing. We would just have to remain dumb, so the right thing to do is build schools.</p>
   <p>A person can live without going to Church but cannot exist without schooling. Nowadays without schools, we would be continually in the background in culture, politics, etc.</p>
   <p>We would put a burden on our selves and on our children for the future.</p>
