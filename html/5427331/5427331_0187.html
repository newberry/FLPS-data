   <p>Members of the Aerie of Eagles, presented a stage performance, last Sunday, at St. Simon's parish. The successful comedy "Boarders," which was given, portrayed the life of the American Slovaks. The play was written about the custom of the Slovaks twenty-five years ago, when they were first coming to the United States in great numbers, and establishing boarding-houses.</p>
   <p>The plot was humorous, and kept the audience amused throughout.</p>
