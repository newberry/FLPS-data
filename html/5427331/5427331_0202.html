   <p>The Slovak-American Sokol (gymnastic society) again gave a good account of its histrionic ability in a performance of the drama, "Matus Trencansky," drawn from Slovak history, in Walsh's Hall, Noble and Emma Streets last night. The proceeds go to the fund for the liberation of Slovakia. The attendance was much larger than the one of the first performance, in the hall of Sokol Chicago, in a more Czech than Slovak neighborhood. [Translator's Note - This report shows friendly relationship between Czechs and Slovaks during the World War.</p>
