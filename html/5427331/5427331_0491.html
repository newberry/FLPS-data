   <p>Delegates from Chicago and other centers of the Middle West are going to the convention of the first Slovak Catholic Union with certain grievances and demands, which can only be met through cooperation. For instance, up to the present time the Middle West has had very little representation on the executive board. However, we cannot reproach anyone for this but ourselves, our lack of interest being the main reason. Chicago and the Middle West are sending good, capable delegates, who are able to give a good account of themselves.</p>
