   <p>Andreno Sotak, who has already published an announcement to his Slovak brethren, sends them another personal message which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Slovak Brethren: Recently we read in the newspapers that our people in Europe have informed the League of Nations that they do not wish to be under Czech rule. The sun is beginning to shine under Upper Hungary, and it is our duty to transmit the news to you.</p>
   <p>"Enough of the terrible hardships which our brethren have suffered since their separation from the Magyars! Let us persevere and unite with the Magyars as we have been united with them for a thousand years. We belong not to the Czechs but to the Magyars. Magyar and Slovak songs were sung over our cradles. Let us unite to promote our ideals and fight for justice for Hungary, for the day is at hand [when justice will be restored].</p>
