   <p>The school children of Holy Rosary Parish will stage a play in the parish hall, 115 W. 108 Street, on Sunday, December 20. Both the parents and all parishioners and Slovaks of this vicinity should attend.</p>
   <p>Not only will they see a Yuletide performance, but they will also be provided with other pleasant entertainment which the children have been rehearsing for some time. Therefore, let us all attend this affair. By so doing we will enjoy ourselves, and at the same time, bring great happiness to our children and their teachers, the nuns who are always patient in their work.</p>
