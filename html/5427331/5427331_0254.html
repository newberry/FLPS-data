   <p>In these summer months, among our larger Slovak communities, preparation are being made to hold a big Slovak Day for the benefit of our Alma Mater, Slovak Schools. Part of the proceeds will go to widows, orphans, and other good causes. Slovak-Catholic, Lutheran, and National Lodges are all working hand in hand, and their efforts are being crowned with success. Here, in our own Chicago, however, it is a different story. The, "Let George Do It," attitude, still seems to prevail; sincere leadership and harmony are lacking, and we have, instead, disorder and jealously. Our so called leadership is divided, each one pulling in a different direction. Then too, we have that type of Slovak who is shy of anything and everything that is Slovak; for instance: his church, school, lodge, books, and publications. If he does join a Slovak organization it is not through love and principle. Oh no! It is for the purpose of furthering his own selfish interests. "Brothers and sisters: This will never do!" We must co-operate, work in harmony, join our local churches, prevail upon our fellow countrymen and prove to them the necessity of doing this; in this way we will rise to the same level of other progressive communities.</p>
