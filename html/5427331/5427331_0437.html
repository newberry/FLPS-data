   <p>Day by day there is more urgent need for cooperation among our Slovak catholics in Chicago and vicinity. There are many things left undone, and all this is due to lack of cooperation. It is a very difficult matter to have cooperation among all Chicago Slovaks when the Slovak catholics themselves cannot agree. Instead of working together, each one seems to be seeking individual honors; consequently, no one is getting anywhere. Therefore, let us get together and work in harmony; then possibly we may be able to accomplish something.</p>
