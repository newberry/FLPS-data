   <p>A big mass-meeting of all Slovaks in Chicago and vicinity will be held next Sunday in Dvorak Park.</p>
   <p>Besides the publicity given this affair by our local newspapers, invitations have been already mailed to our lodges. All Slovaks, men and women, should co-operate with, and interest themselves in this meeting in which there will be discussed our participation in the coming World's Fair, to be held in Chicago in 1933. Representatives from our different organizations should get together and discuss plans for a definite program concerning the tremendous problem of a world's exposition. Differences should be set aside, and a spirit of cooperation instituted in their stead. Therefore, let us not forget this important meeting next Sunday in Dvorak Park.</p>
