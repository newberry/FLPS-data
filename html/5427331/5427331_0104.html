    Our Slovak Socialist Local No. 2 "Rovnost" of Chicago is taking it into their hands to keep up the tradition of this organization to present always different forms of entertainment such as, dramas, picnics, dances and good speakers. So on this Sunday September 17th, at Dufka's Gardens which are located on 21st and California Avenue, a new form of entertainment will start.</p>
   <p>The grove will be fixed like a real vineyard with grapes all around. The patron may take all he wants providing the guard does not see him.</p>
