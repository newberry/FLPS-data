   <p>America's uncrowned king, J. P. Morgan, stated he will help the capitalists to crush the unions and he is right. A worker, who has a family and is unemployed for sometime, watching his starving family every day makes him desperate and he takes a scab job, thereby helping to break the unions.</p>
   <p>The capitalistic system is alright for the capitalist themselves, but for us workers it is endless starvation.</p>
