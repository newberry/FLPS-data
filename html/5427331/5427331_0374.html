   <p>In the last edition of the Tatrana, a small publication issued by the Tatrian Slovak Union, the following statement, which was drafted at the annual meeting, was published:</p>
   <p>After a brief debate, the majority accepted the suggestion of Branch Six and elected Dr. Rurik, as the chief physician for this year. (The executive officers did not vote in this election.)</p>
   <p>The organization's by-laws provide: The chief physician of the organization is to be elected by the executive officers.</p>
   <p>Who, then, is the chief physician of this organization? Dr. Peter Hletko was the duly elected physician, chosen by the officers for an indefinite term.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>According to the by-laws, he is still the chief physician since the executive officers did not vote on the selection of Dr. Rolik.</p>
   <p>The public demands a satisfactory answer from the organization. What will it be?</p>
