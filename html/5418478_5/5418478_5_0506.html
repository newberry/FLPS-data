   <p>The dance arranged by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), which took place on November 1, was unexpectedly successful, financially. The net proceeds to date amount to $1,815. Many tickets are not yet paid for, and it is urgent in the interest of the welfare work which the Association has taken upon itself that the tickets be paid for promptly by anyone still owing for them so that the Association can announce the names of the contributors, and render a complete report to the public of the success and profit of this successful affair.</p>
