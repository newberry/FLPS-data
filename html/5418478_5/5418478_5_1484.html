   <p>The Damsky Pomocny Odbor Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires) of Chicago held a festival on Thursday, December 26, for the benefit of the children of our Czechoslovak heroes. The festival was held in the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall. Gifts were also distributed among the widows and invalids. The gift committee held a meeting prior to this festival in order that Christmas baskets might be filled with staples, and many families were agreeably surprised when they received them. To cite a typical case, there was a widow of a brother legionnaire, alone in the world with four small children, who was given a warm winter dress and a heavy overcoat; her little daughter received a warm topcoat and a cap; her small boy was given good shoes, a sled, and several other toys, to say nothing of the Christmas basket itself, which was full of household necessities. To this the Ladies' Auxiliary added a gift of ten dollars in cash and the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago gave another ten dollars.</p>
   <p>Another typical case is that of a Czechoslovak legionnaire afflicted with an <span class="page-break">\2</span>incurable disease caused by poison gas in the trenches. This man is not employable. He is the father of a charming child. The Odbor Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires) presented him with a gift of twenty-five dollars in cash. Besides that we sent him a large Christmas basket and ten dollars in cash.</p>
   <p>Another sad case is that of a legionnaire who fought in Russia. His wife suffers from an incurable eye disease. What a terrible fate awaits her neither her husband nor her little daughter knows.....we, the Czechoslovak women, will endeavor to lessen their grief as best we can; we shall stand back of them by paying the doctor bills and by contributing to their domestic needs. We also delivered a large basket and ten dollars in cash to the above-mentioned family.To another Czechoslovak legionnaire, the Svaz Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru, (Federation of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires) gave twenty-five dollars, and our Ladies' Auxiliary added twenty dollars to this sum. This is surely a handsome gift, considering the present bad times. To other similarly unfortunate people, the Svaz Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru also gave aid. Every Czechoslovak <span class="page-break">\3</span>legionnaire [depending on the seriousness of his situation] received from five to twenty-five dollars. How glad we would have been to add several figures to these various amounts, but the state of our treasury makes it impossible. Perhaps these facts will furnish food for thought; perhaps we shall find gentle souls who will swell our ranks and make it possible for us to increase our activities.</p>
   <p>May the next year find us well prepared to triple our efforts.....To describe the joy which our gifts brought; to speak of the rays of sunshine which penetrated the woeful homes of these unfortunates; to record the happiness mirrored in the faces of the young when they got their share of the Christmas baskets: All this would be impossible here.....</p>
   <p>The festival was indeed a success, and we are grateful to the board of directors of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs for letting us use the hall without charge. We are also indebted to the Denni Hlasatel and the Svornost for their kind cooperation. We take this opportunity to thank all those who took part in the festival and by their efforts contributed to its success.....</p>
