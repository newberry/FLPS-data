   <p>A regular meeting of the board of directors of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) was held in the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) last night.....</p>
   <p>Dr. Pecival, reporting on the Bohemian Day in Riverview Park, said that the plan to distribute the admission tickets to children who would sell them to their friends has not brought the expected results. Therefore, the committee will try to secure the co-operation of a number of ladies who would be willing to sell the tickets on street corners in those parts of the city which are most heavily settled by Bohemians. The day set aside for this scheme will be Saturday, July 16.</p>
   <p>To this, Mr. John A. Cervenka added that the poor success of the advance sale of the tickets is due to the fact that the North American Baseball Union is having its outing in Riverview Park on the same day as the Bohemians, and the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Union is distributing tickets free of charge.....</p>
