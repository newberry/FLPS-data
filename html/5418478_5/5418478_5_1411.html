   <p>At a surprise party given in honor of Mrs. Anna Sterba and Mrs. Marie Krenek in the dining hall of Mr. Rendek, Turner Avenue and 27th Street, our charitable institutions were remembered by a collection which netted $13.20. Of this sum $6.60 shall go to the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and $6.60 to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa v Lisle, Illinois (Saint Joseph's Orphanage, at Lisle, Illinois). The entire amount was deposited in the branch office of the Denni Hlasatel in the Vojta Naprstek School through the kindness of Mr. D. Pesice.</p>
