   <p>It has become customary for our public and charitable institutions to render an account of their activities once a year, and at this time the general public is given free access to all its parts. One of the most attractive of such inspections was held yesterday at the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). In connection with the inspection, an exhibition of the handicraft of the inmates of the orphanage was arranged.</p>
   <p>The inspection of the orphanage is always attended by a large number of visitors, and so was it yesterday.....</p>
   <p>The program of the afternoon started with an address of welcome delivered by President V. Suchy.....There were....a number of musical selections.....which pleased the visitors.</p>

   <p>We saw many good ladies, particularly those who bear in mind their grown-up daughters' hope chests, purchasing an embroidery here, an ornamental pillow-case there, a lamp shade, etc.--all this the work of the tiny hands of the inmates of our first charitable institution.....</p>
   <p>There was a room full of handwork made by the boys which, of course, was clumsier and more man-like, but many pieces showed promise....or practical sense.....</p>
