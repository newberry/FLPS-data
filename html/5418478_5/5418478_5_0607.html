   <p>Taking as example the Bohemian-Slovak Mutual Aid Fraternity, there has originated in Chicago a "Ladies' Beneficiary Organization Mutual Aid Sorority". During its short existence the results obtained have proved the necessity and benefits of this organization. At yesterday's meeting many new zealous lady members joined the society. This new unit is known under the name of "Ctilada" and is the 13th in the organized sororities. At present, there are 39 members.</p>
