   <p>Lodges, societies, and members of unities, which contributed at their conventions to the Home and Orphanage, must not presume, that they have thereby been excused from their duty to contribute to this noble enterprise themselves, but should work for its successful accomplishment. We are convinced that the conventions in making these appropriations for this most important undertaking desired only to set a good example to their subordinate bodies and to all members belonging to them, to awaken them to self-sacrificing, energetic work. That the conventions did not forget the Home and Orphanage is eloquent proof in itself that they recognize their great importance and that the earliest possible realization of this is to their advantage.</p>
   <p>If all lodges and all individuals will now do their duty, they will only be proceeding in accordance to the intentions of their conventions.</p>
