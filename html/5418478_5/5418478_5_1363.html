   <p>Contributions and gifts which reached the office of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) between April 31, 1922 and May 15, 1922 are hereby acknowledged [The names of contributors and the amounts contributed are omitted in translation. The list is four-fifths of a column long, and the total is $261.11.] Besides the above gifts of money, a number of individuals sent to us articles of clothing, candies, sundry supplies, flour, and bakery goods. Dr. Liska gave his medical services freely. The White Cab Company, which is a Bohemian enterprise, furnished free transportation for fourteen of our children. The South Side Butchers' Union donated meats and bakery goods which were left over from one of their entertainments. There was enough meat to provide tasty dinners for all of the inmates for two days. We also received gifts of several musical instruments. Lodge No. 71 of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union) made us a gift of linen and materials for embroidering.</p>
