   <p>Not infrequently we hear contentions from people who are unfriendly toward benevolent societies that the idea of brotherhood is mere printed matter and becomes empty the moment members are called upon to contribute. However, here are two cases which prove that the situation is different. They occurred in Czech-American communities and illustrate how the Cesko-Americka Jednota (Czech-American Union) and its members interpret the concept of brotherhood. It is true enough that every brotherhood has to keep its business in good order, and every member must pay his dues regularly if he or she expects to share in the benefits. This is equally true in the case of large capitalistic insurance companies. The latter, in fact, are even much stricter in the enforcement of dues than any of our brotherhoods.</p>
   <p>An important difference between a brotherhood and an insurance company lies in the fact that the latter, when called on, will perform no more than its stipulated duty, while the former will do more. This is conspicuously proved <span class="page-break">2</span>in these two examples. One was related to us by the Cleveland, Ohio, branch of the Czech-American Union.</p>
   <p>Brother M. Mixan, driven to despair by an incurable ailment, committed suicide. He was a member of the lodge Cech, No. 7, of the Czech-American Union. The brotherhood not only paid the benefit to the widow with three children, but also arranged a collection among other lodges of the Union. When, a few days ago, the lodge heard that the widow was again in distress, another collection was made for her.</p>
   <p>The second example is given in the case of Henry Kopriva, 1167 West 18th Street, Chicago, a member of the lodge Plzen (Pilsen), No. 1, of the Czech-American Union. Stricken with paralysis, he had to be nursed by his wife, a mother of three children, and she herself was not in good health. The lodge paid him his benefit and gave him support in more ways than one. The man has been a member for approximately two years. Brother lodges then collected twelve dollars for him. The officers of his lodge procured further support <span class="page-break">3</span>from the Cook County authorities, and also from the Bohemian Charitable Association, so that the unfortunate brother's family was at least spared extreme misery.</p>
   <p>These are certainly remarkable instances which reflect true sentiment and effective help on the part of our brotherhoods. Capitalistic insurance companies cannot match them.</p>
