   <p>The meeting was opened at the usual time by President Suchy. Since Mrs. Bozena Krabec, secretary of the board, was absent, the minutes were read by Mrs. Ruzena Lorenc. Before the delegates had a chance to approve or disapprove the minutes, Mr. Lehmann arose and announced that Mr. Fiser, the former business manager of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was present at this meeting, and that he desired to answer to the accusations made against him during the two previous meetings of the board. Mr. Zrust recommended that the board continue in its proceedings and defer Mr. Fiser's case till the end of the meeting....The minutes were approved as read. Mrs. Bozena Krabec's letter of resignation was read. In it [the secretary] announced that she was obliged to resign because of lack of time at her disposal, but that she would always co-operate with the board, attend its meetings, and take part in the tag day activities of the Utulna....On a motion made by Mr. L. Pinc, it was recommended that Mrs. Krabec's resignation be not accepted, and <span class="page-break">2</span>that a committee be appointed which would investigate the reasons for her resignation. Since this motion was carried by fourteen votes, the president appointed a committee whose duty it will be to call on Mrs. Krabec and ascertain the causes of and the reasons for her resignation. The president appointed Mesdames Vrchotka and Podolak and Mr. Lehman to serve on the committee. These three are to report on this matter at the next meeting of the board.</p>
   <p>Radbuza Lodge No. 11 of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union) requested that the children of Antonin Janda, 2014 South Throop Street, be admitted to the Orphanage. The children are Anna, age 10 years, and Edward, age 7 years, and, according to the statement made by the Jednota, the father of these children would be willing to pay the necessary fees for their upkeep. The mother of these children has been committed to the state hospital for the insane at Dunning, Illinois, and their father is unable to give them sufficient care. At present they are living with their grandmother. Since recommendations were made that immediate action be taken in this case, the president <span class="page-break">3</span>pointed out that children are admitted to the Orphanage, depending on the merits in each case, as speedily as possible. It was decided that the investigating committee should handle the case and make recommendations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rudolf Rubringer informed the board by letter that he will be unable to give music lessons to the children of the Orphanage because he does not have time for this activity. The present business manager of the Utulna sent a letter of resignation to the board. Mr. Anthony Smith [the business manager] claimed in this letter that the institution lacks sufficient help, that its morale is thereby affected, and lastly, that the salary he receives is too low. He would, therefore, like to be absolved of his present duties as manager by October 1, 1922. Because matters of this kind belong rightfully to the board of directors, the letter and the subject it dealt with were referred to that board. The debate which followed this subject was interrupted by the president who declared that the board of directors would handle it.</p>
   <p>All bills for the first half of 1922 were approved as presented. Mr. Trnka, <span class="page-break">4</span>secretary of the board of directors, who previously handed in his resignation, was asked to reconsider this matter and not resign. The president was sorry to announce in this meeting that Mr. Trnka has not reconsidered.</p>
   <p>Rules relating to the reserve fund, which were discussed in a previous meeting, were read by the secretary and approved by a two-third's majority. According to the report made by the public accountant, the receipts of the Utulna for the first half of 1922 were $21,240.11. There was $14,650.13 in the treasury; the total, therefore, was $35,890.24. The disbursements for the same period amounted to $30,633.57. The total property of the Utulna A Sirotcinec was valued at $187,748.47. A bindery bill of $85, payable to Mr. Soukup....was approved.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Zeman requested that Edward, age 11 years, be admitted to the Orphanage. His mother is willing to pay for his upkeep. This case was settled favorably. Mrs. Marie Chmelir, age 73 years and residing at 2829 South <span class="page-break">5</span>Spaulding Avenue, desired to be admitted to the Old People's Home. This case was referred to the investigating committee. The application of Mrs. Barbora Balej is to be investigated by the proper committee which is to report [at the next meeting].</p>
   <p>Mr. F. J. Petru, reporting for the entertainment committee, announced that all preparations and arrangements for a concert to be given on November 1, 1922, are in full swing. The musicians' union is to be invited to take part in this concert by furnishing an orchestra. The concert is to be given in the Pilsen Park pavilion. At its last [sixth] convention, the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) made a contribution of $70 to the Utulna as follows: $50 to the institution, $10 to its music fund, and $10 in honor of two deceased sisters--A. Vodak and Belan--in lieu of flower offerings.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petru recommended that when hiring the next business manager for the Utulna, attention should be paid to the qualifications of his wife who would act as co-manager. It would be desirable that she be possessed of a knowledge <span class="page-break">6</span>of Bohemian as well as of English, that she have some knowledge of bookkeeping--these qualifications enabling her to have dealings with American people as well as Bohemians. She would also be able to send receipts to contributors in either language. Mrs. Marek moved that each society or other organization delegate one member, preferably a businessman; the delegates thus assembled could form a committee which, in co-operation with the board of directors, would do away with all of the deficiencies arising in the institution because of insufficient personnel. The children often look unkempt; at least they are not as neat as they should be; the old apparel donated to the institution is not repaired, and one cannot expect the old folks that have come to the Utulna to find rest and surcease from daily activities, to run the institution. The committee, as suggested, would endeavor to put things in order and remove all shortcomings. The motion made by Mrs. Marek was favorably received and supported, although it caused quite a debate among the delegates which lasted for some time until quieted down by the diplomacy of the president. Mr. Suchy [the president] pointed out the unselfish attitudes and activities of the <span class="page-break">7</span>members of the board of directors who always worked without monetary compensation, and never expected any pay, and who are now willing to continue that work as unselfishly as before. Some delegates, [said the president], think that the proposed [new] "advisory board" could not be better qualified and perform better work than the present board of directors which is composed of competent individuals. The Utulna [that is, its board of directors] knows what is amiss; the board knows full well its shortcomings; it is fully aware of the fact that its personnel is insufficient, but the [present] financial status of the institution does not permit the hiring of additional employees to supply such a lack, and merely to elect or appoint a new advisory board would not help matters, but an unselfish and tireless endeavor on the part of the members of the board of directors will.</p>
   <p>[As previously indicated in this report], Mr. Fiser, the former business manager of the institution, attended this meeting to answer to the accusations aimed at him, or rather, to clear up whatever misunderstandings <span class="page-break">8</span>might have existed in the minds of the delegates concerning his managing of the institution. Mr. Fiser asked that he be given full credit for the hardships and troubles he had experienced in running the institution, and that it is an obvious injustice to prefer any charges against him. He asked that he be given a vote of confidence. Mr. Suchy, in answering this request, stated that he never made any accusations as to Mr. Fiser's honesty; in fact, that he could never accuse him of dishonesty. He merely had in mind the welfare of the institution when the rather steep bill [for certain hardware supplies] was presented for payment. He never accused and never could accuse anybody of dishonesty, and under less trying conditions and with a greater calmness this or other unpleasantnesses could have been avoided.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned after 11 P. M.</p>
