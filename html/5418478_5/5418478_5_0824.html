   <p>The trustees of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) announced that a beautiful and valuable gift was received which will be especially welcomed by the orphans. It is a piano given to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec by Mrs. Raymond Kolar, 2823 South Millard Avenue, and it is needless to say that such a beautiful gift was received gratefully.</p>
