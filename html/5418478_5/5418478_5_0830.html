   <p>Last night the Orphanage and Old People's Home Society held a meeting at which Mr. V. Suchy presided. The club of the Czechoslovak veterans announced that it had elected Mr. Thomas Hejn as its delegate to the meeting of the Orphanage Society.</p>
   <p>A letter signed by fathers of wards was read. It took issue with a resolution passed at a recent meeting which limited visiting days to one day per month. There was a demand for more visiting days for parents and relatives of children in the institution. The letter was referred to the managing committee. Mr. Joseph Dusek, manager of the Orphanage, declared that the restriction did not apply to the children's relatives and that the house was open to relatives daily from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
