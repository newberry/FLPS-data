   <p>The executive committee of the Home and Orphanage met yesterday afternoon after a long recess. It was the first meeting since February 10.</p>
   <p>Of course we gladly forgive the committee for this long period of rest because by yesterday's meeting it proved to us, that although it has long been inactive, it is now taking up with renewed vigor the large amount of work which has accumulated during that time. The executive committee has done much for this national undertaking of ours in the short time of its existence; in fact it has pushed everything so far forward that what seemed to be in the immeasurable future is rapidly approaching accomplishment, and there is no doubt that if the committee continues to work as it has heretofore done, the building of the Home is only a question of a short time. Of course everything depends upon the liberality of our people, but the committee can go ahead with full confidence on that score, because this liberality has already been proved so often that there is no doubt that it will again be manifested. To judge by the course of yesterday's meeting, we can expect that work will now be energetically begun, and that agitation in behalf of the undertaking will be extended among all classes of our people.</p>
   <p>On the premises of the Bohemian-American Free Thought School on 18th Street a number of ladies and gentlemen, members of the committee, assembled yesterday and deliberated all afternoon on the most fitting manner in which to initiate the new enterprise. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Charvat. Jan Viska acted as secretary. It was resolved to accept the proposal of Judge [A. J.] Sabath that a bazaar be arranged for, to be held either in February or in March, to surpass by its originality all those that have thus far been organized. All Bohemian societies will be invited to participate. An entertainment committee of seven was elected, whose duty it will be to arrange all the entertainments given for the benefit of the Home.</p>
   
   <p>The members of the executive committee came to the decision yesterday that it would be well to follow the advice given to it last year by Mr. [Charles J.] Vopicka, and therefore a committee was elected to visit Mr. Vopicka and invite him to do what he promised, that is, to arrange for the organization of a club which will promote the undertaking among the general public. It was also decided that one of the lots donated by Mr. F. Zajicek some time ago be placed on raffle. For this purpose two thousand lottery tickets will be sold at twenty-five cents each. There is no doubt that the tickets will readily be disposed of, for not only is the opportunity to win a valuable building lot offered, but by paying that twenty-five cents every purchaser of a ticket will have the knowledge that he has contributed his mite to a philanthropic undertaking. After giving expression to many very well considered reflections and opinions, the meeting adjourned. We hope that we shall soon hear the best possible reports about the activities of the executive committee.</p>
