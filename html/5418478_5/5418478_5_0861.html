   <p>For many years our Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) has felt that its present premises are inadequate.....</p>
   <p>The idea of building an addition or a new section to the part of the institution devoted to the care of orphans had to be dismissed as long as the necessary funds were not available. But Mr. V. Suchy, chairman of the board of representatives of the institution, seems to have found a way of building without a great expenditure of money. He pointed out in yesterday's meeting that there are many Bohemian building trade unions which could help by donating a certain amount of the services of their members free of charge to the organization.....</p>
   <p>On this basis, the board reconsidered plans that had been laid aside sometime ago. These call for a new, modern, fireproof building that would house 160 orphans and four nurses. It would face Crawford Avenue....and have enough space for the necessary offices, the director's quarters, kitchen, dining hall, boiler room, coal storage, etc.....</p>
   <p>The estimated cost of $50,00 would be greatly reduced by donations of building material and work of members of our trade unions.....</p>
   <p>After a long and lively debate, in which....the question was discussed in minute detail, the members carried the motion to erect the new building by fifty-four votes against two, one representative not voting.</p>
   <p>The board agreed to contact various contractors about the matter of bids.....</p>
   <p>The chairman stated that the organization now has about $23,000 loaned out. This money would be used for the building, and the balance would be secured by donations of money, material, and services of friends of the institution.</p>
   <p>After this explanation, the meeting adjourned. It is now up to the building committee to continue with preparations in which it has the best wishes for success of all friends of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec.</p>
