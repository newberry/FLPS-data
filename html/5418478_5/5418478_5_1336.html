   <p>The Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor Lyra (Lyra Bohemian Workingmen Singing Society) has on many occasions touched the hearts of our countrymen by its willingness and readiness to co-operate whenever some good national or charitable cause was involved. It always assembled in full strength and sang with love and enthusiasm, only to prove that a group of singers, and above all, a group of kind and self-sacrificing people, can be happy when it is given an opportunity in some definite way to help where help is needed. The Lyra is a society of humble men who make no demands for a recognition. But it works, and a proof that it works is to be given on Friday night when the organization will again step before our public to show that it is fully aware of its mission in life. It will sponsor a concert which it has arranged itself for the benefit of the musical fund of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage).</p>
   
   <p>The Sirotcinec, as is now well known, has an orchestra of its own which has been successfully organized and managed by our well-known national and charitable worker, Mr. R. Rubringer. The orchestra is in need of instruments, sheet music, and other indispensable paraphernalia, and all that requires more funds....The Sirotcinec itself has no money for this purpose, and the concert has been arranged to raise the necessary funds.</p>
   <p>The concert, for which the Lyra and the orchestra of the Sirotcinec are now diligently rehearsing, will be held on Friday at 8 P. M., in the Carter H. Harrison High School, Marshall Boulevard and West 24th Street. The aforementioned singing society will perform the lion's share of that evening's program, which will be directed by the choir leader, Mr. Josef Kindl. Our well-known soprano, Mrs. Louisa Topinka, will also appear. Others, who will take part on the program are the violin virtuoso, Mr. Jiri Hrusa, and the very talented pianist, Miss Emilie Moser. As already stated, the orchestra of the Sirotcinec will play under the direction of Mr. R. Rubringer.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if the assembly hall of the Harrison School were filled with our people. The concert, which has been arranged with so much sacrifice and good will, should benefit the Sirotcinec greatly. Anyone who appreciates good music, may obtain tickets as advertised by the Denni Hlasatel.....</p>
