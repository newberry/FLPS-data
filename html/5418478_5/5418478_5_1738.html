   <p>Today and tomorrow is the tag day for the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) in Chicago. The Chicago city council issued a special permit for this purpose. Our generous Bohemian ladies will go to the streets of our Bohemian metropolis with collection boxes and will ask everybody to contribute to the fund which is used by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost to support our poor Bohemian families in this city. Open your hearts and your pocketbooks and help this Bohemian humanitarian institution which honorably represents us before the American people and shows them that the Bohemians of Chicago are able to take care of their own poor families. Therefore, do not forget our generous ladies who donate their services when they ask you to contribute. Proceeds of this tag day should yield at least $2,000 so that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost can continue in its humanitarian work started ten years ago. Fourteen prizes are ready for those ladies who collect the largest amounts. Mr. John A. Cervenka furnished the first and second prizes. Mr. John Krupka donated the third and fourth prizes, and Mr. Anton J. Cermak <span class="page-break">\2</span>will provide as other prizes ten tickets for main floor seats in one of the leading theaters in Chicago.</p>
