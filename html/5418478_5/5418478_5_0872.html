   <p>A praiseworthy deed was performed by Czech meat dealers who took up a collection for the benefit of the Old Peoples Home and Orphanage. A total of $14.85 was collected and deposited in the office of Denni Hlasatel. This noble act of the Czech butchers is deserving of public recognition and our more well-to-do tradesmen ought to take notice and follow this beautiful example. During the holidays, when so many happy faces are seen on all sides, we ought to remember our old people and orphans who have need for our help under all circumstances.</p>
   <p>The Butchers Workingmens Club, in their annual meeting held on December 25, took up a collection for the benefit of Saint Joseph's Orphanage and the sum of four dollars was realized. A committee composed of Mr. Vaclav Vorel and Joseph Capek turned the money over to said institution.</p>
