   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America) at its meeting, appointed a committee to make out checks for all those who suffered a loss through the lost shipment aboard the ship "Liberty Glow". Because it is impossible to do this work in our office, for it is being constantly visited by applicants, the committee was forced to close the office so it could work without being interrupted. Therefore, all who are interested are requested to wait until they receive their checks, which will be in the mail within the next few days. The money is deposited in the Adams State Bank and the insurance will be paid in full except for a two per cent discount which will be charged to cover expenses. All insistence in this direction is useless, because the work of the officers is only delayed thereby. The undersigned officers hope that the people will take notice of this report and will recognize the recognize the justification of this step.</p>
   
   <p>For the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe:</p>
   <p>Andrew Schustek, treasurer;</p>
   <p>Jan Straka, financial secretary.</p>
