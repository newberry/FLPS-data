   <p>A new lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) is being organized in our Morton Park. Forty ladies have already applied for membership in this widespread charitable organization. There is no doubt that the recent celebration of the twenty-thousandth member will prove to be a powerful stimulus to the activities of the Jednota and consequently will result in a still more rapid growth of membership.</p>
