   <p>A remarkable jubilee was celebrated at the halls of the Pilsen (district) Park yesterday. It was the occasion of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Illinois Grand Lodge of C.S.P.S. [Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost] (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society). Mr. Eugene Frydl, president, opened the ceremonies with heartfelt words. He presented the wards of the Czech Orphanage, and introduced Miss Vilim, the guardian, Mrs. Blafka, the housekeeper of the institution. Victoria Kaspar then thanked the brethren of the C.S.P.S. for the many things done for the children.</p>

   <p>Doctor Iska, in addressing the assembly, pointed to the enormous amount of work done by the Czech settlers of the western section of the United States during the past thirty-five years.</p>
   <p>Brother Pech, president of the National Grand Lodge of the C.S.P.S., and brother Joseph H. Filip, secretary, read telegrams of felicitation sent by Czech associations from all over the United States.</p>
   <p>At the end of the ceremonies, president Frydl declared the program closed, and the younger generation came into its own in dance and merriment.</p>
   <p>It was generally regretted that Doctor J. S. Vojan, who was scheduled as one of the principal speaker, did not appear.</p>
