   <p>The Slovacky Vzdelavaci Klub (Slovak Educational Club) is well known in our national life by virtue of its activities. It not only develops appreciation for the beauties of life and art through uplifting and interesting entertainments, but it also endeavors to do good whenever and wherever an opportunity arises. It thinks not only about nationalistic but also about humanitarian aims. That this is so was proved again during its last meeting in which, basing its action on the deliberation of its members during the regular annual meeting, a resolution, to contribute $25. to the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), was passed. The secretary of the Club is Mr. Eduard Flader, and the president Mr. Vaclav Kosner. It was the secretary who transmitted the above-mentioned amount to us. The managing director of the Ultulna A Sirotcinec is requested to come to our office to collect the said money. We need not stress the point that the action of the Slovacky Vzdelavaci Klub is worthy of following.</p>
