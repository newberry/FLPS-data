   <p>Many happy groups of our countrymen met at Mr. Karel Psenicka's restaurant, 1651 Blue Island Avenue, Friday night to celebrate New Year's Eve. At midnight, this group performed a deed which deserves full recognition and which should serve as an example for other similar occasions. Greeting the New Year, Mr. Joseph Riha, violin player, undertook a collection for a good cause. A wish was expressed to donate the contributions, amounting to seven dollars, to Mr. Hoover's relief fund. The said amount was deposited in our office.</p>
