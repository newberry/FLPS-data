   <p>The"Pilsen" Literary Society, which has of late been revived, and whose numbers take great pleasure in discussing and advancing all important matters of community interest, called a meeting of citizens last Saturday. The purpose of the meeting was to decide whether or not a Czecho-Slovak Orphanage in the United States, about which there has been much said in the public press, should be founded.</p>
   <p>The attendance at the meeting was very small and if we were not aware of the great dislike of our countrymen for anything that has the semblance of a meeting called for charitable purposes, we would be compelled to think that such a noble, philanthropic thought has no adherents among Chicago Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to order by the Literary Society's chairman, Mr. Lajer, who explained the purpose of the meeting. Mr. C. Hloucal, was secretary of the meeting.</p>
   <p>We must express our regret over the fact, that with the exception of the true Nationalist, our old Mr. Svoboda, all the speakers were in opposition <span class="page-break">2</span>to the founding of the Orphanage. The discussion was lively and interesting and deviated from the main subject toward the end: that is, to the discussion of whether or not the Bohemian Nationalistic Ideals should be upheld in America. After a lengthy debate the following resolutions were adopted:</p>
   <p>(1) That the expenses involved in maintaining an Orphanage are so great, that it is impossible for Chicago Bohemians to attend to the building of a National Orphanage.</p>
   <p>(2) We urge all Benefit and Nationalistic Societies to provide for the public care of orphans in all cities.</p>
   <p>(3) That for the preservation of our Nationality it is an unavoidable necessity, first of all, to found Bohemian Schools, both daily and Sunday; and we further urge National Societies in other cities where there are no Bohemian Schools, to take necessary steps for their founding.</p>
