   <p>Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan, chairman of the American Medical Association, has sent a check of $1,000 to Mr. James B. Forgan, treasurer of the Aid Committee for suffering Viennese. The check is a gift of a Chicago woman who does not wish to have her name revealed. The Viennese are receiving help from all sides, but the Bohemians of Vienna do not get anything from this. They must be taken care of by our countrymen here. Therefore, it is necessary that the collections for Bohemians of Vienna meet with the greatest success among us. Our countrymen living in Vienna find themselves in conditions far worse than any other branch of our people. They are surrounded by a sea of unfriendly people, who make them feel their envy in a cowardly manner, in that they exclude them from all help which comes from other countries for the benefit of all Vienna, therefore, for the Bohemians settled there.</p>
