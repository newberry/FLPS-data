   <p>It would be needless repetition of a well-known fact if we should attempt to point out the profound significance of the annual New Year's celebrations of the various units of our powerful benevolent societies (Podpurnych Jednot). Whether devoted to social, cultural, or agitatorial activity, these gatherings have for years attracted the membership which is guided by the desire to be refreshed, to enjoy the company of fellow members, to rejoice over the prosperity of their unit, and to pledge itself to work for the benefit of the organization during the new year.</p>
   <p>It is not only the members of the organizations who fill these social meetings to capacity. The general public attends these affairs to gain an insight into the beneficent activities of the organizations and to learn of the various opportunities which they offer. This is the practical purpose of these entertainments. The organizations have long known that with ever-decreasing immigration it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain new members or even to retain a status quo. Therefore, the organizations have sought an immediate means of making contact with prospective members. There is no promise of an alteration in this scarcity of eligible men and women members. If we may judge by the results of the affairs given yesterday, we may say that they served their purpose excellently.</p>
   <p>Celebration of the Czecho-Slav Union</p>
   <p>Yesterday was a holiday for the Czecho-Slav Union and for the multitude of their patrons and well-wishers. This was indicated by the large attendance which the spacious hall of the Pilsen Sokol could hardly accommodate, and by the festive mood which prevailed throughout the celebration.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee, consisting of Mrs. B. Laibl, Mrs. M. Pomazal, Mr. M. Cisar, and Mr. A. Turek, had planned a program which was rich in variety and color, and which represented a high artistic standard.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. P. Pecival, president of the Grand Lodge of the Czecho-Slav Union, was the main speaker of the afternoon. He elucidated on the difficulty of the conditions under which the Union is compelled to labor because of the abnormality of the present time. He emphasized the importance of co-operation as a prerequisite for the continued existence of the organization. In his opinion, a consolidation of the units is unavoidable, and was advocated long ago. The brotherhood organizations will feel obligated to merge into one large body, thus following the laudable example of our Sokols.</p>
   <p>In the course of his speech Dr. Pecival mentioned the work done by the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>"This organization should receive the best possible support from Czechoslovak-America," he said, "for Czechoslovak independence is an ideal common to us all, and there never again will be as favorable a time to attain it. Here is an opportunity for our wealthy Czech people to fulfill a lofty duty, to sacrifice upon the altar of our subjugated homeland at least a part of their surplus wealth, and thus to memorialize their names as protectors whom the nation will esteem for centuries to come." Stormy applause rewarded the speaker.</p>
   <p>The musical numbers of the program, which fulfilled high artistic requirements, were received with evident pleasure. The orchestral program was arranged by Brother Joseph Cerny, and the selections were delivered in a manner worthy of any accredited orchestra.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Czech Workingmen's Singing Association), and the Sbor Tambururasu (Mandolin and Guitar Orchestra) also performed. The singers offered three Slovak songs composed by the talented music director, Jos. Houdek. They were: "Kde Si Bola?" (Where Were You?); "Ach, Moj Boze, Co Mam Robit?" (O My God What Am I To Do?), a baritone solo sung by Mr. Richard Adamira; and "Pi, Ondrisku, Pi" (Drink Little Andy, Drink). The turbulent applause which followed these numbers was an indication of the audience's hearty appreciation. The Tamburasi played a selection of songs, "Czech Pearls", arranged by J. Machac, and a medley from the opera, "Faust", by Gounod. These selections earned clamorous applause.</p>
   <p>Little Miss Marenka (May) Sramek, well known to our public, recited a satiric poem, "Svanda Dudak" (Svanda, the Bagpiper), by Korizek; the audience was carried away with the little girl's talent. The Liszt transcription of Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" was beautifully played as a piano solo by Miss Anna Cada. Miss Libusa (Libby) Zdenek moved the gathering by her art; she sang Marenka's air from Smetana's "Bartered Bride", "Kdybych Se Co Takoveho...." (Should I Ever Hear Anything Like That....). Mrs. Slavka Krejci, who as a soubrette has scarcely a rival upon our stage, charmed her listeners with Susie's song from Lehar's light opera, "Dratenicek," and Mr. Krejci sang a couplet, "Cesky Vandrak" (The Czech Wandering Boy), after which Mr. and Mrs. Krejci sang the piccolo-duet from "Waltz-Dream". The dancing school of Mrs. Helen Klaus-Mikuta gave an excellent exhibition of a "FairyDance". "Our Flags", a patriotic scene arranged by Dr. Anton Mueller, was executed by boys and girls of the Besidka (Little Club). There were several more recitations.....</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig Fisher was to have spoken for the Czech National Alliance, but he was unable to attend the celebration, because it was necessary that he appear at an out-of-town affair.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan Hribal, auditor of the Czecho-Slav Union, made a financial report for the organization, which has 6,492 members. The organization's assets are $72,764.78. The treasury fund of the Grand Lodge amounts to $1,119.69; reserves are $66,422.71. The Union has paid (in 1087 death cases) benefits amounting to $928,021.71. Death benefits to the amount of $66,250 were paid last year.</p>
   <p>All lodges bought War Bonds very eagerly. The Grand Lodge paid $3,000 for the War Bonds which it purchased. Mr. Hribal spoke of the many improvements which have been made since the last fall meeting and which are expected to bear fruit in the near future. From the report it appears that the organization is founded upon sound economic principles, and that it has grown and prospered in spite of adverse general conditions. It is fulfilling its humanitarian and social purpose in our public and national life.</p>
   <p>The meeting closed with a dance, during which prizes were distributed to those who had been most successful in gaining new members.</p>
   <p>Czecho-Slav Benevolent Society Celebrates</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge in Illinois and the local lodges of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (abbreviated C. S. P. S., Czecho-Slav Benevolent Society) held their annual New Year's celebration yesterday in the Patronate House, West 18th and South May Streets. Without exaggeration it must be admitted that the program of the celebration was one of the best we have witnessed. If any fault is to be found then it must be found in the large number of lengthy selections. This made the program unduly long, so that the celebration did not come to an end until late at night.</p>
   <p>This remark is meant only as a suggestion to the arrangements committee. Next time it may be wise to remember the old Czech proverb that "too much--." In every other respect the committee deserves unstinted praise. Recognition for the untiring work of the committee was given by all those who had braved the inclement weather to be present at the celebration, and public recognition is accorded the committee through the press.</p>
   <p>The program was opened by the excellent orchestra led by Mr. Jos. V. Soukup, who also supplied two violin solos, the "Cavatine" by Raff, and "Serenade of a Pierrot" by Randeger. The performance of his orchestra far exceeded the performances of other orchestras heard on similar occasions.</p>
   <p>President J. Pecha, in addressing the gathering, spoke with emphasis and pointed to our duty at this time. He not only implored the members of every lodge, but every individual as well, to stand loyally by President Wilson and his Government in this critical time of war. His words were received with loud, patriotic enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>A fourteen-year-old boy, William Kriz, followed with an English oration, "Americanism", and was rewarded with thundering applause. Our well-known amateur actor and zealous patriotic worker, Joseph Jurka, held the undivided attention of the audience with a recitation of Sladek's poem "Na Predni Strazi" (On the Watch on the Foremost Front).</p>
   <p>The main speaker of the day was our fellow countryman from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Attorney J. J. Vlach, a born orator. His was a heart-to-heart talk, delivered with true patriotic sentiment. In his address he laid emphasis upon unity, and upon the obligations which these grave times have placed upon our shoulders.</p>
   <p>Several other numbers followed on the program. These included dancing, singing, and two one-act comedies.</p>
   <p>The attendance was very good considering the bad weather. The celebration ended with a dance, which lasted until the morning hours. The arrangements committee may well be satisfied with the success of the day.</p>
