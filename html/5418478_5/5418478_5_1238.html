   <p>Great joy was created by Mr. Vojta Masek, president of the well-known firm, Pilsen Lumber Company, for thirty poor youngsters who could not afford to buy their sleds. By giving them the necessary materials he made it possible for these young fellows to make their own sleds in the Dvorak Park [workshop]. To make their sleds look more attractive, Mr. Charles Novak, a well-known paint merchant of Blue Island Avenue, gave the boys enough paint to decorate their own handiwork.</p>
   <p>The happy group rolled up its sleeves and went to work so as to have the sleds ready before winter comes. The park director wishes to thank both of these gentlemen for their noble deeds. The boys were truly grateful.....</p>
