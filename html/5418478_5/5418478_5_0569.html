   <p>P.1--When a handful of enthusiastic Bohemians founded the first Czechoslovak Benevolent Society lodge, in St. Louis, in 1854, named "Slovan," they had not the slightest idea, that they had laid the foundation of a Union, which would become in the future the most powerful Bohemian organization in America. Just think of it: Today the C. S. P. S. numbers 216 lodges with 24,000 members. This is an imposing figure, the more so, if we consider the many, often very dangerous and to other societies of this king, ruinous crisis, which the Union had to pass through, since the date of its organization. Other societies failed, vanished completely, but the C.S. P. S. resisted successfully all unfavorable periods and continued to grow, expand and become more powerful. The good that has been done by the C.S.P.S., the amount of work in the national field, in fact in the world field, can not be overlooked by any Bohemian or any man, whose mind is capable of recognizing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>good and noble work. Today we look upon the C.S.P.S., as the most powerful guardian of our Bohemianism in America, because it builds Bohemian schools for us, it endeavors to prevent our youth from denationalizing. It is perfectly natural, the Union does this also in its own interest, for we all know well, that our youth, if it becomes denationalized, is lost for us in every respect, spiritually and materially. Because the children of Bohemian parentage, as soon as they stop feeling Bohemian, become members of lodges of other nationalities, thereby giving them the strength which is needed by our own lodges. It is from a practical viewpoint, that the C.S.P.S. should see to the preservation of our youth for the Bohemian tongue.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's public celebration, held by the C.S.P.S., in the school on 18th St., was, for us, only another proof of the love with which the members of the lodges cling to the Union. Never before have such crowds of people flocked to the school. The beginning of the celebration was set for 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but long before that, the hall was filled to capacity and those who thought they had plenty of time, if they came fifteen minutes later, discovered that they had been mistaken, and that there was no longer any room for them in the hall. We do not over estimate in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>least, if we say, that there were about 1,500 persons in the hall. Seats were all taken and even the aisle space was filled. And still other.crowds kept arriving, so that, when the aisle were filled, the committee could do nothing else, except close the doors. Several hundred people were forced to leave.</p>
   <p>The program was so well arranged and so well carried through, that it would do honor to any academy holding a similar celebration.</p>
   <p>The celebration was opened at 2 o'clock by the orchestra under the direction of Mr. Rudolph Rubringer. The public could not grow weary of the excellent music and showed its appreciation, with thunderous applause after each selection.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Janda, the chairman of the celebration committee, in an informal talk, welcomed the gathering, expressing his pleasure at the enormous attendance and explaining the purpose of the celebration. He, then, introduced Mr. John Pech, the chairman of the Grand-Lodge.</p>

   <p>Mr. Pech, spoke on the significance of the C.S.P.S. and mentioned at length last year's convention in Milwaukee. It was resolved, there, that lodges should endeavor to increase their membership, and many other beneficial motions were made and adopted. Chicago was looked upon, by the delegates at that convention, as the most powerful stronghold of the C.S.P.S., and for that reason, the office of the National Grand-Lodge was moved to Chicago. To be sure, Chicago must now prove, that, as heretofore, it will be a shining example to all others, in increasing the ranks of its members to such an extent as to be beyond comparison with other societies of this kind. For that reason this celebration was held. Also, the transfer of the National Offices to Chicago was celebrated. He urged the brothers and sisters to always work for the good of the C.S.P.S.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker was Mr. J. J. Kral, who spoke on the mission of the C.S.P.S. He introduced the mission of the C.S.P.S., in three parts namely: social, economic, and nationalistic. His speech was well thought out and the mission of the Union clearly indicated.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's celebration had a very deep meaning not only for the Unity, but for our entire public.</p>
