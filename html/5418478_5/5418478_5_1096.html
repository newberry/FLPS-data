   <p>....A very lively discussion was started in the meeting of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) by the reading of an advertisement in Bohemian dailies concerning the prize contest of the Pilsen Brewing Company for the benefit of several Bohemian charitable organizations, a contest for which these organizations are expected to appoint representatives who would supervise the counting of ballots issued to purchasers of Olympia Beer.</p>
   <p>In response to an inquiry by Dr. Frantisek Iska, Chairman Vojtech Suchy declared that the Pilsen Brewing Company started this action without having consulted the Utulna A Sirotcinec and without having received the latter's consent. In the opinion of Mr. Flider and several other members, it is not in keeping with the character and prestige of the Utulnia A Sirotcinec to to have its name associated with any action such as that of the Pilsen <span class="page-break">2</span>Brewing Company. These members propose to address a protest against this action to the company. Mr. Illich suggested that the Utulna wait until the contest is over and the prizes are distributed, and then issue a warning to the company against organizing a similar contest for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec in the future or using the Utulna's name for any purpose whatsoever without securing its consent in advance.</p>
   <p>Dr. Iska was of the opinion that the Utulna should refuse to accept the prize. He says that "we should not agree to run in these 'Olympic Beer games,' and we should refuse the nomination of a representative". The chairman pointed out that the prize would be a welcome addition to Utulna's bank account. Dr. Iska formally moved that the company be warned against the use of the Utulna's name without securing its permission in advance, and that the organization refuse to nominate a representative. The motion was seconded and carried.....</p>
