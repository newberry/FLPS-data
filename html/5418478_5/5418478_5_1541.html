   <p>The membership drive committee which was appointed for the purpose of securing one thousand new members for the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost V Chicagu (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago), sent more than four thousand circulars to Bohemian individuals and organizations in Chicago. In these letters, the meritorous work of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is explained, urging all Bohemians to become members of the Association by contributing the sum of five dollars or more. Responses to this appeal are slow in coming and are not as numerous as was expected. Do not wait until the moment when when the members of the committee call on you personally, but send your contribution to the secretary of the committee, Mr. Thomas Kallal, 3245 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>All contributions will be published in our daily newspapers and membership cards will be sent by mail.</p>
