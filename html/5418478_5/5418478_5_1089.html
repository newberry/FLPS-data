   <p>Lodge Jiri Podebradsky Number 24 of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) voted a contribution of $10 for the benefit of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) at its December meeting. The amount was deposited in the office of this newspaper and its receipt was acknowledged in our issue of December 14, 1913. However, it was credited by mistake to Lodge Jungman instead of Lodge Jiri Podebradsky, although the right number of the Lodge was given.</p>
   <p>The contribution was turned over to Mr. Dusek, financial secretary of the Lodge, together with the sum of $112.60, which Mr. Dusek has shown in his report. But the mistake in the name has not been noticed until just now, and is hereby corrected.</p>
