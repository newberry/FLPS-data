   <p>The well known Bohemian brewing company, Atlas, did not neglect to make its customary monetary contribution, of considerable amount, for some honorable purpose. This year, as a Christmas gift, it donated to the Old Peoples Home the sum of $100, with the hope that this welfare institution should be host to the old people, who will seek and find refuge therein, in the near future. The above mentioned gift was delivered to the Home by Karl Vopicka, President of the Atlas Brewery and member of the Chicago School Board. The Board of Directors of the Home accepted the gift with great pleasure, and will not forget to give whole-hearted thanks, in an appropriate place and time,to the honorable donors whose ranks should grow more rapidly.</p>
