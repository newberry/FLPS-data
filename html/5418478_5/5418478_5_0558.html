   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association will have a Tag Day on July 4th. We will discuss this at length in some future issue. Today, we only want to say that such an organization as the Bohemian Charitable Association should have a Tag Day at least once each week during the entire year and no matter how much money is collected, it would always reach the right place.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association has accomplished a gigantic piece of humanitarian work during the short period of its existence and is deserving of the support of every Bohemian of good will. Not much noise, not much fanfare, but work, honorable work, that is the motto of the Bohemian Charitable Association. We do not wish to shout to the world the work we are doing by relieving the suffering among our countrymen, but we prefer to work quietly, and principally, help is given effectively. Support the Bohemian Charitable Association and soon we will see that there is not one Bohemian or Slovak family in Chicago suffering from want.</p>
