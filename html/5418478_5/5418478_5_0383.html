   <p>Reports of the representatives of various districts followed.....</p>
   <p>This writer, as the representative of the Third District of Chicago, reported that there are 126 benevolent associations in his district, most of them Bohemian, and these are members of their own organization, the so-called Sdruzeni Ceskych Podporujicich Spolku (Association of Bohemian Benevolent Societies). The Sdruzeni has 94 members, and 32 associations in the District are unaffiliated with that body.....</p>
   <p>He reported that all Bohemian benevolent associations are in good financial condition and doing profitable business. They issue a quarterly magazine, and will publish a pamphlet for the wider public explaining the purpose of benevolent associations and their national-economic importance. His report <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was very well received, and the other representatives remarked that the Bohemian benevolent organizations are certainly "up to scratch".......</p>
   <p>Bohemian delegates were in the membership of all important committees.....such as the resolutions committee, convention program committee, committee for the good of the League, committee for new business, and financial committee, so that we are satisfied that we have done our duty.</p>
