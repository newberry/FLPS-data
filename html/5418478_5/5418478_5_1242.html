   <p>While en route to Czechoslovakia aboard the steamship Rotterdam, a special committee was appointed by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) to handle the baggage of all the members of the expedition. For this service rates were charged according to weight of each piece of baggage. The committee, after collecting the money and paying for expressage, etc., had $289 left.</p>
   <p>This amount was given by Mr. Vaclav Radous to the leader of the expedition, Mr. Jan Straka, who, with the approval of the members, used this surplus for various charitable causes as follows: The Vincentinum Orphanage of Prague $50; the Utulek Svateho Josefa (Saint Joseph's Old People's Home), also in Prague, $100; the Nemocnice Alzbetinek (Sainte Elizabeth [convent] Hospital) of Prague, $100; and the Utulna Slepych Divek (Blind Girls' Home) at Kampa in Prague, $40; total, $290. The one dollar which was lacking was supplied <span class="page-break">\2</span>by Mr. Jan Straka. All of the institutions mentioned have acknowledged receipt of the contributions made....and may be seen upon request at the office of the Narodni Svaz in Chicago. [Translator's note: Here follow the acknowledgments written by the four mentioned institutions.]</p>
