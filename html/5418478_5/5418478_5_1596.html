   <p>Our important charitable institution, the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, was remembered at the surprise party arranged in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Hlavacek, 5523 West 25th Street, and held in Kafka's hall on the occasion of their silver wedding anniversary. Mrs. Frantiska Mlejnsky and Mrs. Tekla Tajbl undertook a collection among the guests for the benefit of this institution, and the sum of fourteen dollars was collected. This amount was deposited in our office.</p>
