   <p>The Ceskoslovenske Narcdni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) purchased $2,000 worth of Hoover Mission food orders which will be sent to the Ceske Srdce (Bohemian Heart) in Vienna, Austria, to alleviate the misery of our suffering countrymen in that place. Every man is deeply touched by the call for aid of our unfortunate countrymen whom fate placed in unfriendly Vienna where, depending upon themselves only, they must endure severe hardships. The Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe called upon its district committees to undertake a collection for the benefit of our unhappy Vienna countrymen, the result of which is that in the next few days, $2,000 worth of Hoover Mission food orders will be sent to Vienna. The food orders were purchased through the New York district committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe which donated the substantial amount of $1,000 for this noble purpose. The district committees of Omaha, Nebraska, and of Chicago, Illinois, also contributed large amounts.</p>
