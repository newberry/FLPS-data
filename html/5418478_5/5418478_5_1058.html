   <p>Yesterday's regular monthly meeting of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was exceptionally well attended. This was to be expected, since it was a meeting in which the newly elected officers were being inducted, and since it had been foreseen that the meeting would take up the discussion of a letter received from the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) in reply to the appeal for a donation sent to it by the Utulna a Sirotcinec. Most of those in attendance had heard that the condition upon which the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov would insist before it appropriated any money for the Utulna a Sirotcinec, was the ouster of Mr. Charvat from the board of the Utulna.</p>
   <p>These expectations were not disappointed. The letter was read in full. In it the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov referred to the request of the Utulna a Sirotcinec for the usual New Year's donation and gave assurance of its readiness to be of any possible help to worthy Bohemian institutions. Since, however, the request was signed by Mr. Ant. Charvat, who in his dealing with the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov has not acted as the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov believed a good Bohemian should, the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov demanded that Mr. Charvat resign his office as a member of the board of directors of the Utulna a Sirotcinec, and upon Mr. Charvat's resignation, the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov would consider with the usual generosity the Utulna's request.....</p>
   <p>After the reading of the letter....Mr. Freiller moved a vote of confidence in Mr. Charvat, which motion was unanimously adopted. Mr. Janda said he thought....that the whole matter had been dealt with by the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov with undue haste and lack of forethought....The donations that the Utulna a Sirotcinec is receiving are not donations made to, or because of, individuals connected with the institution....Anybody who works for the Utulna a Sirotcinec as well as Mr. Charvat does is appreciated, and Mr. Charvat's work is easily worth as much as the donation usually received at this time of year from the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov.....</p>
   <p>The meeting instructed the secretary to explain by letter to the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov the point of view of the Utulna a Sirotcinec on this matter, and to repeat the request.....</p>
