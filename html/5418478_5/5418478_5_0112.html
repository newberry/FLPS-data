   <p>The ninth convention of the Jednota Cesk√Ωch Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) is nearing the end, and beginning next week the delegates will be able to return to their homes. Yesterday was again a day of diligent work, and the delegates put forth their best efforts to bring the task of amending the constitution to a conclusion and to accomplish this important duty to the satisfaction of all delegates and the entire membership of the organization.</p>
   <p>A splendid banquet is being prepared by the Bohemian Sisterhood Society this afternoon in honor of the delegates. The banquet will be held at the Pilsen Park pavilion, and it will be a get-together of members from both sisterly societies and many of their friends, who surely will not forget to attend. The banquet is being arranged by the Illinois grand lodge and includes a splendid program, which is a guarantee of pleasant entertainment. The time of the banquet is set for 2 P. M. and the price of admission is two dollars, which includes everything.</p>

   <p>Yesterday's session was called to order by the chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik. After the roll call and the reading and approval of the minutes of the preceding session, the work of amending the constitution commenced again.</p>
   <p>First, the articles dealing with the duties of the state grand committee were discussed, and a few of them were amended only slightly. Then the articles dealing with the organization of new lodges were discussed. Several of the articles were amended, but not to a great extent. In the course of the discussion, the matter of permitting the English language to be used in lodge meetings, as was recommended by several lodges, came up. The delegates did not agree to permit the exclusive use of the English language, although they recognized the permissibility of giving the member the opportunity to express herself in the English language and eventually to interpret the proceedings. These articles required a lengthy discussion which was continued in the afternoon session when other articles of the constitution were also debated.</p>
