   <p>That the Chicago Butchers' Packing Company, a well-known Bohemian enterprise, never forgets our charitable institutions has been proved on various occasions. Last Tuesday it was again demonstrated by a generous Christmas gift to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa (St. Joseph's Orphanage) in Lisle, Illinois. At the directors' meeting of this prosperous enterprise, the sum of fifty dollars was appropriated to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, and an equal sum to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa.</p>
