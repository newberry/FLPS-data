   <p>Several of our countrywomen attempted a collection for the benefit of the parents of the little boy, Pavel Tomasic, of 945 West 18th Street. As we announced in one of our previous issues, little Pavel was killed by an automobile. Mrs. Anna Miva deposited the amount of $38.10 with us. [Names of donors and the amounts contributed by each are omitted in translation.]</p>
