   <p>The Jan Hus League of the Czecho-Slavic Free Masons, through its secretary, Mr. Max Kirchman of Gary, Indiana, publishes records of its activities which have found much favor in wider circles of the Masonic orders of America. The league was founded in 1914. From that time on, it has begun to acquaint the Masonic order in the United States with their national activities, they have thereby accomplished a great amount of important work.</p>
   <p>The March issue of The American Freemason prints an interesting article about the national exertions of the League. The article appreciates the patriotic attitude of the members, and the loyalty toward the country in which they, or their forebears, were born.</p>
   <p>Mention is made of the oppression to which the Czech nation is subjected, and hope is expressed that the hour of liberation is not remote for the Czechs who represent one of the most progressive nations of Europe, and whose value has been recognized in the Allied peace note as an answer to an inquiry by President Wilson. The article also dwells on the extensive activities of the Czechs in their Masonic lodges, a rapid growth of which is anticipated when the War is ended. In another article, the loyalty manifesto of the Czech Freemasons sent to President Wilson is quoted.</p>
   <p>The Jan Hus League will arrange a Hus celebration this summer. One part of the yield will go to the Czech National Association, the remainder will be used for Slavonic propaganda among the various Masonic lodges of Europe.</p>
