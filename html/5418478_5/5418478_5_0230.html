Provisions worth $54.85 were given out to thirty-four adults and to ninety-three children, clothes given to forty-seven adults and to one hundred forty-eight children.</p>
   <p>Special recognition is deserved by Mr. Stanislav J. Loula, our chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mrs. Marie Krupka, president of the Ladies' Auxiliary, for prudent leadership and generous service. We also thank the Bohemian newspapers for the support of our cause and all of our directors <span class="page-break">9</span>and officers of the Ladies' Auxiliary. Our books were audited free of charge by Mr. H C. Goetschem, public accountant.</p>
   <p>After the ten years of activity, we are now entering into another year with a great deal of satisfaction of a well accomplished work. Great opportunities for further accomplishments are ahead of us. Hundreds and hundreds of poor families are looking toward us. It is our duty to make their lives more bearable. Our aim in this coming year should be to bring forth the question of how to get more funds for the Bohemian Charitable Association, and how to increase the number of members to contribute amounts of five dollars or more a year. The City of Chicago ranks next to the City of Prague, Czechoslovakia, which is the second largest Bohemian city in the world, and it is our duty to make the Bohemian Charitable Association an institution which would be imposing with its membership and its philanthropy.</p>
