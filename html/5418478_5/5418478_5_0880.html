   <p>A program of songs and exercises by the children was added for entertainment. The affair was held in the Pilsen Sokol hall.</p>
   <p>Miss Koller, the teacher, requested the visitors to examine the children's work before the program got under way. The entertainment was successful beyond expectation, and those who came to see the work of the children were pleasantly entertained. Some of the girls were dressed as Bohemian peasant <span class="page-break">\2</span>girls and performed folk dances which pleased the visitors very much.</p>
