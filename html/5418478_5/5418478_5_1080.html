   <p>A regular meeting of the representatives of the Ceska Utulna a Sirocinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was held last evening in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). Many representatives of various fraternal societies were present, and Mr. V. Suchy was the presiding officer. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved without change, and all bills presented were ordered paid.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Narodni Hribtov (Bohemian National Cemetery), in answer to the request for a special plot for the burial of the inmates of the Utulna a Sirocinec, said that the organization gives free burial space to all deceased <span class="page-break">\2</span>members of the above-named organization and is opposed to a special plot reserved for members, because it might be construed by many to mean a sort of potter's field.</p>
   <p>A lively debate followed the reading of this letter, and many contended that a special plot need not carry along with it any opprobrium because of the fact that the members of this institution received free burial.</p>
   <p>On the contrary it was brought out that by having one large burial plot, such a place could be kept in beautiful condition more easily than if the graves were scattered over a large area. Many motions were made, and finally one, directing the secretary to inform the Cesko-Narodni Hrbitov of the many divergent wishes of the delegates present, was adopted.</p>
   <p>The Velkorad Statu Illinois of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (The <span class="page-break">\3</span>Illinois Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) is making inquiries in reference to money deposited, and the chairman explained that first mortgage securities amounting to $16,500 are deposited in the vault of Mr. Frank J. Petru, and if the grand lodge wishes more information, let it then select a committee to visit the vaults along with Mr. Charvat, who is the chairman of the managing committee, and inspect the said papers. To describe these papers publicly, it was noted, is not a good public policy, and a motion was made and passed conforming to the above reference.</p>
   <p>The chairman announced the death of Mrs. Marie Ledvinka, long-time vice-chairman of the representatives of the Utulna a Sirocinec. She merited the approval of all who knew her for her untiring efforts for the betterment of our institution.</p>
   <p>The chairman called attention to one specific case of welfare in which Mrs. Ledvinka showed her mettle. The cook of the institution quit her job abruptly, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and there was no one to cook the meals. At this time Mrs. Ledvinka showed what she could do in an emergency: She took up the duties of the cook and made meals for the whole company until another cook could be hired. The chairman stated that this is just one example of the good work performed by Mrs. Ledvinka; that all those who knew her feel her loss. The chairman ordered that the meeting show its last respects to the departed friend by rising and standing silently.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charvat made a very encouraging report, saying that gas will soon be installed in the Home.</p>
   <p>A motion was made, seconded, and passed to the effect that the election of a vice-chairman who is to take the place of the deceased, Mrs. Marie Ledvinka, be postponed until the semiannual meeting next July.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Upon a motion seconded and passed, Mrs. Denemark was assigned to the building committee in place of Mrs. Pech.</p>
   <p>The receipts and expenditures of this meeting were ordered read, after which the meeting was adjourned. Total receipts, $789.51; total expenditures, $678.30.</p>
