   <p>At the last convention of the Sdruzene Vypomocne Spolky (Federated Aid Societies) held in Peoria, Illinois, on October 12, the Mysticky Spolek Ceskych Delegatu (Mystical Society of Bohemian Delegates) was founded. Its treasurer, Mr. William K. Pflaum, sends us the following report: At the convention our charitable institutions were remembered. These were the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa v Lisle, Illinois (Saint Joseph's Orphanage at Lisle, Illinois). In order to make the acquisition of funds possible the Mysticky Spolek was organized, the avowed purpose of which is the doing of charitable deeds. Since every Czech delegate became a member of it without much urging, the sum of $38 was soon collected. This sum was divided into two halves, one half being given to each of the above-named Czech charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>The founders of the Spolek were the following gentlemen: Mr. Frank J. Petru, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Mr. Vaclav Calek, and Mr. William K. Pflaum. The following men became members of the Spolek, and every one of these men--and there were many among them belonging to other foreign-language groups--when asked, gladly contributed to the good cause: Vaclav Calek, Josef Vlaciha, J. L. Voborsky, Konrad Ricker, Karel Krabec, Frank Skrzydlewski, Stepan Kovac, J. Mackiewic, Thos. M. Filas, M. A. Kostecky, F. L. Basta, Jas. E. Melich, Charles Churan, Rudolf Mulac, A. Wachowski, George W. Kralovec, M. E. Vasen, Ward B. Whitlock, Charles F. Zak, Josef F. Janda, Anton Vanek, Josef Czekala, Bob Mudra, F. J. Mancl, J. P. Krivanek, A. J. Wlodarski, Z. Kadow, Josef Serhant, M. D. Riderx, J. W. Benke, F. O. Snyder, J. Mrazek, John L. Novak, Josef Petranek, Frank J. Petru, William K. Pflaum. The meetings of this Mystical Society will be held annually at the convention of the Federated Aid Societies. The sum of $19, contributed to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, was deposited with us.</p>
