   <p>The interest evoked by the sad case of the gardener, Vilem Koukola, is not diminishing; on the contrary, it may be observed that it increases from day to day. This is demonstrated by the many contributions which flood our offices in behalf of the family of that unfortunate man. In his name and that of his family, we wish to thank you for all the kindnesses shown them. To this we also add our personal thanks, for it was our voice which called to the generous hearts of our people....and we also thank those countrymen of ours who, though unable to make any monetary contributions, remembered Koukola with letters during his most trying times. Such letters were not mailed to him directly, although this could have been done, since we published his address. In some letters we are being critized for the steps we have taken in behalf of the unhappy family. We can assure the writers of these letters that their criticisms do not affect us at all. We know that every man has his friends and his enemies, and Koukola is not excepted. Still and all he must be pleased to know that his friends outnumber his enemies.</p>

   <p>We ourselves cherish the thought that we are doing the right thing....that we are discharging our obligations as fellowmen toward other fellowmen; and as to the inimical letters, we pay no attention to them because envy permeates every line and also because the authors forgot to sign them. [There follow the names of contributors and the amounts contributed]. To day's collection amounts to $129.75, which will be mailed to Koukola this forenoon.</p>
