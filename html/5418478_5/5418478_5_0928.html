   <p>During the celebration of the silver wedding anniversary of Henry and Bozena Kafka, Avers Avenue and West 26th Street, on July 29, our charitable institutions were remembered. Mrs. Dolezal, Mrs. Sedlacek, and Mrs. Kafka made a collection for the benefit of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa v Lisle, Illinois (Saint Joseph's Orphanage at Lisle, Illinois). The ladies collected $20 to which Mr. Kafka added $5; total $25.</p>
