   <p>Mr. Frank Wolf, a well-known countryman of 2416 South 58th Avenue, Cicero, Illinois, received a communication from a World War invalid, Josef Kovar, of Horijany, near Tachovice, Czechoslovakia, who is asking for relief from his very sad situation. He is the father of two children, and, because of injuries received in action, he is unable to work. Our countrymen from Horijany and vicinity who would be willing to help him can do so by sending their contributions to the above-mentioned address.</p>
