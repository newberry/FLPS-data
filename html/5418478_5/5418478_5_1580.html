   <p>For the bazaar committee of the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor:</p>
   <p>Barbora Scheffl, chairman;</p>
   <p>Ruzena Lusk, secretary;</p>
   <p>Aloisie Hajek, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the bazaar were sent to the president of the Czechoslovak Red Cross, Dr. Alice G. Masaryk, of Prague, Czechoslovakia, who acknowledged the receipt of it by the following letter:</p>
   <p>"To the Ceskoslovensky Pomocny Vybor of Chicago:</p>
   <p>"I acknowledge hereby the receipt of a letter dated January 3, 1921, in which you sent me draft No. 28563, issued by the American State Bank for the amount of 108,966 Czechoslovak kronen, and which sum you sent for the benefit of the orphans of our fallen Legionnaires.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"I thank you most heartily for your most generous gift. I should like to convince you that the idea back of it pleases us more than the amount itself, and that you are helping us in our difficult work. I know very well that it was not easy for you to collect such a large sum of money, and that it was only your love for your old homeland that helped you in this beautiful task.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, I thank you most heartily for your gift which was sent under the impulse of so noble a sentiment--the sacrificing devotion to your brothers. But I wish chiefly to thank you in the name of our little ones whose losses occasioned by the war will be replaced by your generosity.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"Dr. Alice G. Masaryk,</p>
   <p>"President of the Czechoslovak Red Cross."</p>
