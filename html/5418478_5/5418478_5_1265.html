   <p>All the necessary preparations for the twelfth annual charity ball of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) have been completed. The ball will take place on November 22, 1922, in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue. Judging from the preparations already completed, this year's ball will surpass all previous similar affairs arranged by the Spolecnost. The committee on arrangements has gone out of its way to make this annual ball a great success. The sale of tickets is going well, and we are highly pleased with the attitude of our countrymen who believe in supporting the work of the Spolecnost. The coming winter is going to be bad for the poor Czech families. Coal is expensive; rents and living expenses are high. Heart-rending appeals for help reach the office of the Spolecnost every day; besides the constant influx of new cases there are the old ones, many of which concern old people whose ailments are incurable. There are also destitute families with very young children who need proper care.</p>

   <p>Therefore, during a season which includes such holidays as Thanksgiving and Christmas, let not your hearts be hardened, but help those who really need your help.</p>
   <p>Tickets for the ball have been mailed to the friends of the Spolecnost; more tickets are available at the offices of the Association which is located at 2603 South Kedzie Avenue, telephone Rockwell 1787. The price of a ticket is $1; in purchasing it you support the charities of the Spolecnost. The Spolecnost spent $9,864.46 during the past year for charity, and $71,489.01 during its entire existence. This shows what responsibilities it shouldered. At the last meeting of the board of directors, a check for $200 was received from Mr. August Geringer, publisher of the Svornost; this gift was sent by him on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Another check for $100 was received from the committee of the Obchodni Americka Vyprava Do Cech (Bohemian-American Commercial Expedition to Bohemia). The board of directors of the Spolecnost hereby extends its thanks to both donors. The final meeting of the entertainment <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>committee will be very important, and every member should attend it. It will be held this Thursday, November 16, 1922, at 8 P.M., in the office of the Spolecnost.</p>
