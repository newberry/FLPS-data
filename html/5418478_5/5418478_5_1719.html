   <p>Recently, the headquarters of the Narodni Sdruzeni Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Czech Catholics of America) sent five large boxes full of clothes, underwear, and shoes to the wives and children of our heroic legionnaires who are returning to the old homeland from Siberia, and who are now being detained at Norfolk, Virginia for a longer period of time. The boxes, which also contained plenty of interesting and educational literature, were dispatched by express. Reverend Leo Steffl of New Bohemia, Virginia, whose parish is nearest to Norfolk and who is well known as a self-sacrificing national worker, was authorized by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe to visit the legionnaires and to take care of the distribution of the gifts. All gifts were bought upon his recommendation. The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe appropriated the sum of two hundred dollars for this purpose, and some gifts were also collected after our plea was published in the newspapers.</p>

   <p>Plenty of underwear and clothing was provided by us so that every woman and child will receive several articles which will surely be useful to them during the voyage and after their return to the homeland, where such articles are expensive and quite often cannot be bought at all. The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe did not mind the trouble involved in collecting and transporting these articles, but was interested in seeing that assistance be given to people of our blood who are in need and who are deserving of aid. The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe is determined to help our legionnaires whenever necessary, and this can easily be carried out with the co-operation of all our generous people.</p>
