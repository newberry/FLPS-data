   <p>Since the old year is rapidly coming to a close, it may be advisable to make the Bohemian Freethinking people somewhat better acquainted with two of our most important charitable institutions in Chicago--the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage)--and their work.</p>
   <p>These institutions are located on North 40th and Foster Avenues. The gounds cover about ten acres, and the buildings are rather new. The original building for the Old People's Home now houses the Orphanage, which has about thirty inmates at the present time. In addition to the children's quarters, the offices of the organization and rooms for the help, etc., are located there.</p>
   <p>Then there is the older building which is used as a home for old men and women, of whom there are now about twenty Adjacent to these two, there are a number of other buildings used exclusively by the institutions, such as an icehouse, a woodshed, a barn where three cows are kept, etc. The institutions have a <span class="page-break">2</span>large garden, and a small patch where vegetables are raised.</p>
   <p>All of this equipment is owned by a body known as the Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince (Board of the Old People's Home and Orphanage), consisting of representatives of our Free Thought societies, such as lodges of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity), the Cesko-Americti Lesnici A Lesnice (Bohemain-American [men and women] Foresters), the Taboriti (Taborites), the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Women's Unity), the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Benevolent Sisterhood), the Sokols, workingmen's organizations, and other societes, bodies and associations, educational clubs, singing societies, etc. In addition to these bodies--which are all "members" of the institutions--there are many individuals who are also members. The Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince is incorporated in the State of Illinois and consequently is subject to all Illinois. laws governing such institutions.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this corporation is to give shelter to old men and women of <span class="page-break">3</span>Bohemian nationality who, through no fault of their own, have become destitute, and to furnish education, board, and shelter to Bohemian orphans.</p>
   <p>The member organizations select the men (or women) who will represent them as members of the board. These representatives meet once a month and elect their officers at the annual meeting. These officers are: chairman, secretary, financial secretary, and treasurer. In addition to these, the representatives elect seven members who, together with the four officers, comprise the socalled "Predsednictvo" (Presidium) [a body comparable to and perhaps best translated as "executive committee"] of eleven members, whose duty it is to supervise all activities of the body, conduct its accounting, take care of all needs of the institutions, and execute all actions agreed upon by the representatives in their meetings.</p>
   <p>In addition to this executive committee, an investigations committee of five members is elected whose duty it is to investigate applications for admission <span class="page-break">4</span>to the institutions and to report its findings to the representatives. The representatives then decide on the action to be taken in each individual case.</p>
   <p>Other committees are the accounting committee, which audits the books twice a year, and the propaganda committee, whose duty it is to seek new sources of income for the institutions.</p>
   <p>From the organization's set-up, it is evident that no small group of individuals or any clique can decide on admissions, and that in all actions of any importance, the decision is in the hands of all representatives.</p>
   <p>The trouble is that the institutions are not large enough to be in a position to make a favorable decision on each application received. Thus, the board of representatives is occasionally criticised and wrongly accused of making arbitrary decisions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The board recently applied for a new charter for the orphanage in order to be able to take advantage of the so-called Industrial Law. Once this new charter is secured, the county will have to pay the orphanage ten dollars monthly for every boy and fifteen dollars for every girl, that is for those boys and girls who are orphans and whose parents were citizens of the State of Illinois and the County of Cook.</p>
   <p>Before the kind of charter the board has applied for is issued, the State of Illinois makes a very thorough investigation of the institution. The State sent an inspector, Mr. Chas. Wirden, to the Utulna a Sirotcinec, and it was most enlightening to watch his methods.</p>
   <p>First he called together all officers and members of the executive committee and submitted them to a long questioning. They had to give a history of the orphanage, the way it is managed, what its income is, how it is derived, as well as detailed information concerning everything in connection with the institution. Then Mr. Wirden explained what improvements must be made, what <span class="page-break">6</span>the board must avoid, and offered many useful suggestions. The next day he came at 6:30 in the morning, had breakfast with the children, and stayed for dinner in order to see what they are fed. He wanted to see what kind of luncheon they take along to school. He paid close attention to all safety measures; state of cleanliness, appearance of the whole institution, the children's health, dress, and beds. He wanted to know whether the children are taught to love work, and he asked questions about everything in and connected with the orphanage.</p>
   <p>After all this, he stated that we have a model, well run institution, and that as far as he is concerned, we can expect that the commission which issues these charters will receive the best recommendation for our orphanage.</p>
   <p>The reason for this care is the fact that there are many similar institutions run purely for profit. Such institutions take in many orphans and get the county's subsidy for their support. Then, for example, a farmer comes and asks for a strong boy whom he could adopt. The institution gives him such a <span class="page-break">7</span>boy, but the county keeps on paying for him. The farmer buys him a pair of shoes for a dollar or so, a cheap suit of clothes, puts the boy to work, and saves the expense of a farm hand, to whom he would have to pay thirty dollars a month. Or, a lady comes and desires to take into her home a girl to whom she would like to give an education. But this education consists mostly of laundry work, scrubbing floors, etc., and the lady has a maid for nothing. This I mention only as a warning to our people and organizations, because such orphanages have many well-paid agents who go around soliciting contributions for their "charitable" institutions.</p>
   <p>Our Utulna A Sirotcinec, because of the way they are managed and conducted, because of the supervision they are receiving from our member organizations, are two institutions that deserve complete confidence and general support.</p>
   <p>In recent years, various orders of so-called "Good Fellows" were being organized among the American people. The members of these Good-Fellow organizations pledge to do good deeds of one kind or another. It is a pleasure to <span class="page-break">8</span>know that we have such "Good Fellows" among us also. One of them is certainly the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) with its $500 contributions. Another is the Damsky Odbor Ceske Besedy (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Bohemian Club), which is helpful to the orphans in various ways. There is also the Dobrocinny Krovzek Dam Ceske Kalifonia (California Ladies' Benevolent Circle), and the Spolek Plzenskych Rezniku (Pilsen Butchers' Association), which has already donated two cows to the institution, besides other valuable gifts.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jas. Vasumpaur's donation of a gramophone has afforded many a gay hour for the orphans. Would that we had more such good fellows among us, because they may be assured that every donation goes to the right place and is properly used.</p>
   <p>In closing, I should like to give my readers an idea of the institutions' yearly financial requirements. We spend about $2,500 for meats and groceries, $600 for light and heat, and $1,040 for the pay roll. Other expenses, such as <span class="page-break">9</span>medicines and medical services, clothes, furniture, etc., raise the total to about $6,000.</p>
   <p>The Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince expresses its thanks for the following donations: To Mr. Jas. Vasumpaur for a gramophone valued at approximately $85; the Fulton Market Company for six geese for the Thanksgiving Day dinner; Mr. Jan. Svoboda, owner of the Grand Leader, for a swing for the children; Mr. Jindra's grocery store for a branch of bananas; the girls of the Carter Harrison Technical High School for assorted linen of their own making; Chas. Novak and Company for six sets of water colors and brushes. All of these generous donors have not only the board's gratitude, but also the gratitude of the inmates of the institutions who have enjoyed their donations immensely. The Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince is thankful for any and all help given to the institutions and pledges again to devote itself honestly and lovingly to the care of our destitute old people and orphans, an increasing number of whom have sent in their applications recently.</p>
   <p>We have been receiving complaints from out-of-town member organizations to the <span class="page-break">10</span>effect that they miss news and reports concerning our institutions. Since it is impossible for us to send out our reports all over America, I am requesting Bohemian Freethinking newspapers in America to publish this article. Greetings!</p>
   <p>For the Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince,</p>
   <p>Jos. Trnka, Secretary,</p>
