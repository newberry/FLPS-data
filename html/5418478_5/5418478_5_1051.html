   <p>The regular meeting of the representatives of two of our foremost charitable institutions was held last night with Mr. V. Suchy presiding.....A communication from the Association for the Maintenance of Czech Free Thought (nonsectarian) Schools was read. It came from the sponsors of the F. Drubek School and contained the request that wards of the Orphanage be permitted to visit that Czech school daily. As a result of the ensuing debate on this issue, an explanatory answer was sent to the school refusing the request on the ground that the boys are occupied by light work and home study after school hours and are now pupils of the Chicago public schools. They will, however, be sent to Czech schools on Saturdays and Sundays as in the past.</p>
