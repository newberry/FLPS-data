   <p>During the war, under the auspices of the American Red Cross, series of lectures were given throughout the United States for the purpose of training women and girls in hygiene, the nursing of sick persons, and how to give first aid to those who are hurt. Our Czechoslovak ladies and girls also organized one such detachment, and two hundred of them, under the direction of Dr. Antonin Mueller, attended the course. These detachments were not organized as temporary organizations, for they are now under the supervision of government departments, and they are required to report regularly on the activities of their members and how these members apply their knowledge in practical life.</p>
   <p>Recently, such a report on the work of the Czechoslovak detachment was sent by Dr. Mueller to Dr. H. W. Gentles, director of the Chicago branch <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the American Red Cross. The report contains some very interesting facts about how members of the detachment occasionally use their knowledge in practical life. Their knowledge of first aid was sometimes very useful and welcome. In many cases the graduates of the course could successfully attend to maternity cases when no other help was available.</p>
   <p>The report of Dr. Mueller contains many such examples, and Dr. H. W. Gentles was so pleased with the work of our ladies and girls that he sent this report as an example of the activities of the Czechoslovak ladies to Colonel Conner, one of the main office directors of the military relief of Washington, D. C. and to Dr. Peters, superior officer of other government departments, also in Washington. This recognition will be the best encouragement to our nurses in their future endeavors.</p>
