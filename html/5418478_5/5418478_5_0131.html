   <p>That the delegates to the conventions of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) are always welcome guests in Chicago was proved at Saturday's reception held at the Pilsen Park pavilion, where the 144 delegates from fourteen states were greeted by hundreds of people. Long before the program started, every seat was occupied and more and more people were still coming in. At exactly 8:30 P.M. the orchestra played the American and then the Bohemian national anthem, after which Mrs. Albina Touzimsky, chairman of the arrangement committee, greeted the delegates and expressed the hope that the results of the convention would be for the benefit not only of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, but also of our nation and our native land.</p>
   <p>The second speaker of the evening, Mrs. Marie Smrcek, chairman of the Illinois grand committee, welcomed the delegates in the name of the Illinois grand lodge <span class="page-break">2</span>and in the name of all sisters who are organized in the Jednota Ceskych Dam. She said that as a result of the convention, the now-existing friendship among the sisters will be strengthened, and she also proudly referred to the glorious past of the Jednota Ceskych Dam. The speaker firmly believes and hopes that the Jednota Ceskych Dam will soon have 25,000 members, and she urged the delegates to do their best to reach this goal.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Bohumila Ludvik, chairman of the central committee, was the third speaker of the evening. She also mentioned the fact that the Jednota Ceskych Dam could proudly boast about the results of the work which has been accomplished. The ninth convention of the Jednota Ceskych Dam again means more hard work, but it should not be forgotten that work is the best remedy and best doctor for all kinds of ailments. Therefore, the speaker urged all the sisters not to be afraid of this work, inasmuch as it is being done not only for the Bohemian people of America, but also for our dear Czechoslovak Republic. The speaker concluded her speech by saying, "Let us unite and work, and we shall be happy and prosperous."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Alzbeta Lisy, chairman of the grand committee of the Sesterska Podporujici <span class="page-break">3</span>Jednota (Sisterhood Benevolent Society) was the last speaker of the evening. In her speech she mentioned that today the eyes of the Bohemian people of America are again focused upon Chicago, and that proceedings of the convention will be followed by all of Bohemian-America. On behalf of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota, she congratulated the Jednota Ceskych Dam for the work which was accomplished and for the results achieved.</p>
   <p>All of the speakers, at the conclusion of their addresses, extended their best wishes to the convention. They all paid special attention to the honorary chairman, Sister Karolina Rychlik of Cleveland, Ohio, who was present. Following the speeches, Mrs. Albina Touzimsky, chairman of the arrangement committee, invited Mrs. Karolina Rychlik to the stage to introduce herself to the audience. But Mrs. Rychlik, because of her innate modesty, absolutely refused to do so; and although urged by the audience, she spoke only a few words from the floor and wished the convention the best of success.</p>
   <p>Then one delegate from each of the fourteen states was introduced. All of these <span class="page-break">4</span>delegates transmitted greetings from the sisters of their respective states and extended their gratitude for the enthusiastic welcome. They all paid tribute to the oldest member and founder of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, Mrs. Karolina Rychlik, and wished the best of success to the ninth convention. Then musical and vocal numbers followed, after which an informal dance took place.</p>
   <p>It was a pleasing sight to see so many ladies enjoying themselves. There were ladies whose temples are already as white as pure melted silver and who are the pillars and founders of the Jednota Ceskych Dam. Alongside of them were the graceful figures of beautiful maidens who are the new and promising boughs of this organization. And all these are firmly united by one beautiful thought--to work for the benefit of their society and for the noble aims which the organization follows.</p>
   <p>Golden Jubilee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam</p>
   <p>"Jen ve vedeni a osvete</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>sila zeny rozkvete.</p>
   <p>Jen zena duchem silna</p>

   <p>(Only in knowledge and culture</p>
   <p>Woman's might will mature.</p>
   <p>Only a woman strong in spirit and will</p>
   <p>Is fully able her duty to fulfill.)</p>
   <p>Motto of the Jednota Ceskych Dam.</p>
   <p>Fifty years of tireless, unselfish, and fruitful work dedicated exclusively to the cause of the enlightenment of our people and to humanity received recognition yesterday at the golden jubilee celebration of the Jednota Ceskych Dam. This organization during the past fifty years has developed into one of our largest and most powerful national institutions. Today the organization has 23,071 sincere and enthusiastic members, thus surpassing even the oldest Bohemian fraternal society, the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies).</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Fifty years, half of a century--how work makes the time fly! When an ordinary man reaches his fiftieth year, he is at the zenith of his creative power; he has reached the dividing line after which as a rule, his physical power and mental elasticity slowly decline. But the fiftieth anniversary of the Jednota Ceskych Dam seems to prove just the opposite. It is irrefutable proof that the Jednota Ceskych Dam was founded on an absolutely sound foundation and its continued growth is indicative of a great future. Yesterday's celebration, because of the enormous attendance and joyous mood of all those who were present, was plain proof that the farreaching roots will not permit the enormous tree to perish. The unceasing growth of new shoots and branches is proof that the tree is full of healthy and flowing sap and that it is able to live for a long, long time. And that surely is the sincere wish of every Bohemian-American, in as much as it would be not only for the benefit of our countrymen who live here, but for the benefit of our whole nation.</p>
   <p>The thought of establishing the Jednota Ceskych Dam originated on September 25, 1870, at the time of the erection of a new Bohemian hall known as Slovanska Lipa (Slavonic Linden) in Cleveland, Ohio. The idea took root and began to grow.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Several of our sincere patriots drew up plans, and soon afterward the idea was realized. In the early days progress, of course, was difficult and laborious but consequently on a firmer and more substantial basis. At that time our countrymen were not united, especially our women, because they saw no necessity for organization.</p>
   <p>It was in the year 1873 when the first ladies' society bearing the name "Libuse" was founded. The first meeting of this society was held at the home of Mr. Vaclav Rychlik, a well-known patriot in Cleveland, Ohio. His wife, Mrs. Karolina Rychlik, was one of the founders of this society. She alone lived long enough to see today's festive days, and she outlived all those other dear sisters with whom, at the time of that memorable meeting, she promised to work for the success of the newly founded society and also for the benefit of all the Bohemian people in the United States. The above named lady participated in yesterday's celebration as a delegate of the lodge Vlastenka No. 42, of which she also was a founder.</p>
   <p>During the whole course of its existence the society has lived up to the motto <span class="page-break">8</span>quoted above. Therefore, in the first place the society propagated enlightenment among its own members and also among women's circles in general. At the same time, the society strove to awaken the love for spiritual and national independence.</p>
   <p>It is still remembered in our recent struggle for independence, a great task fell upon the Jednota Ceskych Dam and that this society deserves a great deal of credit for the achievement of its aim. Members of the Jednota Ceskych Dam were ready to help on any occasion with any project for our national cause, and more enthusiastic and willing workers could not have been found. And when the goal was achieved, when the sun of liberty rose over our dear homeland, members of the Jednota Ceskych Dam did not cease working and did not take their deserved rest. They knew very well that liberty alone, although it makes a man happy, cannot feed mankind, and that further work would be necessary. Therefore, it was they who again came to the front when the questions arose of how to help the poorest of the poor and how to help our suffering countrymen beyond the ocean.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>And with same energy and devotion, the ladies of this organization are supporting the most important and most necessary part of our national life in America--our Bohemian schools. Many of our national projects would never have been accomplished, at least not so easily and successfully, if our Jednota Ceskych Dam had not taken part. Therefore, the society is not only significant as one of our most important and largest benevolent societies, but it was, it is, and it will be one of our largest national institutions whose co-operation can be counted on by any of our national, cultural, and charitable projects. In the history of Bohemian people in America, the most honorable place will be reserved for the Jednota Ceskych Dam because of its activities.</p>
   <p>As far as yesterday's golden jubilee celebration is concerned, it is necessary to mention beforehand that if the celebration was not one of the most beautiful ever held here, it surely was one of the most sincere. At some moments there was hardly a person whose eyes were not dimmed by tears of emotion. The beginning of the celebration, when the elderly Mrs. Karolina Rychlik was escorted through a lane of sisters of the various lodges while the band played the American <span class="page-break">10</span>national anthem, was in itself grand. Mrs. Karolina Rychlik was introduced by Mrs. Marie Smrcek, chairman of the grand committee of the State of Illinois. She then addressed the gathering, and in her very fine speech which was delivered in an extraordinarily resonant voice, she recollected times long past. What was most surprising was the unusual liveliness and sprightly spirit which she manifested. She at once be came the darling of all her sisters and of the entire gathering, and it can be said that almost the whole course of the ensuing program turned into enthusiastic homage to this aged but still active founder of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, who was forced to accept thanks for all those dear ones who worked with her in the organization of the society. She also encouraged her fellow sisters to further unceasing work, and in conclusion she wished the best of success to her organization.</p>
   <p>Then the most beautiful number of the program, the initiation of a newly founded jubilee lodge Klara M. Klaus, followed. Because this new lodge already has fiftyfour enthusiastic members who, as it appears, are eager to tackle the society's work, a promising future is predicted for it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>After the usual course of the initiation ceremony, Mrs. Bohumila Ludvik, chairman of the executive committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, announced that the husband of the late Mrs. Klara M. Klaus, in memory of his never-to-be-forgotten wife, donated the sum of one hundred dollars to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, one hundred dollars to the fund for the erection of a new home for the Jednota Ceskych Dam, one hundred dollars to the Children's Hospital of Prague, Czechoslovakia, one hundred dollars for the Children's Hospital of Cernovice, Czechoslovakia, and one hundred dollars to the newly organized lodge Klara M. Klaus, No. 145, of the Jednota Ceskych Dam. The same lodge received a gift of ten dollars from Mr. Emil Ruzek, fifty dollars from the Illinois grand lodge, fifty dollars from the Ohio grand lodge, and many other monetary presents from various grand lodges. Then the rest of the numbers of the program followed.</p>
   <p>With the singing of the national anthem, "Hej Slovane" (Ho, All you Slavs), this beautiful celebration came to an end. But it will be remembered for a long, long time by all those who attended.</p>
