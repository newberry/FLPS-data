   <p>Following their annual custom, our benevolent societies arranged New Year's festivals in various places on the first day of January, and everyone of them was crowned with success. The first day of the year brought infallible proof that from year to year these annual festivals enjoy more and more popularity among our people, and Saturday's entertainment again became the meeting place for not only a great number of members of the fraternal societies, but for their friends as well. Considering that these New Year's festivals are arranged mostly for purposes of propaganda and entertainment, we must admit that the efforts of our benevolent organizations were full appreciated.</p>
   <p>Festival of the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky</p>
   <p>A beautiful program was prepared for the festival of the Illinois grand lodge <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), held at the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' hall, 18th and May Streets, and this festival attracted a great number of people. Never before had the old hall been as crowded as it was on New Year's Day. The program was opened with a brilliant musical number played by the orchestra under the direction of Mr. Rudolph Rubringer. Mr. Jan Pecha then greeted the audience, and in his speech made the clever remark that Bohemian of America have, during the last few years, spent most of their energy for the cause of liberation of our old homeland. But now, when our brothers beyond the ocean are free, it is about time to remember our selves and to work in our own interest.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto T. Pergler, chairman of the Illinois grand lodge and principal speaker of the festival, talked on the theme, "The Future of Our Society," and delivered his speech in both the Bohemian and English languages. His speech was remarkable in every respect....</p>

   <p>Festival of the Jednota Ceskych Dam and the Sesterska Podporující Jednota</p>
   <p>The grand committtees of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union) and the Sesterska Podporující Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) arranged a joint festival in the Carter H. Harrison High School, 24th Street and Marshall Boulevard, and so many members of both of these societies attended this festival that there were many people who had to be turned away. Although the auditorium of Harrison High School is one of the largest on the West Side, it could not accommodate all the people who wanted to get in.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Smrcek, chairman of the grand committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, greeted the audience and paid respect to the memory of a recently departed member, Mrs. Klara Klaus. Mrs. Alzbeta Lisy addressed the audience for the grand committee of the Sesterska Podporující Jednota. Both speakers were applauded by the audience for their sincere and heartfelt speeches.....</p>

   <p>During the course of the festival, a collection for the benefit of orphans was undertaken, the proceeds of which amounted to $250. Of this amount, the sum of $150 will be sent to our old hemeland, and the remaining sum of $100 will be donated to our orphanage near the Bohemian National Cemetery--the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage. In this way entertainment was combined with useful endeavor.</p>
