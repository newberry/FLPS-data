The <span class="page-break">\8</span>party was arranged for the benefit of those poor families of Bohemians who are supported by that society and who applied for Christmas aid. Each case was conscientiously investigated by a special committee, and there were enough gifts to go around, so that everybody was satisfied. Those who do not believe in charity should have visited the party to witness the shining faces of both the old and the young; to see the poor mothers, laden with gifts, who went away filled with gratitude. They carried great baskets of food, poultry, and other edibles worth ten dollars a basket, gifts of happiness which would be indispensable on Christmas. Were it not for these gifts, the holidays would be a hollow mockery of tears and sighs. In its Friday meeting, the committee also sanctioned gifts of ready cash totaling $1,000, which were included in the Christmas baskets for those people who suffered most and who were the poorest, so that they could purchase coal or buy some underwear, shoes, and clothing for the children.</p>
   <p>Our deep gratitude is extended to the three hundred benefactors and philanthropists who responded to the touching proclamation of the Christmas gift <span class="page-break">\9</span>committee.</p>
   <p>Besides such monetary contributions, which are fully reported in another part of this annual report, the following gifts were received [by the Christmas gift committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost]: [There follows a list of contributors and their gifts.]</p>
