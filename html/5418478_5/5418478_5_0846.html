   <p>The minutes of the second meeting showed that some of the contractors doing work on the new part of the building were clamoring for their money. This made it necessary to call for the loans which had been prearranged.</p>
   <p>The first loan of six thousand dollars was arranged through the Kaspar Bank.</p>
