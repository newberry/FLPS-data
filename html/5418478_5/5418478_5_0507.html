   <p>A new Bohemian lodge, Bohemia Lodge, was admitted into the ranks of the Free Masons in a brilliant ceremony last night. The ceremony was held in Maden Temple, on Dearborn Avenue and Walton Place. There was a gigantic participation on the part of members and invited guests, of whom a large percentage are members of the Free Masons. One hundred six charter members of the new lodge were present, and the inaugural ceremony began at 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Grand Lodge of Illinois entered the hall in a body with Grand Master H. J. Burnett. The Grand Master addressed those present with enthusiastic words and left a deep impression upon the listeners. Then followed the installation of officers of the new lodge:</p>
