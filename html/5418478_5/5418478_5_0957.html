   <p>On Wednesday, March 15, a meeting of the board of delegates to the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) took place in the lower hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on 18th and May Streets. The meeting began promptly at 8 P.M. and was attended by a large number of delegates..... The secretary of the board, Mrs. Bozena Krabec, read the minutes of the previous meeting; they were unanimously approved as read.....</p>
   <p>A letter from the Sbor Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association) addressed to the Utulna A Sirotcinec was read by the secretary. The Sbor Narodniho Hrbitova wishes to know whether the board of delegates to the Utulna A Sirotcinec wishes to take part in this year's Decoration Day ceremonies. It was decided that the board would take part in these ceremonies as usual, and if the board of delegates of the Narodni Hrbitov so desires, the children of the <span class="page-break">2</span>Sirotcinec will also take part in the program. The secretary is to inform the Narodni Hrbitov by letter. A number of bills were read and approved..... Among other items, the secretary's salary was mentioned, and since Mrs. Krabec contributed her entire salary to the Utulna A Sirotcinec, it was decided that she should be rewarded for her work with a leather portfolio for her books and secretarial papers. The treasurer, Mr. Frank J. Petru reported that according to the probated will of Mr. John Staigr, deceased on January 8, 1921, a bequest of $1,000 from that source goes to the treasury of the Utulna A Sirotcinec. The said amount was actually paid to the organization a few days ago.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Trnka, secretary of the board of directors of the Utulna A Sirotcinec, read the minutes of the meeting of that body. The reading revealed the following: Mrs. Smolar, a delegate of our institution, presented a report about a complaint made against us by the Children's Benefit League, which claims that some of our ladies tagged on street corners purportedly not assigned to them. Our institution was ably defended in this matter by Mrs. Smolar, so much so that in the directors' meeting of the said league, our rights were fully recognized and <span class="page-break">3</span>the blame for the misunderstanding rests upon some minor official of the said league who assigned the same street corners to several charitable institutions. To smooth this matter out, it was decided to return two tag boxes containing $16.91, one of which is to be given to the institute for crippled children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jolly, a chartered public accountant who was present at the board of directors' meeting, explained some of the items in the annual financial report and recommended that some corrections be made in the bookkeeping of the Utulna A Sirotcinec. He particularly stressed the need for making a new inventory, so that all property, real estate, and equipment could be revaluated in accordance with current figures, for in our books these properties are listed according to old estimates, which were much lower than they are today. Such an inventory is necessary for other purposes as well, such as insurance. The inventory would cost us about $500. The entire problem will be presented at the next meeting of the board.</p>
   <p>Miss Lorenz, a registered nurse, reported on the health of our children and <span class="page-break">4</span>their needs. Our children's health is good. The nurse recommended that a Little Mothers Club be organized among our girls, and that they be instructed by a competent person about personal hygiene and how to retain good health. This recommendation will be worked out in detail with the assistance of our physicians, and the club itself will be organized as soon as possible. The Sirotcinec now has 55 boys and 36 girls; the Utulna has 18 old men and 17 old women. One of the aged men, Mr. Vimer, died during the month of February.</p>
   <p>One of the young inmates, Josef Zak, sent a letter in which he thanked us for rearing and educating him, he promised always to be an honest and upright man and to bring honor to himself and the institution which sheltered him.</p>
   <p>On February 16, an old man named Kanka was temporarily taken in among the inmates of the Utulna. This was done with the approval of the board of directors. Since his conduct has been very disorderly and he has, on one previous occasion, been excluded, it was decided that he should be removed, because by his insubordination he makes life difficult for the other inmates of the Utulna.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The manager complained about an institutional trouble of long standing, namely, the practice of bringing candy to the children without the knowledge and permission of the manager, who has repeatedly forbidden this. Another very bad custom is the gifts of cash money by the visitors. The results of both of these practices are equally vicious; the children stuff themselves with candy, get sick, and endanger their health by promiscuous munching of sweets. Our people were notified not to engage in these practices; it was forbidden by the board of directors; but all in vain. The manager was asked to take necessary measures to prevent this.</p>
   <p>The board of directors recommended the printing of the annual financial report.....</p>
   <p>During a conference held on March 10, the directors were advised by Mr. George J. Holek, an attorney for the Western State Bank, about a reserve fund. Its main features are the following: Any money, valuable papers, etc., which would be deposited in the bank for this reserve fund, are not included in the total capital of the bank, and in case of bankruptcy, could not be counted as a part <span class="page-break">6</span>of the assets of the bank; they are protected by a guarantee which is deposited with the state auditor and are discounted both by the state and the clearing-bank systems. According to Mr. Holek, it would not cost more for such an institution as ours to have the reserve fund handled by a bank than it would for us to handle it ourselves. It is probable that if we handled the fund ourselves, it would be more expensive.</p>
   <p>Drs. O. S. Pavlik and Allan J. Hruby, who attended this meeting, expressed their satisfaction with the state of health of our children and the hiring of a nurse. In regard to the matter of regular medical visits to the Utulna A Sirotcinec, it was decided that an agreement should be reached with some well-recommended physician who would call at both of our institutions regularly. The responsibility for this was assumed by Messrs. Charvat and Suchy.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the meeting of the board of directors were approved after the matter of the reserve fund was explained more fully to the board of delegates. Mr. Petru moved that the reserve fund question be submitted to our Czech bankers, <span class="page-break">7</span>who would give us their opinions. All of them will be sent registered letters in a few days. Mrs. Marek moved that the annual financial report as worked out by the certified public accountant be accepted.....The president recommended that the financial report be ordered printed and that copies of it be sent chiefly to our Bohemian societies and organizations.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Smolar reminded the delegates that on May 15 the Chicago Federation of Aged and Adult Charities, of which the Utulna A Sirotcinec is a member, will have a tag day, and the Utulna A Sirotcinec should therefore make preparations now to [reap benefits from it]. This reminder was gratefully acknowledged by the board.</p>
   <p>The income of the Utulna A Sirotcinec during the month of February was $2,178.12; its expenses amounted to $1,844.63.</p>
   <p>Since there were no other items on the program of this meeting, it was adjourned.</p>
