   <p>Recently a report has been received concerning the activities and progress of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The report covers the year 1914 and is submitted to the Bohemian public by the institution's manager, Mr. Otto F. Dusek, whom we shall let speak for himself:</p>
   <p>"....The institution's income is the best indication of its prosperity. This year our income was double that of the year preceding.....</p>
   <p>"We have made many new friends who have been thinking of us right along and donating clothes and many other articles of value.....</p>
   <p>"The Board of Directors met, since it appeared necessary, as often as two or three times a month, and held, all together, thirty-two meetings.....</p>

   <p>"The propaganda committee did a splendid piece of work also. As one illustration, they gave a concert which brought in almost three times the amount earned by a similar undertaking the year before.....</p>
   <p>"The discussions about the desirability of building a new orphanage, which began last year, resulted this year in the laying of the cornerstone of the building now in process of erection.....</p>
   <p>"Our industrial schools for boys and girls have shown fine results. The exhibition of the children's work was held October 25 and received unusual attention from our public....The net receipts from sales of exhibited articles amounted to $608.58. This has so much encouraged us that we shall begin preparations for an exhibit to be held in the latter part of 1915.....</p>
   <p>"The Juvenile Court assigned eight children to our institution last year, and we should have received more had the capacity of our orphanage been greater. Judge Merritt W. Pinckney has expressed his pleasure regarding the good <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>management of the institution in a letter in which he says that he is happy to see that a family spirit prevails there rather than the spirit of soldiers' barracks, which is frequently found in institutions of this kind. The County contributed $1,698.82 for the support of the seventeen children whom it has assigned to the orphanage."</p>
