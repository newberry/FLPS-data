   <p>The association that maintains the Czech Old People's Home is a member of the Chicago Association of Aged and Adult Charities. The Tag Day on May 14, set aside for the benefit of the latter organization, will also benefit the former. Our Czech women are making extensive arrangements for intensive activities to do their bit for the charitable purpose.</p>
