   <p>The managing committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held a meeting last Thursday in its offices located on 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Mr. A. J. Sokol presided. The purpose of this meeting was to audit the disbursements and receipts for this year. The treasurer of the ball committee, Dr. F. L. Fortelka, submitted a detailed financial report on the last ball given by the society, and turned over to the treasury the net proceeds of that entertainment, amounting to $2,303.18. The ball committee consisted of the chairman, Alois Solar; Chas. J. Novak, secretary; and Dr. F. L. Fortelka, treasurer. The efforts of the ladies' committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost were praiseworthy. These ladies took care of all the work in the kitchen. The Reverend Vaclav Vanek, who is the treasurer of the Christmas Gift Fund, reported that this fund amounts to $3,512, and that 324 individuals contributed sums ranging from $1 to $100. Those families which were in need were given Christmas baskets and ready cash in amounts ranging <span class="page-break">\2</span>from $5 to $35.</p>
   <p>After the payment of all the bills, the balance was turned over to the treasurer of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. This balance will be used for the regular fund and will go toward the support of needy families during the winter months. Mr. Anton J. Cermak is chairman of the gift committee.</p>
