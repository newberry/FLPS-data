   <p>It is remarkable how our women's organizations prosper in comparison with those composed of male membership only. The latter are having many difficulties in holding their own, while membership in women's clubs is increasing by leaps and bounds. This is due to the untiring, self-sacrificing activities of our women.</p>
   <p>This year's annual report by the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Unit of the Aid Sisterhood), the largest women's organization beside the Jednota Ceskych Dam [Czech Ladies Unit], which is the largest in the United States, was published recently. It shows that the Sisterhood has gained seven hundred new members in the last year which raises its membership to 12,238. The seventy-two groups into which the Sisterhood is divided, together <span class="page-break">\2</span>possess $107,085.95 in cash, while their Central Executive Committee possesses over $1,621.78 in its treasury. The humanitarian efforts of the Sisterhood are remarkably reflected in the sum of $2,850.19 donated for national patriotic and charitable purposes, and $2,090.11, for the support of Czech schools during the last fiscal year.</p>
