From the four submitted plans for adapting the building which the board of trustees had bought to the needs of the hospital, the meeting approved the least expensive one, requiring an expenditure of $7,500 and permitting the installation of thirty-five beds.</p>
   <p>It was decided to send out collection blanks to the various committees and ask them to start at once with the collection of money previously pledged. Of the $17,000 in pledges, the board now has $1,400 in cash. The meeting was presided over by the president, Mr. John A. Cervenka.</p>
