   <p>On Memorial Day we place fragrant flowers upon the graves of our dear ones, and in this way we honor their memory. In this great city there are hundreds and hundreds of poor wretched families who need our help. On Memorial Day our self-sacrificing women and girls will ask you for a small contribution in behalf of these unfortunates. Do not refuse them, but put a monetary gift into their collection boxes. This is a work of love and mercy. These are our people, of Bohemian blood, for whom we plead. The Chicago City Council issued a special permit for this year's tag day. It is our moral obligation to see to it that this venture is successful.</p>
