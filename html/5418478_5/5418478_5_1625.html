   <p>A new regulation was introduced in the restaurant and coffeehouse managed by Mr. Karel Psenicka, 1651 Blue Island Avenue. Under this new ruling, any guest who happens to throw a ball off the billiard table while playing a game of billiards shall pay a voluntary penalty of five cents. Every nickel collected in this manner shall be donated toward Hoover's relief fund for the benefit of children in Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>In the course of two weeks, the sum of $2.50 was collected in this manner. The above-mentioned amount was deposited in our office, and we were requested to send this, together with other contributions, to Mr. Hoover.</p>
