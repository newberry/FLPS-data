   <p>A meeting which will be memorable for the Bohemians in Chicago and perhaps in the whole United States was held last night in the pavilion of Pilsen Park at 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. The meeting was called by a group of enthusiastic, sincere, and unselfish workers united in the organization committee of the Bohemian Hospital Association of Chicago, and was attended by members of all classes of the Chicago Bohemian community.</p>
   <p>In spite of the unfavorable weather, the pavilion was crowded with our people. They did not come to be seen, but rather to offer a helping hand and pocketbook to an effort which merits our greatest consideration. They came with the conviction that they are fulfilling an obligation not only to their nation, but also to humanity in general. If the interest and enthusiasm shown is an indication of the true feelings of our Bohemians in Chicago, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>we may be assured that the undertaking which was inaugurated by the Spolek Ceskych Lekaru (Bohemian Physicians Association) will soon be realized, and that the Bohemian colony in Chicago will have its own sanitary and successful Bohemian hospital in the very near future.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Mr. Karel J. Vopicka who greeted the guests as follows:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, the purpose for which we have gathered here together today may have been conveyed to you through our newspapers. It is our endeavor to form a body which will be representative of the whole Bohemian community of Chicago, and whose duty it will be to build a Bohemian hospital. This is a beautiful, noble purpose indeed, and the fact that you have come in such large numbers is excellent proof that among us there are many good men and women with hearts of gold who bring to this undertaking not only a sober understanding but also their humane sentiments. I want to warn you now that the start will not be easy. We shall have to work hard, but the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>final victory will be that much sweeter. Chicago is a cosmopolitan city, and we know that other nationalities have succeeded in building their own hospitals here. Some of them even have two hospitals of their own. Only we Bohemians who are considered leaders among the Slavonic nations have done nothing so far in this respect. Not until now have we realized this shortcoming, but a committee on organization has already been set up, and it is working hard to accomplish this beautiful purpose for which it has collected more than $16,000 in a short time. This sum is only a start, because there are many men who have promised additional contributions. So far none of those whom we have approached has refused, and I am sure that in the future nobody will refuse. All of us are well aware of the importance of this undertaking. Since it is purely a humane project, there is no reason why anyone should be opposed to it. For the sake of the esteem and prestige which the Bohemians enjoy in this city, we must put all our energy into this work and bespeak the continued co-operation of our newspapers to whom our highest appreciation is due for the support which they have given us up to this date."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>After the applause subsided, Dr. L. Fisher addressed the gathering:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am speaking to you on behalf of the Spolek Ceskych Lekaru, and in addressing you, I do so with full recognition of the importance of this occasion in which I see the opening of a new era for the Bohemian groups in America. The road which the early Bohemians traveled was a rocky one indeed. The Bohemian nation was represented in America by a mere handful of families who endeavored through frequent contacts with one another to promote, foster, and strengthen national consciousness in their children. This was the first era, and the recent anniversary of our amateur theatricals reminded us that this national consciousness was awakened more than half a century ago.</p>
   <p>"At this time, however, our main endeavor must needs be of a different character. In these days of economic misery, the concern for the coming generation, for the aged, debilitated, and sick towers like a lighthouse over the sea of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>other obligations. We have been laying the foundations for Bohemian schools, and although they are not yet as efficient as they should be--we heard something about this a few days ago in this hall from somebody who should know--we have these schools, and we shall work for their continued improvement. Also our old men and women are taken care of: they have a home in which they can spend their declining years in peace and without worry. Today we are gathered together to solve the problem of the third principal need--the building of a Bohemian hospital in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This idea is not new. Throughout the years, various proposals have been offered and considered from time to time. But nothing came of them until the recently organized Spolek Ceskych Lekaru adopted the idea of a Bohemian hospital and appointed a committee of seven to prepare a workable plan. I am not an advocate of hero worship, but in the present case I consider it my duty here to thank these seven men for the fine work they have done. Their task is completed, and now it is up to me to issue a plea for help and cooperation on the part of our public.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"Every year the Bohemians of Chicago and surrounding rural districts spend an enormous amount of money for hospital care--in non-Bohemian hospitals--and it would be well if this money of ours could remain in Bohemian hands. The main reason why a Bohemian hospital should be built has been explained, but there are many things that must be clarified. For instance, some people think the hospital will be free and therefore a permanent burden for the public. This is not so. The hospital will be built by public contributions and ninety per cent of the rooms will be used for paying patients, only the remaining ten per cent being reserved for the poor. In this way the hospital will become self-supporting and will retain all of its earnings. At the start there will, of course, be difficulties. But these can be overcome if a sufficient fund is secured. In Chicago alone there are 100,000 Bohemians, with many more thousands in the surrounding area. The need for a Bohemian hospital is therefore urgent. For this reason it is very sad that when collections even for such a proposal as this are taken up, one overhears the word 'beggary'. Why, all we want is a Bohemian institution to which a Bohemian would go as if it were his own home; where he would find <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>a Bohemian atmosphere; and where the poor would also be well received. Where, then, is the reason for using the word 'beggary' in connection with such an institution? 'Duty' would be much more fitting. (Applause). The poor will not call it 'beggary'; they will be glad to contribute a portion of their hard-earned money. Only those who have become rich by dealing with the Bohemian people will call this proposition "beggary". It is therefore necessary to convince everybody that the hospital is really essential. The people will realize this, and they will realize that the hospital is for us and will serve us to great advantage. Let us rely on ourselves only. I am reminded of our Chapel of Gold on Vltava, our National Theater in Prague. All those who pass by this theater are filled with pride and joy over the fact that such a small nation as ours succeeded in building such a great temple of art. The contributions for it came even from the poorest people--even children emptied their little penny banks--and each stone in the structure is an evidence of the love, selflessness, and pride of these good people. May a similar enthusiasm, similar interest, and similar unselfishness awaken in us, so that our progeny will say, 'They recognized their duty <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to the public and fulfilled it in a noble way.'"</p>
   <p>When the enthusiastic applause died down, Mr. John A. Cervenka, a member of the committee of seven, took the stand. He properly and justly criticized those who complain about "beggary," and then he appealed to the merchants and other businessmen for contributions to the hospital. He pointed out that this is an institution for the benefit of the public, the same public that enables their stores and other business enterprises to prosper. Then he appealed to our well-to-do countrymen, urging them to contribute according to their means. Finally he expressed the hope that it will be possible to start the building in a year, provided that everyone will co-operate to the best of his ability.</p>
   <p>Thereafter the chairman distributed authorized collection sheets to all who asked for them. Then a collection was taken right on the premises.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Donations and pledges up to date: Bohemian Pharmacists: $1,100; Bohemian Physicians Association: $1,000; Karel J. Vopicka, Mrs. J. Storkan, Frank G. Hajicek, O. Kubin, J. A. Holpuch, J. F.

[There are many additional donations and pledges of $250, $100, $50, $25 down to $1, some pledging a yearly contribution of $25, $10, etc.]</p>
   <p>In accordance with the motion by Mr. Stepina, a number of collection subcommittees will be appointed; and in accordance with the motion of Reverend V. Vanek the assembly rose in thanks to the organizing committee. Then the bylaws were read, and Mr. Stepina's amendment to the effect that the directors receive the right to change and amend these bylaws was adopted. A nominations committee was appointed, consisting of Messrs. H. Pitte, Dr. F. Pokorny, Fr. Honsik, M. Jelinek, and Ed. J. Kvidera. This committee nominated the <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>following directors: For one year: Messrs. V. J. Klaus, St. Loula, Chas. Kallal, Dr. J. Pecival, and Dr. K. Neumann. For two years: F. Hajicek, A. Cermak, and J. J. Chvatal. For three years: J. A. Cervenka, K. J. Vopicka, J. Holpuch, Dr. O. S. Pavlik, and Dr. L. Fisher.</p>
   <p>Secretary J. J. Chvatal adjourned the meeting, and the Spolek Pro Postaveni Ceske Nemocnice V Chicagu (Bohemian Hospital Association of Chicago) was organized. A meeting of the board of directors at which permanent officers will be elected will be held next Thursday night in the offices of the Pilsen Brewery at West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue.</p>
