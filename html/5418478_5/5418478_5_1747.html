   <p>The educational and benevolent society Trhova Zahradka and Vicinity received several requests from Trhova Zahradka, Czechoslovakia, and surrounding villages for a monetary contribution to aid the Sokol which was founded recently in Trhova Zahradka, and for the benefit of school children who suffer because of inadequate school supplies. The Trhova Zahradka and Vicinity society has always been a generous contributor toward our national and charitable causes here and in our dear old native land. Therefore, the society immediately sent to the Sokol of Trhova Zahradka the sum of two thousand Czechoslovakian kronen and the same amount to the schools of Trhova Zahradka. Two thousand Czechoslovakian kronen were sent to each of the surrounding villages of Snet and Blazejovice. Because the society Trhova Zahradka would like to satisfy all the requests, we therefore beg you, our dear countrymen, to contribute monetary aid for the benefit of those little innocent children whose education has suffered because of the war, and who lack <span class="page-break">\2</span>the most important necessities for becoming the pride of our nation. The educational and benevolent society Trhova Zahradka and Vicinity is extending its thanks in advance for every donation for the benefit of those poor little children. Every donation will be published in our newspapers and letters of thanks will be shown to everybody upon request. Donations may be deposited with any of the following officers of the society or at the meeting every second Tuesday of the month at Vojta Naprstek school, Homan Avenue and 26th Street.</p>
