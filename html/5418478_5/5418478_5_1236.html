   <p>Those compassionate countrymen of ours who did not forget the terrible accident which befell the family of Mrs. Amalie Hladik, 1651 Throop Street, remembered that family again on Thanksgiving day with a collection for the benefit of the orphaned children of Hladik. Their father was recently killed by an automobile. [The amount collected was $16.10. Names of contributors are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hladik expresses her gratitude to all these generous people in the name of her children.</p>
