   <p>The Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital Association) held a meeting yesterday in which donations totaling $598.45 were reported. Various items of current business were taken up, among which was the question of the proposed directory of Bohemians in America. A proposal by Mr. R. J. Psenka was read, stating that the purpose of the directory should be to fill the long-felt need of Bohemian business people and Bohemian organizations in America, and to make some money for the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice by turning over to it all fees paid for the insertion of names and advertisements. The proposed fees are as follows: For the name and address of an individual, one dollar; name and address with his telephone number and occupation, two dollars; name and address of a business or corporation, two dollars; same with telephone number, three dollars; a one-inch advertisement, five dollars. The proposed number of directories to be printed is ten thousand copies, which will be sold <span class="page-break">\2</span>for fifteen to twenty-five cents. The directory would contain, as an introduction, a short historical review and statistical data concerning Bohemians in America, and possibly a few illustrations and photographs; also a plan of the city of Chicago. The proposal was referred to the specially appointed committee on the directory for study and report at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka's proposal to prepare an issue of stamps to be sold for the benefit of the Nemocnice was referred to the same committee.</p>
