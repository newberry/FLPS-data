   <p>In reference to Article VI, wherein it is stated that it shall be the duty of the Alliance and of every member to help and support in every legal manner, either by court or proper political influence, either at the ballot box or in other ways, any member of this Alliance whose just rights and advantages may be endangered, it was requested by individual members that the said article be adopted with the exception that the part which calls for support at the ballot box be omitted. The article was corrected in that sense.</p>
   <p>In Article IV are specified the per capita dues which the member organizations of the Alliance are required to pay. Also they are required to pay on a per-centage basis toward the defrayal of the Alliance's expenses if the annual dues are not sufficient. This article was adopted after a debate during which opinions were exchanged as to what was really meant. Also under discussion was a motion that each society should keep a register of those who do not want to pay their dues, in order to prevent these persons from going from one society to another. It was decided to amend Article VI by the supplement: "Societies represented in the Alliance are requested to exchange journals so that each will have a list of expelled members."</p>

   <p>The next subject under discussion was the number of copies of the amendment which should be printed. It was decided to have two thousand copies printed in order that each society might be supplied with enough to meet the needs of its membership. Chairman Fiedler brought the meeting to a close.</p>
