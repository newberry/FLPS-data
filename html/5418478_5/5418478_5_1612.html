   <p>A friendly entertainment arranged to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Frantisek Dvorak and held at Mr. Basta's hall, 3042 West 26th Street, last Saturday night was well attended by many friends of the celebrants. In the group was a well-known patriot, Mr. Anton Petrzelka, carpenter and contractor, who, in the course of the entertainment, moved to arrange a collection for the benefit of children in Czechoslovakia. Everybody agreed. Therefore, a collection was immediately undertaken, and the sum of twenty-two dollars was collected.</p>
   <p>Mr. Basta, the proprietor of the hall, added three dollars to this sum,so that the total proceeds from the collection amounted to twenty-five dollars. Mr. Jan Vilimek deposited this sum in our office. We hope that this exemplary and generous deed will be duplicated by our countrymen on similar occasions.</p>
