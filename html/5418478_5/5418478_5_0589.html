   <p>It has been a long time since the Bohemian-American Liberal School Hall entertained so large a gathering of the public as that of last night upon the occasion of the twenty-five year jubilee of Jed. Ces. Dam. The attendance was enormous, every seat was filled, it was almost impossible to move in the main hall and the gallery was packed. It is first of all necessary to preface a few words as to the origin of this so successful union.</p>
   <p>This union was organized in Cleveland, on the 25th of September, 1870 at the summons of Mrs. Kar. Rychlik and Fr. Frankore. The first lodge was founded and carried the name of the celebrated Bohemian princess, Libuse. Eight years later a second lodge was organized under the name Ladislava lodge No. 2. These two lodges were then united to form the Jed. Ces. Dam. After that, there was organized rapidly lodge after lodge until now the union numbers 122 lodges, <span class="page-break">2</span>in which there are 12,000 members, certainly an imposing figure. The organization is, so far as Bohemian women are concerned, that largest in America, yes, even in Bohemia they can not boast of such an organization.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's program was distinctively selected and carries out excellently.</p>
   <p>It is self-evident, that the overwhelming majority of those in attendence were women, which is not strange, for it was their celebration.</p>
