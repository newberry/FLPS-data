   <p>I will always remember the day of September 30, 1922, for on that day President Vojtech Suchy started me out as manager of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). It is not my intention at this time to describe the emotions which filled my heart on that memorable day; I shall say briefly that never before have I had such an experience. Mr. Suchy, after calling the entire personnel to his office, sincerely thanked the retiring manager, Mr. A. Smith, for his unselfish and hard work,....taking this opportunity also to thank the entire personnel of the institution. Having received the keys from the former manager, Mr. Suchy then turned to me and in a few well-chosen words outlined my duties, indicated what the Czech people expect of me, and stressed the requirements made by the board of directors. Then, having handed the keys to me, he said, "Mr. Patak, accept these keys as a symbol of opening your heart for the good of all [the inmates] of our institution; and of giving all your energies so that our poor orphans may be developed into self-respecting citizens and thus bring honor to this institution. Attend to the aged and the young with like respect....."</p>
   <p>One could hear his own heart beat in the silence that followed.....Taking the keys, I promised that I would attend to my duties, I pledged my love for the old and the young. I bade adieu to the retiring manager; I shook the hand of every member of the personnel, asking everyone to stand by me in this great and ennobling work. I explained to all of them what our duties were to be.....and having received the assurances of everyone as to the teamwork which now awaited us, I felt inspired to go on with the work.....</p>
   <p>Shortly thereafter my work actually began.....Of course conditions are not as everybody would like them to be, but the inmates of this institution feel at home; they feel that they are among their own; in short they are happy. I do not wish to describe every phase of our life here in great detail, and will content myself merely by saying that we all get along very well, that we help one another, that we try to accede to the wishes of one another, and though many of us hail from different parts of the country, we do feel as though we were one family.</p>
   <p>The visit of Mr. Kotal, the Bohemian globe-trotter, was hailed with much enthusiasm. He was greeted by Mr. Suchy and Mr. Smith, and after spending some moments in my office, his arrival was announced to the inmates by our trumpeter. This gave everyone an opportunity to see and meet this intrepid traveler. Mr. Kotal then addressed the inmates and shook hands with everyone. After an inspection of the premises, he said: "I admire greatly the spirit of sacrifice in our countrymen. [The Utulna....] is a veritable monument to brotherly love." Nor did he forget the little pleasures of our inmates; he brought some delicacies which were greatly enjoyed by every one of them. [I take this opportunity] to thank him.</p>
   <p>Sunday, a regular visiting day in our institution, turned out to be a busy one, and the time passed rapidly; before we knew it, evening was at hand, and we retired with the felling that we are not forgotten by our friends.</p>
   <p>Judging by the number of gifts made to us, the Utulna has a great many friends indeed. Thanks are especially due to the following generous people: Mr. Frank Panuska, 3414 West 26th Street, who brought two hundred pounds of freshly caught fish which provided a tasty meal for all the inmates; Mrs. V. Jelinek, 2610 South Millard Avenue, who made us a gift of various articles of clothing; Mrs. Marie Linhart, 2159 West 21st Street, made us a gift of assorted articles of clothing; the Klub Ceskych Obcanek 34 Wardy (Bohemian Women's Club of the 34th Ward) which collected $35.13 for our benefit at a surprise party given for Alderman John Toman. We also extend our thanks for the gifts of money received. [Names of cash donors are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>[All of the above gifts were made] during the period of September 22 to October 6, 1922.] Before finishing this report let me add that while examining the books of the Utulna, I came across the names of some of our countrymen who do not pay their [pledged] contributions and who could so easily pay the amounts they owe us. My heart ached when I noticed these delinquent accounts. I shall inform everyone who failed to make a payment how much money is due us by him, and I sincerely hope that everyone receiving such a notice from me will discharge his duty in the same manner as our institution does by taking good care of those unfortunates who were sent to us.</p>
   
   <p>The inmates presented a beautiful bouquet to the retiring manager, Mr. Smith, thus showing how much they respected him. Both the old and the young are looking forward to the innovations which I promised them and which rightfully are due them. I am quite certain that the entire Czech public will work hand in glove with me, thus making our life here as pleasant as possible. One of our young inmates died,and was buried on Monday, October 2, 1922. She was little Marie Vana, a sweet and darling child who gained the love of everyone in the institution. Her demise is borne with sorrow by all of us. Requiescat in pace!</p>
   <p>Again I wish to express my gratitude to all in the name of the institution, and remain</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Jan Patak, manager.</p>
