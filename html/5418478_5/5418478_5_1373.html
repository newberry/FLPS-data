   <p>Below are the names of contributors and amounts of contributions made by them in behalf of the destitute Bohemian families who suffered loss because of the Fisk Street conflagration. The ladies who undertook the collection on behalf of these families....found an able assistant in the person of Mrs. Marie Kasak, 1827 Fisk Street, who collected $120.51. This amount was deposited with us for the benefit of the stricken families of Mrs. Helen Petrovec, Mrs. Rosie Kopejtka, and Mrs. Kate Slavsky. [Translator's note: Here follow the names of contributors and the amounts contributed. The list is half a column long and is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Whoever desires to make further contributions to this cause may send them to Mrs. Anna Kinter or Mrs. Anna Ginner, 1828 Fisk Street.</p>
