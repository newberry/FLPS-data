   <p>Important changes will take place in the composition of the board of trustees of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) after the recommendations of the present board are approved by a special plenary meeting called for this purpose. We do not doubt that these changes will prove of benefit to the hospital.</p>
   <p>According to these recommendations the bylaws would be changed to provide for twenty-one members of the board of trustees, which means six new members, three laymen and three women physicians. The board recommends this change because the co-operation of women physicians with the men appears most desirable.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting was called for the purpose of deciding whether it is desirable to call a plenary meeting of the Hospital Association. Eleven out of fifteen directors were present. Three of the absent directors sent their regrets and the fourth sent in his resignation.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka presided. A motion was carried to call a plenary meeting of the Association for May 29. The decision as to where this meeting is to be held was referred to a committee which will announce the place as soon as it is agreed upon.</p>
   <p>In addition to the proposed change in the board of trustees other proposals will be made. One of them is to establish life membership in the Hospital Association. Every person making a payment of one hundred dollars, divided into four yearly payments or paid in one lump sum, would become a life member.</p>
   <p>The board discussed thoroughly the method of issuing memberhsip cards. It also decided that there should be more than one class of membership. But these decisions are not definite, since all of them will be brought up for discussion at the coming plenary meeting, where they will be definitly disposed of by the vote of the whole membership.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian women physicians will be invited to this plenary meeting in the hope that a situation will develop which will induce them to offer their co-operation. This would awaken interest among circles of our people which heretofore have not even been touched.</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto J. Kubin, a member of the board of trustees, sent in a letter which was read at yesterday's meeting and in which a check for $1,500 was enclosed. The letter explained that $500 pays the obligation of the Atlas Brewing Company, $500 is Mr. Charles J. Vopicka's obligation, and $500 is Mr. Otto J. Kubin's own contribution.</p>
   <p>At the same time Mr. Otto J. Kubin sent in his resignation as a member of the board of trustees, giving as his reason the fact that his business does not permit him to devote his time to anything else. His resignation was accepted, and his place will be filled at the coming plenary meeting.</p>
   <p>The total contributions at this meeting amounted to $1,774.</p>
   <p>Summing up all that has been said, it would appear that the plenary meeting which is called for May 29 will be an important one. All members of the Hospital Association will receive invitations from the secretary, and none should be absent from this meeting.</p>
