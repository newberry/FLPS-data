   <p>We have been informed from the office of the Bohemian Charitable Association that many young people are applying for work. The officers of the Association, Mr. John Docekal, and Mr. J. Hladky, are endeavoring in every way possible, but still are unable to secure work for everybody. Therefore, in the name of the Bohemian Charitable Association, and of the people seeking work, we take the liberty of appealing to the Bohemian public, especially the business men, and factory owners, not to hesitate to notify the office at 1436 West 18th Street, if they can offer someone employment.</p>
   <p>Knowing the willingness and generosity of the Bohemian public toward the Bohemian Charitable Association, we expect that it will take cognizance of this appeal, and see to it that people, who are looking for work and want to work, do not remain idle.</p>
