   <p>The question of building an addition to the building which was purchased for a hospital, was discussed in a special meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital), which was presided over by Mr. John A. Cervenka. The question of opening the hospital also came up. Many members of the board were in favor of starting at once, or as soon as possible; others were seriously opposed because of present conditions, and recommended a delay.</p>
