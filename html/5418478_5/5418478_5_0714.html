   <p>There is no doubt that one of the most beautiful and noble projects ever attempted by our Bohemian-American metropolis is the building of a Bohemian hospital.</p>
   <p>There are times in the lives of thousands of our countrymen when they get hurt or ill and are obliged to seek treatment in a hospital. As it is today, they must look for help in hospitals which are not Bohemian, if they are not forced by circumstances to apply for admission into such public institutions as the County Hospital, where they hardly can expect the kind care which is the principal ally of a physician. Those things which a seriously ill person needs most--a kind word in his mother tongue, encouragement, and sympathy--are not given to our patients in a non-Bohemian hospital. There are hundreds of our countrymen who do not speak English and who tell of most bitter experiences encountered in hospitals where they are unable to ask for and get even the simplest care, and where they are often exposed to abuse.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is, therefore, quite natural that since the time our Bohemian colony in this city came to the realization of its national and humane duties, it has been considering means to remedy this sad situation and provide a place where Bohemian patients would be cared for by Bohemian physicians and nurses, where they would not be hearing anything else but a language to which they are accustomed, where they could give vent to their pains, suffering, and sorrows in their own mother tongue.</p>
   <p>It is really strange that Bohemian Chicago, this huge and well-to-do community which built the Utulna (Old People's Home) for its infirm old men and women, its Sirotcinec (Orphanage) for its homeless children, a place where the religious erect monumental churches, the Freethinkers provide buildings for their social organizations, where the Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Charitable Association) and other organizations with noble purposes prosper, where we are proud of our most beautiful cemetery--this Bohemian Chicago, generally admired and justly recognized as the metropolis of Bohemian America--has not yet succeeded in providing an institution where those of us who are ill and therefore the first to be <span class="page-break">3</span>entitled to a helping hand, could go and be sure of the best of care by our own countrymen.</p>
   <p>There were many obstacles to be overcome--greater and more serious ones than in any other of our humane enterprises, but it is not the purpose of this article to talk about them.....</p>
   <p>The larger the obstacles the more improbable the realization of the aim appeared; but all the more welcome, to all good Bohemians, will be the news that these obstacles have been removed and overcome, and that the dream of Bohemian Chicago--nay, of Bohemian America--the dream of having its own hospital, is no longer a dream, but a reality.</p>
   <p>It is generally known that the question of the hospital was taken up by an organization started by Bohemian physicians and composed of men who are prominent in medical, business, and political life. Their seriousness of purpose, their enthusiasm, and their energy found full response in the Bohemian <span class="page-break">4</span>public, which answered their call for contributions for the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) with unprecedented generosity.</p>
   <p>After a series of meetings which succeeded in stirring up interest and popularizing the idea in the widest circles of the Bohemian public, there came a period of comparative tranquility, or at least, so it seemed. The dull reports of the meetings did not appear to furnish grounds for the hope that the idea of a Bohemian hospital would be realized in the near future.</p>
   <p>But, in the meantime, the work of the various committees was progressing, and our public was suddenly presented with the good news that we have the hospital, or at least shall have it in a comparatively short time if the Bohemian people of the city will recognize their duty and give their material support to the enterprise with as great enthusiasm as they showed when the idea was first launched.</p>
   <p>The organization has had the rare opportunity to acquire a large piece of ground <span class="page-break">5</span>for the hospital with a fine stone residence, in a place easily accessible from all Bohemian districts and facing a park. The building is located at 1424 South Albany Avenue. Its interior, including large rooms, wide halls, and a spacious stairway, is particularly suitable for adaptation to the purpose for which it was bought. The building stands on a large lot, and with the adjacent corner lot which was bought with it, the acquired property has an area of 187 by 170 feet. The building has many rooms, all of which can well be used as sick rooms. All that is necessary is the building of an addition which would house operating rooms, with the required side rooms and working spaces. Such an addition is shown in the drawing made for the organization by Mr Rusy, who has been acting as a counsel in architectural matters.</p>
   <p>Including the addition, the hospital will have a capacity of about fifty beds. Considering that under other circumstances the realization of a similar project would require at least one hundred thousand dollars, and that the expenditure connected with the purchase of the real estate and the building of the addition <span class="page-break">6</span>will not amount to more than fifty thousand dollars, our unbiased judgment must be that through the acquisition of the above-mentioned property, the most difficult part of the problem has been successfully solved. Even so, we disregard the fact that there is a good deal of free space fully paid for and available for enlargements in the future.</p>
   <p>The favorable location in Douglas Park--three minutes for the Havlicek Monument--in a quiet, clean neighborhood, in an atmosphere free of dust and odors, gives the property an added value. It is just two blocks from the Twelfth Street car, two blocks from the Kedzie Avenue and 16th Street cars, two blocks from Ogden Avenue, and a leisurely five-minute walk for the Elevated station.</p>
   <p>The official permission for the establishment of the hospital was secured a long time ago, and thus we, the American Bohemians, can have our own hospital ready to receive its first patients very soon--perhaps even in six months.</p>
   <p>It should not be necessary to doubt that the Bohemian public will recognize <span class="page-break">7</span>and appreciate the seriousness of the step made by the hospital organization in buying the property and will support it in accomplishing a thing which by now has become nothing more nor less than a matter of prestige for Chicago Bohemians. It is particularly up to those of our well-to-do people who have so far been sceptical and have withheld their subscriptions. Now is the time for them to do their duty, when the hospital has moved from the realm of dreams into the realm of reality. Furthermore, it is necessary that those who have made pledges should honor them with ready cash at an early date. When the well-to-do part of our public does its duty with regard to this important Bohemian undertaking, the masses of the people who are so ready in their enthusiasm for anything that is good and noble, and who have made so many important undertakings possible in the past and thereby have earned the admiration of non-Bohemian citizens of America and their own brothers and sisters in the old country, will do all that is in their power to make sure that the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice may not only start its work in the near future, but also receive a strong financial foundation that will enable it to grow in years to come and become a blessing to all those among us who suffer and need care.....</p>
