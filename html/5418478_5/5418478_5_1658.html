   <p>That our countryman, Mr. Joseph Dusek, who is one of the mainstays of the well-known commission house of Joseph Dusek and Company, 726 West Randolph Street, is a good hearted man has been a known fact to us for a long time. He demonstrated his generosity quite often, but always in such way that very little was known about it. He never advertised his good deeds, and if they are publicly announced, it is always by accident. Such an accident, occurred yesterday when the American newspapers reported that Mr. Joseph Dusek and his company donated a large supply of Christmas trees to the poor people of Chicago. Mr. Russel J. Pool, secretary and Mr. Max Adamowski, chairman of the Chicago Council's committee to investigate the high cost of living, took care of the distribution.</p>
   <p>We ourselves have found out that Mr. Joseph Dusek, as usual, did not forget our Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, but contributed $150 for the benefit of this institution as his and his wife's Christmas present.</p>
