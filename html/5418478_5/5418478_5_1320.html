   <p>We reported this case last week. The proceeds of the collection was the sum of $39.05....Mrs. Amalie Hladik takes this opportunity to thank, in her own name and the names of her children, Mrs. Antonie Dvorak, Mrs. Marie Klimek, Mr. Josef Hrbek, and the Misses Kautsky, all of whom took upon themselves the responsibility of caring for her family during the sad plight in which they found themselves, and who have endeavored to lighten their burden. She also wishes to thank all those who so generously have contributed to the collections. Also, she is very grateful to all the people who attended the funeral of her husband.....</p>
