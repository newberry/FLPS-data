   <p>The resolutions committee presented the following resolutions, everyone of which was unanimously approved:</p>
   <p>We hereby present to all sisters of the Jednota Ceskych Dam a resolution approved by the delegates to the ninth convention of the Jednota Ceskych Dam:</p>
   <p>Recognizing the absolute necessity of a strong free thought organization in this country, we recommend that our sisters join the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) in a body. Let us help to organize it, let us show the world that we are able not only to sustain but also to preserve our Free Thought organization. In unity there is strength and power.</p>
   <p>The resolution committee, recognizing the work accomplished by our sokol <span class="page-break">\7</span>organizations either for our new country, the United States, or our old country, Czechoslovakia, recommends that our sisters and mothers bring up their children in the sokol spirit, because only in a sound body can there be a sound mind.</p>
   <p>Another resolution approves the beneficent activity of the American Red Cross and ardently recommends to all the sisters that they become members of this organization and pay one dollar a year.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik, mentioned that it would be only proper to give some kind of a compensation to the sister secretary and financial secretary for the use of their homes as offices. Both of these must employ part of their homes to store away the society's documents and office supplies. It was resolved that each of them shall receive the sum of two dollars and fifty cents a month as a rental fee.</p>
   <p>The resolutions committee presented a motion that a special organizational <span class="page-break">\8</span>fund be established which would be used for organization and other purposes directed toward the progress and growth of the group. It was also mentioned that this fund could be used for the purpose of founding and establishing new lodges of the Jednota Ceskych Dam in the old country if there is such a possibility. For that purpose, one death assessment would be levied once a year on the anniversary jubilee day of the Jednota Ceskych Dam.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik, then gave a detailed explanation of this matter and said that in contacts with our old homeland, only moral invigoration is being sought, and that the establishment of lodges in Czechoslovakia is not considered. Most of the delegates agreed with this proposal, and after a brief debate, the motion was approved. The fund will be known as the Rychlik Jubilee Organization Fund. The fund will be taken care of by a special committee consisting of three members, but all the organization activity will be controlled by the central committee. The special committee will be composed of Sisters Karolina Rychlik, Zeman, and Ruzicka.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>After this important question was settled, various matters were debated. Finally the jubilee arrangement committee was called in to witness the pleasant surprise that had been prepared for them. This arrangement committee consisted of Sisters A. Touzimsky, B. Frana, V. Vlcek, A. B. Churan, and A. Klicka, whose efforts the delegates rewarded with beautiful gifts as a remembrance of the ninth convention. The committee was introduced by Sister Smrcek, and the chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik, then acknowledged and thanked them for their tireless efforts. Sister A. Touzimsky responded for the committee. The session continued until 1 P. M. when the delegates went out for lunch. In the afternoon session the convention was formally adjourned. The chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik, cordially thanked the delegates for their sincere efforts and harmonious work which characterized all the proceedings of the convention. Recognition was also manifested for the chairman and other officers of the convention, and a wish that success may follow the new central committee throughout its six-year term of office was expressed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Thus ended the significant convention of our largest sisterly organization, a convention which became one of the most important conventions in all its history, because it was combined with the celebration of fifty years of prolific national and humanitarian activity which has made the Jednota Ceskych Dam one of the principal factors in our national life in the United States.</p>
