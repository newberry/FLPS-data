   <p>The brotherhood C. S. P. S. [Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society)] will hold a meeting for all members this month. All indications show that this will be the largest gathering ever assembled by that oldest and most powerful of our brotherhoods in the United States. Many circumstances contribute to its importance; first of all the advent of the war, which automatically influences the condition of our societies, particularly those whose membership is composed of immigrants exclusively.</p>
   <p>One of the foremost questions to be discussed in the sessions is the merging of all brotherhoods into one large organization. According to opinions uttered in those circles, the unification is almost certain to be accomplished. The Organ Bratrstva (Organ of the Brotherhood) publishes suggestions for certain important changes, all of which tend to strengthen the C. S. P. S.</p>
   <p>The meetings will be held in the Pilsen Sokol Hall, the first being scheduled <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for August 26, and the last for August 31. All states with a C. S. P. S. lodge will be represented. Illinois delegates will be about twenty-five in number.</p>
   <p>Brother J. V. Lunak, secretary of the main lodge of the C. S. P. S., advocates, in the Organ, the creation of a special emergency fund, which should prove to be a boon for other lodges also, as it would avert the necessity of special assessments which are mostly, though unjustly, opposed by members. Dr. Lunak says about this matter:</p>
   <p>"The laws prescribe that enough should be collected for payment in case of death, and also for the creation of an emergency fund, an auxiliary fund to be used in case of an abnormal death rate. To this end an extra collection is to be made, not exceeding four per cent of the total amount paid out in death benefits during one year. The C. S. P. S. has been collecting only money absolutely needed for the payment of death benefits, and no reserve was accumulated. Consequently, when the death rate was higher than anticipated, there was a shortage <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the fund for death benefits. This predicament can be overcome only by special assessments or by increasing the present dues by ten per cent. The National Fraternal Congress has issued a chart of payment, providing for an additional payment amounting to four per cent, by which a deficit can be covered. The law demands such an emergency fund, and it should be started by members who have never paid more than was just necessary to secure their death benefit."</p>
   <p>The Sokol Slavsky is strongly advocating the erection of the new building for the Czech-English Free Thought School on 18th Street, and assures the enterprise of its full moral and financial support. As we reported before, the board of directors of the School encourages the idea, which has already won favor with the Grand Lodge of the C. S. P. S.</p>
