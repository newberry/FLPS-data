   <p>........There will be several independent committees working in the Chicago area; each of these will be responsible for its specific Czech neighborhood. The Czech neighborhoods in which these committees will work are as follows:</p>
   <p>The largest one comprises the Bohemian California and Lawndale districts, bounded by Western Avenue on the east, 48th Avenue on the west, the drainage canal on the south, and by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad on the north. This large Czech neighborhood already has a working committee which was organized on November 8, at a meeting held in the Sokol Chicago Hall on that day.....Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, 2438 South Lawndale Avenue, was chosen as chairman of this committee; Mrs. Marie Nedved, 2520 South Crawford Avenue, was chosen vice-chairman; Mrs. Vaclav Jedlicka, 2313 South Millard Avenue, was made secretary; Mr. Jan Podmajersky, 4308 West 26th Street was made treasurer.</p>
   
   <p>The entire section of Chicago described above will be subdivided into precincts, exactly as it is done in political matters; each precinct is to be "covered" by a collector. The collectors will be assigned to their precincts at the next committee meeting which is to be held next Wednesday, November 15. Every new worker is welcome. Make your application with the above-named officers, or in the office of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America), 3734 West 26th Street, Chicago. The office is open daily until 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>In the Cicero and Berwyn district there was a meeting in the Sokol Karel Jonas Hall, on Friday, November 10, for the purpose of organizing a committee which will be charged with the responsibility of making the largest possible collection for the benefit of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires' fund for invalids, widows, and orphans living in America. The meeting was opened by Mr. J. Placek, who outlined our responsibilities to the invalid Legionnaires, and the widows and orphans of fallen Legionnaires. The following were then chosen as officers of the committee: Mr. Vaclavkozojed, 2419 South 61st Avenue, president; the vice-president for the eastern part of the Cicero-Berwyn area will be Mrs. Marie Proks, 5411 West 24th Street, Cicero; the vice-president for the western part of the same area will be Mrs. Katerina Hynous, 2241 Austin Boulevard; the secretary will be Mrs. Klaudie John, 5510 West 25th Street, Cicero, Illinois; the treasurer will be Mr. Frantisek Cuchna, 2109 South 60th Court, Cicero, Illinois. These officers are to make assignments for the work to be done in the area, and are to obtain more volunteers to make the collection. A special publicity committee was also organized as follows: Mrs. Katerina Hynous and Mrs. Karla Pouba, both of 5729 West 23rd Place, Mrs. Barbora Prokopec, 2229 South 60th Court; Mrs. Marie Kral, 1643 Austin Boulevard; Mrs. Anna Hanus, 2317 South 61st Avenue; and Mrs. Marie Radvanovsky, 5323 West 25th Place. There can be no doubt that this publicity committee is going to do fine work, for its members are, for the most part, well-known club workers. But any volunteer workers may communicate directly with the above officers.</p>
   <p>The committee will hold its regular meetings every Thursday in the Sokol Karel Jonas Hall. It is generally accepted that both Cicero and Berwyn will occupy a significant place in the present campaign, judging by the work these two communities have performed during the struggle for the liberation of Czechoslovakia.</p>
