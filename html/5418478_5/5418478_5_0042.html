   <p>The members of the Sdružení Ceských Katolických Lesníku (Order of Bohemian Catholic Foresters) are urged to work diligently to make their forthcoming social entertainment a financial success, for the larger the attendance at this entertainment, the greater the proceeds from it. One half of the money will go toward the upkeep of the Utulna Svateho Benedikta (St. Benedict's Home for the Aged), and our joy will be twofold: First, because of a successfully arranged evening's entertainment; second, because we shall be able to help our old men and women who were not so fortunate as to be able to live the rest of their lives in the intimacy of their own family circles.</p>
