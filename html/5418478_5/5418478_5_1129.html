   <p>A meeting of the directors of Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Old People's Home and Orphanage) was held yesterday at the C. S. P. S. Hall. The chairman opened the meeting at 8 P.M. The secretary read the minutes of the previous meeting. The committee from the Grand Lodge of Ceske Vlastenky (Bohemian Patriotic Ladies) announced that Magdelena Fenik was duly elected as representative of the Grand Lodge, and, that Lodge Karolina Svetla, No. 36, recently admitted, requests an explanation about a donation by this lodge in the amount of five dollars, which to this date is not accounted for. The secretary was instructed to make an investigation of this account as requested. Lodge Svatopluk, No. 1108, R. Knights and Ladies of Honor, announced that Mr. Henry Bafka was their newly elected representative. Mr. John Wagoun brought in the monthly dues from the violin school. He brought in one dollar for the month of March. Mrs. Ruzicka, who represents the Chicagska Jednota Ceskych Dam (Chicago Bohemian Ladies' Unity) made its quarterly payment of twenty-five dollars. Then Mr. J. Philip presented a bill of two hundred dollars for the hauling of cinders to level the grounds of the Orphanage.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Wm. M. Kisling presented a bill for repairing the roof of the Orphanage building. This bill, which amounted to ninety dollars, was ordered paid. One of the directors was aroused about this matter, and stated that this work was not done by Bohemians, but after he was informed that a Bohemian firm estimated $140 more for the same kind of repair, it was ordered paid. The managing committee reported that "Grandma" Kokov, who has been in the Old People's Home nearly eleven months, and who donated fifty dollars to the Home for her cure, has now left the institution. Upon the recommendation of the committee the sum of twenty-five dollars will be refunded to her. A club by the name Klub Debatujicich Dobraku (Club of the Goodhearted Debaters) sent eight dollars to the office of this newspaper for the Orphanage. Another donation in the amount of $4.50 was brought in by Mrs. Matous; the money was collected at a social affair held at her home recently. While we are mentioning names of donors the following may also be given a place: Mr. J. Suchoman, 2931 North 42nd Court, $2.60; Mrs. Anna Stroll, 1060 South Troy Street, $4.20. Several other donations were received from persons who wished their names withheld. The housekeeper of the Orphanage made her monthly report, which was accepted. Mr. Joseph Smid, a carpenter contractor, presented an estimate of $216 for a new floor in the dancing room, and the managing committee was instructed to accept this bid. The chairman recommended that some kind of system be installed for bookkeeping, so that, if the State Auditor should audit the books, he would find them in the best of condition. Mrs. Bezner volunteered to prepare the system of bookkeeping and the chairman thanked her for volunteering to do this for the institution. Mr. John Pecha, chairman of the Bohemian National Cemetary Association, requested the newspaper reporter to announce through the press at this time that not all the raffle tickets for a lot to be raffled off are sold, and that as soon as they are the raffle will take place; and that the winner's name will be announced. The bond of Mr. Bolek as vice-chairman was accepted and the new officer was immediately installed. The chairman regretted the necessity of remarking that a number of gossipers are contending that the institutions are not "on the level"; this is detrimental to the Old People's Home and to the Orphanage. In resenting the slur the chairman stated that all the directors, representatives, delegates and committees are rendering their services absolutely free of charge, and hence that abuse is out of the question. There are some scoundrels who have nothing else to do and are always ready to tell lies about those who are always willing to do charitable work. These persons will be stopped in due time, even by punishment if necessary.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the roof be repaired. The receipts were $213.39 and expenditures were $384. The meeting then adjourned, a few minutes before 11 P.M.</p>
