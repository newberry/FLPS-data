   <p>Many years ago the Sbor pro Postaveni Cesko-Americke Nemocnice (Committee for the Erection of the Bohemian-American Hospital) bought a building known as 1424 South Albany Avenue for hospital purposes. This building would have been equipped as a hospital a long time ago, had it not been for unexpected obstructions--primarily the World War. The World War induced us to turn our minds to more important and serious action, and therefore the program for the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice was naturally less intensively followed up, although the committee met quite regularly. When the World War ended, when the liberation of our old homeland was realized, when the most important work of American Czechoslovaks had been accomplished, then the committee commenced to meet regularly again.</p>
   <p>In the course of time the committee became convinced that the building was not suitable for hospital purposes. Therefore they were delighted when it became known that the real-estate firm of Cermak and Serhant had a certain buyer on hand who was interested in the above-mentioned structure. Since that time the <span class="page-break">2</span>disposal of the building has been seriously considered. Inasmuch as the building is leased to the Illinois Sportmen's Club, which also has an option on it, it was necessary to notify the club about the contemplated sale and advise it that in case it wished to purchase the building, it must do so before July 15. If, in the meantime, the club decides not to buy the building, it will be sold to the real-estate firm for the sum of $27,000. Such an agreement was made at the last meeting of the Sbor pro Postaveni Cesko-Americke Nemocnice, at the offices of the Pilsen Brewing Company. The meeting was presided over by Mr. John A. Cervenka, and the agreement was signed by all the attending members of the committee.</p>
