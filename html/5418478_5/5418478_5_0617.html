   <p>The fourth day's session of the C.S.P.S. convention was notable chiefly for the setting up of benefits to members in the event of death of their wives.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon session there developed a furious debate in reference to benefits to members whose wives pass away. Amendments proposed by individual lodges were referred to special committees for consideration. Majority and minority reports were given but neither was approved. Then there was a lengthy discussion as to whether or not a member, upon the death of his spouse, should receive five cents from each member or whether the benefits should be arranged by each lodge individually. The following motions came up: A motion for the payment of $200.00 was rejected. A motion to pass the matter down to the individual States, was rejected. A motion for the payment of $100.00 was rejected. There on Bro. Bunata's move for a reconsideration of the majority report, that is that five cents be paid by each member, this was finally accepted. Therefore in the event of the death of a wife, the member will be paid approximately $150.00 by the Brotherhood.</p>
