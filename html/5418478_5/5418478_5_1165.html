   <p>That the name of Bohemian immigrants in Chicago may be spoken of with respect when we shall have been for a long time turned back into ashes and dust, depends upon all of us. Everyone of us should work for monuments which will make known to our descendants that we really worked towards the alleviation of the suffering and grief of our countrymen who through unfortunate circumstances were driven upon the rocks where their vessel of happiness and of a satisfactory life was wrecked. By monuments we mean a "home" for our old people and an "orphanage" for Bohemian children. These are two undertakings for the early realization of which every Bohemian should zealously work. Every individual, every society, and every Bohemian club should remember to make collections at every opportunity for the "home"and for the "orphanage" and in this manner help build the most beautiful lasting monument for all of us in common.</p>
