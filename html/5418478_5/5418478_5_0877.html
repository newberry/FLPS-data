   <p>Mr. Anton Kaspar, who lives at 2252 South Homan Avenue, recently deposited one hundred dollars at the office of Denni Hlasatel. He donates this money in the name of his brothers, Vaclav, Joseph, Charles, and himself, out of their share in the estate of Mrs. Rose Chladek for the benefit of our humanitarian institutions, The Old People's Home, The Orphanage, and The National Cemetery. This noble deed by the Kaspar brothers is deserving of public recognition and should be emulated in all cases, whenever anyone receives a considerable gift or inheritance.</p>
