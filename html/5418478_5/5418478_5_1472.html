   <p>The following is the annual report of the Damy Plzenskeho Pivovaru (Ladies of the Pilsen Brewery) for 1921:</p>
   <p>Every year our society participates in some great cause. This year, however, there was nothing in particular in which the society could take part. This does not mean, of course, that our members were idle. The chairman, Mrs. A. Cervenka, arranged a festive soiree on February 21, 1921, for the benefit of charitable institutions and causes. The results were about as follows: for the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), the Damy Plzenskeho Pivovaru deposited $100 in the bank; to honor the memory of the deceased Cenek Bolek, another $100 was deposited for the benefit of the Utulna. Our society decided to build a swimming pool for the boys and girls of the Sirotcinec, this should be completed before the coming summer.....We are therefore very anxious to accomplish this task as early as possible. The above-mentioned $200 will be the initial sum. Other gifts from the proceeds of the soiree were: To the Damsky Odbor Dobrocinne Spolecnosti (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Charitable Association), $50; to the Damsky Pomocny Odbor Durziny Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires), in Chicago, for their widows and orphans, $50; to the Plzen Rebekah Loze (Pilsen Rebekah Lodge) for some good cause, $25; to the dramatic artist, Mrs. Inneman, who, together with her children, is in great financial distress, $25. Fifty dollars went for the purchase of certain articles necessary for our rooms in the Utulna A Sirotcinec. Thus, the total sum of $400 was paid out for charitable causes, all this money having been cleared from the soiree. Our warm thanks go to all our friends and benefactors; also grateful acknowledgments for the work done by Mr. Jindrich Weidner, who supervised the soiree.</p>
   <p>Our society also arranged a picnic to the Pilsen pavilion....from which we obtained contributions which will be distributed as follows: To the Svobodomyslne Skoly (Free Thought Schools), $25; to the Zdrubek School, $25; to the St. Joseph's Orphanage in Lisle, Illinois, $25; to the Damsky Odber Dorbocinne Spolecnosti, $25. The total was $100.</p>
   <p>On January 4 we paid a visit to the Utulna A Sirotcinec and were hosts to the aged inmates. Our members provided excellent bakery goods which they baked themselves, and the coffee was furnished by the institution.....We also brought some useful gifts for these old people, such as warm comforters, balankets, etc. Two warm blankets will be provided for each bed in our rooms; besides these we furnished a dozen bed sheets, a dozen pillows, aprons, stockings, neckerchiefs, and tobacco. One of the old men gave his thanks to us in the name of the whole group of inmates, and the children entertained us by reciting some fine poems. We went away with the feeling that it is always more blessed to give than to receive. The institution presents a good impression, and the children amazed us by their excellent behavior. The expenses of this visit to the Utulna A Sirotcinec were paid from the proceeds of our picnic, and there will still be a neat sum left over which will be added to the aforesaid $200. After the payment of all bills for gifts purchased, there will be a total of $400 left in the bank. The chairman promised to increase this amount from any surplus from the soiree, It seems, therefore, that as soon as the rays of the vernal sun begin to shine, our promises made to the youngsters of the Sirotcinec will become a reality.</p>
   <p>We take this opportunity to thank the newspapers, Denni Hlasatel and Svornost, for their readiness and willingness to be of service to us whenever there was a need for it, and to all our friends we send our greetings.</p>
   <p>For the Damy Plzenskeho Pivevaru:</p>
   <p>Antonie Cervenka, chairman;</p>
   <p>Josefa Florian, secretary;</p>
   <p>Jennie Sistek, treasurer.</p>
