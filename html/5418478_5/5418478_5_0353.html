   <p>Sbor Mir Cechie, Cislo 71, Sesterska Podporujici Jednota v Cicero (Society of Bohemian Peace, Number 71, Ladies' Benevolent Union) has decided to form a club which later will be affiliated with the mother body.</p>
   <p>The young ladies in this locality, who are not members of any benevolent society, should take advantage of this offer, and join this prosperous organization.</p>
   <p>The initiation fee has been cut in half, and that alone should be an incentive to join this newly formed club.</p>
   <p>Any lady wishing to become a member of this new club may do so by calling on one of the following founders: Marie Novotny, 5405 West 24th Street; Marie Prokes, 5411 West 24th Street; Anna Sklenicka, 5016 West 23rd Street; or Louise Kubicek, 5619 West 23rd Street, who will give all necessary information.</p>
