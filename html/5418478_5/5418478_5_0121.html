   <p>One of the most important decisions of the ninth convention of the Jednota Ceských Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity) was not to change the present table of death rates and to continue the eight-hundred dollar death benefits without alteration. Debates about this article of the constitution started shortly before the morning session adjourned. Previously, the delegates discussed various articles of the constitution with reference to death benefits, etc.</p>
   <p>Sister Bohumila Ludvik, chairman, called the morning session to order at 9 A. M. All of the delegates and officers were present, and soon afterward further corrections and amendments to the constitution were discussed. The work is lightened to a certain extent by the fact that the proposals of various lodges were printed and sent to each delegate. Therefore, each delegate is well acquainted with what the various lodges recommend, and the proceedings of the convention are carried out accordingly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Articles referring to the sick benefits were not altered to a great extent, and most of the articles were left alone or corrected only slightly. A member is entitled to a sick benefit if she is ill for a period longer than eight days. The sick benefit starts from the day of the presentation of a doctor's certificate. If a member has not paid her lodge dues, she can do so at the time of the next meeting. However, in such cases the financial secretary is not permitted to receive the money at her home before the meeting is held. The amount of the sick benefit is governed by the bylaws, with the exception of the main regulations, according to which a full amount of sick benefit is paid out for a period of three months. This is followed by one half of the amount and later on a member is entitled to twenty-five cents a week. A lengthy debate followed the question of what would be done in cases where a member was sent to an insane asylum. The delegates, from experience gained in their own respective lodges, referred to many cases when not only a sick benefit had been involved, but also a question of what should be done when a member cannot pay her dues and there is nobody who would be willing to pay for her. Finally it was agreed that the only solution in <span class="page-break">3</span>similar cases would be to let the lodge pay her dues, which of course would be considered only as a loan and which, in case of death, would be deducted from the death benefit.</p>
   <p>Further, the question of certificates of transfer was discussed. The certificates of transfer can be issued for a period of not more than one year, and upon receipt thereof, the member must pay the sum of ten dollars. If a member intends to leave the United States, she can obtain a traveling certificate at the nominal cost of two dollars to cover the running expense, but she is not entitled to a sick benefit. At the time when the certificate of transfer is issued, a member must submit to a physical examination; and if she is not recommended by the examiner, she may return to her own lodge.</p>
   <p>The sum of twenty-five cents must be paid for the examiner's certificate, of which ten cents goes to the lodge and fifteen cents to the central committee. A member wishing to make a change in her beneficiary is required to pay the sum of forty cents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>A member who has not paid up her dues at the time of the quarterly meeting may be, if the lodge decides to do so, reminded of her duty by a registered letter, and the expense connected with this action will be added to her debt. A period of one month is allowed for the payment of delinquent dues. If a member fails to do so in the time required, then the member should be expelled.</p>
   <p>The article concerning meetings was amended in the sense that only members of the lodge will be admitted to the annual meeting.</p>
   <p>Then the question of death benefits came up and was debated. Individual lodges presented the following amendments to this article of the constitution.</p>
   <p>The delegates recommended that the present articles concerning the death benefits be kept in force without change, because it would be almost impossible to make any changes under the present charter of the organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Any important change in these articles might be followed by an official order to establish a new table of rates, which of course would result in much unpleasantness and eventually in another special convention.</p>
   <p>All these circumstances were brought up by Sisters Anna Stolfa, Vojtisek, and Liska, who all seemed to agree that it will be in the best interests of the organization if the present articles are kept unchanged. A motion to that effect was made and passed, and soon afterward the session adjourned.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon session, the delegates debated mostly on the matter of orphanage funds and other matters with reference to the payment of death benefits as mentioned heretofore. The afternoon session was somewhat shorter because of an excursion to the Pilsen Brewing Company which, according to the program, had been scheduled for 4 P. M. This excursion was arranged by, and the delegates were guests of, the Pilsen Brewery Ladies' Association, whose members are also members of the Jednota Ceských Dam. The delegates were <span class="page-break">6</span>cordially welcomed and escorted through the whole plant, and then enjoyed the reception which was arranged in their honor.</p>
