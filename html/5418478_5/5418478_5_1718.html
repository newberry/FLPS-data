   <p>Mrs. K. Vlcek, treasurer of the Caslavske Krajanky (Countrywomen of Caslav), a benevolent society of Chicago, deposited the sum of twenty-five dollars in our office for the benefit of an ancient church in Caslav, Czechoslovakia. Mrs. Katerina Sirinka, 1913 South Fisk Street, was urged by the dean of Caslav, Czechoslovakia, to undertake a collection among local countrymen from Caslav for the benefit of the said cause.</p>
   <p>Dean Alois Dostal of Caslav, in his communication, expressed the hope that the Chicago countrymen from Caslav will never forget their birthplace. At the same time he voiced an appeal for the solicitation of funds for the historic church. Upon the basis of this appeal, the collection was undertaken. The Caslavske Krajanky contributed the sum of twenty-five dollars which, together with other collections, will be sent to the old homeland.</p>
