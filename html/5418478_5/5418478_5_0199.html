   <p>The Sokol Slavsky, in a meeting on May 22, after a conference with representatives of the C. S. P. S. [Cesko-Slovanska Podporující Spolecnost (the Czecho-Slav Aid Society)], with a view toward an understanding among the brotherhood lodges, resolved as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, From the beginning of Czech immigration to Chicago the "Czech Pilsen" (Plzen) district always was the center of our business, social, and national life, as well as the source and starting point of our important national and intellectual movements; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The first building, the original home of the C. S. P. S. and with it the Czech-English Free Thought School, has ever since offered a home and shelter to all of our Free Thought societies; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, That building was the pride and the representative theatrical hall of "Czech Pilsen"; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, I was witness to many memorable occasions and important events in the history of Czech Freethinkers in Chicago; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It has witnessed the education of thousands of our Czech children in the maternal tongue, and instilled into them respect and love for the dear old Czech motherland; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we of the Sokol Slavsky, recognizing the importance of this community center for the preservation of the Czech element in our Plzen district, this oldest stronghold of Free Thought, recommend to the Board of Sponsors of the Cesko-Americka Svobodna Skola (Czech-American Free Thought School) to collaborate with us, and the other societies, in the erection of a new building for the C. S. P. S. on the site of the old building. A gorgeous edifice is not demanded, but it should be useful and modern, as is needed today by all organizations. Be it further "Resolved, That this should be done within the shortest possible time so that the building will henceforth, as before, be a historical landmark which has survived the hardest times till the moment when the sun of golden liberty will blaze over our nation. "Na Zdar! (Success!)</p>
   <p>"Bohus Hak,</p>
