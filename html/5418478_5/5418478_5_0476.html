   <p>The Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) achieved its long hoped for aim yesterday--it moved into its own new home. As we reported sometime ago, the Beseda bought Senator William Lorimer's residence at 3659 Douglas Boulevard and started to adapt it to its own purposes immediately after the deal was closed. Many changes were necessary in order to make the spacious building suitable for all the requirements of modern club life, but everything was done in record time, and members who came Saturday to the Club's new home were agreeably surprised at its practical renovations. The changes and furnishings must have cost a great deal of money, but now the Ceska Beseda's home equals the best clubs in town.....</p>
