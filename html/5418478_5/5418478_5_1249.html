   <p>The twelfth annual charity ball of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) took place last night in the gorgeously lighted and richly decorated Pilsen Park pavilion. The Spolecnost has long been regarded by our people as one of the most indispensable institutions of our public life. Since its inception the Spolecnost has proved innumerable times that it fully comprehends its humane mission. The basis on which it operates is indeed very sound, and by arranging its annual balls, which are its main source of revenue, it convinced us....that the general Czech public is not only well disposed toward its humane labors, but that it willingly co-operates in whatever projects the Spolecnost launches. Every one of the annual balls thus far given by the Spolecnost was a decided success, not only morally, but financially, as was again shown last night. Our Czech public regards the support of these annual charity balls as a regularly levied tax which it pays gladly and willingly to alleviate the suffering and the want of its countrymen who happen to be in straitened circumstances.</p>
   
   <p>Whoever saw the large number of people in the corridors and the halls of the pavilion....must have been filled with joy that our people are not lacking in sympathy and compassion, and that charity with them is not an empty phrase.</p>
   <p>The receipts of the ball were highly satisfactory in every respect; it seems to us even that they surpassed the wildest expectations of the very active committee on arrangements. Thus strengthened by the sympathies of the public and by the large financial success of the ball itself, the Spolecnost may now face its task of caring for the underprivileged with a calm assurance of having sufficient means to do so; and we know that there will be many an eye filled with tears of gratitude for the aid given by the Spolecnost.</p>
   <p>As regards the ball itself, it has for many years been an annual occurrence. The committee on arrangements with the help of the ladies' auxiliary made extensive preparations, and nothing was overlooked that could add to the splendor, the gaiety, and the success of the ball. As in former years, so this year too, intensive publicity was used; thousands of our countrymen and many prominent people belonging to the foreign-language groups received eloquent letters asking them to purchase the enclosed tickets. These requests were granted with a very few exceptions. The attendance at the ball was, consequently, a tremendous one, but the service did not suffer thereby; on the contrary, it was exemplary, so that nobody had any reason for complaint. The work was systematically divided under the committee chairmanship of Mr. Josef F. Bolek, and among others who helped were Messrs. Louis Solar, John A. Cervenka, Tomas Chval, Karel V. Janovsky, John Krupka, John A. Sokol, Charles J. Novak, and Anton Laad. Among the ladies who were active in the work were: Mesdames Antonie Cervenka, Terezie Hajicek, Marie Krupka, Aloisie Spatny, and Emma Zeman.</p>
   <p>The stage decorations are well worth mentioning; thanks to Mr. Kaspar, who loaned some beautiful palm trees to the Spolecnost, the whole stage had a festive appearance. Mr. Rubringer's orchestra contributed greatly to the gaiety and entertainment of the occasion.....</p>
   
   <p>The president of the Spolecnost, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, received an eloquent expression of appreciation by the board of directors. At the end of the grand march which was a grand spectacle indeed, and which was led by Mr. Cermak, Mr. Jan A. Cervenka stepped forth and handed him a gavel artistically carved from ivory. This was a gift from the board of directors of the Spolecnost. The gift was accompanied by a short speech from Mr. Cervenka who, as a spokesman for all those present, expressed his joy at the election of Mr. Cermak to the presidency of the Board of County Commissioners, stating that now that he has been elected he can use his high office for the good of the Spolecnost and for the indigent in whom that society is actively interested.</p>
