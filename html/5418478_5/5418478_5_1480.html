   <p>"Thousands of Russian children are dying daily from hunger. Let us organize to furnish aid throughout our Czechoslovak colonies."</p>
   <p>In accordance with this resolution made by the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (The Czechoslovak National Council of America) in its last meeting held in Cleveland, the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemain Catholics of America) has decided, as was previously announced, to launch a program of organized aid for the Russian children.</p>
   <p>The situation in Russia is getting worse every day, and the news items we get here are heart-rending. Slavonic-Russian children are dying--children who knew only misery and want and no moments of happiness! We are Christians and Slavs, and therefore let us not be tightfisted! Let us be compassionate! Let <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>us save those who can be saved! Let us not say that we cannot accomplish much and that our help is like a drop in the ocean. True, Russia is an enormous country and its people suffer greatly, but every little bit helps to save at least some of the people.</p>
   <p>According to Nansen's report, the poverty of the Russians is greater than one can imagine. In the Budsulsk government alone, one-half million inhabitants (or a third of the population) are without any food. During the last three months, thirty thousand people died. The mortality rate is growing rapidly, and without immediate help, two thirds of the population will perish before spring comes. Corpses are lying in the streets, and Nansen was an eyewitness when stray and starving dogs gnawed the flesh and bones of the dead. He found a pile of eighty dead children in a cemetery, all of them nude, for the rags in which they were formerly clad were taken off their emaciated bodies to clothe the living ones.....</p>
   <p>The children in Russia can barely stand on their feet, and they are horribly <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>emaciated. Their mothers are desperately foraging for food, denying themselves to feed their children. Such conditions exist in all of Eastern Russia. Everybody ought to consider it his duty to help these sufferers. Thanks to Mr. Dostal, the secretary of the Apostolat Svatych Cyrilla A Methodeje (The St. Cyril and Methodius Apostolate), a collection was started through the Hlas (Voice), and a neat sum has already been sent to relieve the suffering. The activity of the Apostolat was endorsed by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku and recommended to our countrymen.....</p>
   <p>It will be necessary, however, to mobilize all of our Bohemian Catholic societies and colonies so that this activity may be inaugurated everywhere as speedily as possible. Hunger does not wait! Send your contributions to your newspapers, which will gladly transmit them, or to Mr. Dostal, secretary of the Apostolat Svatych Cyrilla A Methodeje, or directly to the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku, 3207 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois. The last named organization will see to it that all gifts are forwarded as quickly as possible.</p>

   <p>In the name of the suffering children and their desperate mothers, we say to you: May God repay you for every little gift and charitable act with which you begin this New Year! Whoever can must help!</p>
   <p>For the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku,</p>
   <p>Antonin Vaclav Tesar, Director.</p>
