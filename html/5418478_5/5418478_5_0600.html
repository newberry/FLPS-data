   <p>The following is for the consideration of all Bohemian Lodges, especially the Grand Lodges.</p>
   <p>Representatives of lodges, enthusiastic for the uniting of all Bohemian-American benevolent societies, have been gathering in meetings to discuss ways and means, on the basis of which the desired alliance, beneficial not only to our national life, but also from a financial viewpoint, could be accomplished.</p>
   <p>There are many Bohemian societies, not only in Chicago, but scattered throughout the entire union, which are favorable to the idea of an alliance, recognizing that in union there is strength.</p>
   <p>But the various steps taken thus far to unite all benevolent societies have proven to be useless, for they always have ended with a simple wish but no decisive move. If good will was not lacking then courage was missing, in spite of the fact that many benevolent societies had a large majority of their membership voted to unite themselves to effect an actual alliance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Therefore, we take this method of asking the various benevolent societies to discuss this important question in their meetings, so as to decide according to their best ability, as to the benefits to be derived from such a course, and to unite on some final resolution, the result of which they should not forget to send, for only in this manner can any decisive step be taken.</p>
   <p>The various Grand Lodges ought to accept the question of uniting as their own and discuss it jointly. For this purpose we are calling them to a joint meeting to be held Saturday, July 20th, in the hall of the Bohemian-American Liberal School, on Eighteenth Street.</p>
   <p>This meeting should be attended by all representatives also.</p>
   <p>It is our intention to leave the question with the Grand Lodges for discussion. They will then either recommend its adoption to their subordinate units or reject it themselves. In this way the final settlement of the question of an alliance will be accomplished, and in 1902 we will either be celebrating the <span class="page-break">3</span>union of all benevolent societies, or having rejected this beneficent and important question to Bohemians, we will prove, that vanity has held us back and that we are doomed - even though we are brother-countrymen - to suffer further the burden of excessive payments. Either we will celebrate, - this depends upon the decision of the Grand Lodges and Grand Councils - like Bohemian-Americans, united under a free flag, or we will remain broken into small units, striving to overcome one another.</p>
   <p>None of the officers of the main bodies, and none of the representatives should neglect to attend the meeting. The proceedings will be very important. The executive officers of the Grand Lodges ought to consider the question of unification impartially, and come to the meeting with a definite and practical motion, by which the entire movement would take on a different aspect.</p>
   <p>The various extolling of individual lodges above others in such a grave event, should finally cease. Let not the officers of the Grand Lodges think that this <span class="page-break">4</span>or that lodge should have precedence, or something of that kind. The main purpose of all our benevolent societies is to pay death benefits to the surviving legal or appointed heirs, for the smallest dues possible. It is evident that the more members a benevolent society has the smaller are the monthly dues paid. Therefore, it is a matter of business, if in practical America we consider dues as the prime factor in our entire proceedings, which demand that the unification of all our benevolent societies be accomplished. In addition to that, consideration should be given to the fact that through the unification of the lodges our countrymen, as members belonging to them, would become one great family, whose strength and power would be recognized in all its undertakings for the benefit of our nationals, our national life and our children.</p>
   <p>Our main object is to bring the various benevolent societies into one whole. As to how such unification could best be accomplished, it is still impossible to say. However, in our opinion, there are only two methods by which this could be done without any great hardship. Either the societies would combine <span class="page-break">5</span>themselves into one large society or they would, (and this seems more appropriate) form a federation, whereby each society would retain its full independence simply by paying dues for a joint death benefit. Of course with such a large number of members, dues would be negligible; this is what we are chiefly trying to accomplish. There are some benefit societies which require quite large death benefit dues of their members.</p>
   <p>By uniting we would have more strength to build and maintain our schools; our youth, downtrodden Cinderellas, should be educated to fill the places of those who have gone to the place from which there is no return.</p>
   <p>Unification would make possible the accomplishment of many beneficial undertakings, which we are forgetting at present, or which we do not care about, fearful of the blackening, baiting and trouble to which our celebrated pigeon judgement usually leads.</p>
   <p>However, if we could, once and for all, discard these old prejudices and realize that we have enough sense so that we can mutually benefit if we wish, <span class="page-break">6</span>as in a nationalistic sense so in a business sense, much would be gained thereby. Under conditions such as prevail at present in our benevolent societies, the members care little about the society to which they belong for they do not appreciate it and when they are expelled from a society they go to another for they are received with open arms. Through unification all this would cease. Many are concerned about the name which the united organization would adopt, fearful lest the name of the society to which they belong be lost. However this is just as insignificant as the loss of dignity, for which so many in our societies yearn. A name which would be satisfactory to all could easily be found.</p>
   <p>The advantages and importance of uniting the benefit societies overshadows all such insignificant objections.</p>
   <p>Do not fail to be present at the meeting on July 20th, all of you, especially the representatives of the Grand Lodges and Supreme Councils, so that they can once and for all make known their opinion on the question of unification.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Absence will speak for itself and will be understood as an indication of nonendorsement.</p>
   <p>Out of town benevolent societies are requested to express their views and opinions regarding the unification by forwarding a letter.</p>
   <p>With a hope that this meeting shall meet with success, we remain - Tomas Polivka, Chairman; Karel Musil, Secretary; of the Committee for the Unification of Bohemian Societies.</p>
   <p>Address all correspondence to the Secretary, K. Musil, 615 Loomis Street.</p>
