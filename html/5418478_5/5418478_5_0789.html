   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the board of delegates to the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was held last night in the lower hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets. Many delegates and representatives of the various societies were present....The meeting was opened shortly after 8 P. M. by Mr. Vojtech Suchy, the president. Mrs. Ruzena Lorenc read the minutes of the previous meeting in the absence of the regular secretary, Mrs. Bozena Krabec. The minutes were approved as read. This was followed by the reading of a few letters. The Pilsen Court No. 12, of the Cesko-Americti Lesnici (Bohemian-American Foresters) announced the appointment of its representative to the Utulna, Mr. John Bilek of Brookfield, Illinois. The secretary of the board of delegates of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), Mr. V. A. Filip, inquired by letter whether the inmates of the Orphanage, Miss Vlasticka Stipek and Miss Marenka Otahal, will be able to recite some <span class="page-break">\2</span>Bohemian and English poems at the Memorial Day services at the cemetery. (The president indicated, while this letter was being read, that the matter had already been settled at the meeting of the board of directors, and that the two girls will take part in the program.) Mrs. Metta Studt, of 4610 North Keystone Avenue informed the board that she has taken Frank Stepanek, an inmate of the Sirotcinec, into her home, and that she will make reports to the business manager of the Sirotcinec. Mr. Frank J. Petru announced that the Cesky Poplatnicky Spolek V Ciceru (Bohemian Taxpayers' Association of Cicero, Illinois) sent $10 to the Utulna, and that it appointed as its delegate the former justice of the peace, Mr. Josef Langer.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the above-mentioned letters, the office manager, Mr. Fischer, read the bills for the past month, from which it appeared that receipts amounted to $1,190.30 and disbursements totaled $2,051.45.</p>
   <p>The investigation committee reported that it is investigating the application of Mr. Louis Bratich, 449 North Harding Avenue, who asked that his children <span class="page-break">\3</span>be taken into the Sirotcinec. It was found that the applicant remarried, and that, therefore, his application cannot be considered. The tag day committee reported that it is unable as yet to give the results of the collections made on that day for the benefit of all of the orphanages of Chicago among which our Sirotcinec is included. Hope was expressed, however, that the results will be satisfactory. [Translator's note: The names of several contributors who made gifts to the Utulna are omitted in translation. The total thus received was $30.] Mr. F. J. Petru reported....that he received $2,060.00 after cashing the West Side Hospital bonds which were given to the Utulna by Mr. and Mrs. Frank Fucik. Mr. Petru also collected $220 in interest on a loan made to the societies Hrad Rabi (Castle Rabi) and Jan Huss.</p>
   <p>Since it will soon be necessary to make preparations for an annual concert for the benefit of the Utulna, President Suchy appointed an entertainment committee, the members of which are the following: Messrs. F. J. Petru, A. Charvat, Jakub Janda, and Mesdames A. Brychta, Frantiska Kolar, M. Svacha, A. Kasandr. A motion was made by the chairman of this committee, Mr. Petru, <span class="page-break">\4</span>that no solicitations be made for advertisements on programs to be printed for this occasion. Instead of ads [usually solicited] every merchant will be asked to buy four tickets to the concert.</p>
   <p>An interesting feature of the concert will be an orchestra composed of the inmates of the Sirotcinec. Mrs. E. Hrisny and Miss Scheffl reported that the Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) intends to give a concert for the benefit of the Utulna on the second Wednesday in June at the Carter H. Harrison High School. The said Society was gladly given permission to sponsor the concert. At the same time all the delegates promised to be helpful in selling the tickets for that occasion.</p>
   <p>At this juncture Mr. Josef Trnka, secretary of the executive committee arrived and read the minutes of his committee. The minutes revealed that applications for admitting the three children of Mr. Stepan Halek were accepted. The children are: Rolland, aged six and one-half years, Helen, aged four and <span class="page-break">\5</span>one-half years, and Raymond, aged three and one-half years. These children were recommended by the committee and admitted to the institution after their father obliged himself to do his duties. The children, Ondrej and Michal Makr, of Cicero, Illinois were admitted into our institution under the same conditions.</p>
   <p>The board of delegates approved the payment of $25 to the secretary of the board of directors for various expenses for the year 1922. The building committee submitted a plan for various repairs to be made, such as painting, straightening of the sidewalks, etc. The making of these repairs was approved. The building and grounds now seem to be in good shape, and by May 30 (Memorial Day) the entire property of our institution will be in perfect order. Mr. Charvat, our architect, was given orders to furnish estimates for the building of a swimming pool for our children. This he will do at the next meeting when the contractors' bids will also be studied, contracts awarded, and the work begun. The expenses for this will be borne by the ladies auxiliary of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Pilsen Brewing Company, and the expenses of installing a locker room will be paid by Mrs. Antonie Cervenka as a memorial to her father, Mr. Bolek.</p>
   <p>Our children attended an exhibit made by the pupils of the Haugen School, and are now working on a similar exhibit themselves. Our orchestra is diligently rehearsing now, and will on some future occasion be able to show samples of its activity.</p>
   <p>The Utulna needs a house physician, and it was decided, therefore, to make an agreement with Dr. Stulik, Jr., who will receive a monthly salary of one hundred dollars. The said doctor is to visit our institutions regularly, and is to take care of the health of our inmates. The contract, which was drawn by [our legal representative] between the Kaspar State Bank and our institutions, and which concerned the matter of a reserve fund, was read and approved by the board [of directors], and its approval recommended to the board of delegates.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>It was decided to organize a Bohemian Sunday school for the children of the Sirotcinec. The classes will be conducted on Sunday afternoons in the dining hall of the Utulna. The teacher will be appointed by the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools). The board of directors of our institutions will take part in the Memorial Day celebration at the Bohemian National Cemetery where our children are to recite poems, etc. A radio set was ordered for the use of the Orphanage. It will be one of the best and will be installed at the expense of Mr. Mrizek, president of the Mrizek Bakery Company....The pharmacist, Mr. Pelikan, donated a number of medical and pharmacentical supplies. Mr. August Geringer donated linens valued at $100 for the room which bears his name. Mrs. Rinn donated carpets, hospital and other equipment. The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Union) contributed $25.02....At the present time the Old people's home has thirty-seven inmates while the Orphanage has ninety-one.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors, <span class="page-break">\8</span>the proposed contract between the Kaspar State Bank and the Utulna came up for discussion....A lengthy debate ensued in which Messrs. Petru, Kubecek, Soukup, David, Langer, Lehmann, Illich, Zrust, Rada, and Suchy and Mrs. Brychta took part. It was decided that the matter should be left in the hands of the executive committee....According to the submitted draft of the contract the bank is to become a trustee of a fund amounting to $20,000. Its trusteeship is to last for ten years, or until such time when the fund will reach the sum of $50,000. The bank proposes to use the money received from the Utulna for the purchase of government and municipal bonds and other gilt-edged securities, and receive for its services one eighth of one per cent. (We shall publish the full text of the contract after both parties have definitely agreed to enter into it.)</p>
   <p>This was followed by a discussion for the good of our institutions. Mr. Illich offered to take the two heifer calves owned by the Utulna to the cattle market and sell them for $80. Should he not be successful in getting that amount of money, he would make good the difference from his own pocket. Mr. Lehmann <span class="page-break">\9</span>opined that it would be better to slaughter the animals and use their meat in the kitchens of the Utulna. He promised to provide both a butcher and a sanitary inspector for that purpose, but after a brief debate it was decided to carry the motion made by Mr. Illich. The office manager then read a report on last month's receipts and disbursements.</p>
