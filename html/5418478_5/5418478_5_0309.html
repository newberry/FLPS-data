   <p>The numerical strength of the Czech element in the State of Illinois as compared with others is particularly conspicuous in the number of delegates who are to attend the general assembly of the C. S. P. S. [customary abbreviation for Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spelecnost (the Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society)], which will be held in Chicago next year. The Society has 24,349 members in 231 lodges represented by 88 delegates. Of these 27 are from Illinois, 13 from New York, 12 from Ohio, 6 from Pennsylvania, 4 from Iowa, 3 each from Missouri and Tennessee, 2 each from Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin, and 1 each from all other states.</p>
