   <p>The last session of the sixteenth rally of the C. S. P. S. [Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek (Czecho-Slav Aid Society)] was held yesterday. The discussions dealt almost exclusively with the selection of a time and place for the next rally. The names of cities suggested were finally narrowed down to Galveston, Texas, and Cleveland, Ohio. The latter city was chosen, and the next conference will be held there four years from now.</p>
   <p>The sixteenth rally has not made many changes in the statutes, true enough, but it has made two which are very important. First, it resolved unanimously to combine the brotherhoods in the United States into one body.</p>
   <p>This unification is, in spite of the obvious solidarity of the individual organizations, not easy to accomplish. Mere voting cannot accomplish it. The laws of the various states over which the brotherhoods are spread have to be conformed with. It will take considerable time before the various <span class="page-break">2</span>lodges will be able to adapt their regulations, which are subject to the laws of the state in which they are organized, to the new conditions. Aided by good will, the organizations will overcome these difficulties.</p>
   <p>The second resolution passed was the introduction of a system of child insurance, in a form which has been found satisfactory by a few lodges of the brotherhood. The problem before the organization now is how to gain the largest possible number of children as prospects. The law requires a minimum of 600 children before the insurance is valid.</p>
   <p>One resolution was received with great enthusiasm: the decision to give the Czech National Alliance all possible moral and financial support, and also to participate vigorously in any patriotic activity having for its aim the liberation of Czechoslovak lands.</p>
   <p>A proposal to support Sokol organizations should also be accepted by every one of the lodges. Generous gifts were bestowed upon the Czech National <span class="page-break">3</span>Alliance, the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphan Asylum, Czech schools in America, and various other humanitarian institutions.</p>
   <p>This clearly demonstrates that the C. S. P. S. is not merely an aid society, but a national patriotic body as well. These are reasons why the sixteenth rally may be called a memorable one, and will find fullhearted approval on the part of the individual members.</p>
