   <p>The trustees of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) started their regular meetings again after a two-month vacation period. They met yesterday in the offices of the Pilsen Brewery under the chairmanship of President John A. Cervenka.....The agenda of the meeting was limited to the presentation of committee reports on work done during the past two months.</p>
   <p>Dr. Neuman reported for the press committee on the progress made in the preparations for the publication of the directory. His report was approved and his committee was given full power to proceed at their discretion both with the directory and the proposed stamps. The directory is to cover not only Chicago, but many other Bohemian communities in the United States [as well], and, upon Mr. Cervenka's suggestion, will include, in addition to the names of firms and individuals, Bohemian social organizations also. Their names will be included for a small fee.</p>
   <p>The meeting agreed to call in all subscription blanks for a check-up. This <span class="page-break">\2</span>does not mean the subscriptions are to be discontinued--just the contrary. The solicitation of funds should be continued with increased energy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludvik Fisher, acting as secretary, presented the report of the constitution and bylaws committee, indicating that the work on these documents had been ended. It was agreed to publish them in both the Bohemian and the English languages.</p>
   <p>The question had previously come up, at one or two meetings, as to whether or not the Hospital could be run profitably. The Hospital is not expected to be a money-making proposition, but the trustees want to feel sure that the Hospital will not show such a deficit as to make its functioning impossible. This question came up again yesterday, but Dr. Pavlik explained that there is no such danger. He had studied the financial reports of a number of hospitals comparable to the one the trustees have in mind and found that they all prosper. Under proper management, a year's expenses of a hospital with sixty beds should not exceed $20,750, while the income--figuring only forty <span class="page-break">\3</span>weeks a year, since all the beds cannot be expected to be occupied continuously--should be close to $30,000. In order to make this point quite clear, the trustees asked for additional information to be available at the next meeting together with a report on the building sites under consideration and their prices.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Frank G. Hajicek reported the receipt of $300 as the first prize of the contest arranged by the Pilsen Brewing Company, and $25 from Dr. Fisher, which he had received as fee for counting the ballots. In sundry contributions [itemized in the article], from various sources, $45 was received during the vacation.....</p>
