   <p>At the annual banquet arranged on Saturday night, February 11, by the Joseph Triner Company [a Bohemian enterprise] for its employees, to whom it wished to show its appreciation for their conscientious work, the unfortunate poor who need our help were not forgotten.</p>
   <p>During the height of the entertainment, Mr. Lupe, who is a shipping clerk for this concern, suggested that a collection be made for our orphanages. The collection netted $40. Of this sum, one half was sent yesterday to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa V Lisle (St. Joseph's Orphanage in Lisle, Illinois) and one half to the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage) in Chicago.</p>
