   <p>Mr. Jan Kracalik, 1235 South 49th Avenue, Cicero, Illinois, undertook a collection for the benefit of poor people in Ujezd, Czechoslovakia, his birthplace.

Mr. Jan Kracalik some time ago undertook a similar collection among his co-workers at the place where he is employed. For the collected amount he bought provisions which he sent to his birthplace, but the shipment was lost aboard the ship "Liberty Glow". He recently collected the sum of $20 as insurance for the lost shipment, which he added to the first above-mentioned collection, and the whole amount was sent to Ujezd.
