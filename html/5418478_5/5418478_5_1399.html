   <p>The Lodge No. 29 of the Slovanska Podporujici Jednota (Slavonic Benevolent Union) celebrated its twenty-fourth anniversary recently. On that occassion a collection was made for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and a lamb has been raffled off. The proceeds from all this amounted to ten dollars which has been deposited with us by the treasurer of the Jednota, Mrs. Emilie Kostal.</p>
