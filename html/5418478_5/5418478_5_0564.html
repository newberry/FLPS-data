   <p>A conference took place at Banker Hajichek's offices last Friday, in which fundamental rules for conducting the business of the Bohemian Benevolent Association were discussed and adopted. Judge J. Z. Uhlir presided; after some routine work was finished, Mr. John A. Cervenka, representing the committee for the setting up of regulations,made a report on meeting in which the following recommendations were made:</p>
   <p>The creation of a committee of six empowered to investigate cases and grant requests for aid. The overhead expenses should never amount to more than 25 per cent of the gross income. The voucher system is to be introduced. A finance committee of three shall be created, whose duty it is to make a check on payments every three months. One director shall be placed in every district inhabited by Czechs, to receive requests and <span class="page-break">\2</span>to investigate cases.</p>
   <p>Close contact with the Bohemian Cemetery Association for the handling of death cases, was generally acknowledged as a matter of expediency.</p>
   <p>A deficiency in the service in the County hospital was pointed out by Mr. Petru; Czech patients in the County hospital, if they do not speak English sufficiently, have no way of communicating with the attending personnel. The engagement of a Czech doctor or a nurse would ease matters. Mr. Petru was delegated to take the necessary steps toward this aim by consulting Mr. Mendl, one of the directors of the Bohemian Benevolent Society and at the same time a member of the Board of County Commissioners, which governs the hospital.</p>

   <p>It is however, a sad fact, that many of our most well-to-do Bohemians have not yet applied for membership in the society and thus far, have not contributed a single penny to it, while on the other hand, their foremost duty should be to contribute their mark to the success of the society.</p>
   <p>With that, the chairman ended his talk and immediately thereafter, the secretary read his report, which dealt with the activities of the society from the date of its inception. The Bohemian Charitable Society was organized on February 11, 1910, for the purpose of giving financial and moral aid to poor Bohemians. Certificate of Incorporation was issued, by the Secretary of State on the 24th of February. Sixteen persons were elected as a board of directors in the very beginning. Fourteen meetings have been held so far, and 142 persons applied for aid. Sixty of these were given assistance and thirty-two were referred to their county-agent. It should also be mentioned, that they were given aid there. Upon the recommendation of the society, six persons were admitted into the county hospital, five were admitted to the eye clinic, four were admitted to the poor-house, one was admitted to the Martha Washington Institute, and nine children were sent to the Orphanage.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Seven persons secured work in the country through the influence of the society, while fifteen were given jobs in county buildings and twenty-one were given jobs in factories.</p>
   <p>With the aid of the society, two people were buried in the Bohemian National Cemetery, one request for pension was arranged, in five cases Doctors acted free of charge, and medicines also were furnished free in seven cases.</p>
   <p>The financial report of the society, which was read by the secretary was as follows: Total receipts were $1,172, disbursements $266.65, balance on hand $905.35. The society has a total of 87 members who have deposited their contributions and 17 others who have made pledges. During its existence it has aided financially fifty-seven families.</p>
