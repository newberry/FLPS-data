   <p>P. 1, Col. 6 -- Promptly at 8 o'clock yesterday evening the regular monthly meeting of the Orphanage and Old Peoples Home Association convened, with Mr. Pecha as chairman, in the lower hall of the Bohemian Liberal School on west 18th street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlaciha, the secretary, sent his regrets for his absence, caused by illness, and Mr. Bolek acted in his stead as temporary secretary. The minutes of the previous meeting of September 17, 1910, were read and approved of.</p>
   <p>At the request of the president the delegates present arose in respect to the memory of one of the deceased delegates, Mr. Prybl, who was a benefactor of the Orphanage and Old People's Home Association. The delegates also extended their heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved widow.</p>
   <p>A communication was read from Vratislav Lodge No. 51 C. S. P. S. (Czecho-Slovak <span class="page-break">\2</span>Benevolent Association) requesting the admission of Anna Trnka, who recently arrived from the old homeland, Bohemia, and will contribute the sum of $1,250. The matter was deferred for further investigation.</p>
   <p>Svornost Lodge requests the admission of one of its members, Mr. Frank Syndilk, who has no property but has an insurance policy for $1,000 and is willing to make the Old People's Home Association the beneficiary. His sister is the present beneficiary. Therefore a resolution was moved and adopted that Mr. Syndilk should first have the policy changed to make the Old People's Home Association the beneficiary, and that then he should be admitted to the Old People's Home. Otherwise it will be his sister's duty to care for him.</p>
   <p>America Lodge brought to the attention of the body of delegates that this Orphanage was built exclusively for orphans, and that it was not intended to admit children who have a father or mother unless one of the parents is able to pay for their care. This led to a heated discussion. It was resolved that for the present no change in policy shall be made, and that as heretofore each individual case shall be brought before the assembly of delegates and be acted upon accordingly.</p>

   <p>Mr. John Vopicka made a request for admission to the Old People's Home, but since he has two sons who should be able to care for him, this matter was referred to the Bohemian Charitable Association for investigation, which will see to it that the two sons provide for their 72-year-old father.</p>
   <p>Joseph Lestina made a request in writing for the admission of his 86-year-old mother and is willing to pay $10 monthly for her care. He gives as reason the fact that he has a family of eight children and has small living quarters, so that his mother would have to lie on the floor. This also led to a heated debate, and it was remarked that the Association does not provide for any one gratis; that inmates must pay for being cared for or will something of value to the Association.</p>
   <p>The investigating committee gave a report concerning a five-year-old boy, Frank, the son of Mrs. Anna Stepan, deceased. The boy was born in a maternity hospital and is without relatives. He should be admitted to the Orphanage. Joseph Kloucka's request for admission was tabled for investigation. Mr. Kloucka states that his equity in certain property is in the hands of a bank in Kansas City, Mo., and amounts to $480, and that he has some cash on hand.</p>

   <p>The semi-annual report of the Orphanage and Old People's Home Association was read. Resources amount to $67,000, an increase of $5,000 over the total given in the previous annual report.</p>
   <p>Receipts were $250, and disbursements $532.45. The Orphanage has twenty-one inmates; the Old People's Home has eighteen inmates, fourteen women and four men.</p>
