   <p>The Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic-Benevolent Societies) is now sixty-eight years old. It is the oldest benevolent association in the United States. The best way to celebrate this occasion would be to secure a large number of new members. If each of our states would secure sixty-eight new members--that is one for each year of the Societies' age--the total would be quite impressive.</p>
