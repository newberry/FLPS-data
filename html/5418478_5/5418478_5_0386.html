   <p>The Cesko-Americka Jednota (Bohemian-American Unity), the youngest of our Bohemian fraternal organizations, celebrated appropriately the fifth anniversary of its foundation and the completion of the first five years of its activity yesterday. The Jednota has, in spite of its youth, a place of considerable prominence among our societies, and its energy and progressive ideas will, no doubt, advance it to a place of much greater importance within a short period of time.</p>
   <p>Chicago Bohemians who follow carefully the development of our societies will remember very well the circumstances that led to the founding of the Jednota, and will also recall that those who took the first steps toward the foundation of the new organization had ample reasons for doing so, not the least among such reasons being national pride and self-respect. A public affront given to the Bohemian members of a non-Bohemian association by some prejudiced individuals elicited the best possible reply: the Bohemian members discontinued their membership in that organization and founded an independent organization <span class="page-break">\2</span>of their own--a purely Bohemian organization. This new organization was started five years ago--a short while in the span of human life--but the Jednota has achieved great success in the way of growth in this period of time, and the celebration of its anniversary is, therefore, fully justified and proper.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Americka Jednota, supported by all its local lodges, decided to celebrate the anniversary by an outing in Pilsen Park, to which the celebrants marched in an impressive parade through the streets of our Bohemian Pilsen.</p>
   <p>The outing met with huge success, a natural outcome of the care with which all the necessary preparations for it had been made by the arrangements committee.....</p>
   <p>The spacious Park was filled to capacity....and the celebration was all that could be expected by the greatest optimists.....</p>
