   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held its tenth annual ball at the Pilsen Park pavilion last Wednesday, the result of which can be a satisfaction to the arrangements committee. The spacious auditorium was crowded to capacity by people who came in order to enjoy themselves and, at the same time, to support the humanitarian causes championed for a long period of years by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. It was proof that our people highly esteem the meritorious work which this organization does for poor and deserted Czechoslovak families in our city, and therefore the moral and financial success of this ball was great.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee provided stylish decorations and fancy illumination, so that everyone entering the auditorium was pleasantly surprised. In the course of the entertainment, an interesting program, under the direction of Miss Duda, was presented.</p>

   <p>Among those attending were Mayor William M. Thompson of Chicago and several other prominent politicians. Dancing to the excellent music continued until the early hours of the morning, and those who attended left the auditorium satisfied not only because they had spent a delightful evening, but also because they had accomplished a good deed by supporting the humanitarian causes of the Ceska Bobrocinna Spolecnost.</p>
   <p>We hope that the proceeds of the ball are large, and it is to be hoped that our Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is more frequently remembered, because through it we remember our poor families which must be taken care of by this organization during the coming winter.</p>
