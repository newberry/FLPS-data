   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) held at the office of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was one of the most poorly attended, with only seven of the fifteen members present.</p>
   <p>Dr. Zabokrtsky presided in the absence of Chairman John A. Cervenka, and after a late call to order, the minutes of the last meeting were read, followed by the reading of letters containing contributions. The following were received: Lodge Vysehrad, No. 48 of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian Slavonic Benevolent Societies) paid its yearly contribution of $10, and Mr. Jan Kusta was selected to represent this Lodge at all meetings of the board of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Memocnice. Mr. Joseph Kostohryz, representing the Union Wholesale Liquor Company, is sending a contribution of $100 for the hospital; the Pilsen Brewing Company sends $50, which is one fourth of the $200 promised to the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Pilsen Brewing Company.</p>
   <p>The meeting allowed $45 as a payment for ten years' insurance of the hospital building for $15,000 a year (sic). The delicate question of collecting outstanding pledges was discussed. These amount to $7,000, and so far none of the committees have been able to collect these pledges despite all their efforts. These pledges should be collected as soon as possible, because $5,000 is still needed to finish paying for the property, and much more will be needed for the building of the addition and the outfitting of the hospital. The management does not want to start with a debt. The several committees on collections will again visit every subscriber. They hope that everyone will come forward with the amount subscribed.</p>
   
   <p>The motion to pay $4,000 to Mr. Frank G. Hajicek as a payment on the hospital property was carried, so that now $18,000 will have been paid, leaving a balance due of $5,000.</p>
   <p>Dr. Neuman announced that a call for bids for the printing of the directory has been published in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>According to the report of our agent, Mr. Ludvik, $3,000 is collected for advertisements in our directory, and $2,000 more is outstanding in contracts for larger advertisements. It is evident that the outcome in this respect will be very favorable.</p>
   <p>The directory is to be ready for the printer sometime in the early part of April.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned after the financial secretary, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek announced the receipts, which totaled $225.</p>
