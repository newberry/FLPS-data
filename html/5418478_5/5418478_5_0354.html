   <p>The annual meeting of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held Friday evening on the second floor of Sokol Chicago Hall, with a large attendance, and at which meeting the officers of the directorate submitted their yearly reports. These reports will surely bring them deserved recognition.</p>
   <p>The sphere of activity of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, with its efficient business management, for which the present officials are accountable, marks this as one of the most commendable organizations among the Czechs.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes by the secretary, Reverend Vanek,which were accepted as read, the secretary's annual report was read and accepted. This report and minutes will be found in another section of this newspaper.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that the secretary's annual report be printed in Czech and English <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and copies used for agitation and for imformative purposes.</p>
   <p>The secretary now read the names of all the members of the organization: the names of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost; the Auxiliary Committee of Czech Ladies, and the names of the young ladies of the Junior League. These three last named societies are doing valuable work which the secretary's report shows in detail.</p>
   <p>The business of the meeting further showed the work done by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost from its inception; the amounts in dues collected, gifts received and the moneys received from the many undertakings amount to $28,916; whereas the total disbursements are approximately $25,452.</p>
   <p>The receipts for the year just ended were less than for the previous year; but the expenses were less, because there were not as many calls for assistance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goetshe, a public accountant, examined the accounts of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost gratis, and sent the report to the Chicago Association of Commerce <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>which reported to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost by letter. It was agreed at this meeting that Mr. Goetshe be made a member of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost in recognition of services rendered.</p>
   <p>The chairman, in a fervent address, called attention to the meritorius work of the ladies in the interest of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, and said that, for the interest manifested, the ladies should be represented on the board of directors. Motions were presented referring to the ladies' representation by Messrs. Hajicek, Cermak and Bolek with no dissenting votes, and the ladies are requested to make their own choice of directors, of whom there are to be nine.</p>
   <p>Because the business of this meeting called for the election of directors to fill vacancies, the nominating committee, composed of Messrs. A. J. Cermak, Stanislav Loula, and Eduard Kvidera, retired to another room to deliberate on the naming of these directors. When the names were presented to the whole body, they were accepted without a dissenting vote.</p>
   <p>The board of directors is now composed of the following gentlemen, elected to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>serve three years: Petr Drije, Jan A. Cervenka, Eduard Kvidera, Vaclav Cihak, Fratisek Kreml, Karel Mrizek, Alois Solar, and Dr. F. Jirka. The following gentlemen were elected to serve two years: Robert W. Dvorak, Josef A. Smejkal, Vaclav Triner, and Vaclav Topinka. And the following gentlemen were re-elected [two-year terms]: Reverend Vaclav Vanek, Jan Sokol and Karel V. Janovsky. The gentlemen elected to serve one year are: Josef Z. Uhlir, Frantisek G. Hajicek, Frantisek J. Petru, Roman Sedlacek, Karel Novak, Antonin Laadt, Josef F. Bolek, and Stanislav J. Loula. Mr. Josef Zalusky was elected investigator without remuneration.</p>
   <p>The chairman, in a short address, then thanked the officers, the press, and finally Mr. A. J. Cermak, who would not accept the nomination as director, although pressed to do so by the officers and members. He gave as his reason for not accepting the prevalence of reports by misinformed persons which reflect upon Mr. Cermak's honor, and therefore he is of the opinion that it would be better for the organization if he did not accept office. Nevertheless, Mr. Cermak promised that he would be just as active in the future as though he <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>were a member of the board. Mr. Cermak then presented an outline of the work which he hoped to accomplish with the aid of his co-workers; he further gave vent to his disapproval of the conduct of some of our wealthy people who, despite their affluence, show no concern for their countrymen who are in want.</p>
   <p>Messrs Sokol, Janovsky, Loula, and Krasny seemed unable to find appropriate words of praise for Mr. Cermak's work in the interest of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, and said they were sorry he was leaving the directorate.</p>
   <p>The receipts of this meeting were: Garden City Brewing Company, $25; Mr. Josef Z. Uhlir, $25; Mr. Alois Hell, $10; Union Wholesale Liquor Company, $25; Mr. Josef Kostohryz, $5; Mr. Josef Jiran, $5; after which the meeting was adjorned.</p>
