   <p>For the benefit of the Joaneum, an institution for crippled children in Prague, Czechoslovakia, several of our countrymen deposited their contributions in our office. Heretofore, the sum of thirteen dollars was collected. This sum, which is equivalent to one thousand Czechoslovakian kronen, was sent by us through the Skala State Bank to the above-mentioned institution.</p>
