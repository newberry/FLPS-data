   <p>The Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage), institutions recognized by our public as most useful and indispensable, are now under State supervision and are members of the Chicago Chamber of Commerce. More recently, they have also acqauired membership in the Children's Benefit League. This membership gives them the privilege of participating in the "tagging" to which that league alone is now entitled.</p>
   <p>The Children's Benefit League has a tag day, approved by Mayor Thompson, set for October 18. The Utulna a Sirotcinec, as a member of the League, is expected to send out one hundred and fifty ladies to help "tag" for our institution, and in that way enhance its means just at a time when, building a new home for its unfortunate orphans, it is in great need of additional support.</p>
   <p>Our former appeals have been almost without result. Only a very small number of our ladies have notified us that they were willing to be active <span class="page-break">2</span>on the tag day. Other charitable institutions in the city, belonging to other than the Bohemian nation, have secured ample help by now. We, therefore, appeal again to all our ladies who are willing to donate a day's work for the Utulna a Sirotcinec to attend the meeting which will be held in the Pilsen Sokol building, 1812-1816 South Ashland Avenue, at eight o'clock tonight, October 5.</p>
