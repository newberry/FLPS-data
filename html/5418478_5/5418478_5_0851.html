   <p>The Businessmen's Association of Irving Park, some time ago offered three libraries, which were to be given, one each, to the three most popular associations, schools, churches, or other public bodies in Irving Park.</p>
   <p>The balloting which ended within the last few days, gave the second library to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). This prominent institution has become the owner of a library of fifty volumes of good English literature. The best proof of the Utulna's popularity is the fact that it has received 1,100,000 votes in a neighborhood where there are comparatively few of our countrymen.</p>
   <p>The principal credit for securing the library for the Utulna goes to our <span class="page-break">\2</span>Bohemian businessmen of Irving Park.....to whom many thanks.</p>
