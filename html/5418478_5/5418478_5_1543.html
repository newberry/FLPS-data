   <p>A touching appeal was sent to our Bohemian merchants and other individuals by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost v Chicagu (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago), by means of which the Association wishes to secure one thousand members who will contribute the sum of five dollars or more for such humanitarian work as the Association has been doing for a number of years. This sum of five thousand dollars will be necessary this year in order that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost may fulfill its task of supporting the poorest Bohemian families. Heretofore, one hundred philanthropists responded to this appeal by contributing the sum of five dollars or more each as membership fees. Nine hundred more are sought, and the membership drive committee is earnestly urging them to send their membership contributions to the treasurer of the committee, Mr. Thomas Kallal, 3245 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois. All contributions will be published in our Bohemian daily newspapers.</p>
