   <p>The J. C. D. [Jednota Ceskych Dam (Czech Ladies' Unity)] celebrated the unveiling of its banner in the hall of the Sokol Chicago yesterday afternoon. We report with much regret that only a very few of the members of this, the largest and strongest of our women's organizations, took part. There were, in fact, hardly ten per cent of the members present, though the affair was arranged in co-operation with the Red Cross, the support of which is an eminent duty of every Czech girl and married woman.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Smrcek, president, opened the ceremonies. Then followed "The Star-Spangled Banner," played by the band. Mrs. Cervenka delivered a splendid address at the dedication of the banner. The main attraction of the day was a drama, "On the Field of Glory and Victory," which had been originally written for the famous actress, Sarah Bernhardt, who created the main role at a recent presentation at the Majestic Theater with brilliant success.</p>
   
   <p>[Follows a synopsis of the play.] The arrangement for the Czech stage was made by Albert J. Havranek, Czech-Chicago poet and writer. In this work, he again showed not only enthusiasm for the cause, but also his rare gifts. He certainly ingratiated himself with our public.</p>
   <p>The main role, that of the youthful flag-bearer, was intrusted to our popular actress, Mrs. Slavka Svoboda. Both Mr. Havranek and Mrs. Svoboda, as well as others in the cast, were heartily applauded. The play is to be given again.</p>
