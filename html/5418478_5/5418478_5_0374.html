   <p>The question of a unification of Bohemian benevolent organizations is a question affecting not only their membership but the whole Bohemian Free Thought public. It cannot be denied that the responsibility for the upkeep of our Free Thought institutions and, in general, the leadership in the activities of the whole Bohemian-American Free Thought public, rests almost entirely on our fraternal unions. If these activities are not all that could be desired, the fault is in certain matters concerning officers and their continuity, rather than in a lack of good workers and of their willingness. It is for this reason that the Svaz Cesko-Slovanskych Podporujících Jednot (Federation of Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Unions) has issued this proclamation to the wider Bohemian public.</p>
   <p>In February of this year, a convention of six Bohemian benevolent unions was held in Chicago: the Cesko-Slovenske Podporující Spolky (Bohemian-American Benevolent Associations), the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity), the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporující Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Fraternity), the Jednota Tabor (Tabor Union), the Cesko-Americti Lesnici a Lesnice (Bohemian-American [men and women] Foresters), and the Cesko-Americka Jednota (Bohemian-American Union). This convention adopted certain principles on which the unification of these six unions was to be undertaken. Each union was to vote on it not later than July 1, 1915.</p>
   <p>Because of unexpected difficulties arising after the convention, the dead line for the voting has been indefinitely postponed by the Svaz. But it is felt that by now all unions have had sufficient time to do what their official representatives agreed would be done, and that the work on the unification of at least the six unions which have expressed their willingness for it should be continued without further delay. It is to be regretted that the headquarters of other unions have been putting obstacles in the way of the unification in spite of the fact that a large majority of the members are agreeable to it. But where the membership has not sufficient power to make its officers do what it wants, such unions will have to be left alone, because no further delay of the unification appears possible.</p>
   <p>Desiring to bring the whole matter of unification to a successful conclusion, the Svaz Cesko-Slovanskych Podpurnych Jednot has agreed to call a convention of such unions as have agreed to the unification. This convention will be held in Chicago, beginning March 20, 1916. So far there are three such unions, to wit, the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota, the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporující Jednota, and the Cesko-Americka Jednota. In one union, the Jednota Taboritu, the idea has been rejected, the unification not having received the necessary two-thirds majority of the votes of its lodges, that is, fifteen votes. Thirteen lodges either have not voted or have not sent in their ballots within the time specified by the headquarters of the Tabor Union, that is, prior to August 15, 1915. One lodge mailed its ballots on August 14, but because they had not reached the headquarters on August 15, they were declared void. The ballots of that lodge would have changed entirely the outcome of the voting. To pass upon this action of the headquarters is, of course, up to the membership of the Jednota Taboritu. Most of the individual members of the Jednota favor the unification and it is hoped that the manipulations of its headquarters will be thwarted, because it has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction among the membership.</p>
   <p>In the Jednota Cesko-Americkych Lesniku a Lesnic the voting has taken place, but its grand lodge has declared that the voting cannot be considered valid because serious objections, of a legal and financial nature, have been advanced against the unification. As a matter of fact, however, many unifications of fraternal unions have taken place both this year and last year, and the unions are still in existence without being molested by state commissioners. The question of finances has been very thoroughly discussed in the financial secretary's report, and no objections to it have been filed.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovenske Podporující Spolky has met with opposition in its own headquarters office, which has refused to submit the conditions of the unification to its members. At first the headquarters office said the refusal was based on the constitution and bylaws, which, it was alleged, provide that a proposed change in the constitution must be presented by each lodge in a certain specified manner in a referendum to the members, and that the conditions of the unification constituted, in principle, a change in the constitution. When, however, one lodge presented that question in the proper form to its members, the grand lodge to which the lodge belongs asked the headquarters office of the Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky to what article of the constitution the proposed change referred. The headquarters office made no direct reply to that question but stated openly that it would not permit any voting because it is doubtful about the legality of the proposed unification. According to the constitution, the headquarters has no right to proceed in that way, but apparently that was considered immaterial. The legal aspects of the unification were fully discussed in the secretary's report to the convention, which included quotations from the best authorities, prominent corporation lawyers, who declared the unification possible from the legal point of view. Just as it is true that a person who dislikes a certain law can always find a lawyer who will advance the opinion that the law is invalid, so the foes of the unification have found a lawyer who will declare the unification illegal.</p>
   <p>The above constitutes, in brief, the history of the movement for unification up to this time.</p>
   <p>The results of the voting are as follows:</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota: for unification, 2,545 votes; against, 834 votes. Total, 3,379 votes; two-thirds majority, 2,252.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporující Jednota: for unification, 1,972 votes; against, 11 votes. Total, 1,983 votes; two-thirds majority, 1,322 votes.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Jednota: for unification, 818 votes; against, 24 votes; void, 4 votes. Total, 846 votes; two-thirds majority, 564 votes.</p>
   
   <p>The Jednota Taboritu: for unification, 900 votes, against, 472 votes. Total, 1,372 votes; two-thirds majority, 915 votes.</p>
   <p>The organ of the Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky maintains that there is very little interest in the voting. That this statement is incorrect is evident from the fact that no voting ever is participated in by the majority of the members. If the author of the article will consult the records of his own organization, he will be surprised. We call his attention to the referendum of the Modern Woodmen of America concerning an increase in dues, a matter of great importance to the membership. At that time the organization had one million members of whom only 50,000 voted. The Socialist party conducts a referendum on any important question, and it is rarely that more than twenty-five per cent of the ballots are returned. Anybody who has any experience in such matters will admit that the results of voting on the unification question snow considerable interest.</p>
   <p>In view of all these circumstances, the Svaz Cesko-Slovanskych Podporujících Jednot has found that it is impossible to wait until the interval affairs of the unions under discussion are settled, and has decided to undertake the unification of those unions which will signify their agreement and send their delegates to the convention. In view of the rather distant date of the convention, March 20, 1916, every union will have ample opportunity to make a final decision.</p>
   <p>By an expression of opinion, our public can render on this, as on any other public question, an important service. There is no doubt that the unification of our benevolent organizations would be profitable to the whole Bohemian Free Thought public, and would have a most beneficial influence upon the Free Thought movement. Certainly there are no obstacles which would make the realization of this idea impossible. We appeal, therefore, to our public to help by its influence to bring this matter to a successful issue, and to bear favorably in mind those unions which have shown their good will toward this worthy idea. It may be a truism, and against good taste to use it in these serious times, but we feel that the adage by which we end this proclamation is exceptionally fitting. Therefore we say, "In unity is strength".</p>
