   <p>We have just received the financial report of the Czechoslavak Benevolent Societies for the last six months, ending Dec. 31st. This report was arranged by the executive national committee very accurately, and carefully, and is very instructive to everybody.</p>
   <p>Ninety-nine societies accounted for themselves in this past year's report. A few new societies have been organized since then. The total number of members in the new plus the old societies amount to 5,540 members. There is $113,475 in the collective treasury. In the last six months $6,707 has been paid out for sick benefits to members; death policies, $15,676; death policies for the death of members' wives, $4,179. Other items such as the number of new members initiated in the last six months show exactly how remarkably the fraternities are growing, and what great hopes they may have for the future in case they will stay true to their cause and harmoniously fulfill their duties.</p>
