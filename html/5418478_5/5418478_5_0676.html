   <p>The board of representatives of the Cesko-Amerika Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) announced a most agreeable piece of news during yesterday's meeting. The administration of Riverview Park, the largest and most popular amusement park in Chicago, advised the board of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice that it is willing to donate all admission fees paid by Bohemians on any one night the board may designate. In other words, the management will give the board free of charge any number of admission tickets that the board will be able to dispose of among the friends of the hospital without any compensation to Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>Since all of the Sundays during the summer are taken up by picnics, outings, and excursions, the board thought the next best day would be a Saturday and selected Saturday, July 18.....</p>
   <p>In regard to the Hospital's finances, it was reported that the balance of $4,000 which is due on the property will soon be paid. After that the board will concentrate on the building of the addition, which is expected to cost $15,000. This amount will be secured by a loan on the paid-up property if the funds will not be on hand when needed.</p>
