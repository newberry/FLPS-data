   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) will have its own tag day this year on the joint tag day which was scheduled for May 15, 1922. One hundred and twenty-five ladies are needed to sell tags. Some of them have already offered their services for this noble cause. The tag day committee, whose chairwoman is Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, of 2438 South Lawndale Avenue, (telephone number Lawndale 1501), asks the ladies who are willing to offer their services on that day to call either Mrs. Cervenka or the office of the Spolecnost which is located at 2603 South Kedzie Avenue, telephone, Rockwell 1787. Fifty more ladies are needed to make the tag day a financial success. The Spolecnost spends about $10,000 annually supporting the deserving indigent Czech families, and more money for the continuation of this charitable work is sorely needed.</p>
