   <p>Yesterday's New Year celebration of the large, benevolent and nationalistic organization, Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Society), was a genuine manifestation.</p>
   <p>This New Year's celebration has been an annual event for many years and is arranged by the Grand Lodge of the society with the aid of the subordinate lodges of Chicago and vicinity. The celebration yesterday was somewhat a preliminary to the festive day in May, at which time the society will celebrate its twentieth anniversary. Twenty years of activity! How much good it has done in that period is known best by the public. Yes, indeed, the society has been active among Czechs for that period and is, therefore, rightfully deserving of the greatest respect if we take into consideration the great work which it has done during that time for the welfare of its members and in the national field. Every sincere countryman of ours will welcome with joy the report that the society is entering the New Year with the fullest hope for another twenty years, which will surely be even more fruitful and successful than the past twenty years. The large hall of Pilsen Sokol on Ashland Avenue was filled to capacity with members, their friends, and even the general public, all gathered to pay homage to a tireless meritorious work. The program was carefully arranged and served to show the good will of the arrangements committee to provide the audience with the best of entertainment. The celebration began with the playing of a festive march by the orchestra under the direction of Mr. M. Cada. Mr. E. Frydl, Grand Lodge President, spoke briefly, and ended with a wish for much success in the new year. The high light of the program was the festive speech by Dr. Frantisek Iska.....</p>
   <p>Then followed the report of the Grand Lodge Secretary, Mr. Hrvs: "We have had, for many years, a good habit in our society in that we meet on New Year's Day so that we may review what has been accomplished in the past year and what it is necessary to do for the further growth and success of the society. Numerically, our society was enlarged by three societies: Lodge Columbia, initiated on January 5, 1911; Lodge California, initiated on February 13, 1911; and Lodge Lipany, No. 63, initiated on July 21, 1911. In the journal of January 1, 1911, the report of the Secretary, it appears that there were 4,736 members in December, 1910. In the journal of January, 1912, the membership is listed as 5,220. According to the reports in the journal, the increase amounted to 484 members. To this should be added the initiates for December, numbering 50, making an increase of 534 members. In reality there were 893 members initiated into the society in the past year. This indicates a difference of 359 members between the initiates and the actual growth of the society, and this is accounted for by 66 deaths and 293 dropped for nonpayment of dues or resignations."</p>
   <p>The above report as well as the following report by the Grand Lodge Auditor, Mr. Hribal, were received with praise. Mr. Hribal reported: "Since the founding of the society 621 members have died, having a total insurance of $544,000. The sum of $533,261.67 has been paid out to the beneficiaries of the deceased members, leaving the society with liabilities of $10,739, against which the society has cash on hand, $1,294.80, cash due from subordinate lodges, $4,900, or a total of $6,194.80. Deducting this amount there still remains a liability of $4,544.20. Against this the society has $31,300 in bonds; cash in Grand Lodge fund, $1,098.53; accounts payable by subordinate lodges, $1,200, making a total of $33,598.53; after deducting the liability of $4,544.20, there remains a balance of $29,054.33. The number of members on January 1, 1911, was 4,747, on December 1, 1911, it was 5,220, increase in membership for eleven months was 473. Deaths from January 1, 1911 to January 1, 1912, were 66 members. Death benefit payments from January 1, 1911 to January 1, 1912, amounted to $55,750.</p>
