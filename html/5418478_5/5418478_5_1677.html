   <p>"He who gives promptly gives twice" ought to be the motto of all who intend, this coming Christmas, to make happy any of the hundreds of poor Bohemian families which are supported by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago). Members of the Christmas distribution committee, Alderman Anton J. Cermak, chairman; Mr. John A. Sokol, secretary; Mr. Anton Laadt, treasurer, Mr. K. V. Janovsky, and the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, appeal to the Bohemian people of the City of Chicago to provide funds for gifts to be distributed at Christmas time. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, has on its list hundreds of the poorest Bohemian families. During the whole year these families are supported by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The Association now is sending out an appeal to the more fortunate Bohemian families and individuals for gifts to help make Christmas more joyous for the needy. Whoever has a heart for the poor and forsaken should help the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost in its philanthropic task.</p>
