   <p>Only two more days remain before the tag day....In order that its results might be as successful as possible the co-operation of our Czechoslovak women and girls is needed. I issue, therefore, this call to you: Come and swell the ranks of our workers; consecrate Monday, May 15 to this most worthy cause to aid our poorest families. On this occassion let Your own hearts dictate to You and act accordingly. Picture to Yourselves Your own happy homes surrounded by comforts, your children well provided for against the inclemencies of weather carefree and happy; and then, by contrast, recall the unhappy conditions in which some of our suffering countrymen may be found: the head of the family bedridden, his wife tired out by incessant drudgery and unable to continue her work, the children half naked and exposed during their earliest infancy to the ravages and miseries of life....The charms of a happy fireside are not theirs to taste, unhappily do they live their childhood and it is quite possible that many of them would perish were it not for the work which the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) is doing to alleviate their misery and to <span class="page-break">2</span>render effective aid whenever and wherever it is needed.</p>
   <p>To accomplish its purposes fully, the Spolecnost must have a source of income, and for that purpose it was included among the rest of the charitable organizations of the city of Chicago which are to have a joint tag day on May 15, 1922. Our organization will participate in this and will cover the Bohemian sections of the city. We shall not have any specially distinguishing insignia, but in spite of it, give of your substance whether it is for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) or for us. Do not hesitate to give. He who gives now gives doubly. Open your hearts on this day and remember that we are the sons and daughters of a great mother--Mother Bohemia--and help! The knowledge that You have performed a good deed will warm your hearts....Therefore swell the ranks of our volunteer workers; make applications now and thus discharge your duties at once both charitable and national.</p>
   <p>Should there be someone among you who wishes to make a larger contribution, <span class="page-break">3</span>let him send such a contribution directly to the Spolecnost or to the chairwoman of the tag day committee, Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, 2438 South Lawndale Avenue. All contributions will be acknowledged with thanks. We also request that all the women members of the Spolecnost give their correct addresses so that our office records may be complete. Many of the letters sent by us were returned due to changes of address.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, chairwoman.</p>
