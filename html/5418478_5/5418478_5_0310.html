   <p>After last Sunday's meeting, the Czecho-Slavonic Union has sent out a call to all our fellow countrymen who do not yet belong to any aid society. It is expected that this step will boost the Union's membership. The Czecho-Slavonic Union has celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation this year. The first quarter of a century of its existence has produced results which augur a splendid future for the organization. In one of its latest meetings, insurance for children over two years of age was introduced. The financial status of the Union is excellent.</p>
