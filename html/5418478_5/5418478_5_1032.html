K. Soukup, immediately began to read the minutes of the past meeting. These were approved as read. The secretary then read a communication from the Illinois grand committee of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood) announcing that the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota had accepted as an obligations the duty of urging each member to make a voluntary contribution to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec of ten cents a year. The Sesterska Podporujici Jednota sent a check for $709.10 as head tax from 7,091 members. This announcement pleased the attending delegates immensely, and the president remarked how beautiful it would be if all the other Bohemian societies and organizations followed the noble example of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota. Then, he said, the Ceska <span class="page-break">2</span>Utulna a Sirotcinec, two of our foremost and most needed institutions, which can never be renounced by anybody, would not have to beg for support and eke out a bare existence on alms.
