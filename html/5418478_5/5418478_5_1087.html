   <p>The Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage) was made richer by a magnanimous donation of $100. This most welcome instance of generosity was shown by our enlightened countrymen, Alois, Antonin, Jan, Ludvik and Frank Nepil, who had honored the memory of their departed parents, Joseph and Therezie Nepil by donating the above-named amount to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec.</p>
   <p>This meritorious act of the brothers Nepil will surely be appreciated and its value recognized by everyone who takes an interest in an institution that we greatly need, the home for our orphans and old people. To honor the memory of departed parents in this way is an act that deserves to have many imitators. Thanks are due the noble-minded donors not only from the old people and orphans at the institute, but from all its friends.</p>
