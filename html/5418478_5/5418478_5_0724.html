   <p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) was held last night in the offices of the Pilsen Brewing Company at Albany Avenue and 26th Street. The meeting was presided over by Mr. John A. Cervenka, and its large attendance and the serious way in which all deliberations were conducted seem to us a definite indication that the project will meet with success. Treasurer Frank G. Hajicek reported various donations ranging from $1 to $300 and totaling $460.65. Dr. Neuman's motion to proceed with the printing of the constitution and bylaws and identification cards was carried.</p>
   <p>No meeting of the board will be held during the summer months, but all committees will continue their work. The next board meeting will be held September 11.</p>
