   <p>Despite the rainy weather which prevailed in Chicago last Wednesday afternoon the familiar precincts of the Pilsen Park pavilion were so overcrowded by the attending well-wishers of our foremost charitable institutions--the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage)--on the occasion of the annual concert, that the managing committee was beside itself with joy. Thanks to the tireless efforts of its members and the large number of tickets mailed out by them, the concert netted a considerable amount of money which will help to fill the depleted coffers of the institution.</p>
   <p>The program of the evening was started by Mr. F. J. Petru who, as chairman of the managing committee, gave a brief address [of welcome]. The next item on the program was a selection of musical compositions played by the <span class="page-break">2</span>Ceskoslovenska Hudebni Federace (Czechoslovak Federation of Musicians) Orchestra. This organization deserves special mention, for it gives its services gratuitously every year on the occasion of our charity concerts. The orchestral music was followed by two recitations--one in Bohemian and another in English--by two wards of our Orphanage. Both girls were richly rewarded by applause. The next number was Mr. Jiri Hrusa's violin presentation. Mr. Hrusa, who is well known by our countrymen as a violin virtuoso, played several difficult compositions by the old masters. He was followed by Miss Marie Nebozka who gained the hearts of the audience by her splendid recitation of one of Jan Neruda's ballads. Then came the eagerly awaited performance by the Orphanage boys' orchestra. The boys, besides playing the national anthem, gave renditions of various songs and were loudly acclaimed.</p>
   <p>After a brief intermission the program continued. Most of the artists who performed during this second part of the program were well-known people. Mrs. Schnabl, an opera singer from Domazlice, and only recently arrived in <span class="page-break">3</span>Chicago, sang an aria from B. Smetana's opera "Libuse," accompanied on the piano by her son; Mrs. Ottilie Splavec, who greatly enriched the program by her dramatic recitation of a poem; and Miss Helena Fris, who gave a splendid piano solo. Then the youthful Helena Zajicek danced two ballet numbers, Miss Fris accompanying her on the piano.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who is a candidate for the office of president of the County Board of Commissioners, was then introduced to the audience. The sympathetic applause which greeted Mr. Cermak was proof of how well liked this leader of Chicago liberals is by our own countrymen. His brief address given in Czech and in English brought forth a storm of applause. Similarly warm plaudits greeted Mr. Josef Mendl who is a candidate for the office of member of the County Board of Commissioners.</p>
   <p>The last number on the program was performed by Mr. Evzen De Rubini whose <span class="page-break">4</span>efforts were also gratefully received. Thus ended the program which fully satisfied the attending public.</p>
