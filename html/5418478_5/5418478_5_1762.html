   <p>A check for the sum of $197,455 was received by mail at the office of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada V Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America), Saturday morning, from the Czechoslovak Consulate General in New York, which sum will be used to pay compensation to those senders whose shipments of gifts were aboard the lost steamship "Liberty Glo".</p>
   <p>Taking into consideration the fact that there are about 3,000 senders, it is not possible, of course, to pay everyone in a week's time. Two officials of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada V Americe will be kept busy making out the checks, which, of course, will take some time. The checks will be signed at the meeting of the Ceskosloverska Narodni Rada V Americe, to be held April 14. On the next day, April 15, every sender whose shipment was either lost or damaged should receive his check.</p>
   
   <p>In consequence of this, the senders are requested by the office of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada V Americe not to bother it with useless inquiries unless it is absolutely necessary. This will facilitate and hasten the work of officials, to the benefit of every sender.</p>
