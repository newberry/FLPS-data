   <p>Kindly print the report of the effort undertaken by me for the benefit of Mrs. Ludmila Inneman, a widow, who first sang the role of Marenka from the opera "Prodana Nevesta" (The Bartered Bride) when this opera was first presented in Chicago, way back in the year of 1893. [List of donors is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Additional contributions will be gratefully accepted by Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, 2438 South Lawndale Avenue; Mr. Joseph Jurka, 1903 Washburne Avenue; and Mr. Vaclav B. Kosner, 2643 South Central Park Avenue.</p>
   <p>On the twenty-second of June I sent the sum of five thousand Czechoslovakian kronen to Mrs. Ludmila Inneman, who now lives in Czechoslovakia. This sum is equivalent to $70.50.</p>
