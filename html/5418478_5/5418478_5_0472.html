   <p>Successful indeed was the New Year's celebration held by the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity) in the Pilsen Sokol Hall, at Ashland Avenue and 18th Street. It is an annual event, since almost without exception the Jednota every year prepares a refined New Year's Eve entertainment for its members and friends. Yesterday's event was really very successful.....</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Jednota was founded in May, 1892 when, because of intolerable conditions in the Knights and Ladies of Honor Society, it became necessary for several of its Bohemian lodges to secede and found the independent Jednota Cesko-Slovanskych Rytiru A Dam [Unity of Bohemian-Slavonic Knights and Ladies]--the present Cesko-Slovanska Jednota. In a few years, the Jednota was enlarged by taking in a number of lodges and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organizations which did not employ the Bohemian language, so that our Jednota is now rightly called a refuge of all those of European origin who have been disappointed in foreign-speaking organizations. In November, the Jednota had sixty-four lodges with 5,513 members. During its existence, it has paid out $592,371 in life insurance. The reserve fund amounted to $36,200.04, and total assets of the Jednota to $39,428.48.</p>
   <p>Insurance with the Jednota is valuable and safe, no court action is necessary when a policy falls due, as is frequently the case with societies of other nationalities. It is therefore desirable that the Jednota grow and the principle be put into operation that each Bohemian belong to the Bohemian Jednota. It was through the Jednota's efforts that the S. C. P. S. [Sdruzeni Cesko-Slovanskych Podpurnich Spolku, Association of Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies] came into being, in which benevolent body there are six individual benevolent organizations represented.....</p>
   <p>The Jednota's slogan is "May our national aims flourish." Therefore, no <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>one should hesitate to become a member. Every healthy man or woman of good reputation will be accepted. The value of the insurance policies is $1000, $500, or $250.....</p>
