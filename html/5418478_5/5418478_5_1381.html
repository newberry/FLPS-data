   <p>In the Cornell Square Park field house, on the occasion of a reception of new members of the Spolek Matek, cis. 3 (Bohemian [Gold Star] Mothers' Club No. 3), all of whom were either the mothers or the wives and sisters of fallen Bohemian soldiers of the World War, a collection was attempted for the benefit of crippled soldiers. The collection totaled, $15.70. One hundred and fifty-seven new members were initiated. [Names of donors and the amounts contributed by each are omitted in translation. The total of all contributions (not the above figure) was $66.20.] The Spolek wishes all members to know that it is most grateful.</p>
