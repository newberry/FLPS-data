   <p>p. 1.. Last Sunday afternoon a large group of our countrymen gathered at the Bohemian-American Hall on West 18th Street, to attend the 9th annual celebration of Pilsen Lodge No. 80 "Cesko-Slovanska Jednota" (Czecho-Slovak Unity). A short meeting was held first, then the honorary and chartered members' sons were admitted into the lodge. They each received a ring with their birthstone in it.</p>
   <p>During the introduction, the musicians played, the orchestra being conducted by Mr. Horna. Then Mr. Malik delivered a very impressive speech. A luncheon was then served, but before the lunch was served Mr. Hlavaty suggested that while everyone is about to partake in the luncheon, we should not forget the Old People's Home and the Bohemian Orphanage Asylum. At this suggestion, immediately a collection was taken up and the exact amount of $9.00 was collected.</p>
   <p>This was quite a coincidence: 9th annual celebration, 9 juveniles admitted into the lodge, and $9.00 collected for these institutions. The Bohemians at any kind of an affair, always should remember to take up a collection.</p>
