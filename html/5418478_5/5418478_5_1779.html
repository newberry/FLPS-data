   <p>That Czechoslovak-America is good hearted and is always ready to make sacrifices for a really good cause or for a righteous person, Joseph Spika, legionnaire, will be convinced today. He is lying in the County Hospital eagerly awaiting the time when he will be able to resume his pilgrimage around the world, on his way home. He will be convinced by the new donations deposited for him.....</p>
   <p>Total donations deposited in our office amount to $210.25. Besides this amount, a certificate for one hundred Czechoslovakian Kronen was deposited with us.</p>
   <p>To this we add that Spika's sister, Mrs. Anna Jansova, at our request, deposited the sum of $82 in our office, which is all the money thus far donated to Spika at the hospital. The reason why we requested her to do this is that at the hospital, where everyone has admittance, his money, might have been stolen by some unconscionable person.....</p>
