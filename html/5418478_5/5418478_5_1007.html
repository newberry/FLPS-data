   <p>The secretary of the board of directors, Mr. Joseph Trnka, then read the minutes of the board of director's meetings held March 24, April 1, and April 12, 1921, as follows:</p>
   <p>The meeting of the board of directors of the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince was held in the Husuv Jubilejni Dum (John Huss Memorial Building), March 24, at 8 P. M. [Names of directors who attended the meeting are omitted in translation.] The meeting was called for the purpose of holding a conference in regard to securing a new matron and other help for the institution. The meeting was presided over by Mr. A. Charvat; Mr. J. Trnka was the secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. Antonin Charvat, presented for consideration the matter <span class="page-break">\4</span>concerning the existing conditions in the Orphanage, facts that are well known to all members of the board of directors. For instance, because of the incapable personnel, especially the matron, discipline and obedience among the children of the Orphanage slackened to such an extent that in some cases physical punishment had to be inflicted. Inasmuch as such punishment is not expected to restore discipline, the whole matter was placed before the board of directors for consideration. In order to secure a qualified matron and other necessary personnel for the Orphanage, advertisements were placed in our daily newspapers. Answers were received, but none of the applicants met the requirements of the office of matron. A matron should be a woman who can devote all of her time to the institution. All the applications so far received came from women who have their own families to care for. Various propositions of how to secure a qualified person for this office were presented. Finally, through the efforts of Mrs. Urbanek, Mrs. Bozena Krabec agreed to accept the office and will try to restore order and discipline in the Orphanage. It was further proposed and unanimously <span class="page-break">\5</span>approved that those inmates who seem to be incorrigible and who would only hinder the restoration of discipline, should be picked out and sent back to their parents or relatives.</p>
   <p>It was also announced that a janitor is needed for the Orphanage. Messrs. Charvat and Trnka were authorized to hire a man for this work.....Mrs. Urbanek and members of the so-called house committee were authorized to provide and purchase anything that they think is needed in the Orphanage. Because of the late hour, the chairman adjourned the meeting and further proceedings were deferred to the mext meeting.</p>
   <p>The regular meeting of the board of directors of the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince was held in the office of the institution on Friday evening, April 1, and was attended by all of the directors. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Charvat; Mr. Trnka was the secretary. The minutes of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>previous meeting were approved as read. Bills amounting to $2,128.57 were recommended to the board of delegates for approval.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to pay out the sum of $246.84 to the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-Slavonic Union for Marie David, an inmate of the institution, and to continue paying assessments on her one-thousand-dollar life insurance.</p>
   <p>A communication received from the Department of Buildings of the City of Chicago, and in which the erection of a stairway and a certain exit in the hospital building is ordered, was referred to the building committee. A communication received from the Chicago Board of Health, with reference to new toilet rooms, was deferred.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Brychta announced that the Ladies' Society of Bohemian California [a Bohemian district of Chicago] bought a quantity of utensils for the institution. Through the efforts of Mrs. Hrisny, the Shedd Park Club arranged a minstrel <span class="page-break">\7</span>show in the Orphanage on March 13. It was also brought to the attention of the directors that Mrs. Bozena Krabec cannot, for personal reasons, accept the office of matron.....</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince, Mr. Vojtech Suchy, presented a letter sent to him by the chief inspector of orphan asylums in the state of Illinois, Mr. Charles Virden. This gentleman had been invited to inspect our Orphanage, and according to his letter, he was not fully satisfied with the administration of the same. In his letter, he gives several suggestions leading to the improvement of conditions and management of the institution. The contents of the letter were taken into consideration and after a brief debate, it was resolved to follow his suggestions.</p>
   <p>The manager of the institution, Mr. V. K. Soukup, then presented his written <span class="page-break">\8</span>resignation, saying that his health and personal business do not permit him to hold this important office any longer. The resignation of Mr. V. K. Soukup was accepted with the understanding that he will hold this office until a new manager is appointed. It was decided to advertise in our daily newspapers for a new manager, and Messrs. Charvat and Suchy were authorized to interview all the applicants and, if necessary, give them more detailed information. The meeting then was adjourned.</p>
   <p>The meeting of the board of directors of the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince was held Tuesday evening, April 12, 1921, at the Husuv Jubilejni Dum. [Names of directors who attended the meeting are omitted in translation.] The purpose of this meeting, as was previously agreed, was to read the applications received for the office of manager of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, and to decide whether or not any of the applications should be accepted. The meeting was presided over by Mr. A. Charvat. He read the many individual applications. Each was taken into consideration and thoroughly discussed. The directors were <span class="page-break">\9</span>fully aware of the importance of their task. A decision was finally reached, and Mr. A. Charvat and Mrs. Marie Urbanek were authorized to give a personal interview to one of the applicants, Mr. Jaroslav Bukovsky, who at present time is a reporter for the Denni Hlasatel. If the said applicant meets the requirements of the office of manager of our institutions, he should be appointed as soon as possible. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
   <p>To comply with a written request of the board of directors of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association, it was decided to permit all the children of the Orphanage to appear in the Memorial Day program. Several of the women delegates protested against the appointment of Mr. Jaroslav Bukovsky as manager. The chairman promised to investigate the objections. The secretary, Mrs. Bozena Krabec, then announced that this year's tag day for the benefit of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec will fall on Monday, May 23, and that those ladies who will volunteer their services on that day will hold a meeting and be given tags on May 21, in the Pilsen Sokol Hall.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>According to the report of a public accountant, receipts of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec during the past year amounted to $41,534.01; disbursements, $32,980.52. Receipts for the month of March totaled $1,903.42; disbursements, $2,338.21. Following several proposals for the benefit of the Association, the meeting adjourned.</p>
