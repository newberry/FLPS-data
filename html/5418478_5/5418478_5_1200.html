   <p>The administration of Svatopluk Cech Park, is notifying parents that the work with children inside the park building will begin tomorrow, October 14. The gymnasiums for both boys and girls will be open from 3:30 to 9:30 P. M. The hours for school children are from 3:30 to 6 P. M., for employed youths, 7 to 9 P. M. The gymnastic teacher for the boys is Mr. Frat. Zettek whose experience guarantees that he will train the boys in all that is beneficial for their health. Boys nine years old and up are admitted. The age of admission for girls is the same. They will be taught various healthful exercises, steps, and drills by Miss Snevely, and they will drill to the piano accompaniment of Miss M. Petru.</p>
   <p>Children under nine years of age will also be taken care of. They will have a large room of their own, directed by Miss Goldsmith, who will play with them and keep an eye on them daily from 3 to 5 P. M.</p>
   <p>Every Saturday from 2 to 3 P. M., children of eight years and up will be <span class="page-break">2</span>taught Bohemian folk songs by Mr. Liska of the Conservatory of Music of Prague. All instruction is absolutely free of charge. We therefore urge parents not to miss the opportunity of sending their children to the Park as soon as they return from school. They will be much better taken care of than if they were on the streets where there is constant danger.....</p>
