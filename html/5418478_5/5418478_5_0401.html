   <p>It is a very common experience to read in various newspapers about lawsuits which heirs are obliged to file against non-Bohemian benevolent societies when these societies, for various reasons, refuse to pay out the expected death benefits, and there are certain specific societies in which such suits are particularly frequent. What a hardship it is for the heirs to go to the courts of law in order to get money which is theirs by right is easy to imagine. Most frequently, such suits involve a wife and her children who have lost their provider and are in most difficult circumstances. A prompt payment of the death benefit would be a real blessing for them, but instead, they have to go to the law, wait a long time--sometimes for years--before the litigation comes to an end, and after all that, they have to spend most of the money they eventually get for court and lawyers' fees.</p>
   <p>It would be unjust to blame the societies in every case, because it sometimes happens that it is a member's own fault when heirs have to sue for the benefits.</p>
   
   <p>American societies are conducted strictly along hard business lines, and when there is a chance of refusing the payment of a death benefit, all brotherly feelings and principles cease. In this they act very much like some insurance companies which always look around for a reason to refuse the payment, and very frequently succeed.</p>
   <p>Our benevolent societies act according to principles which are different from these. Here the principles of brotherhood are always considered, and none of our societies would think of refusing the payment of a death benefit for a trifling reason. They know that the money goes to a widow who may have to raise several children, and only a very important reason could cause refusal to pay out whatever benefit may be due the family of a deceased member. They always consider the fact that the member had paid his dues for many years and paid them with the purpose in mind of preventing the worst kind of suffering and distress from reaching his loved ones, and that his widow and children are fully entitled to the money. Payment is refused only in cases where it would definitely be illegal.</p>
   
   <p>Just recently a lawsuit took place in which the heirs were refused the payment because the member, a woman, did not give her right name when applying for membership. We suppose that, according to the letter of the law, this was sufficient reason for refusal to pay the benefit, but at the same time, it is true that the member had been paying all her dues regularly, that there are children here for whose benefit the payments had been made, and that otherwise everything else was in perfect order. Probably many of our own societies have similar provisions in their bylaws, but we believe that their officers would think first before they would dare to consider this one reason as sufficient for a refusal to pay out the death benefit to the children for whom it had accumulated.</p>
   <p>But, at the same time, such cases should be regarded as a warning against such irregularities as giving the wrong name when taking out membership in a benevolent society, no matter where and what kind. The same applies to other data, such as age, address, etc. Care and accuracy will always protect the heirs from such lawsuits, and this should be remembered not only by those who apply for membership in non-Bohemian societies, but also by those who turn to our own. A member who acts according to this advice and always follows the provisions of the bylaws of his benevolent society need not fear that his heirs will have to go to the courts for their inheritance.</p>
