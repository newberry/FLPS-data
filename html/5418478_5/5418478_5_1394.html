   <p>The druggist, Mr. Louis Scheffel, mailed us a check for $5 which is to be transmitted to the Utulna A Sirotcinec in the name of the Chicago Retail Druggists Association. The latter organization has a special fund for the purchase of flowers for the graves of deceased members; the recently deceased member, Mr. Vojta Vavra, expressed a wish before his demise, however, that no flower offerings were to be made, and therefore a gift of ten dollars was made for a good cause. Of this amount five dollars was given to the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage) and five dollars to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa (Saint Joseph's Orphanage, at Lisle, Illinois). The gift for the Saint Joseph's Orphanage was mailed to the publishing office of the Narod. We may add that the Bohemian druggists of Chicago are very active in the aforenamed druggist's association, and that this year they have three Czech officials--Messrs. Louis Scheffl, Frantisek Dubsky, and Frantisek Kara.</p>
