   <p>The first year of the existence of the Cesky Damsky Pomocny Spolek (Czech Ladies Aid Society) has been completed, and a plenary meeting gave an account of its activities. During the first months the society, which had no initial funds, was entirely dependent upon the membership dues of only 25 cents per two months. This income was augmented by the yield of small entertainments with raffles, for which each member usually donated some small object of interest or commercial value. A fund was built up in this manner, and when the society ventured to hold a picnic in Pilsen park, its treasury gained $550.</p>
   <p>The ambitions of the society are directed toward extending aid to poor families and the support of orphans. The society also acts as practical adviser to the destitute, whose predicament can often be traced to ignorance in the handling of domestic affairs.</p>
