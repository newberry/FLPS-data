   <p>At the meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society (Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky), Reverend Vaclav Vanek enthusiastically explained the purpose of the Immigrant Home which he founded in Baltimore. He asked the Grand Lodge for contributions for the upkeep of the institution. The Reverend Vanek's request was not refused; such a request could never have been ignored by the men who are always among the first to contribute to any humanitarian cause. Ten dollars was donated for the benefit of the Immigrant Home, and in addition, all subordinate lodges will be urged to make generous contributions to the institution. We know, from past experiences, that it will be unnecessary to urge the lodges to assist in this beneficent cause. The Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society Lodges have done much good; they have never wavered from their objective of giving aid, both moral and financial, wherever a need has been indicated.</p>
