   <p>The Chicago members of the Zapadni Ceska Bratrska Jednota (Western Bohemian Fraternal Association) launched a membership drive for the purpose of establishing an Illinois organization which would later become a part of this great benevolent association....At the present time there are about two hundred members of the Jednota in Chicago who belong to lodges situated in other states; all in all, forty-six lodges from the states of California, Colorado, Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North and South Dakota are represented by the Chicago group.</p>
   <p>The said two hundred men are the former members of lodges situated in the above-mentioned states, but the constitution [of the Jednota] does not permit them to create an independent lodge. An attempt to secure such a privilege will be made at the next convention of the Jednota which will be held next September in Omaha.</p>

   <p>It was with this end in view that propaganda was started recently in this city so that a definite proposition may be made during the convention showing the advantages of such a change. During the next meeting of the local group, to be held on Sunday, May 28, 1922 at 2 P. M., in Mr. Kafka's hall, 26th Street and Avers Avenue, the members will discuss this matter further. The temporary secretary....is Mr. Jiri M. Kristufek....who also advised us that this year will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Jednota. This occasion will be celebrated by the Chicago members also.</p>
