   <p>The office of County Agent is one of the great charitable county departments which require large sums of money, especially in the winter time when thousands of poor families must be cared for. Expenditures of this office during the past year amounted to $720,611; this amount includes the office running expenses, pensions, etc., and can be explained by the fact that during the month of March, assistance was given to 3,220 families. During the month of July, 1,853 families were assisted, which was the smallest number of the year.</p>
   <p>A record shows that on the list of those who received assistance, there were 83 Bohemian families, 88 widows, 26 deserted families, 4 single women, 3 divorced women, and 4 widowers with children, making a total of 208 of our countrywomen and countrymen to whom aid was extended.</p>
