   <p>The annual festival of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Union) held January 1 at Pilsen Sokol hall attracted so many of our countrymen that the spacious auditorium was filled to capacity. Dr. Karel Neumann, president of the grand lodge, opened the program at 2 P. M. with a brief speech. The speaker was rewarded with a storm of applause. Mrs. Otilie Splavec then entertained the audience with a humorous act, for which she also reaped spontaneous applause.....</p>
