   <p>The Sbor Utulny A Sirotcince (board of delegates to the Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage) arranges a concert every year for the benefit of the inmates of that institution. An opportunity is thus given to our charitable people to contribute in small amounts to this very important cause, and at the same time to be pleasantly entertained. Consequently it is not so much a sacrifice to be placed on the altar of charity by paying admission to a fine concert.</p>
   <p>This evening will mark the ninth annual concert given by the Utulna. The affair will take place in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue, and it is desirable that the spacious pavilion hall be well filled by our public. The entertainment committee, which worked very hard to make the concert a success, prepared the following program:</p>

   <p>The concert begins sharply at 8 P.M. Let us hope that the attendance will be large which will be a proof that the Czechoslovaks of Chicago know how to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>honor an institution to which they may point with pride.</p>
