   <p>P.1--The Garden City Brewers' Association has donated $100 to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage Association of Chicago, and the same amount to the Bohemian Catholic Orphans' Home at Lysle, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Last Wednesday the stock-holders of the Garden City Brewery met to elect their board of directors. In this meeting they also voted unanimously to send their annual donation to the societies already mentioned.</p>
   <p>Our national and local benevolent societies would never be short of funds if all our large Bohemian business-houses and concerns, remembered them as the Bohemian Brewers, do in the way of financial support. It is with great pride and joy that we point to the wonderful support which we have received from them. The Bohemian Brewers donate annually towards this humanitarian undertaking.</p>
   <p>One must admit that the breweries operated by Bohemians, are succesful. We all wish them success in the future because they are Bohemian enterprises, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and because they do not shirk their duty to cooperate with Bohemian benevolent societies.</p>
   <p>We hope that others will take this as an example and will do their share toward the support of this worthy cause.</p>
