   <p>The tag day organized by the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) on May 15, 1922 brought $1,919.17. [The amounts collected by each of the ladies are omitted in translation.] Our thanks go to these ladies who gave of their time that the tag day might be successful, and without their unstinting efforts such a success would have been impossible. We also thank Mr. Kostecka for his delivering of the empty boxes....and to Mr. Arthur Bitsky for taking the full boxes downtown. Our full gratitude goes to Mrs. Josefa Vich for her work in Cicero, Illinois. We are likewise indebted to Mrs. Boezner of Ceska Kalifornie (Bohemian California, [a Bohemian settlement in Chicago]), and finally to Mesdames Zahlava and Vellik, Mr. Zika, manager of the Pilsen Sokol, the Sokols themselves for granting us the use of their hall for our meetings....</p>
