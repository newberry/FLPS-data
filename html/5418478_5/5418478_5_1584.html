   <p>If anyone of our readers did not perform his duty as an American toward suffering Czechoslovakia, as Mr. Herbert Hoover asked in his great campaign undertaken throughout the United States for contributions in behalf of suffering children in the young republic; if anyone did not perform his duty as an American Czechoslovak, to thom this newspaper has been appealing for such a long time; and if anyone did not perform his duty toward the children in Czechoslovakia who are calling for help, he can still do so.</p>
   <p>Contributions toward the Hoover's Relief Fund, for suffering children in Czechoslovakia, may be deposited in our office until March 15, 1921. All contributions received by us until that day will be sent to Dr. Bedrich Stepanek, Czechoslovak ambassador at Washington D. C., with a request to deliver these contributions to Mr. Herbert Hoover as a collection undertaken by the Denni Hlasatel in behalf of his relief fund.</p>

   <p>All contributions sent to us later on also will be accepted, but will be equally divided by us between the Dr. Alice Masaryk Fund and the Bohemian Orphanage in Brno, and will be sent directly to Czechoslovakia.....</p>
