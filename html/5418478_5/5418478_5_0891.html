   <p>p. 1.. Mr. Joseph Lio, deposited with the administration of this newspaper the sum of $15, collected at the silver wedding of Mr. Frank and Mrs. Marie Majer, 840 Allport Street. The silver wedding anniversary was held the third day of May of this year, and while the children, relatives, and friends were enjoying themselves, they have not failed to remember the inmates of our institutions, this is the reason for the collection, taken up for the benefit of the Old People's Home and the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Many thanks are expressed to those who were so kind and thoughtful.</p>
