   <p>The dance given by "Vlasta" (Women's Society) last Saturday was a grand National entertainment, which not only afforded pleasure to the guests but was a great success in all respects. The Hall-room was beautifully decorated and upon the stage stood a beautiful floral piece. The ladies themselves waited on the guests besides performing all official and committee duties. Between dancing there was speaking and singing. The prologue was delivered by the President of "Vlasta," Mrs. B. Pitt.</p>
   <p>The entertainment continued until morning. The ladies of this new lodge have been before the public twice now. The first time in collecting clothing for our poor unfortunate countrymen out West, who were burned out by the Indians and now the second time with their Ball.</p>
   <p>They are generally recognized by the entire community and we hope that after this successful beginning they will continue to labor in their hereditary national role.</p>
