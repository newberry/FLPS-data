   <p>The Pilsen Brewery Company, which recently assumed the new name of "Pilsen Products Company", has always been one of the most willing and most generous of our local Czechoslovak-American corporations as far as our national and philanthropic activities are concerned. The corporation, headed by its president, Mr. John A. Cervenka, is very well known, especially since the time when the liberation movement was in full swing and when bazaars and other projects, long to be remembered by local Czechoslovaks, were arranged. The Pilsen Products Company enthusiastically and generously supported every one of these splendid projects and still carries on this work with the came enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Responding to the urgent call which is being published every day in our newspaper in behalf of suffering children in Czechoslovakia, the corporation, through its secretary, Mr. A. F. Jirousek, deposited in our office a check for one hundred dollars as its own contribution, plus ninety dollars in cash, <span class="page-break">\2</span>representing the result of a collection undertaken among the members of the board of directors for the above-mentioned purpose. The following gentlemen contributed to the collection: [There follows a long list of contributions.]</p>
   <p>We joyfully report both of these contributions, and we hope that the example of the Pilsen Products Company will be followed by other Czechoslovak corporations of Chicago during the next few days.</p>
