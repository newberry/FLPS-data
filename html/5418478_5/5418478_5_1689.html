A collection list was included in every communication.</p>
   <p>Mr. Emil Prochazka, 2527 South Sawyer Avenue, was the first one of our countrymen who came to our office with the collection list filled with names of the contributors. As soon as he received the communication, he generously undertook a collection for this most meritorious purpose.

The following countrymen contributed: [There follow the names and amounts.] Total, twenty-four dollars.</p>
