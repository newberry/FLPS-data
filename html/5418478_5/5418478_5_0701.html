   <p>The regular weekly meeting of the board of directors of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) was held in the offices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society) last Tuesday night.....</p>
   <p>The directors were most agreeably surprised by a letter from Mrs. Marie E. Storkan containing a check for $500. The letter explained that the donation was being made upon request of her deceased mother who before her death had generously supported the movement to build the Bohemian-American Hospital.....</p>
   <p>President John A. Cervenka reported the proposal of the Ceske Divadlo (Bohemian Theater), a group of actors appearing regularly in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, which has offered to arrange a theatrical masquerade, half of the proceeds of which would go to the Hospital Association. The offer suggests that publicity for the masquerade would not be launched before January 4, the day of the concert for the benefit of the Cesko-Americka <span class="page-break">2</span>Nemocnice....The offer was accepted on condition that the Hospital Association shall not be held responsible for any possible deficit this affair might incur. Negotiations with the Ceske Divadlo on this point will soon begin.</p>
   <p>This offer led to the idea of appointing a committee of three who would take care of matters of this kind. The committee would deal directly with societies, clubs, etc., and would offer its co-operation. The president will appoint such a committee in the near future....</p>
   <p>Cervenka reported that he and Dr. Fisher had been looking for a convenient hall where the proposed concert could be held. They would prefer the hall of Sokol Chicago. January 4, 1914 being a Sunday, the hall will be available in the afternoon, and possibly also in the evening, since the amateur actors of the Sokol Chicago would be willing to forego the use of the hall that night. Everything depends on the rental which the Sokol Chicago is <span class="page-break">3</span>to specify at its next meeting. The admission will be one dollar for main-floor seats and fifty cents for gallery seats....</p>
