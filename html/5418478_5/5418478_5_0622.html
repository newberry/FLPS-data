   <p>The convention of the fraternal brotherhood, the "C.S.P.S." (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Association) was brought to order by brother Robt. Pitte, yesterday morning with a hearty welcome to the visiting delegates from all the cities where the C.S.P.S. has its branches.</p>
   <p>Then came roll-call and the presentation of credentials by the delegates. The chairman's gavel was turned over to Brother Rychlik, of Cleveland, the retiring chairman of the National Grand Lodge. The new chairman expressed the thanks of those present to the Grand Lodge of Illinois for the work and time it devoted to making the arrangements for this convention. After a short welcoming address by Brother Pitte, the convention proceeded to administer the third degree to those Brothers not previously so honored.</p>
   <p>Next in the order of proceedings was the election of committees, namely two. (1) A committee to examine the credentials of delegates. (2) A committee to work out rules of procedure for the daily order of business. These committees were composed of one delegate from each State.</p>
