   <p>In the latest issue of the organ of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society) [usually abbreviated C. S. P. S.], Brother J. V. Lunak discusses the value of employing organizers. Some time ago, the C. S. P. S. decided that an organizer was not necessary. Mr. Lunak points to the big insurance companies, which spend very large amounts for salaries and commissions for their agents and prosper in spite of large overhead. The United States Government, likewise, has spent large amounts on propaganda for military insurance. This expense should really not have been necessary, for Uncle Sam's offer is so reasonable that none of the aid societies can compete with it. The insurance campaign conducted by that branch of the Government produced excellent results, so that over 95 per cent of all soldiers and sailors are insured. Vigorous activity lies at the bottom of this success. Even the best cause cannot be properly enchanced without propulsion.</p>
   
   <p>Only the Western Brotherhood among our units has an organizer, and the best proof that he is of good use is that this office was not abolished at the last plenary meeting, although some of the delegates voted for this move. Other units have not recognized the usefulness of organizers. Their convictions are supported by the fact that the brotherhoods' business is conducted on a sound, thoroughly honest basis, guided by strict economy, so that perfect security is guaranteed.</p>
   <p>The great American insurance companies cannot, however, do without organizers and agents, and Mr. Lunak expatiates on this point: "Every organization granting death benefits or charitable aid of any sort must have a man who is able to explain and set forth the advantages offered. The brotherhoods must become aware of the necessity of methods which contact the bulk of our people and canvass those who are not willing to join on their own initiative or are reluctant in general. Thousands may sign up when first approached, but hundreds of thousands have to be urged and shown clearly just why they should become members. Dutiful and sincere members have come from these two classes of people, but it takes unceasing propaganda to win them over.</p>
   <p>Our brotherhoods need agitators, organizers, or agents, and they need them very badly. They cannot accomplish very much without them; they must face this overhead expense, no matter how they may calculate and economize.</p>
