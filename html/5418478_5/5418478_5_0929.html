   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Sbor Utulny a Sirotcinec (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) took place last night in the lower hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), May and 18th Streets. The meeting started promptly at 8 P. M. with Mr. Vojtech Suchy presiding. The attendance was large and the deliberations of the Sbor very active, even stormy at times. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read.</p>
   <p>The correspondence received during the month was as follows: A communication from the Jaroslava Lodge No. 8 of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union), informing the Sbor that Mrs. Ruzena Lorenz is its new delegate to supersede its retiring delegate, Mrs. Marie Kristan. A letter from the Vlasta Lodge No. 9 of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood), enclosing <span class="page-break">\2</span>a gift of $15....The investigating committee recommended the admission of the following applicants (some of whom were already admitted and now reside in the Utulna): Mrs. Marie Dorotka, 63 years old; Josef Koukol, 6 years old; Robert Koukol, 4 years old; Vladimir Pachman, 5 years old; Vlasta Pachman, 7 years old; Josef Havelka, 5 years old; Robert Kozel, 4 years old.</p>
   <p>The treasurer of the Sbor, Mr. Petru, announced that the annual concert given by our institutions will be given this year on October 5, 1922, and as usual, will take place in the pavilion of Pilsen Park. He also explained the difficulties in maintaining the property on Warren Avenue, and was of the opinion that it would be better to dispose of it. The sale of this property was approved. Mr. Petru further reported that Mr. Pechar, the stone mason, who purchased a part of the aforementioned property, paid $75 as part payment and gave his note for $500.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the board of directors, Mr. Trnka, arrived at the meeting and <span class="page-break">\3</span>read the minutes of three meetings of that board. The minutes contained the following: In the meetings of the board of directors, the three children of Rudolf Zettek were admitted to the Sirotcinec, as were also the two children belonging to Josef Koukol. The fathers of these children obligated themselves to pay for their keep, and the children are already residing in the institution. Adolf Tachman, who made an application to have his two children admitted into the Sirotcinec, informed the board that he will be unable to pay the fee for their maintenance. He was referred to the Juvenile Court and his children were admitted to the institution. The aged Mrs. Marie Dorotka [vide supra], a member of the Svojanov Lodge of the Ceska Sesterska Jednota, made an application for admission to the Utulna. Her condition required that immediate steps be taken to have her admitted by the board. This was done and she was admitted.</p>
   <p>The secretary read the letter of resignation of the manager of the Utulna a Sirotcinec, Mr. Bohumil Fischer. After some discussion his resignation was <span class="page-break">\4</span>accepted; both Mr. and Mrs. Fischer were greatly overburdened with work during the eighteen months following an operation which Mrs. Fischer had to undergo. The board realized that their claim, was just, accepted their resignation, and at the same time decided to advertise in the two Bohemian dailies, the Svornost and the Denni Hlasatel, to the effect that there is an opening for the position of manager.</p>
   <p>In regard to the letter written by the management of the F. B. Zdrubek Free Thought School in which a protest is voiced against the proposed classes in Czech to be organized in the Sirotcinec, it was decided to refer this matter for decision to the committee of the Svobodomyslne Skoly (Free Thought Schools) and also to the management of the said F. B. Zdrubek Free Thought School.</p>
   <p>The official report of the house physician, Dr. Stulik, Jr., was read. The doctor stated that the health of the inmates was generally good. In his work, Dr. Stulik was assisted by Drs. John M. Krasa and J. J. Pomazl. The <span class="page-break">\5</span>veterinary, Dr. Rudolf Heller, submitted written proof that all cows kept by the institution were free of tuberculosis. As to the sale of certain parcels of land owned by the Utulna, it was decided to ask for the expert opinion of several real-estate men who would be able to fix the value of the said property. It was decided to order the next coal supply from the Wisconsin Lime and Cement Company which supplied us with coal during the past.</p>
   <p>Eight of our children completed their eighth year of grammar school successfully, and it was decided to send them to high school.</p>
   <p>In the board of director's meeting, which was held on July 17, applications for the job of manager [vide supra] were considered. There were six applicants. After listening to a report by Mr. Vojtech Suchy, who interviewed these applicants, it was decided to consider the application of Mr. Anthony J. Smith. This man is presently employed as engineer and was formerly an <span class="page-break">\6</span>officer in the [United States] Navy.</p>
   <p>It was announced that Mrs. Storkan made a gift of linens and other objects which are to be used in the room bearing her name. The ladies' auxiliary made a gift of linen to our children. The minutes of the board of directors were approved as read with the proviso that in the future they are to be read separately. [Translator's note: In this meeting the secretary read the minutes of three meetings of the board of directors.]....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marek expressed her astonishment over the resignation of Mr. B. Fischer. The president thereupon explained the circumstances, and remarked that Mr. and Mrs. Fischer, being a relatively young married couple, found their life in the Sirotcinec to be rather oppressive, and since the young people require certain social diversions, their life in the institution must have seemed dull. Besides that, Mrs. Fischer has undergone an operation following a rather severe illness and, as a result, could not fulfill all her duties as <span class="page-break">\7</span>housekeeper in such an institution as ours without further endangering her health. The majority of the delegates were not satisfied with the reasons given, and with the explanation [offered by the president], and Mr. Lehman insisted that Mr. Fischer give his reasons to the Board of Delegates personally....The president called the attention of that delegate to the fact that his request may not be granted since it is opposed to all the principles of the Sbor. The board of directors is the only authority in this respect. Only that board may hire, dismiss, or accept the resignations [of the employees of the Utulna]. Mr. Lehman then moved that all constitutional principles, rules, regulations, etc., be suspended for ten minutes, and that Mr. Fischer be asked to speak. The motion was carried and Mr. Fischer obtained the floor. He explained that he had no intention of giving the real reasons for his resignation but, being pressed by the delegates, he acceded to their demands and is ready to justify his act as follows:</p>
   <p>The conditions in managing the [two] institutions reached such a point that <span class="page-break">\8</span>they became unbearable. They had their origin among the members of the board of directors. So many orders reached his office that he was unable to do justice to all of them. He named the vice-president of the board and gave reasons for his clash with her. And this one case was not the only reason [for his resignation]. He stated that he asked for a salary increase. His salary was only $75 a month, an amount too meager to compensate him for fulfilling those duties that were imposed upon him. His request for such an increase was refused, and this led to his resignation.</p>
   <p>In defending herself, the vice-president, Mrs. Gruenwald, mentioned certain shady conditions existing in the management of the kitchen of the Sirotcinec, and said that when she called the attention of the manager to them, she was refused entrance into the kitchen, and that Mr. Fischer also forbade her to have any contact or conversation with the inmates of the institution. After the passage of this ten-minute interlude, order was again restored.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Velik called the attention of the board of directors to a gift of $200, <span class="page-break">\9</span>already reviewed by the Probate Court, the gift being in accordance with the last will and testament of her relative who thus remembered the Sirotcinec.....Mr. Trnka then announced that our children will continue to attend the F. B. Zdrubek Free Thought School. The decision [that the children]continue their attendance there was unanimous. Mr. R. Glass, a member of the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), reported that the concert given by that Society in the Carter H. Harrison High School on June 16, for the benefit of the Sirotcinec, netted the sum of $301 which amount he delivered to the president. This joyous piece of news was loudly acclaimed by the Sbor, and it was moved that the devotion of the Workingmen's Singing Society be respected by sending them a letter of appreciation.</p>
   <p>Only one application for admission to the Utulna was handled in this meeting. It concerned the case of Mr. Josef Taborsky who is 72 years old. It was referred to the investigating committee. The secretary, Mrs. Brabec, announced that in the recent tag day report an unpleasant omission occurred in not <span class="page-break">\10</span>listing the names of three ladies. These were Mrs. Berta Kucera, who collected $23.69; Mrs. T. Novak, who turned in the sum of $27.21; and Mrs. Ludmila Cerny, whose collection amounted to $17.51. Mr. B. Fischer then rendered his last financial report. The expenditures amounted to $2,197.23; receipts were $3,148.27. Both receipts and disbursements were approved.</p>
   <p>At this juncture another debate was launched as to how the two institutions should be managed. The treasurer of the Sbor, Mr. Frank J. Petru, suggested that for all future cases [requiring it] a committee on complaints be appointed which would undertake the task of investigating such complaints as would occur. This very interesting meeting was then brought to a close.</p>
