   <p>The ladies of the Zabavni A Podporujici Spolek Krajanek Z Myta A Okoli (The Social and Benevolent Society of the Countrymen from Myto and Vicinity) arranged a soiree in the hall of Mr. Studeny, on 26th Street and Avers Avenue. After the installation of officers, Misses Mary Jedlicka and Anna Vesely took up a collection for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage). The collection netted $9.10 which sum was deposited with us to be transmitted to the aforementioned charitable institution.</p>
