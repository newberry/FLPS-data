   <p>Last Sunday in Mr. Kafka's hall, 26th Street and Avers Avenue, there was a surprise party in honor of Mrs. Kristina Nemecek of 2724 South Avers Avenue. The guests remembered our orphans on this occasion by raffling off a lamb which was contributed for this purpose by Mrs. Emilie Novak, 2819 South Harding Avenue. The raffle brought $15.1<span class="gap">[gap]</span>, of which $6.55 was given to the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) in equal amount to the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa (St. Joseph's Orphanage) in Lisle, Illinois.) The money was deposited in our office for transmission to these institutions.</p>
