   <p>[Translator's note: Mr. W. F. Severa of Cedar Rapids, Iowa has given $50,000 for the establishment of an American home for Czechoslovakian children suffering from heart disease. The home is to be in Czechoslovakia, and the gift thus far was the largest ever made by a single individual to the republic of Czechoslovakia.]</p>
   <p>The site for the home was donated by the municipality of Brno.....Mr. Severa, who hopes that committees interested in the development of the home, will be formed in [all] the large cities of the United States where Czechoslovakians live, came to Chicago to arouse the interest of our local and charitable countrymen. They will certainly wish to support an institution of this kind. Since the summer months are not auspicious for [the gathering of funds] and the organizing of a committee, Mr. Severa will return to Chicago at a later date to stimulate interest in the project.</p>
