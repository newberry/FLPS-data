   <p>Some time ago our Chicago countrymen, natives of the Town of Polen, near Klatovy, Czechoslovakia, undertook a collection among themselves for the benefit of a public library of their native town, and recently a letter was received by them acknowledging receipt of the gift. The letter, in parts, reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"In the year of 1860, to honor the memory of our famous native son, author and patriot, Josef P. Sumavsky, a public library was established in our town, but after a period of many years, only a few books remained. Several months ago, our Polen countrymen who now reside in the City of Chicago, upon the request of Mr. J. Kocour, their leader, collected among themselves the sum of $60.50 for the purpose of establishing a new public library in Polen, Czechoslovakia. For this money, which is equivalent to 3,284 Czechoslovak kronen, 234 new books were bought and the new library already has a number of diligent readers. The new library was placed in our public school and is under the care of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mr. M. Sedivec.</p>
   <p>"Guided by the example of their Chicago countrymen, the natives of Polen who now reside in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, also undertook a collection for the benefit of our public library. From this collection, an additional 2,128 Czechoslovak kronen was secured.</p>
   <p>"The citizens of Polen, Czechoslovakia, are wishing the best of success to all those who contributed, and assure them that their names will be remembered in the new memorial book of the Town of Polen.</p>
