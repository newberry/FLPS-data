   <p>It was upon the suggestion of several sincere Czech patriots who scouted all the Czech and Slovak associations and clubs in this community that a bazaar was arranged for March 24. There was a lecture by Mr. F. Klepal. The proceeds went to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance). The preliminary work devoted to the affair took about one week only. It was, therefore, not possible to follow an extensive outline. The committee in charge had done its best. It consisted of seven ladies who solicited gifts. One booth was completely filled with beautiful articles made by the Czech and Slovak women. The attendance did not meet with the expectations of the committee, and the gifts had to be raffled at rather low prices in order to dispose of them at all, and to transform them into gifts of money which the Bohemian National Alliance needs so much.</p>
   
   <p>It must be admitted on our part that wherever patriotic aims are in the foreground, there the Czechs always lag behind the Slovaks. We mean here in Hawthorne. There were many more Slovak than Czech visitors at the Bazaar.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klepal in his lecture said: "If you hesitate to contribute to the treasury of the Bohemian National Alliance for patriotic causes then, at least, do it for the benefit of suffering mankind."</p>
   <p>The concensus of the opinion of the committee is that the part of the money that is not employed for political purposes, should be used for the alleviation of the hardships imposed on the Czech people of the old country. Many simple minded questions, it was related by the ladies, were put to them on the occasion of collections. One woman, so one story goes, asked "what was being done with the monies taken in?" And "whether Professor Thomas G. Masaryk would keep the money for himself?" When the lady, intrusted with the collection, offered a booklet containing the biography of Professor Masaryk for the price of one dime, she met with a refusal. Some people do not want to know about Masaryk, they only want to criticise him. They do this to hide the fact that they are loath to contribute.</p>
   <p>The proceeds from the bazaar amounted to $200.</p>
