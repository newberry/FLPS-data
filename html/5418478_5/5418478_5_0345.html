   <p>The fourth, and last session in the first general meeting of the Cesko-Americka Jednota (Czech-American Union) was held here, brother V. Basta presiding. After the election of the officers, the finance committee received donations and pledges for the support of humanitarian institutions and of our liberal schools. The organization has been giving attention to the bringing up of our youth, for with this next generation it hopes to fill the ranks of past members of its own and of other Czech-American societies. The Old Peoples Home, the Orphanage, and the association for the maintenance of the liberal schools in Chicago and Cleveland, are those institutions of which the Czech-American Union has always thought first, as they are considered of the greatest importance in our life. An amount of $100 was also awarded to the National Association for the pursuit of political action. The finance committee reported that a deficiency of $200, dating from a former secretary, has been made good. A few changes in the by-laws were effected, and the session of this, the first general meeting closed with a get-together and dinner. The next general meeting is to be held here in two years hence.</p>
