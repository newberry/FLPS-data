   <p>For the first time in 1922, we present to our public a report on some of our activities. It is understood, of course, that the main outlines of our activity are contained in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors, but as it often happens, such minutes give only the essential features, clearly enough, but in the dry official way, omitting the hundreds of details connected with the matters reported.....These details, however, are not lacking in interest. Thus, for instance, a playroom was made for our children, but what joy that playroom brought them is mentioned nowhere.....Again, there is well organized instruction in music [in our institution]; there are four music instructors who come to us regularly and give lessons in different musical instruments. Such efforts are well rewarded by the children's diligent application to their studies.....The girls are also very active in learning how to crochet and embroider, and some of them are also studying music. In accord with the wish of our president, Mr. A. Suchy, an early exhibit of the work of our children is to be arranged by us so that the Bohemian people may realize what profitable and <span class="page-break">2</span>successful training our children receive.....</p>
   <p>The New Year started out very well, both morally and financially, for which fact we are indebted mainly to the Bohemian people and to our benefactors..... We deem it our duty to thank the Dobrovolne Pracovnice (The Voluntary Workers) of the Vlast Rebekah Lodge No. 165 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows for their splendid gift of $200. As chance would have it, this gift happened to be the first item for 1922.</p>
   <p>On January 22, 1922, we arranged a moving-picture show for the children..... The films were furnished free of charge by Mr. Frank J. Petru, and the transportation of the projector was furnished by the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery). On January 29, we had out-of-town visitors. On this occasion, Mrs. Sykyta presented a cake, for which twenty dollars was raised. Mrs. Bezvoda added five dollars to this amount, and the cake was then given to the children.</p>
   <p>....In a certain charitable institution, the names of benefactors and contributors <span class="page-break">3</span>are chiseled in a marble plaque. Our poor inmates show their gratitude in other ways.</p>
