   <p>The office of the Czech branch of the American Red Cross has issued a call to the members of the Czech-American women's organizations, which should stimulate participation in the activities of the Czech branch. A large membership and the creation of numerous Czech branches are urgently needed right now. The appeal points to the Czech-American men, who were among the first to enlist for military service, and admonishes our women not to lag behind the men in patriotic ardor. Attention is called to the classes for prospective war nurses. The membership in the American Red Cross is two dollars, one dollar of which goes into the Czech-American branch for sundry accessories and for material. The meetings of the Czech branch will be held each Wednesday evening in places to be designated from time to time. For the present, the classes are to be held in the halls of the Pilsen Sokol (gymnastic society), Sokol Chicago, and Sokol Havlicek Tyrs.</p>

   <p>We have been successful in winning the co-operation of several expert physicians who are awaiting their authorization from Washington. Our Red Cross action is sponsored by the Czech National Alliance. We shall demonstrate how much we appreciate the aid and comfort which has been extended to our men in the prison camps in Europe by the American Red Cross; this can be done best by a vigorous participation in the activities of the Red Cross.</p>
