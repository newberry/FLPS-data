   <p>The many friends of our countryman, Mr. Joseph Kovar, president of the Grand Furniture Company, and his wife, arranged a surprise party at his home, 2101 South 63rd [sic] Court, Cicero, Illinois. On this occasion a collection for the benefit of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage was undertaken. The proceeds of the collection, amounting to $16.60, were deposited in our office.</p>
