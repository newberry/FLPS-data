   <p>p.4--Everything appears to indicate that during the coming year we shall finally see realized our national welfare undertaking--The Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage.</p>
   <p>We don't want to say that we shall have some pompous buildings constructed at great expense, but it seems that the institution will be functioning, though on a somewhat smaller scale than was originally planned.</p>
   <p>The majority of the lodges (and therefore also their delegates) which constitute the Association for the construction of the Home, are inclined to take steps toward the actual realization of this undertaking. Also the majority of the lodges seems to be of the opinion, that the beginning should be on a smaller scale rather than such as was recently still being considered.</p>

   <p>No matter what happens, whether large, luxurious buildings are erected or whether the Home is housed in the buildings now on the grounds, the public will be satisfied, but it is waiting for some definite decision. And it is waiting impatiently, because the matter has been postponed almost too long. True, it is necessary to proceed with caution, it is necessary to thoroughly consider everything before any definite decision is made; but it is also true, that something must be done, and that soon.</p>
   <p>It seems that the continued postponement is detrimental to a good purpose. We hear odd remarks about this procrastination, discouraging remarks which would be stopped if the matter were brought to an actual conclusion. Therefore, let us begin on a small scale, but let us begin now. No more delays, no more hesitation. The ground is paid for, a few thousand dollars are on hand, so why hesitate?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Or is it apprehension concerning the maintainance of the institution which discourages many and prompts further postponements?</p>
   <p>Well, these fears are needless, wholly unwarranted. We know well the heart of our people, we know and are firmly convinced that they would never let it come to the point where there would be unsufficient funds to maintain the institution. On the contrary, the institution will prosper, contributions will increase and there will never be any deficiency.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian people have always done their duty whenever a beneficent purpose was concerned, and they will continue to fulfill their duty. Therefore, let us put away apprehension, let us banish fear and let us proceed with deeds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Thus will be silenced the perpetual doubters; thus will be rebuked the everlasting faultfinders, who criticize everything, who find mistakes in everything, but are incapable of raising a finger in order to aid a good cause.</p>
