   <p>Our foremost mutual benefit societies have arranged a New Year's festival. Among these societies, the following deserve to be mentioned first: The Cesko-Slovánské Podporující Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union), and the Jednota Ceských Dam (Bohemian Ladies Society).</p>
   <p>A Festival of the Grand Lodge of the</p>
   <p>Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky</p>
   <p>First of all we must mention the New Year's festival of the grand lodge of the Cesko-Slovanské Podporujici Spolky of the State of Illinois, which was held at the usual place, West 18th and May Streets. The festival should have begun promptly at 2 P. M., but due to unavoidable circumstances, it <span class="page-break">2</span>actually started half an hour later.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to capacity. This was chiefly due to the colorful and varied program. The festival was officially opened by the chairman of the grand lodge, Mr. Otto T. Pergler, who asked the audience to excuse the absence of Professor B. Simek of Iowa State University. Professor Simek was originally listed as the main speaker at this festival, but at the eleventh hour he decided not to come because of the illness of his wife. Professor B. Kral was asked to address the lodge in his stead, but, unfortunately, he, too, became ill. It was for this reason that the chairman, Mr. Pergler, was compelled to deliver the opening speech himself. After greeting the audience, he called attention to past practices of the Cesko-Slovenske Podporujici Spolky, which used to busy themselves with extraneous matters; now, however, the time has come when the societies must pay more attention to their own interests and their own mission.</p>
   <p>He stressed the need for relying, not upon the work which the leaders of the <span class="page-break">3</span>various societies are doing, but rather upon the work of every individual member. The chief duty of the members is to propagandize the work of their societies. At this juncture he indicated the kind of work Mr. Janes of Town of Lake has accomplished not only as a member of his own lodge, but as a co-operating member of the whole group of societies. He pointed to the work of this man as a pattern to be followed by others. He likewise stressed the meaning of the work of the combined societies; he indicated the particular worth of the activities of the younger members, who, when asked to participate in the leadership of their societies, especially in regard to the arrangement of entertainments, are able to bring many benefits to the union as a whole. He followed these general remarks with a speech in the English language addressed to the younger generation, the contents of this latter speech being in sum and substance the same as his Czech address. We may report that Mr. Pergler's addresses deserved great approbation.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the conclusion of his speeches, the program continued, the individual items of which were chiefly musical numbers, recitations, and songs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Deserving of mention was a classical dance number. The program terminated with a one-act comedy produced by the veteran player, Mr. Josef Jurka. The actors who took part in this comedy were: Miss J. Sachaufet, Mr. J. Holan, Mrs. Anton Cervenka, Messrs. B. Janous, J. Svoboda, V. Prochazka, and Miss A. Schaufel.</p>
   <p>During the course of this comedy, a collection for the benefit of our shelter and orphanage was undertaken. The collection netted sixty-eight dollars. The managing committee consisted of Josef Jurka, J. Janda, V. H. Filip, K. Kopecky, Fr. Veselik, and J. Filip. We must mention that Mr. Vaclav Petrzelka, the speaker representing the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Community) and the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers), participated in the festival. When he learned that the chief speaker, Professor Simek, could not attend, he attempted to get the floor for five minutes, wishing to address the assembled members from the standpoint of the Freethinkers. His request was denied. As an excuse he was told that there was no time for any more addresses, and that there were many other attractive features on the program. Why this <span class="page-break">5</span>happened we cannot say, but all in all, we can say that the managing committee ought to be satisfied with the results.</p>
   <p>The Festival of the Czecho-Slavonic Union</p>
   <p>The attractively decorated hall of the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Gymnastic Association) on Ashland Avenue was filled to capacity yesterday afternoon. The regular New Year's festival of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota was held here. The program was rich and varied, consisting chiefly of entertainment. After the playing of an orchestral number under the direction of R. Bartos and a short address by Mrs. F. Mrazek, there followed a recitation by little Jirina Roucek entitled, "What We Want and What We Get".....The main speaker at the festival was the well-known national worker, Dr. Karel Neumann, president of the grand lodge. The substance of his speech was a description of club life and its meaning for our nationality, with a few remarks concerning the purely humane and benevolent activities in which our societies are engaged. This speaker emphasized the fact that the annual New Year's festivals are above all <span class="page-break">6</span>a sort of inventory of the work performed during the previous year, and are not meant primarily to be entertainments. In this respect the union may be proud of its accomplishments, particularly in the faithful fulfillment of its duties during the year just terminated.</p>
   <p>The union is just ending the thirtieth year of its existence, and its splendid work in the past is a fitting climax for its thirtieth anniversary. The speaker also pointed out the differences between the Bohemian societies and those of other language groups. While other societies originate and perish, ours continue to thrive and to increase in membership.....What is the basic reason for this phenomenon? It is our close economy. We manage things scrupulously, anxiously saving every penny, but at the same time we support every deserving national project as much as we can. In other language groups there is a lack of such economy and bad financial leadership. Dr. Neumann admonished all those present to continue to conduct their affairs with the same indefatigable zeal.....The program of the orchestra consisted mainly of classical compositions. The evening was set aside for lighter diversions such as dancing, etc.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Festival of the Central Committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam</p>
   <p>The luxurious assembly hall of the Harrison High School, 24th Street and Marshall Boulevard, was filled to capacity by the members and friends of our oldest and strongest woman's organization. The Jednota Ceskych Dam is very well known not only throughout our land, but also in the distant country of our origin.....The program started shortly after one o'clock. After the playing of the American national anthem, the president of the state organization, Mrs. Anna Brychta, gave her opening address of welcome.....She recalled the origin and the beginnings of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, which during the half century of its existence, has gathered into its ranks almost twenty-five hundred women distributed all over the United States and grouped into 145 organizations.....There were other speakers on the program, as well as musical numbers, recitations, and a one-act play. The ballet school of Mrs. Libuse Bartusek-Brown was well represented by its pupils of both sexes, whose performances have frequently earned them well-deserved applause.....The orchestra of Mr. Rudolf Rubringer rendered a few concert pieces. The arrangement <span class="page-break">8</span>committee consisted of Misses. M. Smrcek, A. Brychta, K. Novy, Alzbeta Lisa, M. Horovy, Rosie Lapka, Anna Kroca, and Frantiska Schejbal.</p>
