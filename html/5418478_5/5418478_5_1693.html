   <p>The Rozmital Lodge No. 59 of the Cesko-Slovanske Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Union) arranged a festival on November 13 to celebrate its tenth anniversary, and the net proceeds of this festival were donated for the benefit of school children in Rozmital, Czechoslovakia and vicinity. The festival was attended by a great multitude of our brothers, sisters, and friends. The chairman, in his speech, greeted those who were present and urged the guests to become members of the lodge and present their children for membership in the juvenile department.....</p>
   <p>A collection which yielded twenty-five dollars was taken for the musicians, but they refused to accept the money and donated the entire amount for the benefit of poor school children. This sum was then added to the net proceeds. Fellow sisters prepared an excellent supper, Brother Redek furnished the hall free of charge, and therefore the net proceeds were satisfactory. The proceeds amounted to $303.32, and the whole amount will be sent to Rozmital to be used for the above-mentioned cause.</p>
