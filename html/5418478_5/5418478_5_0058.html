   <p>The eighth convention of the Ceskoamericti Lesnich a Lesnici (Czech-American [Men and Women]Foresters), one of our largest and most popular Free Thought unions, was opened in the Pilsen Park pavilion on West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue at 9 A. M. yesterday. Almost all the delegates who had signified their intention of coming to Chicago to attend the convention were present--fifty-six all told.</p>
   <p>On this occasion we had the pleasure of meeting many old friends with whom we had attended previous conventions of the body, and it is most gratifying to realize that all have come as members of one large family, ready to do all that is in their power to promote the welfare of our dear union and of the Czechoslovak people in America. Willingness to put forth the best efforts in this respect was noticeable also in those for whom this was the first convention, our brand new delegates.</p>

   <p>The convention was opened by the Chief Forester of the Grand Lodge, Brother Zikmund Chobotsky, who welcomed those present with a few well-chosen words and stressed the importance of the eighth convention. He said he was sure that all the member lodges had sent their best and most agile workers, and expressed the hope that the delegates will be certain to do all that is necessary in order to make this convention of the greatest benefit to the union and to the American branch of the Czechoslovak nation. He asked all to pay the closest attention to every part of the business that will be transacted, to avoid unnecessary delays, and to do their duty toward the union itself and their individual lodges.</p>
   <p>Having finished his introductory remarks, the Chief Forester appointed a credentials committee, consisting of Brothers Prosek and Bernard, and Sister Soucek. This committee scrutinized the credentials and made out a list of names of those present; and the comparison of that list with the list of those who had announced their intention to come revealed the fact that almost all of them had already arrived. Even so it was necessary to make a few slight <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>changes in the representation of some of the lodges, and all the proposed changes were approved by the convention.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The names of thirty-five lodges and their delegates are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The Chief Forester of the Grand Lodge requested Brother Secretary V. T. Hajek to read the minutes of the seventh convention. The eighth convention approved the minutes without changes. Thereafter the Chief Forester read his own report, a document that is interesting in more than one respect, and from which we quote the following parts:</p>
   <p>"It is our custom to go straight to our goal, to go right to the bottom of things, and to flatter no one. We simply refuse to emulate the officers of other unions who seek nothing but praise and slaps on the back. Our slogan and principal concern is truth, and nothing but truth. Personal favors on the one side, and personal animosities on the other cannot swerve us from our chosen course.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Now we are happy to state that we have lost less than one hundred members during the critical period of war and the epidemic. Our reserve fund was increased by $20,000 during that period, and our percentage of growth in membership is larger than that of other unions. There is not a single good cause that went unsupported by our union. We have always tried to be among the first in doing. But that, in our sober opinion, does not mean anything, because in doing so we have done nothing more than our duty, a duty which we must do and shall always do in the future. After all, to do good is the only reason for which all Czech unions and organizations have been founded.</p>
   <p>"Our interest centers in our own internal affairs and in our growth and progress. The last convention decided that the introduction of new members should be done individually according to a new ritual, and work on the development of this idea was started. But the results of this effort have been very poor indeed. Some lodges are using the ritual, some are not. We recommend, therefore, that this idea be abandoned and new members be introduced quarterly <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>according to the old ritual on the occasion of an entertainment and educational meeting. My own lodge has been doing this always.</p>
   <p>"In the last convention of all Czech Free Thought unions the proposal of their unification was discussed. A committee composed of delegates of all Czech unions was appointed, whose duty it was to prepare this unification. Our Grand Lodge has resigned from that committee because we have seen and known that, under present conditions, a unification is impossible. We therefore suggest that there be no proposals in regard to that idea and no discussions of it in the present convention, and that our attention be devoted exclusively to our own internal affairs.</p>
   <p>"The Grand Lodge founded an English-speaking sports club in 1916 which was joined by sixty-seven of our younger brothers. There was a hope that it would be possible to found the first English-speaking lodge. Most interested in this idea were Lodges Tesar, Jan Zizka, Plzen, Sumava, Tabor, and Svatopluk Cech. But that hope has not been realized. There was no co-operation. The <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>membership of the club joined the army during the war, and the club disbanded. But we still recommend the foundation of English-speaking lodges, because other unions are founding them also. There have been objections on the ground that transacting business in the English language would bring about our end and be a proof of our national bankruptcy. We do value our Czech language above anything else. Once it disappears, we disappear. But conditions seem to require it; we have to attract our youth, and have to offer them everything that is available in other than Czech unions.</p>
   <p>"One of the largest Czech unions in this country, in its recent convention, changed its table of rates from the form we are still using, that is, providing for a payment of a fee whenever a member died, to a form requiring one payment every month. This form of assessment seems to be working very well. On the occasion of a revision in the Grand Lodge, the state auditor recommended that form both to the secretary and the treasurer, assuring them that the sooner the union adopted it the better off it would be. We recommend, therefore, that this change, if possible, should be agreed upon in this <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>convention. We are certain that it will have the best results, both as a business method and for purposes of publicity. And it is most important that we do something in the way of publicity. Let us consider the situation of those who depend on our union. Our union is the only protection of many of our members and their families. Those who are well fixed may be safely left out of the present consideration because they have other protection elsewhere. But our union is composed mostly of workingmen, impecunious and needy all around. That is the element that deserves all our consideration, and every member must be sure of getting what he was promised when he joined our union.</p>
   <p>"There have been several cases where a member died within six or seven months, or within a year after joining the union. His beneficiaries were paid the whole death benefit according to the rules. We believe that a continuation of this policy would be unjust to older members who have been paying for years. It is desirable that this convention take this matter under advisement. We do not recommend the system in force in other unions, that is, that a member <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>should not receive the whole benefit until after he had been a member for five years, but we think that the payment of half of it at the death of a member who has been with us two years, and half of it two years after his death would be no hardship on anybody. The matter of insurance of children does not require any discussion because that is being done already. All that is necessary for the lodges to do is to push it more than they have been doing. According to the report of the Narodni Bratrsky Kongres [sic] (National Fraternal Congress) twenty-one unions have, in their children's departments, 95,250 policy holders."</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Grand Lodge, Brother Hajek presented a very long report in which he advocated many important changes concerning all phases of the activities of the union.....</p>
   <p>Brother Hajek reported also on the union's membership from January 1, 1918, to June 30, 1921.

   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>....The Lodge Cesky Lev proposes the foundation of mixed lodges (men and women)....and the corresponding changes in constitution and bylaws....</p>
   <p>All proposals were passed on to the respective committees for action, but the constitution and bylaws committee will be the busiest of all.</p>
