   <p>The Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) recently received the following brief, but significant, communication from the office of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic:</p>
   <p>"To the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. Attention Doctor Joseph P. Pecival, President: The President of the Czechoslovak Republic most cordially thanks you for the congratulations sent to him on his seventieth birthday, and also for the gift of one million Czechoslovak kronen sent for his disposition. The President is especially pleased by your solicitude, which bears out the evidence that you are not forgetting your old native land and also these who fought for it."</p>
   <p>This communication surely will be an encouragement in our work which we <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are doing for the benefit and interest of suffering Czechoslovakian people in our native hand. We attest that our work is not yet accomplished, and that further harmonious and united work is necessary to finish our task.</p>
