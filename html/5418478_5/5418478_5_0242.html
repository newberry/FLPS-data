   <p>The central executive committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Czech Ladies' Union) has filed its report for the second half of the past year, presenting a clear survey of the growth in membership and the improvement in its financial position. The report reveals that during the period there were 267 new members, 107 deaths, 101 expulsions, and 74 resignations. On December 30 of last year, the total membership was 23,133. The Union paid out $83,200 in death benefits, $9,378.38 in sick benefits, $2,359 for charity, $3,988.41 for national patriotic purposes, and $1,872.36 for Czech schools. The reserve fund amounted to $52,225.83. The total assets of the Union are valued at $415,673.48.</p>
   <p>The increase in membership of 429 for the first half of last year was not as large as usual. Were it not for deaths and expulsions, an increase of half that number might be called satisfactory. The figures show that women's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organizations are also subject to considerable loss in membership by expulsion, although losses of this kind are more numerous in organizations with male memberships. Years ago, large numbers of prospects were indiscriminately accepted as members, and no particular attention was paid to their qualifications or to the possibility of their eventual expulsion.</p>
   <p>The war has brought about a change. Attention is now being directed not only to acquiring new members, but also to keeping the ranks of old members intact. Expulsions and resignations are elements of trouble not only in our brotherhoods but in almost all American brotherhoods, as was pointed out at the Congress of American Brotherhoods. The average number of resignations or expulsions is almost constant, while the number of new members is constantly decreasing. This applies especially to our brotherhoods, for our immigration has become stagnant because of restrictions dictated by the war.</p>
   <p>Some American brotherhoods have increased their dues to an unjustifiable <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>degree, and this is possibly the reason for their being on the verge of collapse. However, this reason does not apply to our brotherhoods, which are not only engaged in extending benefits to members, but are also active in patriotic enterprises. Every member should be conscious of the fact that he is duty bound in a twofold way--to his family, which has to be taken care of in the event of his death, and to his nation as well. There is, at the present time, hardly a single organization among us Czechs that is not active in the field of patriotic endeavor, that would not support the Czech National Alliance, the Czech schools, and other nationalistic institutions. This is one of the reasons why our brotherhoods should enjoy steady prosperity and growth. This is more desirable now than ever before. Members should center their interest upon the growth and strength of their organizations.</p>
