   <p>The Americka Narodni Rada Ceskoslovenska (Czechoslovak National Council of America) sent an appeal to all loyal Czechoslovaks asking them to terminate their revolutionary activity by a charitable deed--the creation of a fund for invalid Czechoslovaks. The fund will be at least one hundred thousand dollars, and is to provide support for the families of fallen and invalid legionnaires living in America. This fund will be controlled by a board of trustees of the Narodni Rada. Chicago and suburban Czechoslovaks will be required to contribute thirty-five thousand dollars to this cause. For this purpose a committee composed of the following members has been created: for the Narodni Rada, Messrs. Jan A. Cervenka, Jan Straka, Josef Placek and V. Cipra; for the Czechoslovak Legionnaires joint committee, Mrs. Claudia Ruzek, Messrs. Frantisek Horlivy, Frana Klepal, Karel Kouba, and Jan Mrazek; for the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics), Miss Anna Kosner, Mrs. Anna Masin, Messrs. Jan Kesner, Josef Krakora, and Frantisek Lidinsky; for the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), Mrs. Bozena Kosman, <span class="page-break">2</span>Mrs. Anna Fajnor, Messrs. Martin Huska, Jan Matlocha, Jan Nemec, Juraj Zarovy, and Jan Zidek.</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Huska was elected chairman of this board; Mrs. Claudia Ruzek, vice-chairwoman; Mr. Karel Kouba, secretary; and Jan Kesner, treasurer.</p>
   <p>To make the work of the committee more systematic, the field of activity was divided into nine sections as follows: (1) Pilsen; (2) California and Lawndale; (3) Marigold; (4) Cicero and Berwyn (Illinois); (5) Oak Park, Illinois; (6) Town of Lake; (7) The small South Side; (8) Irving Park, Jefferson Park, and Humboldt Park; (9) Pullman, South Chicago, Joliet, and Chicago Heights, Illinois; and Hammond, Whiting, and Gary, Indiana. In each of the above nine districts an independent work committee will be formed, with its aim the recruiting and appointing of the greatest possible number of collectors.</p>
   <p>Each of the nine sections will secure dependable workers; the Pilsen district started working today, November 3; that is there is to be a meeting of workers <span class="page-break">3</span>at 8 P. M. in the Cesko-Americka Sin (Bohemian-American Hall) 1436 West 18th Street (lodge room no. 3) to organize a committee for the Pilsen district. We ask all friends to report for duty on Friday: a duty which is a moral one, a duty which by the blood shed by our legionnaires obligates us to care for the invalids, and the widows and orphans left behind. Only by doing their duty will the Czechoslovaks of Chicago finish their task successfully. Whoever has a heart in the right place will come forward and join us. The collection committee is composed of Martin Huska, chairman; and Karel Kouba, secretary.</p>
