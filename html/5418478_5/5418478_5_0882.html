   <p>The new Old People's Home is a two-story building, 50 x 70 feet. The building includes a basement which will have space for a large boiler room with an oil burning furnace, a storage room for food, a room for baggage, another for the use of a laundry, and also a drying room near the furnace. Another section of the basement will be used as a lounge where the male inmates can gather and chat with each other; adjoining this room will be a similar room for the old women. The first floor will be occupied by the office, a dining room, lavatory and shower rooms, kitchen, and linen room. The second floor will consist of sleeping rooms. The building will be fitted to house from twenty-two to twenty-four women and twenty to twenty-four men. The total cost of the completed structure will be seventeen thousand dollars. The plans were designed by Mr. Anton Charvat, architect; the contractors were Rusy and Rezny; the bricklaying was done by Mr. Frank Pitrov, and his men; the carpenter work was done by the firm of Joseph Strnad and Sons; the masonry work was done by the firm of the California Cut Stone Company which <span class="page-break">2</span>furnished the material; the cement work was done by Mr. B. J. Vack, and his men; the plastering by F. Jaros; and the plumbing work by Mr. Stanley J. Loula. The iron work was done by the Pilsen Foundry and Iron Works which also furnished the material for their work. The roofing was done by the Matthew Holpuch Roofing Company; the cornice work was done by the Universal Cornice Works and the material was furnished by the same Company. The electrical equipment was installed by Mr. Hrdlicka, a member of the board of directors who furnished all material free of charge. The shades were also furnished free of charge by Mr. M. S. Kemper, another board member. The Old People's Home is but a short distance from the Bohemian Orphanage Asylum and is situated on 40th Avenue, formerly Crawford Avenue, now Pulaski Road, and Foster Avenue. The building of the Bohemian Orphanage Asylum is arranged in a similar manner and is estimated to house from thirty to thirty-two orphans. The grounds of the Orphanage are much larger than those of the Old People's Home. There are fourteen acres in all. There are plenty of trees, nice lawn, plenty of space for playgrounds, a large swimming pool, swings, and hammocks. A large portion is fenced off for a vegetable <span class="page-break">3</span>garden, the produce of which is to be used for the inmates of both institutions. Everything is arranged in such a manner as to make life pleasant for our orphans and comfortable for the old folks. The price of this new building would have been much more, but most of the materials were purchased at cost price, which was appreciated by the management of these institutions, for this resulted in a big saving. The donation of materials also brought down the cost. The management again wishes to thank the various organizations, lodges, and individuals for their contributions, and hopes for their continued assistance in the future. It is planned that improvements shall be made on the institution whenever it becomes necessary.</p>
