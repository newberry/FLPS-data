   <p>The untiring committee which had been authorized to carry through the preliminary work for the unification of all Bohemian Free Thought benevolent societies of America into one great and powerful body has almost accomplished its task. It hereby notifies all the grand lodges of the organizations concerned that it is now up to them to make the next important move. For that purpose the unification committee prepared a proclamation which has been sent to all the organizations concerned and which speaks for itself. In spite of the fact that the problem of unification had recently been pushed aside by other events and problems whch won a place on the front pages of our daily newspapers, it does not follow that it had lost its urgency.</p>
   <p>Several times we had an opportunity to point out that imperative economic reasons speak for unification, even if other equally important reasons are not taken into consideration. Several times we had an opportunity to refer to the fact that the favorable attitude toward unification among the members of the benevolent societies is not fully comprehended by the officers of the grand lodges. So far, none of the officers in charge of the benevolent societies have directly repudiated the proposed unification, but on the other hand, it cannot be denied that some of them have worked against it secretly.</p>
   <p>Now the time has come to discuss the matter publicly. The unification committee has put its cards on the table and is asking everybody else who is interested to do the same. The time for successful dodging has passed. The proclamation of the unification committee reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Since the time when the authorized committee for the unification of all Bohemian Free Thought benevolent societies published its last report, the members of the committee expected to hear from individual organizations as to how far they have progressed with the unification work. This was to apply especially with reference to some of the organizations which desired to have a statement of the value of certificates of other organizations before they would approve and agree to unite. In view of all other circumstances which prevented this desirable unification from becoming a reality, the members of the committee arrived at the decision that it would be necessary to prepare a new constitution and a new table of rates, and to figure out the benefits to members who would make payments according to the new rating. These benefits would be in the form of paid-up certificates according to the accumulated surplus which is provided for by state laws governing the business of fraternal benevolent societies.</p>
   <p>"The unification committee, through its subcommittees, prepared only the formal proposals for a new constitution and rituals, and left the task of preparing the estimates of new table rates and terminal valuation of certificates to an accredited actuary in order to prevent all possible doubt in the future about the absolute reliability of the estimates.</p>
   <p>"The various subcommittees present their reports and recommendations for correction and approval at every regular meeting of the unification committee, and all the preliminary work is nearing completion. After this preliminary work is completed and approved by the unification committee, the result will be submitted to the convention of representatives of the organizations concerned for approval.</p>
   <p>"In order to accomplish this unification under the existing state laws, it will be necessary that such a new organization acquire a charter, or permit, to conduct the business of fraternal benevolent societies. In order to acquire this permit, it will be necessary to have at least five hundred applications of charter members. Everyone of these charter members must be examined and recommended by a physician. Only after such a permit to conduct business is acquired will the new organization be entitled to take over the responsibility and risk of the present societies, and therefore it will be necessary, first of all, to satisfy this requirement.</p>
   <p>"Members of the existing societies will be accepted as a whole according to the valuation of their present certificates. The valuation of their certificates will be adjusted by a hired actuary, and each member will be credited with a determinate amount. Each member will have the right to select a new policy best suited to his purpose--either a straight life policy, an endowment policy, or one which would include an old-age pension. The rates on such new policies will be adjusted according to the age of the applicant at the time when such change is made, and according to his share of the surplus of his society which joined the new organization as a group. No one will be forced to change his policy if the present one is satisfactory to him. He will continue to make payments according to the present rates, but under the condition that each year he will be forced to pay additional amounts needed to assure the payment of such policies. Members who select new policies according to the newly adjusted table of rates will be separated into one class, but members who keep their present policies will have their own accounts in order to avoid the risk of keeping this class of policies in force.</p>
   <p>"From this it is apparent that each member will be treated justly and will receive his due share of the accumulated surplus of his society according to the duration of his membership. The new table of rates is based on the American Experience Table Rates which, in many cases, are lower than the existing rates of some of the societies concerned. It is apparent that the new rates are sufficient for any benevolent society if they are established right from the start.</p>
   <p>"In order to make any advancement of preliminary work possible, we ask the grand lodge officers to urge their members, especially the officers of subordinate lodges here in Chicago, to send in their applications in order to become charter members of the new organization. From these applicants, temporary officers will be selected to take care of the unification until the time when a joint convention is called. The convention will be called as soon as the applications of those societies which are really interested in the unification are received.</p>
   <p>"With fraternal respect for the unification committee:</p>
   <p>"Anton J. Zahrobsky, Chairman,</p>
   <p>"Vaclav Havelka, Secretary."</p>
