   <p>The meeting of the board of directors of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) was held last evening in the office of the Pilsen Brewery Company, with most of its members in attendance.</p>
   <p>Immediately after convening, Mrs. Frances Schejbal, representing the Sbor Mlada Amerika, Jednota Ceskych Dam (Young America Society, Unity of Bohemian Ladies), turned over one hundred dollars to the financial secretary as a contribution from that Society. Mrs. Schejbal expressed the hope that other bodies would contribute likewise, a hope in which she was joined by all the other members. The chairman, John A. Cervenka, speaking for the organization, thanked Mrs. Schejbal, and said that he hoped others would follow her example; she was asked to convey due thanks to her society.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes by the recording secretary, Dr. [Gustav] Fisher, a letter sent by the Sbor Ceskych Lekarek (Bohemian Women Doctors' <span class="page-break">\2</span>Society) was read; it stated that the conditions for co-operation were accepted by the committee appointed for that purpose, but not by the whole Hospital Society, and asked that when this matter was opened for action at a mass meeting of the Hospital Society the [Doctors'] Society be notified, so that the committee named by it could be present at the mass meeting. This request was granted. The Bohemian Women Doctors' Society will be notified as to the time of the next mass meeting.</p>
   <p>The next order of business was the reading of a letter received from Jaromir R. Psenka, who had made a proposal to print a directory, calling attention to the fact that work in this direction had not progressed as anticipated, and making suggestions in regard to remedying this condition.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that this letter be turned over to the committee in charge, which is to a call a meeting, at which the wishes of the board will be given cognizance, and at which it will be decided how best to proceed in this work.</p>

   <p>The financial secretary announced that he had received the yearly tax bill, in the amount of $449.53, which tax had to be paid because a hospital building had not yet been erected.</p>
   <p>The chairman, John A. Cervenka, brought up the question which confronts the board at every meeting, of the raising of funds for the erection of annexes to the building now standing on the property. This raising of funds is to be brought about by allotting to each board member a certain number of names of persons who have made pledges but have not up to date remitted. These are to be visited and urged to remit.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned after a report of the total receipts, which amounted to $125.00.</p>
