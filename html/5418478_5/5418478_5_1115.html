   <p>The meeting of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Old People's Home and Orphanage Association) was called to order by the president, Mr. Freidl. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. The following women's organizations are withdrawing their delegates from the Association because they do not agree with the proposed building of the tavern, the election of officers, and the amendments to the bylaws: Lodge Karolina Svetla, Jednota Ceskych Dam (Unity of Bohemian Ladies); Velkovybor Jednota Ceskych Dam (Grand Lodge Executive Committee of the Unity of Bohemian Ladies); the Grand Lodge Executive Committee of the Jednota Ceskych Vlastenek (Unity of Bohemian Women Patriots) of the State of Illinois; Lodges Premyslovna, Zdenka Havlicek, and Ratolest Miru, of the Women Sokols of Chicago; Lodge Frantiska Gregorova, Lodge Vlasta, Lodge Vitezstvi, Lodge Milada Z Dube, and the Sdruzeni Ceskych Dam (Federation of Bohemian Ladies).....</p>
   <p>The canvas of the vote on the issue of the tavern was then taken, and the result was fifty-four votes against and fifty-eight votes for the proposal. The report was accepted, and the committee will now receive bids for the construction of a suitable building.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary's report has not yet been completed, and the secretary was therefore given until next meeting to complete this task.....</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued over the withdrawal of the delegates of the women's organizations; but in order to allow the disturbance to subside, we will remain silent about it. The entire question was referred to a special meeting where the matter will be adjusted as well as possible.....</p>
   <p>Receipts were $571.80; disbursements were $225.10.</p>
