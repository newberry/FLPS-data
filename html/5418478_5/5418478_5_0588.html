   <p>The C.S.P.S. lodges will meet in convention in St. Louis during the first week of August next year, An election of delegates, who will represent the Illinois lodges at the convention, was held last night.</p>
   <p>The election was carried out very strictly, careful attention being given, that only such delegates be elected, who it was certain would strive with all their power to pass every proposal tending toward the elevation of the welfare activities of the organization. It was for this reason that the elections dragged on into the late hours, it being almost 3 o'clock in the morning when the representatives of the Illinois lodges left the premises of the Bohemian-American Liberal School at 400 West 18th street, where the elections were held.</p>
   <p>The elections were attended by representatives of forty-six Illinois lodges of C.S.P.S. and eighteen delegates to the convention were elected.</p>
