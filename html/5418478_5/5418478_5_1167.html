   <p>Dvorak Park is a center of entertainment not only for our youth, but also for our adult population. Thus, for instance, some of our retired old-timers meet here every afternoon to play a game of cards. Not so long ago, Miss Klefer organized a mother's club which meets here on Thursdays at 7:30 P.M. Our mothers visit the park to recuperate after a hard day's work and to indulge in a bit of gossip. Sometimes they have a dance and drink coffee. All mothers may become members without paying any dues.</p>
