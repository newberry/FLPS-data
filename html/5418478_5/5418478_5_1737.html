   <p>The ladies who so enthusiastically and generously collected donations for the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost v Chicagu (Bohemian Charitable Association of Chicago) yesterday may be satisfied with their accomplishments. They collected the sum of $2,400 for the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, which of course is a very good result. But it could not have been otherwise, for we must take into consideration the enthusiastic work of our ladies. For this accomplishment they deserve the gratitude of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost and of our people. Our Bohemian people have recognized the importance of this humanitarian institution.</p>
