   <p>The Order of Czech-American Foresters (men and women) is having a three-day holiday during their annual meeting, which began yesterday and will be finished tomorrow. After that, they will enjoy a well-deserved rest. Their work will surely be crowned with success. They will be feted at a banquet and honored by a concert and recital arranged for them by Dvur Neruda (Lodge Neruda) No. 35, in co-operation with the grand lodge. On this occasion, the eighteenth anniversary of the foundation of the Order will be celebrated.</p>
   <p>Eighteen years is not a long time, true enough, but the work that has been accomplished during that period by the Order of Foresters is far-reaching and impressive. The organization may calmly take account of its work--especially <span class="page-break">2</span>of what has been done in the last four years.</p>
   <p>The officers of the grand lodge are Zikmund Chobotsky, Chief Forester, John V. Budilovsky, assistant; V. T. Hajek, secretary; F. Mancl, treasurer.....The members of the accounting committee will surely feel at ease when they appear before the delegates to submit their reports. They know they have done all in their power for the good of the Order, and that the assembly, which had intrusted them with their offices, will not be disappointed.</p>
   <p>The meeting is being held in the hall of Sokol Karel Jonas in Cicero, Illinois, thirty-five lodges being represented. Brother Chobotsky opened the first evening by extending a hearty welcome to the gathering. He admonished the delegates to give the meeting their undivided attention, and always to work for the best interests of the Order.....</p>
   <p>There was a roll call of the delegates.....The minutes of the last full meeting <span class="page-break">3</span>were then read.....Sympathy was expressed for the families of members who departed since the last meeting.....</p>
   <p>The insurance for children was one of the main subjects of discussion. This insurance, it was pointed out, has become very important for the future of the organization. Members and delegates alike declared themselves to be in favor of insurance for children; it should, however, be issued after a child has reached the age of two, for the mortality rate at an earlier age proved to be too high. The organization will not be able to obtain a charter for this insurance before five hundred applications, the legal minimum, are received. Some delegates advocated the admission of children whether their parents are members or not, as long as they are of Czechoslovak descent. The law of the State of Illinois will have jurisdiction over this question, for each state has its own legal interpretation for this point. It was proposed that <span class="page-break">4</span>children's insurance be introduced, as it will knit the relations of the Order with the younger generation. If a child has been insured for several years, when he reaches the eligibility age for membership, he and his parents will show more genuine interest in the organization.....</p>
   <p>The merger of all Czech Freethinker lodges into one large organization was proclaimed to be a necessity which ultimately must be realized. Some move toward insurance for children should be made at once, regardless of the first result, but always with a view of the future merger. If other Czech organizations should introduce children's insurance, then the Order of Czech-American Foresters ought to follow their example immediately.</p>
   <p>This whole issue was referred to the committee on resolutions which will pass upon its merits and make appropriate recommendations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Another equally important question was broached. It concerns insurance of members now in the Army or Kavy. It is known that Uncle Same insures soldiers for a small amount. This benefit applies only to cases when the man is wounded, whereas his surviving relatives receive nothing in case of his death. The soldiers' insurance is valid only during wartime. It was therefore proposed that the organization create a fund out of which casual benefits would be paid. The solid, main assets will thus remain unimpaired.</p>
   <p>There are sixty members of the Order in the field today. Some, or even all of these, may return and wish to continue as members. The organization cannot simply get rid of them, but they must be provided for, and it should be done today. In order to be properly prepared for serious losses in some cases, it will be advisable not to pay out full amounts of death benefits, but to make payments in installments distributed over several years.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>A motion by Mr. Kundrat was passed. It places a tax of ten cents per month upon every member in order to provide a fund for the benefit of soldier-members. The collection is to begin on March 1, and it is intended for all members, drafted or volunteers, regardless of who does the paying. Members who do not pay or for whom payments are not made will lose their membership.</p>
   <p>The committee on resolutions then recommended the above-mentioned arrangements, and they were passed by the delegates.</p>
   <p>Another item of discussion was the agitation fund. One proposal demanded a monthly payment of five cents for this fund. There were objections, and five cents for three months was finally decided upon.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Part of the routine business of the meeting contained the financial report submitted by Brother V. T. Hajck. The receipts of the casualty fund during the last four years amounted to $136,335.61; the disbursements (for 147 death cases) were $133,900. Receipts of the current fund for a like period were $11,946.73; expenses were $10,193.69. Income of the reserve fund for the four past years was $19,442.45; assets from former years are $802.70. Therefore, the total assets of the reserve fund are $20,245.15; disbursements, $19,575.90.</p>
   <p>There were 2,562 members on December 31, 1917, who paid $133,900 into their respective lodges [during which period is not mentioned in the article]..... All reports were acknowledged and a proved. The meeting will be continued this morning, January 18.</p>
