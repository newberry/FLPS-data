   <p>The Lodge Plzen (Pilsen) No. 272 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows held its regular meeting on December 26 at which, as usual, good deeds were not forgotten. Mr. Karel Psenicka, a member of the lodge and a well-known restaurateur, asked all those who were present to undertake a collection for the benefit of suffering children in Czechoslovakia and to contribute this amount toward Hoover's relief fund. The collection was immediately undertaken, and the sum of twenty-five dollars was collected. Mr. Psenicka then deposited this amount in our office.</p>
