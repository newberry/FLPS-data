   <p>.....After a full day's work I hasten to submit my report to you at midnight. It is my duty to express my thanks to Alderman Anton J. Cermak, the Democratic candidate for the office of president and member of the board of county commissioners, and to the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Rozvoj (Gymnastic Union Sokol Rozvoj [development]) for admitting the wards of our orphanage into their institution: twenty boys and eighteen girls were thus admitted; the very young children are receiving their instruction in physical culture inside the orphanage. This was a source of great happiness to me, for it proved that our youngsters desire to build up their bodies as well as their minds and to become the proud heritage of the Czech nation and of your and our institutions. I therefore render my thanks again to the brothers of the Sokol Rozvoj for their true understanding of the meaning of the Sokol idea, and call "Nazdar!" (to success!) to them.</p>

   <p>It is self-understood that gymnasium suits were required for our wards in this new experience, and since we did not have any, I turned to our alderman and Democratic candidate for the presidency of the county board, Mr. Cermak.....That is, I mailed him my request, and early next morning I received a telephone call from him permitting me to buy whatever suits, etc., were necessary for our children. You may well believe me, my countrymen, that although I know the proverbial kindness of our countryman Mr. Cermak, I did not expect such prompt action on his part, or that he would make such an immediate and unselfish contribution. I was astonished and so were the children, who stood up and shouted a prolonged "Nazdar!" Thanks to our prominent Czech who aided us in such a prompt manner.</p>
   <p>It took a long time before quiet was established again among the children; they were so excited with joy. You may well believe that if our children were entitled to vote every one of them would vote for Mr. Cermak as president of the county board of commissioners. They would thus wish to repay his love, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>his kindness, and his unselfishness. They know that he would continue to make their lives more bearable.</p>
   <p>But you, my dear countrymen, you may do that which my wards may not; you may vote, and therefore it is these children who now call to you: "Vote for him!" Elect such a noble and honest countryman as Mr. Cermak! Do your duty as his countrymen, as Czechs; for we are certain, in this our home, that your vote will perform miracles and that by tonight we shall hear the news, "Cermak is elected!"</p>
