   <p>The meeting of the Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage of Chicago) was held in the lower hall of the Czechoslavonic Benevolent societies, 18th and May Streets. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Vojtech Suchy, at 8 P. M. sharp. The secretary, Mrs. R. Krabec, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved as read. The reading of communications, of which there were only a few this time, followed.</p>
   <p>The Svobodna Obec (Bohemian Free Thought Community) sent an invitation to a celebration honoring the memory of Frantisek B. Zdrubek. The celebration will be held on September 11, at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery). The celebration will be under the auspices of the Svobodna Obec <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association). The Sbor Ceske Utulny a Sirotcince was requested also to grant permission to the children of the institution to attend the celebration in a body, and to permit one of the children of the institution to recite a fitting poem.</p>
   <p>The Milada z Dube Lodge sent a contribution of $1.50. A letter containing $7.50 was received and read. The sum represents the proceeds of a collection made at a surprise party given in honor of Mrs. Schlesinger. The Sokolky (Women Sokols) of the Sokol Berwyn presented their new delegate, Mrs. Anna Huml. The family of the architect, Mr. A. Charvat, chairman of the board of directors of Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, sent $10 instead of flowers for their late friend, Mr. Jan Kryl. The receipt of a letter, signed by some half dozen citizens, requesting that the institution be open to visitors twice a week, was acknowledged. At the same time it was remarked that the letter came too late because such a system has already been established by the superintendent, Mr. J. Bukovsky.</p>
   <p>The reading of bills received during the past month then followed. Without <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>exception all the bills were approved and ordered paid.</p>
   <p>Various committees and officers then presented their reports, and one of the most interesting was the report of the music committee. The committee, through its chairman, Mr. Vojtech Suchy, announced that the teaching of music in our institution, under the direction of the well-known band leader, Mr. Rudolph Rubringer, has begun. The committee also announced that the Bohemian Lodge No 943 of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, of which Mr. Frank S. Novak is the master, collected and sent to the institution musical instruments which were donated by patrons of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec. [List of those who donated instruments is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The minutes of the meeting of the board of directors, held August 5, were read. The minutes were written by the secretary, Mr. Joseph Trnka, and read as follows:</p>

   <p>"The superintendent, Mr. J. Bukovsky announced a gift of $500 from Mr. Joseph Dusek. Of this sum, $200 was a personal gift of Mr. and Mrs. Dusek, and the sum of $250 was the gift of the commission house, Joseph Dusek and Company. This money shall be used for the establishment of a playroom in the Orphanage. Credit for securing the gift should be given to the superintendent of the institution. The money will be paid out toward the end of this year, but we can already secure credit for all that is necessary. The superintendent will try to secure additional patrons to supply the full amount needed for the establishment of the playroom.</p>
   <p>"The report that a seamstress, to mend the garments in the institution, was employed at the Orphanage last month, was acknowledged. The seamstress was hired and paid by the Krouzek Dam Ceskeho Sirotcince (Ladies' Aid of the Bohemian Orphanage), which organization deserves recognition for the work done in behalf of the children of our institution.</p>

   <p>"The children were treated to a puppet show, popcorn, and similar things at the picnic of the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Slavonic Union, which was held in the near-by picnic grounds. The children, upon the request of the committee of the Grand Lodge, were admitted to the picnic grounds for a short period of time so that our people could get acquainted with the inmates of our institution.</p>
   <p>"The superintendent's report regarding the Halberstat children was considered. The parents of these children are divorced and both were suing for the right of possession of the children. The court ordered that the superintendent give the children to the mother who should have brought them before the court and then back to the institution. The children were given to the mother but, so far, they have not been brought back. The matter was reported to the judge and it is up to the judge now to take further necessary steps. The superintendent reported that Mr. Victor Kubl trimmed and set the hair of the girls of the institution and, inasmuch as he is an expert in his profession, we can not do otherwise than express to him our appreciation. Dr. Viska and <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Dr. Dedic, dentists, performed the necessary dental work free of charge. Inasmuch as proper dental care is a part of the program which was recommended at the last meeting by the committee of physicians, the report was gladly taken into consideration, and a resolution was passed that letters of thanks be sent to both these dentists.</p>
   <p>"The Orphan's Automobile Day Association requested in its communication that the children of our Orphanage be permitted to participate in an excursion which is arranged for August 31. This excursion is an annual affair of the said Association, and inasmuch as we have heretofore permitted our children to participate, they should be allowed to go on this occasion also.</p>
   <p>"The superintendent reported that a certain Mr. Frank Sloup has two children in the institution, and that he, for a long time, has been in arrears with his payments. The superintendent stated also that Mr. Sloup, although constantly reminded of his duty, either had some excuse or did not answer <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>at all. The same may be said of a certain Mr. Karbsicky, who has three children in the institution. The board of directors ordered the superintendent to return the children to their fathers if the payments are not made in a week's time. The motion of Mrs. M. Urbanek, that the children of any father or mother who is more than a month in arrears with their payments be returned to them without further action, was carried.....</p>
   <p>"During the past month there were eighty-seven children and thirty-one aged men and women, a total of one hundred and eighteen inmates, in the institution. During the past month ten children left the orphanage and five children accepted.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Pechar announced that he was willing to buy a piece of land called the Spice (Point), but the matter was postponed for one month. It was also announced that the annual concert, which will be given for the benefit of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, will be held October 5 in the Pilsen Park pavilion. The financial report was made and the meeting adjourned."</p>
