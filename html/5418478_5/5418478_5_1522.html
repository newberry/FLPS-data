   <p>Miss Bessie Selepa, well-known Bohemian piano teacher, of 2700 South Springfield Avenue, presented her class of thirty pupils last Sunday in her first concert, given at the Masonic Temple. On this occasion Miss Selepa proved not only her excellent qualifications as a teacher of music, but she demonstrated another phase of her endeavor. She remembered our foremost deserving humanitarian institutions by donating the net proceeds of her concert, amounting to sixty dollars, to the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage and the Saint Joseph Orphanage in Lisle, Illinois. The generous donor deposited the said amount in our office; it will be equally divided between the above-mentioned institutions. This deed of Miss Selepa's should be an example to many others on similar occasions.</p>
