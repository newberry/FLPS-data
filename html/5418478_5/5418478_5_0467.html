   <p>Mrs. Ludmila Veselsky, who is well know to our public as an ardent worker in many of our national organizations, has sent us, on the occasion of today's anniversary of the Ustredni Jednota Cesko-Americkych Zen (Central Unity of Bohemian-American Women), the following information concerning the activities of this popular organization:</p>
   <p>The Ustredni Jednota Cesko-Americkych Zen v Chicagu was founded ten years ago. Its principal purpose has been to arrange an educational and entertaining lecture every three months that is open to both members and their friends. This purpose is being faithfully followed, and it is also the chief reason for the growing popularity of the Jednota, which now has eight lodges with more than nine hundred members. The first lodge was Lodge Magdalena Doromila Rettigova; the second, Lodge Cabriela Preisova; third, Lodge Zofie Podlipska; <span class="page-break">\2</span>fourth, Vetev Ceske Vlasti (Branch of Bohemian Homeland); fifth, Lodge Vlasta; sixth, Lodge Chicago; seventh, Lodge Mlada Amerika (Young America); and eighth, Lodge Pavla Cechova.</p>
   <p>All lodges show very gratifying progress, and the whole Jednota has enjoyed a steady growth. The dues are rather low. Upon the death of one of the group, all members pay only five cents. The lodge sends a delegation in its own car to the funeral and presents a floral gift in the form of the American flag made of red and white carnations. The American flag is the emblem of the Jednota. The Jednota is a member of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), and of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage).....</p>
