   <p>Notice is hereby given to all our Catholic countrymen of the United States that a collection for the benefit of the American Red Cross will be undertaken throughout the United States beginning November 19 and ending November 25 of this year. The meritorious work of this great organization for the benefit of poor and suffering people of not only the United States and Czechoslovakia, but also the entire world, is generally recognized. You will help this cause if you apply for membership by paying at least one dollar as an annual contribution. Of course, more should be given if conditions permit.</p>
   <p>Our people have donated many thousands of dollars toward this cause. This year we can send our contributions through the central office of the Narodni Sdruzeni Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America), just as our countrymen of other national organizations can send their contributions through their own organizations. By doing so we can keep a record of our activity, and the American public will learn that we, the <span class="page-break">2</span>Czechoslovaks, are fully discharging our duties toward the humanitarian institutions of America.</p>
   <p>In regard to this year's collection for the benefit of the American Red Cross, the central office of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku is giving the following advice and instructions to all of its members, district alliances, parish alliances, and newspapers. All the necessary collection equipment will be sent out before November 11. See to it that proper agitation and propaganda is circulated in your neighborhood or town by word of mouth and through your newspapers. Flying squadrons of collectors should call upon every family. The collected amounts are to be sent, and unused collection equipment returned, to the central office immediately after November 25. We call your attention to these points in order to prevent misunderstandings and duplication of efforts. See that your applications for membership and your contributions for the American Red Cross are sent to the central office through your district and parish alliances. The central office will keep a record of your activity. If in your town and vicinity special collection circumstances prevail and you <span class="page-break">3</span>are obliged to work with a local organization, then keep a record of your and our people's contributions and notify the central office, because such information will be helpful to us. Inasmuch as contributions will be collected at every public place, at all street corners, and at places where people are employed, very few will be able to avoid this obligation.</p>
   <p>Therefore we appeal to you to send your contribution to the American Red Cross through our national organization and its branches.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku,</p>
   <p>3205 West 22nd Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
