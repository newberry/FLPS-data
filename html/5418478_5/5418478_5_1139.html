   <p>P.4--The fair for the old people's home and the orphan asylum has not met with the success really expected. Why? The answer to this question is not easy to find. For there is nothing to-day to keep anybody from endorsing this enterprise.</p>
   <p>Formerly many people used as excuse a paragraph in the by-laws which read that nobody should be accepted for the old people's home who could not deposit $300 as admission fee, which was against their better judgment, and they could not develop any enthusiasm for the enterprise. This paragraph has been entirely rescinded, and every old man or woman will be admitted when poverty and merit have been proved.</p>
   <p>And yet the icy crust on the hearts of many of our countrymen has not been melted by this alteration in the rules. Thus far not enough patrons have appeared at the bazaar to make us enthusiastically proclaim: All the people ardently desire this institution and wish for its existence.</p>
   
   <p>Well, then, there must be other reasons for this indifference. These causes ought to be sought out and removed at all costs. Surely we are not mistaken in maintaining that the most important reason for this indifference is endless dilly-dallying. People want to see something done, people want facts; in short, to see the building begun. Why wait, why delay? The ground has been paid for, some money is on hand; why not decide to erect the buildings and at last establish the proposed institutions? There is not sufficient capital, they say, to guarantee the maintenance of the institutions. There will never be sufficient; such capital must never be counted on. The capital is in the hearts of the benefactors, and because the greater part of these do not want to release it before the institutions are established, the capital lies dead, bearing no interest, and that is a mistake.</p>
   <p>Why not go ahead with building? What is there to be afraid of? Once Bohemian old men, old women, and orphans are in the institution, surely we shall not let them want. The Bohemian people certainly would not so shame themselves. It is useless, to-day, to argue about this matter. It has been proved that the people desire the establishment of the institutions, and therefore their wish should be complied with without delay.</p>
