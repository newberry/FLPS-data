   <p>The Bohemian National Cemetery Association held its regular meeting yesterday. The president, Mr. Pech, called the meeting to order at eight o'clock in the evening. The secretary, Mr. Halik, read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were noted and unanimously approved. Accounts payable as read by the financial secretary were approved and ordered paid. The payroll for employed workers in the amount of $3,799.33 was noted. Then followed the reading of communications received. Robert H. Vickers, of Lodge No. 63 announced by letter that in its meeting it had elected as delegate, Brother Victor H. Filip of 1125 Eighteenth Street, for a period of one year.

Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Jednota, (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society) announces that Brother Zelenka resigned as delegate because of his advanced age, and that in his stead Brother Thomas Tyk was elected as delegate. Lodge Vratislav, No. 51, C. S. P. S. (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society) protests against the action of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association in regard to the increase in prices of lots, both large and small <span class="page-break">\2</span>and the increase in charges for digging graves on lots owned by individuals. The lodge insists that prices should remain as heretofore. On this question, there ensued a debate among several members of the Association, and it was finally resolved on motion of the chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Smejkal, that the letter be taken note of, filed, and a written explanation sent to the Lodge. The matter was turned over to the secretary for the required action.</p>
   <p>The letter from Doctor F. Iska, whereby he sends a circular and proclamation on behalf of Czech-American Freethought Society and Associates, asking for support and aid in the construction of the "Hus House" was accepted and postponed indefinitely. The gymnastic society, Sokol Havlicek, extends an invitation to attend the ceremonies in connection with the laying of the corner stone of its new gymnasium, on October 8. Noted and filed.</p>

   <p>The following transfers of lots were made: Marie Tourek to Marie Mudil; Adolph Petrik to Anna Petrik; Anton Kouba to Frank Mark and Marie Burian to Vaclav Burian. All of these transfers were approved. Then followed a debate as to whether or not the Board of Directors should make a report in regard to the building of a crematorium, how far negotiations with builders of electric furnaces for crematoriums have proceeded and whether or not a crematorium is really going to be built, if so, when will the work be started. Messrs. Hladovec, Mencl, Pospisil, Svoboda, Kopecky, Benes, and Friedl took part in the debate in which various opinions were voiced. In the end, a motion by Mr. Kopecky and seconded by Smejkal that the present committee of three be augmented by four other members was approved.
