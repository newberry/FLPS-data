   <p>P.1, Col.3--That the interest of our most important humane undertakings, are not diminishing, is best proven by the contributions received from various meetings, club social affairs and dances. It is the aim, or hope of this Bohemian institution of Chicago, to be able to say, that every gathering of Bohemians has and always will, acknowledge this worthy cause, in the way of financial support.</p>
   <p>During the New Year's Eve celebration, given by the well known, "Ceska Vlast Society," a collection was taken up by Mr. J. Peklem, the proceeds of which were given to the proper authority, or society in charge of the Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage.</p>
   <p>We hope that this may serve as an example to other clubs, lodges and societies which are less active in this humanitarian cause.</p>
