   <p>A week of urgent work commenced yesterday for the delegates to the convention of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity). The brilliant days of the golden jubilee celebration being over, the convention set about its work again, and a whole week will be devoted to consultations and to amendments to the constitution. Apparently it will take a great deal of work, because each article of the constitution is being considered, each article is being discussed by many of the delegates, and therefore it is certain that the convention will last until next Tuesday as the program indicates.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's session was called to order at 9:30 A. M. by the chairman, Sister <span class="page-break">2</span>Bohumila Ludvik. Almost all of the delegates were present. The chairman then mentioned the death of Vaclav Snajdr, Nestor of Bohemian-American journalists, who also did a considerable service for the Jednota Ceskych Dam at the time when the order was just established. The delegates showed respect to his memory by rising.</p>
   <p>Because the printed minutes could not be delivered in time, the reading of Saturday's minutes was postponed until later, when they were approved with minor corrections necessitated chiefly by typographical errors.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Sister Anna Stolfa, then read many congratulatory communications from the following societies: [Translator's note: Names of societies have been omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The work on amendments to the constitution was begun Saturday, and several <span class="page-break">3</span>articles were approved or in some cases slightly altered.....</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was called to order at 2 P. M. and the following congratulatory communications were read:....</p>
   <p>After the reading of congratulatory communications, the delegates began working on amendments. Under the able leadership of the chairman, Sister Bohumila Ludvik, and with the harmonious co-operation of all the delegates and officers of the convention, the work proceeded smoothly. The above-mentioned constitutional changes are not of very much importance to our people, because in most cases they are not drastic. But even in this regard it is apparent that all the delegates do their best to see that each amendment or each correction is properly considered with greatest regard for the benefit of the whole organization. So far, the results of the convention bear out the evidence that <span class="page-break">4</span>each change and amendment will lead only to the common good, and when the convention comes to a conclusion next week, the delegates will be able to point to all that has been accomplished for the interest of all members of the Jednota Ceskych Dam.</p>
