   <p>When people are fortunate and happy, they should remember the less fortunate, suffering, and poverty stricken, and endeavor to aid them. At every large meeting or entertainment of our countrymen, if the Old People's Home and Orphanage, were remembered as happened at the celebration of the silver wedding anniversary of Joseph and Caroline Souhrada, that institution could take care of all of our needy aged people and orphans.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Marie Ledvinka and Mrs. Matilda Ruzicka, well-known workers in social circles, took up a collection among the guests for the benefit of the Home and Orphanage. They collected a total of eleven dollars. Mrs. Ledvinka, who is a representative in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Home and Orphanage Association, will turn this money in at the next meeting of that organization.</p>
   <p>A large number of friends attended the celebration of the Souhrada's silver wedding anniversary, and they will never forget the pleasing, sincere entertainment which was prepared for them.</p>
