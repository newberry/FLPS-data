   <p>p. 1, col. 6.. At the close of the year, it is with sincere pleasure that we follow the growth and influence of Ch. J. C. D. (Chicago Bohemian Women's Unity). This year was fortunate for our Unity, because it increased its membership satisfactorily; in fact the number of its members doubled, and the Unity today has almost as many lodges as it did at the height of its development. In addition to other benefits, the J. C. D. provides for its members a death benefit payment of $300 which it pays within several weeks after the death of a member. Several new lodges were formed this year, the constitution was amended, certificates were introduced and much beneficial work was done, so that the J. C. D. today stands upon a good foundation and we hope that it will continue to grow in strength and ability to contribute to the welfare of its members and their descendants. The executive committee of the Chicago J. C. D. (Chicago Bohemian Women's Unity) wishes the best of success.</p>
