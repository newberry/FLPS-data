   <p>The Klub Letem-Svetem (By Wings Through the World Club), which enjoys well-deserved popularity among our countrymen, for its philanthropic deeds has proved again that this popularity is merited. In the meeting just recently held members of this Club decided that the Club's cash on hand should be divided among our charitable institutions, and the money was divided as follows: for the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, $20; for the St. Joseph Orphanage of Lisle, Illinois, $10; and, for the Free-Thought Schools, $10. These amounts, for the purposes mentioned, were deposited in our office.</p>
