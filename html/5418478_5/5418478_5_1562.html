   <p>When the collection for the benefit of suffering children in Czechoslovakia was concluded by us--a collection that was a part of Mr. Herbert Hoover's successful nation-wide campaign--we were aware of other tasks which were dictated to us not only by our Czechoslovak sentiments, but by those of America and humanity in general. Now that we have accomplished a piece of good work for suffering Europe, and for Czechoslovakia especially, we know very well that it is impossible for us to arrest our activities, but that we must continue work in behalf of our local enterprises which also need our support. And if any of our enterprises are worthy of our support, one of them is the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association). The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is purely a humane institution. The Association is composed of representatives of all classes of our people. Any local enlightened Czechoslovak of good will and good heart may become an active or a contributing member. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost and its Ladies' Auxiliary have many enthusiastic members. In spite of this, however, the Association cannot accomplish all its good work without calling on our people for assistance. The Association would like to depend only upon its own resources, and this would be possible if its membership would substantially increase so that all of its projected work could be accomplished without recourse to aid from the general public.</p>
   <p>For that reason, a campaign was recently launched by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost with the intention of obtaining the greatest possible number of new members. The Association ordered the printing of a variety of pamphlets and mailed them to our people and various organizations, requesting them to give these the best of attention. We therefore ask everybody who receives such communication not to throw it away but to read it carefully, and especially read the last annual report of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. After reading this last annual report, the reader will gladly reach into his pocket and send the required five dollars as an annual fee together with the application for membership. When he realizes that by doing so he personally contributes to an institution that is recognized officially as one of the foremost charitable organizations of Chicago, and not only the foremost but the most unselfish and economical one, he will gladly make such contribution.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost does not have a number of highly paid employees; it does not boast of having sumptuously equipped and large offices; but, on the other hand, it does have its one aim of utilizing every penny of its resources for those purposes for which it is meant--devoting its money to those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in abject misery. It was for this reason that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost was approved not only by the investigating authorities, but also by the committee of the Chicago Industrial League, which recommended it very highly by using it as an example to other organizations of the same kind.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we ask everyone who is able to make contributions to become a member of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. Every self-conscious and humane Czechoslovak should be proud to claim membership in this organization. Every self-conscious local Czechoslovak woman, especially the wives and mothers, should consider it her duty to belong to the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost.</p>
   <p>The contributing member pays an annual fee of five dollars, but there are no limits to charity. The more you give the better for the treasurer of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, and the better for the unhappy and poor countrymen of ours who receive aid from this Association.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost desires to be self-sufficient in this work. The Association would be grateful if by arrangement of balls and other forms of entertainment it would become unnecessary to seek aid from the general public. By having a larger number of members who would guarantee its income by their dues, the Association would not have to seek outside help, and its work would thus become much easier and more effective. In order to secure as many members as possible, the Association appointed a membership drive committee, the chairman of which is Mr. Vladimir Spatny. The ladies committee [Names of members of committee are omitted in translation.] developed a feverish activity during the last few days which certainly deserves the best results. It has mailed the above-mentioned request to organizations and to individuals. The request is accompanied by a coupon which is to be filled out and returned in the inclosed self-addressed envelope to the treasurer of the committee, Mr. Thomas Kallal, 3245 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In the next few days we will mention in greater detail some of the meritorious work which the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is doing.</p>
