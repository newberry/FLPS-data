   <p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association was held last evening in the office of banker, Mr. Hajicek. Several important matters were discussed.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association is progressing successfully in its work, and because all of its members, especially the directors, conscientiously perform their duties, it is a very good reason why this Association has become a real benefactor for our poor people, and that it is gaining favor and support in the widest circles.</p>
   <p>Judge J. Z. Uhlir presided at the meeting yesterday. The minutes of the previous meeting were read, and upon the motion of Mr. Cihak, were unanimously approved. The reading of communications received was the next order of business. The most interesting of those, which were not concerned with requests for aid, was the letter from the secretary of the United Charities of Chicago, Helen R. Friend, <span class="page-break">2</span>in which the Bohemian Charitable Association is requested to take over all Bohemian cases in need of aid.</p>
   <p>In order that the objectionable points of this letter may be understood, we herewith give a brief explanation. The Bohemian Charitable Association will surely look after and help any countrymen who are stricken by difficulty or misfortune, but it is expected that other societies should share their contributions for the care of our poor, especially when such societies appeal for support to our more well-to-do Bohemians, and receive it in generous amounts. Alderman Cermak also expressed himself in that sense about the communication from Secretary Friend. He moved that the communication be accepted, and Miss Friend be informed that the Bohemian Charitable Association is willing to take over all Bohemian cases, but that it should be given one-half of the contributions which the United Charities of Chicago receive from Bohemians. In the end, a committee, composed of Messrs. Uhlir, Cermak, and Cervenka, was appointed. This committee is to call on Mr. Wacker, chairman of the United Charities of Chicago, to discuss the matter.</p>

   <p>Mr. Cervenka then reported the result of the conference with the National Cemetery Association in regard to the burial of the poor, free of charge, upon the recommendation of the Bohemian Charitable Association. As we already have mentioned, the matter under discussion was the burial without charge in such cases, instead of first paying for the grave, and then asking for a refund. For that purpose, a committee had been appointed, composed of Messrs. Otto R. Fuerst, and John A. Cervenka, to visit a meeting of the Cemetery Association in order to explain the matter, and obtain the agreement of that body. From. Mr. Cervenka's report, we learned that the committee was not successful. The National Cemetery has a constitution and by-laws in this respect, and the deputation was given to understand that the Cemetery Association does not intend to deviate therefrom. The matter was referred to the managing committee, but inasmuch as that committee was unfavorable toward the Bohemian Charitable Association's request, it is almost certain that it will not receive satisfactory action on its request from the committee.</p>

   <p>Alderman Anton J. Cermak called attention to the constantly recurrence of calls for collections for the benefit of the poor in the newspapers. He observed that this should have been stopped long ago, and anyone in need of assistance should turn to the Bohemian Charitable Association, or be sent to it.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. A. Cervenka spoke briefly about the preparations being made for the celebration of the Fourth of July, and urged that work commence in preparation for Tag Day, which will take place in all Bohemian sections for the benefit of the Bohemian Charitable Association.</p>
   <p>After the settlement of various minor matters, Mr. John Docekal read a report summarizing the activities of the Association since the last annual meeting up to May 26. It appears from this report that there were ninety-five applications received for assistance; eighty-two of such cases received assistance, and in thirteen cases, it was denied. Insofar as securing employment is concerned, steady jobs were obtained for six applicants; temporary jobs were obtained for four applicants. It should be noted that more people are constantly asking for work, but there is none to be had. Therefore, the Bohemian <span class="page-break">5</span>Charitable Association is asking and begging Bohemian employers, who could perhaps offer some jobs, to call the office of the Bohemian Charitable Association for workers.</p>
   <p>The total receipts from January 1, to May 26, amounted to $816. The disbursements for the same period were $634.67. This sum includes all relief payments and expenses in connection with the management and maintenance of the office. Cash on hand amounts to $2,347.07.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Charitable Association considers it as its duty to express its heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Kolar, Dr. Tetrev, and Dr. Steere, all of whom, with extraordinary generosity, offered their services in many cases gratis, to the Association, being recommended to them by the Association. The same applies to the druggist, Mr. Foucek, who donated the medicines prescribed by the doctors. No less praiseworthy is the generosity of the following lawyers: Messrs. Pisa, Klenha, and Triska, who took care of some matters for penniless clients, upon the recommendation of the Association.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>As can be seen, there is no lack of generosity on the part of the Charitable Association, and there is no doubt, today, that there has developed from it an institution of which every Chicago Bohemian can be proud.</p>
