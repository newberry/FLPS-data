   <p>The C. S. P. S. (Cesko-Slovanska Podporující Spolecnost [Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society]) has raised its dues for death benefits a ten per cent. The new scale becomes effective on January 21. This change is not considered "regular," and no information was given as to whether the raise will become permanent. It was passed as a measure necessitated by war conditions. Many organizations have already introduced similar amendments, and others will soon feel compelled to follow this example if they want to be prepared properly for an eventual increase in mortality rates.</p>
   <p>Slovak benevolent societies held conferences sometime ago in regard to this matter and decided in their plenary meeting upon a raise in the mortality dues. These are being collected from the beginning of the new year. Thus the Slovak groups have been first in taking an action which our Czech organizations will have to take if they are to avoid great embarrassment later. Every one of us wishes these raises were not necessary, but a few cents more per month does not matter when the interest of our lodge brothers who are serving under Uncle Sam's flag is at stake. It is better to be prepared than to run the risk of being unable to meet just obligations.</p>
   <p>We hope that war emergency funds which are being created now will not be called on, yet their existence means security and preparedness.</p>
   <p>The main lodge of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society took up this question in a meeting on January 18, and offered the following explanations:</p>
   <p>"The moment has arrived when our often proclaimed love for the survivors of members will be put to a severe test. This applies particularly to relatives of members who have laid down their lives upon the altar of the motherland. In order to pass this ordeal with honors, every one of us will have to sacrifice a coin or two so that death benefits can be paid to survivors of fallen soldiers within the shortest possible time.</p>
   <p>"Having already been called on by the grand lodge of the State of Illinois several months ago, the national main lodge, in its meeting on January 18, 1918, decided upon a raise of ten per cent in the dues for death benefits as an indispensable necessity. This surplus will be used for the creation of an extra fund which will represent a war reserve."</p>
   <p>Accordingly, $1.18 will be the dues on $1,000 for persons eighteen years old for death benefits. Ordinary insurance rates will be raised in a similar manner. This innovation will remain valid until the end of the war, or up to the next plenary meeting when it may be voided.</p>
   <p>The United States Government requests all benevolent societies to urge members now in military service to apply for Government insurance. February 12 is the deadline for the filing of applications for all those recruited before August of last year. Time is pressing for those who want to take advantage of the benefit offered by the Government.</p>
   <p>Our brotherhoods are gladly fulfilling the Government's wishes. The main lodges are sending out notes to minor lodges concerning this matter, elucidating the benefits derived from Government insurance.</p>
   <p>It may be said that this insurance works to the detriment of the benevolent societies, since it will remain in force even after the war. Our societies are, however, far too patriotic to attach undue importance to this point. They keep foremost in their minds the fact that Government insurance will, at any rate, do much good for all soldier-members and their families.</p>
