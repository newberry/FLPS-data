   <p>The Czechoslovak people of Chicago, in order to show their recognition and appreciation of an artist who has aged in the service of her muse Thalia, and who was so cruelly visited by fate....have united to express that recognition to Mrs. Eliska Novak. Mrs. Novak was for several decades a recognized artist of Bohemia and Moravia. Fate brought her to America where her talent served her well....For her benefit, the Narodni Divadlo (National Theater) of Chicago, under the directorship of Mr. Krejci, produced the well-known operetta "Kouzlo Valciku" (The Charm of Waltz). Everybody who was able has contributed either morally or materially to make this occasion a success. The actors gave their services gratis; the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs furnished its hall free; our newspapers gave their space for this occasion without charge; the printing establishment of Mejdrich and Kalik printed the posters free of charge; and last but not least, the audience likewise contributed by attending the play on a day which was characterized by bad weather. In spite of the last named obstacle, all seats were sold and the hall of the Sokol was filled to capacity. The performance and stage setting were very fine.</p>
   <p>After the second act, the veteran aged actress had to make a curtain speech. It was brief but hearty, and thanked all who contributed to the success of the evening. Mr. Krejci then appeared before the curtain and addressed the audience. He pointed out the work done by Mrs. Elizka Novak, her sacrifices for the sake of her nation and her art, and emphasized the duties which devolve upon us to make her old age bearable. Though penniless, she has the knowledge that she is not deserted and forgotten, and that should make her happy.</p>
