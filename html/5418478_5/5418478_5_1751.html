   <p>We willingly fulfill the wishes of the Legionnaires and we hope that our public, after reading this, will form their own conception about the activities and ideals of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago. This organization does not care to exist only as an ordinary society, but it wants to prove by its activity that whenever and wherever it is necessary, it is willing to work with love and enthusiasm not only for national and cultural causes, but also for the cause of humanity. Therefore, we expect that the Czechoslovak Legionnaires will be supported in all their undertakings by our public, who in that way will prove that the sacrifices made by our legionnaires for the liberation of the Czechoslovak nation are acknowledged. It will also prove that the work which is being done by them and the work which they are willing to do among us in the future, is fully valued and recognized.</p>
