   <p>A year's hard work is being completed by our organizations, whose satisfaction will be the consciousness of honest effort. The year 1917 has not been characterized by any event conspicuous in the routine of social activities. In the case of some societies the year has not been better, perhaps, than the one preceding it. In general, it has not been worse. Some organizations have been able to register an increase in membership. This was not expected, for reasons that we often mentioned. No matter how much one may wish for a growing membership, it cannot, under present circumstances, thrive. There is not material enough to solicit members. The situation was different only a few years ago.</p>
   <p>We may well be prepared for future years to come without prospect of betterment. Restriction of immigration is one reason for the unfavorable conditions.</p>

   <p>Many members have enlisted in the armies.</p>
   <p>The decreasing membership in our aid and benevolent societies will soon bring up the question of a unification of these organizations. The moment for such a step is favorable, and its urgency greater than ever before.</p>
