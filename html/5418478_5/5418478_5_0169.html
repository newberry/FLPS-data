   <p>The Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies of America, founded in St. Louis in 1854, will be sixty-six years old next year. It is interesting to note that as fraternal, benevolent societies they are the oldest in the United States. Such societies as the Masons, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and others are older, in fact, we could trace the first mentioned to the middle ages, but they were not, and even now, are not benevolent societies in the same meaning as the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies. In the American societies, you could compare only the Woodmen, the Royal Arcanum, etc., which are insuring for a certain amount in case of death, with our benevolent societies.</p>
   <p>I remember once when an insurance agent from a life insurance company offered me a policy, one of his principal arguments was that no fraternal, benevolent society could survive longer than forty years. According to the best opinions <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of their actuaries, he said it is simply impossible. I told him at that time that I knew of one fraternal, benevolent society older than fifty years, which is still prospering, and was discharging all of its duties to insured brothers. Finally, he admitted that he heard about one existing Bohemian society, but that during the last forty years, many others had discontinued activities.</p>
   <p>At that time, the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies were fifty years old, and so far there was not a single legitimate claim which had not been satisfactorily adjusted.</p>
   <p>Today, they are more than sixty years old, hoping soon to celebrate their diamond jubilee, and they are still "doing business in the same old place."</p>
   <p>In last year's convention, the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies accepted new rates which provided that a member who is eighteen years old and insured for $1,000 will pay $1.18 a month; a member forty years old, will pay $2.56, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and others accordingly. No one would say that these rates are too high, in fact, they are much smaller, comparing them with the rates of life insurance companies.</p>
   <p>The Woodmen of the World, one of the largest fraternal societies in America, founded about thirty years ago, and much younger than the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies, in their last convention "readjusted" the rates so that a member fifty years old will pay $3.70 a month for a $1,000 policy; a member sixty years old will pay $6.14, and a member seventy years old will pay $11.39 monthly, etc. Another of their new regulations is that these payments must be paid up during the month of January, which means one whole year in advance, so for instance, a member deceased in the month of January will have his assessments paid up for another eleven months, the same as required by insurance companies.</p>
   <p>One could understand very readily that these new rates mean a great burden for older members. Not only that, but new readjusted rates for the ages of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>eighteen to forty years are identical with those of the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies.</p>
   <p>The Woodmen of the World is a society thirty years old--the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies is sixty-five years old. Anyone who is interested in arithmetic can easily ascertain what rates the Woodmen of the World will have in the next thirty-five years, and compare them with the existing rates of the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies after sixty-five years of existence.</p>
   <p>The Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies with their rates are a phenomenon in the history of fraternalism, considering that they are sixty-five years old. It also should be considered that this record has been attained without excluding the so-called hazardous occupations, which is a practice of American societies. The Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies are covering and making no exceptions for members as to "healthy or unhealthy" states. This always should be a credit to them.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Today, after sixty-five years of existence, having almost the same rates for the average age as the American fraternal society, which is only thirty years old, the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies are prospering, when many other societies after many years of existence have disbanded, or were forced to unite with others. For two-thirds of a century, a fact that the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies were able to give protection to sons and daughters of Bohemian (Czech) origin in the United States is proof that we should be thankful for wise, prudent and economical leadership.</p>
   <p>I am not, and do not consider myself as one of the old founders and pioneers of the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies, but I am able to look back after thirty-one years in United States and recall that it was those brothers, active in National or Grand Lodges, who left such an astonishing record of generous, unselfish work for us. Very few of them had a high school education, but they were men of practical ideas, and always ready to offer themselves for action. Seldom elsewhere could we find an example of such <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>unselfish service. Material rewards were trivial, but to them it was always a sacrificing, profitless service.</p>
   <p>There is still something else about the Woodmen of the World and the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies. Although the grand officers of the first mentioned society were receiving fairly good rewards, the last convention raised their salaries. There are seventeen grand officers. Their salaries amount to $67,005 yearly, or an average of about $4,000 per man. This does not mean that each of these seventeen grand officers receives one seventeenth of $65,000. Some are minor officers, receiving only about $2,000 a year, but the highest officer--Sovereign Commander--receives $15,000 or more. These are not the only expenses the Woodmen of the World have in maintaining their main office. These are only the salaries of grand officers, who are directing only. To do the work, they have bookkeepers, accountants, clerks, stenographers, etc. These employees occupy several floors of a big skyscraper.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>What a difference in the main office of the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies! There we have only two officers, receiving only meager salaries for real hard work, while the other help only receive nominal wages.</p>
   <p>I do not say that this is just, for were it not for the sacrificing, unselfish service from the beginning of the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies, and through decades, who knows if after sixty-five years of existence the Czecho Slavonic Benevolent Societies could boast of the record that there is not a single legitimate claim which has not been satisfactorily adjusted, and also that its rates will stand comparison with this big American society which is more than thirty years younger.</p>
