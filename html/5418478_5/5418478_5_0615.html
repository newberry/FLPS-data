   <p>At 7:30 A.M. yesterday, for the fifth time, an all day session of the delegates of the C.S.P.S. (Czecho Slovak Benefit Association) was brought to order. The most important accomplishment of the morning session was the adoption of the resolution, that benefit payment in the event of death of a brother member shall be $750.00 hereafter, instead of $650.00 as previously. There was considerable discussion on the matter before the resolution was adopted. It was also decided to leave the management of the reserve funds in the control of the individual lodges.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon session discussion of Section 14- Paragraph 4, of the Constitution, dealing with the admittance of lodges having members past 45 years in age, was continued. Because of the importance of this paragraph the matter was referred to a committee composed of one member from each State.</p>
   
   <p>Should some lodge find it necessary to change some part of the Constitution, it will secure the agreement of three others in different States, in which there are lodges. Such correction shall, after due consideration and acknowledgement of the importance of its principles, be sent to all lodges for decision.</p>
   <p>The voting to be carried out in the same manner as at the convention, that is: one vote for each 25 members. If the amendments be accepted by two-thirds of the entire vote it shall then be in force. All voting to be carried on in a regular meeting of each lodge.</p>
   <p>The convention then took up the amendments to the laws of the National Grand Lodge, which took up the whole afternoon. The convention adjourned at 6:30 P.M. to resume at 7:00 A.M. Saturday.</p>
