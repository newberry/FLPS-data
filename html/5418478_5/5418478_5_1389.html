   <p>The regular meeting of the delegates to the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was held yesterday in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets....The meeting began at 8 P.

   <p>The secretary of the board of directors of the Utulna then read the minutes of two meetings of the board as follows: The meeting of March 31, 1922 took place in the Husuv Dum (John Huss Memorial Building).

Kosobud, of the American State Bank; Mr. E. F. Silha, of the First National Bank of Cicero; Mr. Evzen W. Kaspar, of the Kaspar State Bank.</p>

   <p>The bank representatives as well as the attending members of the board gave their opinions regarding the creation of the reserve fund. The whole matter was discussed in great detail and the creation of the fund was unanimously approved. The fund will be handled and managed by the Kaspar State Bank. Everybody agreed that the fund will be safely deposited there and that it will be properly managed and increased.</p>
   <p>The other meeting of the board took place on April 7, 1922 in the office of the board. Messrs. Evzen Kaspar, E. F. Silha, and Frank Mayer attended that meeting also. Mr. Mayer, who is a lawyer for the Kaspar State Bank, after elucidating the matter, submitted a resolution by which the president and the secretary of the Utulna are empowered to sign an agreement with the Kaspar State Bank, thus making it possible for the fund to become a fact. By that agreement the said bank is bound to protect all moneys of the Utulna, to purchase bonds and mortgages, to collect all interest accrued, to furnish statements about the fund, and generally to manage conscientiously all matters relative to it for a payment of one eighth of one per cent of the total amount deposited, which, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>according to estimates, would be about $25 annually. The offer by the Kaspar State Bank was willingly accepted by the board of directors of the Utulna and by the delegates. It was further decided to hire the services of a certified public accountant for our institution, and the position was given to Mr. S. J. Viescor, 11 South La Salle Street, who is of Czech origin, and who can be of help to us by auditing all of our books and accounts. Mr. Suchy then announced that he intends to secure the services of some radio station which would advertise the work of our Utulna.</p>
   <p>The next item which came up for discussion was the preliminary work necessary for the building of a swimming pool for the children. The pool is to be furnished by the ladies auxiliary of the Pilsen Brewery Company. Mr. James F. Stepina sent us a check for $80 which amount is to be used for the purchase of furnishings of a room which bears his name. A bill for $125, sent by the firm Kroupa and Smejkal, attorneys, for some legal work done by that firm in behalf of the Utulna, was deferred for later action. The board of directors knows nothing about any legal work having been done by that firm <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>The payment of a premium of $50 to insure the cashier against theft was approved. The face value of the policy is $2,000.</p>
   <p>The matter of the reserve fund was then thoroughly discussed, and....the resolution [empowering the president and the secretary of the board] was read in English and Bohemian. After a lengthy debate in which Messrs. Zrust, Suchy, Novak, Spinar, Leahman, and Petru, and Mrs. Lorenz took part, it was unanimously decided to let the Kaspar State Bank manage the fund, and to let the board of directors take the necessary steps in that direction. The treasurer, Mr. Petru, reported that he received the obligatory amount of $1,252.50 from the county, this sum covering the months of December, January, and February. He also announced that Mr. Charles A. Mrizek, who is the president of the Atlas Baking Company, a well-known Czech enterprise, will have a radio installed for the inmates of the Utulna. Mr. Novak representing the committee on accounts made a report of the work of his committee which examined the books, checking accounts, etc....The expenses during the month of March, 1922 amounted to $2,383.43; the income for that month was $1,894.27....</p>
