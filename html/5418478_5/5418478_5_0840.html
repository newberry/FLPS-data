   <p>Those ladies who willingly responded to a call issued by the directors of the Czech Orphanage may proudly point to the success of the tag day for which they gave their time and energy to the humanitarian cause. The collections for the day totaled $715.16. This sum represents money laboriously collected, mostly from people who themselves possess no superabundance of it.</p>
   <p>Forty-nine ladies tagged, while over one hundred had permission to do so. Some of the workers were on the spot early, and obtained much larger collections than some of the latecomers. Mrs. Carolyn Hruby, 3622 West 22nd Street, topped all of the workers with a collection of $45.66. By mentioning this, however, we do not mean to disparage the work done by the other ladies. Some of them were downright out of luck. They obtained small amounts because the stands assigned to them simply did not yield more.</p>
