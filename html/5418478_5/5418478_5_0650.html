   <p>An important meeting of the officers of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital) is being called at the Pilsen Park pavilion on Wednesday evening, June 23, 1920. According to the statement of Dr. Charles Neumann, who is secretary of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice, the matter of the disposal of the hospital building will be discussed. The building, as our readers well remember, was bought for this project many years ago. But it appears today that the whole project will be dissolved. If the matter of the disposal of the building is to be discussed, then the question will arise as to what will be done with the money received. There is no doubt that the building may be sold at a profit at the present time, because of its location and the price of the material used in the construction of it.</p>
   <p>We ourselves have been very much interested in this project ever since its inception, and we have supported it to the best of our ability. Therefore, we do not expect to be blamed if, prior to tomorrow's meeting, we express <span class="page-break">\2</span>our opinion on how to invest the money to the best advantage. Originally, the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice was destined to serve our poor suffering countrymen as a free asylum with the best possible nursing care. As far as we know, such an institution to take care of our aged and poor countrymen and country women who have nobody here to nurse them is already in existence. We have in mind the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) located near the Bohemian National Cemetery. Both of these institutions, which are in fact one great institution of which our Freethinking countrymen are justly proud, are financially insecure.</p>
   <p>Therefore we ask: Would it not be proper that the money received for the building which was destined for the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice be donated to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec? Both of these institutions have hospital sections which would prove inadequate in case of an epidemic. If the money received for the structure of the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice were given to the above-named institutions, the hospital sections of both these institutions could be enlarged and improved. This would be a good and meritorious deed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We hope that the people who discuss the question tomorrow evening on what to do and how to invest the money received will take into consideration our proposition, because above all they must not forget that Bohemian-America is duty bound to do something for itself.</p>
