   <p>The Damsky Pomocny Spolek Ceskeho Sirotcinec (Ladies' Aid Society of the Bohemian Orphanage) is making extensive preparations for an entertainment to be given in the Pilsen Park pavilion on April 27, 1922. As in all previous affairs arranged by this excellent organization, this one has been prepared to aid our orphans as much as possible. The Spolek consists of four hundred Bohemian ladies residing in Chicago, Cicero, Berwyn, Oak Park, and Riverside, Illinois,and from the time of its foundation to this day it has been tirelessly active in behalf of the Bohemian Orphanage.</p>
   <p>In its last meeting, conducted by Mrs. Alma Marek, the Spolek listened attentively to a motion made by her. According to the motion the Spolek was to furnish all the necessary paraphernalia for a gymnasium of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), and agreed unanimously to do so. The sum of $600 is required to purchase this equipment, but the ladies are so active that the required sum will soon be realized. The fact <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that during the six years of its existence the Spolek was able to clothe the orphans at a cost of $10,000 is sufficient proof of its successful activity. It is to be hoped that this new project will be as easily accomplished as all the previous ones, and that the Pilsen Park pavilion will be filled to capacity next Thursday.</p>
