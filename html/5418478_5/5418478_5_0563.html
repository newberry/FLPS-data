   <p>"Don't believe them, don't give them anything!" These are the words of our unforgetable Havlichek, and they may be appropriately applied to some of the propagators of mutual aid societies among foreign nationalities. And for what good reason, then, do our fellow countrymen join those associations, when their interests can be equally well served by Czech organizations? There is a club, now being formed, which is to be attached to the Lozhe Cech (Czeh Lodge) No. 25, of the thriving Ches. Slov. Jednota (Czecho Slavonic Union). The membership and medical aid are free of charge. Prospective members may sign up in Schnabl's Tavern, 26th St., and Trumbull Ave.; at Mr. Fischer's, Lawndale Ave. and 26th St., at Mr. Slama's Throop St. and 18th St., at Mr. Soukup's 25th St. and Sawyer Ave.; and with Mr. Richard Hegner, a member of the agitation committee, 2522 So. Hamlin Ave.</p>
