   <p>The lodges of the Cesko Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society) have elected the candidates from whom the representatives to the general assembly will be selected. The rules established for this election do not provide an individual delegate for each lodge. Instead, the representatives are apportioned to the various states according to the number of members within a state. Every lodge has already elected its candidate. The names were sent to the grand lodges which will arrange for the ballots. The members in each state will then elect their number of representatives. The next assembly will take place in Chicago next year.</p>
