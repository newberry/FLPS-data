   <p>A recent poll among the members of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost [usually abbreviated C. S. P. S.] [Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society] showed that although the majority favors the installment of an "organizer," the necessary two-thirds majority could not be mustered.....An organizer is urgently needed to maintain the present number of members and to agitate for an increase.....Immigration has reached a low point, and new members can be drawn from Czechs already settled.....Recruiting also decreases the number of prospective members.</p>
