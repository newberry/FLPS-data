   <p>The storms of the last war and all the later tragic events in our national life have, in a large measure, caused the annihilation of every great national enthusiasm and self-sacrifice, the two beautiful virtues of which our Bohemian-Chicago was so proud. This fact is known to everyone who was interested in the spiritual life of our Czechoslovak colony in this metropolis, though many optimists could be found who regarded this phase of our life as the logical outcome of postwar slackening and fatigue, or merely a transition from one period to another. Well, these purported connoisseurs of our people suffered a great defeat yesterday in the public meeting which was called by the trustees of the Spolek Pro Postaveni Cesko-Americke Nemocnice (Society for the Erection of a Bohemian-American Hospital). It was in this meeting, we are sorry to say, that those avowed optimists received their coup de grace. The entire public meeting which, as announced by our papers, was to be held in the Pilsen Park pavilion, consisted of twenty-seven people inclusive of the managing committee, the board <span class="page-break">\2</span>of trustees, and other officers, and two newspaper reporters. It was a sad public mass meeting and one which was to decide the fate of such a humane and important an institution as a hospital undoubtedly is....</p>
   <p>It was shortly after 9 P. M. when the painful silence was finally interrupted by the gavel of the president, Mr. John A. Cervenka. He opened the meeting by a brief address explaining the purposes which led to the calling of this meeting and expressed his disappointment in its meager attendance. Dr. Neumann, as secretary of the Spolek, then read a brief survey of the activities of the organization from its inception on April 11, 1913 to April 13, 1922. This survey was as follows:</p>
   <p>The day of April 11, 1913 marks the beginning of our organization, for on that day the Spolek was organized in a public meeting held in the Pilsen Park pavilion. This took place after a great many conferences with the Spolek Ceskych Lekaru (Bohemian Medical Society) which latter organization believed that a Bohemian hospital was necessary in Chicago. Immediately following that <span class="page-break">\3</span>meeting, a board of trustees was elected. That body was organized on April 17, 1913 and consisted of Mr. John A. Cervenka, president; Dr. L. Fischer, secretary; Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, treasurer. When Dr. Fischer later resigned, Dr. Karel Neumann was elected in his place. In the beginning there were fifteen trustees, but their number was increased to twenty-one shortly after. At present the board consists of the following: Messrs. Stanislav J. Loula, John J. Chvatal, B. O. Bouse, Anton Pergler, James Dibelka, Josef Bolek, Edvard J. Kvidera, Josef A. Holpuch, Doctors J. Zabokrtsky, F. Fara, J. F. Chvatal, O. S. Pavlik; and J. P. Pecival; also the following ladies: Mesdames K. Machek and Frantiska Schejbal, Doctors F. A. Ringer, M. Schmidt, and P. R. Kapsa.</p>
   <p>The board of trustees, immediately after becoming organized, began to collect monetary contributions for the hospital, and its efforts met with splendid successes. After a short time there was enough money with which to purchase a building situated at 1424 South Albany Avenue and the extensive property adjoining it for the sum of $23,000. The mortgage was paid within two years, an <span class="page-break">\4</span>accomplishment that was made possible by the publication and sale of a directory of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance). From this latter source alone $3,500 was netted.</p>
   <p>Originally it was believed that the purchased property would serve for a hospital building and that annexes could be built if necessary. All details were studied, plans were prepared, and everything could have been brought to a successful finish had not the unfortunate World War broken out. It was decided in the interest of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, on January 28, 1916, to stop all contributions to the hospital with an idea of resuming collections at a more favorable time. From that date, then, no further collections were attempted, but the board continued to meet and expedite certain necessary matters. In order that the purchased property might bring some profits, it was rented to an athletic club. But since difficulties arose and repairs were made necessary which caused a great deal of expense, and since the taxes, too, were inordinately high, it was thought advantageous to sell the property in question. All former plans were <span class="page-break">\5</span>then rendered impossible because conditions have changed in the meantime. It was decided, therefore, that it would be better to have ready cash which could be deposited in some bank and bring interest. The board unanimously approved the sale of the property, and after a protracted dealing it was sold on March 31, 1922 to the Jewish Day and Night Nursery, and the treasury of the Spolek thus gained the net sum of $26,647. In that manner, about $3,500 was earned, and the treasury now has the sum of $30,002.16.</p>
   <p>The board had its last meeting on April 13, 1922....In that meeting it was decided to call a public meeting of the Czech people of Chicago who would decide the fate of the hospital project.</p>
   <p>The reading of the survey was accepted, and the treasurer of the Spolek, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, presented the financial report on the life of the Spolek from April 11, 1913 to April 27, 1922. [Here follows a detailed account of all moneys received, and disbursed. The sum which remains in the treasury is <span class="page-break">\6</span>$30,002.16.] The treasurer's report was approved after a lengthy debate as to what steps are to be taken in the future. Mr. J. J. Jelinek discussed the present conditions and their possibilities....and believed that some charitable person or persons could be found who would contribute to a cause so humanitarian as a hospital. He moved that new plans and estimates be made for the building of it. The president then explained that it was the original intention to have thirty-five beds in the hospital, but after a consultation with Bohemian physicians it was found that a hospital having less than seventy beds would not be a paying proposition. The members of the board, after having considered the expert opinions of the doctors, looked about for some source of income which would make the financing of such a hospital possible....They have appealed to the Sbor Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association), offering bonds for sale in behalf of the hospital. The results were so negative that they lost all desire to pursue such or similar attempts....</p>
   <p>The next speaker, Dr. Pecival, was of the opinion that our countrymen are able <span class="page-break">\7</span>to take good care of their dead ones, but that, also, they care little about their live ones. He mentioned some of our old and well-known vices which are ruinous to all the good which was accomplished. He suggests that the collection of the necessary amount be intrusted to some campaign company which would raise the needed money for a consideration....The president did not favor this idea and claimed that such companies are in fact professional beggars who would not be satisfied with a profit of less than forty to sixty per cent. He said that he gave much thought to the problem and decided that it would be best to secure the services of some capable financial expert who could try to raise the needed money by means of a bond issue. It would certainly be worth trying, and he hoped that the necessary sum could be raised in one year. Others, who attended this meeting, were of like opinion and among those who regarded the president's suggestion favorably were Messrs. Bolek, Laadt, and others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Laadt took this occasion to excuse the absence of Mr. Karel J. Vopicka whose opinion, he said, he was obliged to express in this meeting. The opinion of <span class="page-break">\8</span>Mr. Vopicka is the following: Mr. Vopicka favored the building of a Bohemian hospital, but in case the project be found impossible, he suggested that all the money be equally divided among our charitable institutions. Mr. Vopicka's suggestion, however, did not find agreement among the men attending this meeting. Smaller sums could be contributed to the said institutions but the larger sums would have to be returned to the original donors. This was also the opinion of the president and Mr. Frank G. Hajicek. Finally, at a motion of Dr. Fara it was decided to accept the original motion and to float a bond issue of about $200,000. This motion was carried unanimously. By that decision the board also received its new term of life and a purpose for further activity.</p>
