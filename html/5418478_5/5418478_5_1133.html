   <p>P.1--The annual meeting of the council yesterday proved that our people's interest in our national humanitarian undertakings is not diminishing. It seems, on the contrary, to be increasing rapidly. Not only was the attendance large at this meeting, but the election of officers aroused keen interest in all the delegates. They chose officers who are well able to perform their several duties.</p>
   <p>Practically every Bohemian organization in Chicago was represented at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The zeal displayed by the delegates was really inspiring.</p>
   <p>Contributions to the institution amounted to $890.91, collected from large Bohemian business houses, brewries, and Bohemian organizations in Chicago.</p>

   <p>From the reports of the council we learn that new buildings are under construction, and that in several weeks they will be ready for dedication.</p>
   <p>We are making progress, and the Bohemian people of Chicago should recognize the importance of the enterprise. Work of this nature is not to be compared with anything else. It provides for destitute aged Bohemians and Bohemian orphans.</p>
