   <p>The meeting was opened at the appointed hour by the president, Mr. Vojtech Suchy. The secretary, Mr. J. Lehman, read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were approved as read. The Chicago Osteopathic Hospital informed the Board that in case any destitute woman needed obstetrical help, the staff of that hospital would be willing to give it upon recommendation made by the Board of the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The offer was accepted. Mrs. Marie Tlapa, of 1820 South Ashland Avenue, made a gift of six pillows in memory of her deceased husband. They were gratefully accepted. Mr. Novy, of 1935 South Clifton Park Avenue, sent five dollars as a gift made by an anonymous lady.</p>
   <p>Mr. Josef Mandl, of 1823 South Millard Avenue, was inducted as a new member of the Board of Delegates. He will represent the Klub Dobrovsky, a Masonic organization.....Mr. Mandl is no novice in our clubs, since for more than <span class="page-break">\2</span>twenty years he has taken part in the club life [of our community]. He pledged his support of the Utulna and was then introduced to the rest of the members of the Board.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. F. Petru, reported that the total receipts during the month of October were $1,358.49, and that the disbursements for the same period amounted to $2,733.71. Following the request made by a delegate, Mr. Kolar, that account be made for the money disbursed, a debate ensued in which Mr. Patak, the business manager of the Utulna, endeavored to throw light upon the situation....but the president, Mr. Suchy, cut the debate short by declaring that once disbursements are approved by the Board of Directors, nothing remains but to allow the bills to be paid. This was followed by the reading of minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors. The minutes were approved as read.</p>
   <p>The receipts for the concert given on November 1 amounted to $1,629.35 net, but since about one thousand tickets have not yet been returned nor otherwise <span class="page-break">\3</span>accounted for, there is hope that a few more dollars will come in, thus making the event of November 1 rather profitable.</p>
   <p>A delegate, Mrs. Hrisny, pointed out that since Mr. Rubringer's resignation as teacher of music, the wards of the Orphanage have had no instruction, and recommended that a substitute teacher be appointed. Mr. Josef Kratochvil has consented to take charge of all music instruction for the time being.</p>
   <p>The application for admission to the Utulna made by Mr. Frantisek Riha, as member of the Jungman Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) was approved by the investigating committee. Mr. Riha, who is seventy years old, now resides at 1653 Kimball Avenue. He will surrender the certificate of his lodge to the Utulna and, after all necessary formalities have been attended to, he will be admitted. Mr. Frank Grvessl of 3620 Southport Avenue, a native of Ronsperk near Pilsen, applied for admission to the Utulna; his case was recommended by the investigating committee but rejected by the Board of Delegates. [Translator's note: The translator of this <span class="page-break">\4</span>article is well acquainted with the part of the country from which the applicant Grvessl hails. The country around Pilsen is inhabited by Czechs and Germans, and it is quite likely that the applicant was rejected on account of his nationality.] The cases of the ten-year-old boy Tomas Border, and the three-year-old girl, Ottilie Prchal, were investigated. The committee recommended that Ottilie and her sister Milada, age five years, be admitted to the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>The Christmas season is approaching, and since the institution needs money, and since from its past experience such money has usually been supplied by charitable people, a motion was made by Mr. Petru that a committee be appointed which would mail cards to our benefactors, thus refreshing their memory. The motion was carried. There is no doubt that this year, too, as in the past, the contributions made to the Utulna will be satisfactory. The institution needs all the help it can get.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bohumil Stastny, who is a member of the Bratrska Laska (Brotherly Love) <span class="page-break">\5</span>Lodge No. 19 of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska a Podporujici Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Fraternal and Benevolent Union), made an application for admission through his union. His family is willing to waive all rights as beneficiaries in his insurance policy and is willing that the Utulna be named a beneficiary instead. The Board requested the investigating committee to look the case over and report at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>On motion made by Mr. Mandl, a committee was appointed to investigate the condition of our wards who attend the F. B. Zdrubek [Bohemian Free Thought] School. The following were appointed: Mr. Zrust, Mr. F. Stepanek, and Mrs. B. Lorenz. These members are to meet next Saturday and investigate the whole matter.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned.</p>
