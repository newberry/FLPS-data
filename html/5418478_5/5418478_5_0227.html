   <p>All aid societies in the United States have been requested to help in the drive for the third issue of the Liberty Loan. Their representatives held a meeting in the Sherman Hotel and showed that the appeal will result in vigorous response. Patriotic endeavor is a duty, and the aid societies, more than any other organization or individual, can promote the campaign to success. There are fifteen million members in the United States and over two hundred and fifty thousand in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Our Czech brotherhoods fulfilled their duty during the first and second campaigns by buying bonds generously, and this is the best proof of their patriotism. Brotherhoods should not invest deposits in other bonds that bear no more interest than Government war bonds and are less reliable.....</p>
   
   <p>In the official organ of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society), there are suggestions for improvements which will prove beneficial to all the brotherhoods. The grand lodge in the State of Maryland proposes one main office with a stationary seat in Chicago. There is not much to be gained by constantly Moving the headquarters. They should be located where most of the members live, as this facilitates the contact between lodges. The grand lodge also proposes the removal of state trustees.</p>
   <p>Women should not only fill the laces in business and industries left open by men enlisted in military service, but they should also fill the gaps in our societies. Our aid societies and brotherhoods are, and will be, hit hard by enlistments of their male members. These brotherhoods are of vital importance for our national life, because they not only provide economic security for members and their families, but they are buttresses for our nationalistic activities.</p>
   
   <p>While our organizations are unable to acquire new members among young men now, women should join at a higher rate. The Cesko-Americka Jednota (Czech-American Union) has provided a splendid example of what can be accomplished in this direction. In the course of the last three months, it has organized three new women's lodges.</p>
   <p>Graduate students in the Czech section of the American Red Cross under Dr. Anton Mueller have also organized into a sisterhood.....</p>
   <p>This is the way in which the shocks suffered by our organizations on account of the draft can be endured and survived.</p>
