   <p>The collection undertaken by Mr. Josef Herback in behalf of the unfortunate family of Mr. Hladik, who was killed in an accident, netted $19.05. Of this sum, three dollars was spent for flowers for the grave, and the balance ($16.05) was turned over to Mrs. Hladik. Many sincere thanks are due those who contributed. Anyone who wishes to make further contributions to the now destitute family of Mr. Hladik may do so by communicating with Josef Herback, 1651 South Throop Street, Chicago, Illinois.
