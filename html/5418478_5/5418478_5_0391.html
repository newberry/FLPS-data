   <p>The League of Benevolent Associations of North America will hold its annual convention in San Francisco in July of this year. The Cesko-Slovanska Liga Vypomocnych Spolku (Bohemian-Slavonic League of Benevolent Associations) is represented in the North American organization as a part of the benevolent associations in the state of Illinois. The Cesko-Slovanska Liga selected its president, Mr. Jan L. Novak, and Mr. J. L. Voborsky as delegates to the convention.....</p>
   <p>The annual conventions of the National League [sic] are of no small importance. Many experts in various fields deliver speeches on matters which are discussed later in the various State Leagues and also in the American and foreign press. Because the coming convention will be held in San Francisco during the time of its World's Fair, it offers us a splendid opportunity of acquainting the American public with the way the Bohemian-Slavonic element invests its savings, and the number of homes built wherever <span class="page-break">2</span>Bohemian families settle. The Bohemian delegate to this convention is ready to take upon himself the compilation of complete statistical data about all Bohemian-Slavonic benevolent associations and to present it at the convention for inclusion into the report on its proceedings. The preparation of such a statistical work requires a great deal of time and effort and cannot be undertaken without the co-operation of the secretaries of all Bohemian-Slavonic benevolent associations. We are therefore making the request that all such secretaries and other officers who are in a position to do so, please send us the following information: (1) Name of association and address of its office; (2) Name of president and of secretary; (3) amount of loans, mortgages, and assets; (4) earnings as of current period; (5) number of active shares and shareholders; (6) amount of contingent funds. All this data should present the actual, present state of affairs of each association and should therefore be reported as of the most recent meeting. The information should be sent to Mr. Jan L. Novak, 1817 Loomis Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>

   <p>We also request all Bohemian-Slavonic newspapers in America to publish this request together with the name and address of the man in each state who is able to give the necessary information to the delegate to the San Francisco convention.</p>
