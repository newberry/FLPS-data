   <p>Praha Lodge, No. 231, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, one of the best known organizations in our social life, held an informal entertainment after its meeting on January 3, 1912, in the Sokol Chicago Hall. A collection for the benefit of the Old People's Home and Orphanage was taken up among those present, and the sum of $28.50 was realized. The money was turned over to Mr. Anton Charvat, a member of the management committee of the Old People's Home. We take the privilege, at this time, to call the attention of all Czech benevolent and other societies to this fine example of the Praha Lodge.</p>
