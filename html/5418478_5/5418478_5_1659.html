   <p>The Krouzek Horlivcu (Circle of Enthusiasts), which is exclusively known to our people for its generous support of national and charitable causes, did not forget our charitable institutions during this holiday season. In its past meeting it appropriated $10 for the benefit of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage; $5 for the benefit of the Johaneum of Prague, Czechoslovakia; $5 for the benefit of the Bohemian Heart of Vienna, Austria; and $5 for the benefit of Mr. Fr. Luza, 1154 West 18th Street, Chicago.</p>
