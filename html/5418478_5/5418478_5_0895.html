   <p>A bazaar for the benefit of the Bohemian Orphanage was held in the hall of the Bohemian-American Free Thought School last Saturday and Sunday. It is peculiar that we have had to report an extremely small attendance at all the recent concerts and entertainments arranged by the Orphanage Association. The attendance on Saturday and on Sunday was not an exception, although the arrangements committee had done all in its power, and the press had pointed out time and again the noble aims of the cause. On Saturday, in particular, the hall was so distressingly empty that one could literally feel the chill from the frigidity of the vacant space and from the hearts of those who could have been present, but neglected to be.</p>
   <p>Where is the explanation for this to be found? Several years ago the organization had been looked upon askance, true enough, and the circle of its friends dwindled, but all this has changed. There are many loyal sympathizers, and every time a club or society has given an affair for the Orphanage, the results have been satisfactory. The Association itself, however, is unable <span class="page-break">2</span>to pride itself upon a single entertainment that yielded any amount of money worth mentioning.</p>
   <p>The bazaar offered many prizes, beautiful or useful. The drawing for the raffle, with a house lot as the prize, had to be postponed until another occasion. The property, located on 47th and Bishop Streets, was donated by Mr. F. Zajicek and is valued at at least seven hundred dollars. The tickets, at twenty-five cents each, have been on sale for the last two years, but not more than one half of the total two thousand were sold.</p>
