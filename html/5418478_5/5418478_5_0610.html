   <p>Vaclav Burian has joined as a member of the "Bohemian-Roman-Catholic Society" of the parish of Saint Prokop. This organization was founded, last April, as a supporting society, securing to its members sick benefit, and insurance in case of death. Burian was paying his dues and fulfilled his obligations as every good Bohemian-Roman should do. He caught a cold, which affected his lungs, in time, and made him feel worse. For a short time he received from the Catholics a benefit of $5.00 a week; when they found out that his ailment was of longer duration, it was decided that they did not need him any more.</p>
   <p>He was accused of quarreling with the wife of another member and being absent from the meeting, he was simply thrown out of the society. Now Vaclav Burian is asking in the Court a mandamus against the "Bohemian Roman Catholic Society", the reinstatement as member of the brotherhood, and the $5. weekly sick benefit continuously until he is cured.</p>
