   <p>The twelfth annual meeting of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) took place on Friday night in the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery on 26th Street and Albany Avenue. It was well attended by the members of the association and will leave in their hearts that source of light and happiness which is so necessary for the further continuance of work in behalf of the needy folk.</p>
   <p>The meeting began at 8:45 P. M. and was opened by the vice-president, Mr. John A. Sokol. The minutes of the last annual meeting were read by the secretary. Mr. Vaclav Vanek, and were approved. The annual report for the past year was also read. Because of its extensive nature, it will be published in one of the future issues of our newspaper; today, because of lack of space, we shall only make known the fact that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, during the twelve years of its existence, has collected the awe-inspiring sum of $71,489.01 for our needy people. This amount was very carefully disbursed. How much <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sorrow, grief, and misery were averted by this money, as well as by other gifts, is emphasized in the annual report, which pleased every member present at the meeting. The report, as well as the financial statement,....were unanimously approved.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the ladies' auxiliary of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, Mrs. Antonie Kybic, read the annual report of her organization, which also shows how efficiently the little hands of our ladies worked at their charitable tasks.....The chairman of the same organization, Mrs. Beranek, then arose to thank those who made sacrifices for the welfare of the unfortunate. It was also reported that the following contributions were received at the time of the annual meeting: From Mr. Otto Kerner, $50; from Mrs. L. Cervenka, $10; from Mr. August Geringer, $5.</p>
   <p>The secretary called the attention of the members to certain criticisms of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost voiced by the members of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) in their last meeting. It appears that some of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the members of the latter institution expressed their doubts as to the good work which the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is doing; that it purportedly has sectarian feelings; and that prompted by such feelings, it favors only certain organizations. Mr. Vanek indicated that such an untoward expression of suspicion on the part of the members of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov is highly censurable, and added that most of the sectarian organizations take care of their own poor people. At the behest of the president, Mr. Frank J. Petru discussed this situation and made a motion for a committee to be appointed which would attend the next meeting of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov for the purpose of clearing up whatever misunderstanding there may be among the members of that body and resuming friendly relations. Mr. Janovsky opposed this motion and suggested that this whole painful incident be called to the attention of the board of directors, which may act on it in whatever way it finds best.After a brief debate, the second motion was considered favorably and action will be taken as Mr. Janovsky suggested.</p>
   <p>Another motion, which was carried, was [previously] suggested by the board <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of directors; it concerns the collection of membership contributions, which henceforth is to be taken on or about June 1. The nominating committee, consisting of Messrs. Frank Hajicek, Bolek, and Anton J. Cermak, recommended the re-election of all the members of the board of directors whose terms have expired. With the exception of Dr. F. E. Dostal; who does not wish to be re-elected, all the members of the board of directors will retain their old offices. In lieu of Dr. Dostal, Mr. Tomas Chval, a 22nd Street merchant, was nominated and elected. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, a member of the City Council, discussed ways and means of improving the systems of charitable work in which the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is engaged.</p>
   <p>Since the program was exhausted, the president ended the meeting by announcing that refreshments would be served to all those present, and that this would be followed by a short musical program.....</p>
