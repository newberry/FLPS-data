   <p>Mention has been made several times lately in our columns of the suit against the North American Union, an aid society, filed by some of its members who oppose a proposed merger with another society. Mergers are not infrequent with brotherhoods of this kind, and may prove beneficial to one or the other. This does not, however, apply to our Czech aid societies. A few details of the suit will enlighten the reader on the subject.</p>
   <p>It became known that one intermediator in the merger was to receive $100,000 for his services; and that the director, or manager, of the North American Union drew $10,000 per year. This Union has only thirty thousand members, just a few thousand less than our own largest aid society, the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czech-Slavonic Aid Society), or our Jednota Ceskych Dam <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>(Czech Ladies' Union).</p>
   <p>Beside the director, the chairman and some other officers drew $1,000 annually. It is obvious that with such management a merger became a necessity. Think of our societies paying $10,000 yearly to one official, when in reality they are guarding themselves anxiously against unnecessary expenses! There is no such thing as a deficit, so common with organizations of other language groups, among us.....Czech organizations should rely upon themselves.</p>
