   <p>A ladies' auxiliary supports the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphan Asylum by paying twenty-five cents per month. These contributions are used to purchase necessities and articles of comfort for the inmates. The ladies meet once a month. Mrs. Dusek, good-hearted matron of both institutions, speaks highly of the beneficence of the ladies, who also arrange for entertainments for the wards. Such an entertainment is today's picnic, to be held in the garden of the Orphan Asylum, 5066 North Crawford Avenue. Each lady is to bring a basket filled with food, and even delicacies. Visitors are welcome. They are asked to pay fifteen cents admission if adults, or ten cents if children. The picnic begins at 9 A.M.</p>
