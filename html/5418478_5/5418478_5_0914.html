   <p>My dear countrymen!</p>
   <p>The day of November 1, 1922 is near at hand and my wards are looking forward to your visit. They desire to show you that the sacrifices which you made in their behalf were not in vain.</p>
   <p>Since there is quite a distance between our institution and the place where our concert is to be given, I wish that everyone who owns a car, and can spare the time, will be good enough to come here at 7 P. M., sharp, to transport our orphans to Pilsen Park and make arrangements to bring them back after the concert. There will be twenty-five of us and the musical instruments. It will facilitate matters if you will let me know, before Monday night, whether or not you are able to do us this favor.</p>
   <p>Thanking you in advance I remain,</p>
