   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) has begun extensive preparations for its annual charity ball which is to take place on November 22, 1922. It is expected that the venture will meet with great success, and that it will thus provide aid to such causes which the Spolecnost so loyally served in the past. This week tickets have been mailed to the various organizations and individuals, and the committee hopes that for the sake of the good cause they are serving, ticket sales will be great and immediate.</p>
