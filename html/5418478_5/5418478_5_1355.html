   <p>It has been a long time since the Pilsen Park pavilion saw such a select group of ladies as came yesterday afternoon to hold a strawberry festival for the benefit of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association). The festival was arranged by the Damsky Odbor of the Spolecnost (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Association). The exalted and beautiful aim of this festival attracted so many of the foremost women workers of all our Bohemian societies that the spacious hall of the pavilion was filled to capacity. The large attendance at the festival was, first of all, a great satisfaction to the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Spolecnost, proving to them that people understand the meaning and work of the Association. It also furnished an added stimulus to further work which will be greatly needed this year.</p>
   <p>The splendid program, arranged by the chairwoman of the Ladies' Auxiliary, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, began shortly after 2 P. M. with an address delivered by the chairwoman. Mrs. Cervenka mentioned the unpleasant fact that, due to some misunderstanding, the hall of the pavilion was engaged on the same day by two organizations, and that, therefore, it would be necessary to hasten all proceedings and speed up the program so that the hall might be emptied before the time of the meeting of the other organization.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was rendered by our soprano, Mrs. Marie Matejcek-Ort, who sang with unusual feeling the aria, "Ach Jaky Zal" (Oh, What a Sorrow) from Bedrich Smetana's opera, "Prodana Nevesta" (Bartered Bride)....She was accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Porak-Kalina. The next item on the program was a group of dance numbers and prologues performed by the pupils of the Kvidera ballet school who acquitted themselves very well....Mrs. Helena Petru then sang Mendelssohn's "The Violet" and the well-known Czech folk song, "Pockej, Ja Povim" (Wait, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>I'll Tell on You). For an encore she sang another folk song, the popular piece "Kdyby Moje Mila" (If, My Dear One). Mrs. Petru's songs were followed by Mr. Solar's xylophone solo which afforded much esthetic pleasure to the audience. He played....Weiss' well-liked "Pochod Cechoslovaku" (March of the Czechoslovaks). The performance was proof of the excellence of the instrument which was loaned for this occasion by the well-known firm, Solar Music House....Miss Jane Cervenka then played several piano pieces, "Baccio" (Kiss) by Arditi, and Anton Dvorak's "Prstynek" (Ringlet) being among the best-liked ones. It will be a long time before we shall again hear such a fine rendition of these two musical creations. Miles' "Sparklets" was chosen by Miss. Cervenka as an encore. Her unusual artistic ability is much to be commended. It would be superfluous to try to praise the violin solos of Professor Jiri Hrusa who played Fritz Kreisler's "Caprice Viennois" and Anton Dvorak's "Humoresque". Mr. Hrusa is very well known among our people, and his violin technique is able to charm anybody.</p>

   <p>The young girls of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, accompanied on the piano by Professor Jiri Hrusa, then gave a musical and dance number, "Hra Na Slepou Babu" (Blind Man's Buff). In this they were directed by the Sokol instructor, Mr. Matuska. The one-act play, "Zarlivec" (The Jealous Man), was then performed by the actors of the Homan Theater under the direction of Mr. Frantisek Lhotsky....Since the usual address by the chairwoman Mrs. Cervenka was already delivered beforehand, the guests were now regaled with tasty strawberry shortcake and very good coffee. The refreshments were enthusiastically greeted by all....</p>
   <p>This report would be incomplete were we to omit the names of the ladies who assumed the responsibilities of making the festival a success. It was first of all the well-known society worker, Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, who, as chairwoman of the entertainment committee, shouldered the greatest part of these responsibilities, and contributed much to the success of the event by her indefatigable work. To the other members of this committee <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>we likewise owe much praise. They were: Mesdames Hajicek, Krupka, Zeman, Valha, Spatny, Kybic, and Ourada. The entertainment committee was well pleased with the outcome of the festival, the financial profit of which left little to be desired. We congratulate [the members on their success].</p>
