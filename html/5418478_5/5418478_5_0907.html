   <p>The agitation for the establishment of an orphanage is beginning to liven up and we hope that it will be carried on to such an extent as to bear plentiful fruit. It is proper for all liberal minded Bohemians to whom it is really important, that their party work with all its might for the benefit of its members and of the Bohemian people at their society meetings, in public debates; in fact, at every opportunity to call attention to this very necessary humanitarian undertaking and encourage its support. The more the question is discussed, the more good ideas come to light, the greater will be the interest and the sooner will it be realized. We are decidedly for the completion of the "Home", but we think that both of these philanthropic undertakings could easily be combined and in such a way that every sensible conscientious Bohemian would be pleased. Only let us try and think about it!</p>
