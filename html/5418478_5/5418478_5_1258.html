   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council in America) issues a call to our Oak Park countrymen to secure a sufficiently large amount of money for the legionnaires' fund. This fund will be used to support the suffering [Czechoslovak] legionnaires who are in need and all the widows and orphans of the fallen [Czechoslovak legionnaires]. The [central] committee for the collection of funds in Chicago and vicinity is organizing independent committees in all parts of the city of Chicago and vicinity, each such committee to be responsible for the collections made [and to be made] in its district. The meeting of the Oak Park volunteers shall accordingly be called on Monday, November 20, 1922, at 7:15 P. M., in the Sokol Oak Park. We ask the duly elected officers of our Czech organizations in Oak Park to organize their own committee which would be made responsible for all collections made for the above-mentioned fund.</p>
   <p>We invite all our countrymen of Oak Park who would be willing to co-operate with us. The purpose of this fund will be explained by Mr. Josef Placek, a member of the Narodni Rada, who will address the meeting on Monday evening.</p>
   <p>For the committee:</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Hustko, president;</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Kouba, secretary.</p>
