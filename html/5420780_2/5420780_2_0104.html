   <p>Under the title of Minister of Social Affairs, we have in the Danish cabinet, a man by the name of K. K. Steincke, who has been the very soul of social legislation in Denmark. He is the man that coordinated the whole field of private and public relief in Denmark; he had for years been head of all relief in Copenhagen, so he knew what he was talking about.</p>
   <p>When you speak about social security for a whole nation, people at once ask: Where does the money come from? I will try to answer this question before going into other details.</p>
   <p>First of all we can dismiss the question of accident insurance, which covers 900,000 people employed in all walks of life. This insurance is taken out in the regular insurance company, and the premiums are paid by the employer and the employed. In case of accident the compensation is paid by the company in which you are insured. This insurance is compulsory.</p>

   <p>The question of expenses to the public, is in regard to sickness, invalidity, old age pension and unemployment. The latest figures that I have been able to get hold of, show that during 1930-31 Denmark spent two hundred and twenty-six million crowns on social security.</p>
   <p>Nearly two million Danes, out of a population of three and one-half million, belong to one of the 1,650 sick benefit societies. The total sick benefit payments was fourty-seven and one-half million crowns, of which thirty-two million was membership fees, eleven million, paid by the State and the rest from various sources.</p>
   <p>Invalid pension covers twenty-five to thirty thousand, whose invalidity is due not to any accident, but to some disease that has made them wholly or partly unable to support themselves and their families. The sick benefit clubs have made no provisions for them, as they would be too great a drain upon the treasury. Fifteen million crowns, was the cost for that purpose, of which 6.1 million was paid by membership fee, 3.6 million by their former employer and <span class="page-break">\3</span>5.3 million crowns by the State.</p>
   <p>Old age pension was paid to nearly one hundred thousand at a cost of sixty million crowns, the State paid thirty-five million, and the cities and the counties paid twenty-five million crowns.</p>
   <p>About three hundred thousand workers are insured against unemployment. They are divided between seventy approved unemployment societies, and a number of societies not approved. Between fifty to one hundred thousand received unemployment benefit at a cost of one hundred million crowns of which thirty-two millions were paid by the members themselves, thirty-nine million by the State and twenty-nine million by towns and counties, and finally four million by the employer.</p>
   <p>The net result is, that of the two hundred twenty-six million paid in social security, seventy million, was paid by those that got the benefit, one hundred and forty-five million, by the State and the local communities and eight million, by the employer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This whole system has of course raised the taxes for everybody; you pay between ten to fifteen percent in income tax; but you feel that you get real value for your money when you are sick, when an accident happens and when you get old. It is, therefore, no wonder that no party in Denmark has been able to outvote the Social-Democrats, who at every election get a greater and greater number of votes.</p>
   <p>If President Roosevelt carries through his program for social security, there is no doubt, that he will be re-elected with a great majority, and that the common man will stand by him until this idea of social security has been tried in United State also.</p>
   <p>One thing is sure, that it is far more efficient than the system now at work among America's millions of unemployed.</p>
