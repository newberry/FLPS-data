   <p>On Armistice Day Ex-governor Frank O. Lowden unveiled a war memorial in the Armory on Michigan Blvd., commemorating four hundred forty-three soldiers of the 131st Infantry Regiment, who died in the World War.</p>
   <p>The memorial is made from ore, with heavy pillars and a top piece displaying the American Eagle and the Illinois Coat of Arms.</p>
   <p>The memorial was designed by N. Malmstrom and sculptured by Victor J. Jespersen, 2443 W. North Ave. The American papers carried pictures of the memorial, Nov. 4th and Nov. 11th, and in the photogravure sections of their Sunday issues. As it is only a year since Mr. Jespersen went into business for himself he is to be congratulated on his success.</p>
