   <p>The Society for the Danish Old People's Home had its semiannual meeting in Dania April 10. The majority proposal is for the election of a board of twenty-seven, consisting of fifteen ladies and twelve gentlemen; this board is to have full and final authority.</p>
   <p>The proposal of the minority is for the usual election of the board and its officers, and that the board of directors consist of fifteen members, nine ladies and six gentlemen; and that the whole society, rather than the board, be the final authority.</p>
   <p>Another subject for discussion is whether the Home is to have any free rooms or not, and how many.</p>
