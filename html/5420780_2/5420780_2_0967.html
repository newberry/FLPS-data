   <p>The Hans Christian Andersen Jubilee gathered about six or seven thousand people around his statue in Lincoln Park Sunday, April 2. Governor Deneen, Mayor Harrison, Dr. Hirsch, and Mr. Tracy, president of the Park Commission, had all been invited, but failed to appear. Henry L. Hertz, who was to have been the director of the celebration, was sick in bed with a severe cold.</p>
   <p>Charles Ryberg gave the welcoming address. The main speaker was Reverend R. A. White of the School Commission. He spoke about the high development of Danish culture and about Hans Christian Andersen, whose name has become a household word in the entire English-speaking world. Miss Marie Shedlock brought a greeting from Queen Alexandria of England and read one of Andersen's "Fairy Tales".</p>
   <p>Caroline Rosenfeld, a little Jewish girl from the Hans Christian Andersen <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>School, placed a laurel wreath on one of the feet of the poet (she could not reach any higher). Finally there was a short speech by Francis McKay, the principal of the Hans Christian Andersen School.</p>
