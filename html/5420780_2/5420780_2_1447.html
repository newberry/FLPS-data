   <p>Lodge No. 18 of the Danish Brotherhood observed the 30th anniversary of its founding with an animated celebration last Sunday in Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>The celebrants numbered about 250, including members, delegations from other Chicago lodges, and a few specially invited guests.</p>
   <p>The table was set in the big dining room, and during the festive meal the customary speeches were delivered, including a review of the history of the lodge.</p>
   <p>Then followed the lighter part of the program, which consisted of cabaret entertainment in the appropriately decorated basement, and dancing in the ball room.</p>
   <p>The arrangement committee deserves credit for its excellent work.</p>
