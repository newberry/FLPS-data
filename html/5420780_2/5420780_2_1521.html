   <p>The Danish Brotherhood, the largest Danish organization in the world, an organization which for years has been establishing its branches from coast to coast, is today stronger than ever. Nearly three hundred lodges, distributed over twenty-six of the northern states, now belong to the organization, which is steadily penetrating into new Danish settlements, extending to the Danish population the advantages of mutual support in case of illness and death. There are many cases where suffering would have been the lot of survivors in families bereft of the provider except for the support extended the family by the Danish Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>This organization, the twenty-fifth anniversary of which was celebrated on January 2, 1907, has twenty-seven lodges in Chicago. The oldest of these, Chicago Lodge No. 17, today is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary with a banquet and dance at the hall of the Lodge, 315-317 Hirsch Street.</p>
   <p>History of Lodge No. 17</p>
   <p>After the Danish Brotherhood had made several vain attempts at organizing a lodge in Chicago, Mr. C. F. Hansen, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, undertook the task of making a new effort. The systematic endeavors he initiated met, however, with stern opposition from many sides. Nonetheless, he did not lose courage, and on March 28, 1884, the first Chicago lodge of the Brotherhood held its installation at a meeting in Dania Hall, under the name "Chicago Lodge No. 17". Twenty-three members were inducted at this meeting, and at the following meeting three new members were accepted, so that the Lodge started with twenty-six charter members.</p>
   <p>The new Lodge made steady though somewhat slow progress for a while, but when assessments became necessary, and sick benefits were provided, several members left. In addition, several of the original members subsequently withdrew to join the new Lodge No. 18, which had been organized about a month afterwards. Still others, anxious to have a more convenient meeting place, organized Lodge No. 58.</p>
   <p>Thus, for a while, Lodge No. 17 had somewhat tough sledding. Quite frequently, it happened that the amounts to be paid as sick aid exceeded the amount in the treasury, and it was not an unusual occurrence for the treasurer to have to advance money from his own funds in order to meet required expenses. In the meantime, the members remaining in the Lodge stuck together; through great sacrifices they aided one another as the need arose, and time has shown that the faith of these men in the future of the Lodge was not misplaced.</p>
   <p>Several charter members of Lodge No. 17 have died, and some have moved away from the city, so that today there are merely three of the "Old Guard" remaining.</p>
   
   <p>On November 14, 1889, a group of women presented the Lodge with a beautiful silk banner, and in 1893 the Lodge secured, through freewill contributions, two fine flags, which were dedicated at a social of the Lodge on May 25, 1893. In 1903, the ladies once more showed their interest in the Lodge by presenting it with two large flags of silk (the older ones were of wool), which were dedicated by the Supreme Vice-president of the Brotherhood on May 1, 1903.</p>
   <p>On many occasions at the conventions of the Danish Brotherhood, Lodge No. 17 has exerted considerable influence through its delegates for the furtherance of objectives of benefit to the organization. Mr. Edward Holm, the first president of the Lodge, was for several years the Supreme Auditor, and at the convention in Racine, Wisconsin in 1902 the delegate of the Lodge, Mr. Vald Kikkebusch, was elected Supreme Vice-president of the Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Lodge No. 17 is also well represented in the central committee chosen by the Chicago lodges. The president of this committee is a member of Lodge No. 17, and one of the Lodge's most popular members is secretary of the united committee of the lodges, in charge of arrangements for the national festival in Riverview Park to be held on June 6. Lodge No. 17 has invariably occupied a prominent place among all the Danish societies, whenever the more important Danish undertakings were to be launched. It is unnecessary to go into details regarding this point.</p>
   <p>At various times, Danish societies have made efforts to secure their own halls. Lodge No. 17 was the first that succeeded in such an effort. On January 4, 1907, a committee was appointed to investigate the possibilities of a building for the Lodge. The committee....agreed to recommend the purchase of the building at 315-317 Hirsch Street. The price of the property was $3,500. The Lodge subsequently authorized the committee to negotiate the purchase, and the price was paid during the same year. ....During the summer the necessary alterations on the property were made, and on Sunday, October 27, 1907, the Lodge met in the new building for the first time, and the property was dedicated as the future home of the Lodge. The property cost the Lodge $8,000, including fixtures, etc., and it contains a large lodge hall with a number of smaller rooms for use by committees.</p>
   <p>The building is paying for itself through the renting of halls and rooms for various meetings, and will undoubtedly prove a good investment. The amount needed for the purchase was provided in part by the Lodge itself, and in part through the buying of shares by the members of the Lodge.</p>
   <p>Throughout its existence the Lodge has had many energetic members who have, in many ways, contributed to the growth of the organization.</p>
