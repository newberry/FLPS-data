   <p>The Germans are just now working overtime in complaining about German soldiers being killed by American bullets. But isn't the business of War killing, if anything - and isn't the United States also willing to sell the Germans as many bullets as they can use? If these can not be delivered, the fault does not lie on this side of the Atlantic. Why did the Germans start the war, if they were not properly prepared for it, on water as well as on land? And if they have discovered now that the odds are against them, why do they not (instead of playing the baby act) sue for peace?</p>
   <p>For the United States to stop exporting ammunition would not only be neutrality in favor of one of the belligerents, but would also tend to prolong the war and delay its final and inevitable outcome, the through defeat of the war-mad Germans. The sooner this is accomplished, the better for them and the rest of the world. The defeat of Germany is the main and only issue.</p>
