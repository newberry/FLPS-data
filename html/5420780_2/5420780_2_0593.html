   <p>The Merchants' Record and Show Window presents a reproduction of Axel Krohns' latest picture. It represents a tropical beach with tall slender palms, the fronds clicking in the breeze, the sighing of the wind, the waves roaring on the sands, and now and then the call of a bird heard closeby, then from afar, creating a symphony that could not have been written by man. Yes, the picture is so well done that it takes very little imagination to believe that you can both hear and see it.</p>
   <p>We will quote a few words that have been said: "We call the attention of our readers to the artistic cover on this issue of the Merchants' Record and Show Window. Full credit is due Axel Krohn, art director in the service department of L. Bauman and Co, Chicago.</p>

   <p>"Mr. Krohn is well-known in the art colony of the 'Windy City.' High-class artistic talent is clearly shown by his work on this cover, and on others that will follow during the next few months, we really believe that our subscribers have an artistic treat awaiting them."</p>
   <p>Krohn has done some of the largest decorating projects in the country.</p>
   <p>Sometime ago, Krohn did some portraits that gave us an excellent example of the third dimension.</p>
