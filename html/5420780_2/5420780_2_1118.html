   <p>The Norwegian-Danish paper, Norden, of Chicago was discontinued the last week and was joined with the Norwegian paper, America, which latter took over the subscribers of the former. The new is called American-Norden.</p>
   <p>The Norden could have celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1898. The Norwegian banker, Stensland, took over the paper many years ago and made Sartz Editor. The Editor was a REpublican and very conservative. In 1894 or '95 Mr. Stensland gave the paper to Sartz and Oppedal. Mr. Oppedal soon got Sartz out. Mr. Oppedal was impossible as an editor and how the paper is dead and buried.</p>
