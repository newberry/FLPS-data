   <p>The Scandinavian-American Medical Society of Chicago observed the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding last August, and has now, in memory of that occasion, published a brief outline of the history of the Society, under the title Silver Jubilee Souvenir.</p>
   <p>The book is written by the popular Dr. B. Meyer, a charter member of the Society. Dr. S. Jacobsen, Dane, was the first president of the Society. Later he went to Denmark where he died in 1895.</p>
   <p>The author honors the memory of the famous Danish surgeon Dr. Christian Fenger who in 1900, two years before his death, became an honorary member of the Society.</p>
   <p>Among the other Danish doctors, who have been active in the Society, is Dr. Svenning Dahl, who in 1909 held the office of president.</p>
