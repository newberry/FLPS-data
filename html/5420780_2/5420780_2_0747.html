   <p>The Danish Workers' Singing Society celebrated the 18th anniversary of its founding last Saturday with a spirited celebration in its castle on the corner of Albany and Armitage Avenues, which was festively decorated with flags and flowers and banners in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
   <p>Delegations from the two other large singing societies Harmonien and Magneten were present with greetings and best wishes to their colleagues.</p>
   <p>At the table, the traditional speeches for America, Denmark, and the ladies were delivered and many others besides.</p>
   <p>The best talent of the three societies entertained generously with songs and recitations, and a genuine singer spirit and comradeship prevailed from beginning to end.</p>
