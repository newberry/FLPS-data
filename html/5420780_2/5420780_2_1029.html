   <p>During the past two year so much has been written about the Den-American Archives, its history, its object, etc. that I shall confirm myself to what has been accomplished since January 1931.</p>
   <p>The result of the first two years' activities has been highly satisfactory: we had never dared hope for the great interest which has been shown by institutions and individuals.</p>
   <p>The private collection donated by Dr. Max Henius, the wealth of rare manuscripts, pictures, letters, books, etc. Sent by the librarian of the John Crere library in Chicago, J. Chr. Bay, and the collection of manuscript notes and printed volumes which was bought from the estate of professor P. S. Vig. form an integral part of our collections.</p>
   <p>At the end of 1932 we had accumulated about 5,500 volumes and pamphlets and more than 200 library boxes filled with manuscripts, collections of letters, newspaper clippings, pictures, etc. Rarely a week goes by without some material coming in. All the archives material has been registered and arranged in library boxes and a major part of the books have been calalogued.</p>

   <p>The building has been thoroughly repaired from spire to basement, a modern heating plant has been installed and a number of bookshelves added to accomodate the ever increasing flow of material.</p>
   <p>On the 3rd of July, 1932, the Archives and Library were officially opened to the public. The Danish Prime Minister, Th. Stauning, the American Minister to Denmark, F. W. B. Coleman, J. Chr. Bay, Librarian, Chicago, Roger Nielsen, Editor, Copenhagen, the Mayor of Aalborg, M. Jorgensen and Dr. Max Henius, Chicago, delivered addresses, and many promineny men and women from both sides of the Atlantic attended the opening. Most of the leading Danish and American newspapers sent representatives.</p>
   <p>In 1931 the Archives were visited by 538 persons, in 1932 by 899.</p>
   <p>The annual meeting of the Dan-American Archives Society was held in Copenhagen in February this year. The officers were all reelected and the Board of Directors for the coming year will be as follows: Dr. Henry Goddard Leach, New York, chairman, Roger Nielsen, Copenhagen, vice-cahirman, Rev. M. F. Blichfeld, Copehagen. Treasurer, S. N. Nielsen, Chicago, Secretary, J. Chr. Bay, Chicago.</p>

   <p>Any books, letters, pictures, manuscripts etc. pertaining to Danish emigration and emigrants, American history, economy and industry, will be received with gratitude.</p>
