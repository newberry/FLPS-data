   <p>Last Sunday April 14, marked the twenty-fifth year since a well-known couple, instrument maker P. C. Paulsen and his wife, arrived in America with their two little boys Marinus and Carl. It had been Mr. Paulsen's dream to become a great musician; but he was poor, and violins were expensive, so he tackled the problem in a practical manner by making a violin himself. This experiment started him on the road to success as an instrument maker. He has made about 2,000 violins. Mr. Paulsen is always working, and is away from his shop only while eating his meals.</p>
   <p>His dream of becoming a musician was finally realized through his three sons of which the youngest, Valdemar Paulsen, was born in this country. The parents spared no efforts to educate and train the oldest son who is now a recognized violinist, teacher and noted composer. Although the two younger sons did not choose to become professional musicians, the Paulsen home on Champlain Avenue, resounds with classical music produced by the domestic quartet consisting of the three Paulsen boys and Mrs. Marinus Paulsen.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Paulsen are well liked by everybody, and the little group who helped them celebrate their jubilee last Sunday will long remember the hospitality they enjoyed in that ever hospitable home.</p>
