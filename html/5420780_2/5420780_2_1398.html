   <p>The board of directors for the Hans Christian Andersen monument has decided to take a vote among all ministers, editors, businessmen, etc., to decide whether the statue shall be placed in Humboldt or in Lincoln Park. The money for the statue has been collected among Danes all over the United States, and the board felt that the result of the placement committee, with three votes against two, was not enough to make a final decision.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: According to Revyen, March 14, 1896, the result of the above voting was 24 for Humboldt and 44 for Lincoln Park.]</p>
