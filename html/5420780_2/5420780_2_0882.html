   <p>The company which last fall presented Gustav Esmann's "Father and Son" at the Garrick Theatre, will give a benefit performance some time during October at the same place.</p>
   <p>The play to be presented has not yet been definitely decided upon but it will probably be Gustav Wied's "Unbending Wills," and the proceeds will be equally divided between the fund for Denmark's building at the 1915 San Francisco Word's Fair and the Danish Old People's Home in Chicago.</p>
