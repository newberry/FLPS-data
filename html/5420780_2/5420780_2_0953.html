   <p>Fifteen hundred persons had bought tickets [for this evening's performance of the Music Festival]. Many Danes were present but the chorus was Swedish. The united Swedish chorus, directed by John Ortengren and Emil Bjorn, was vociferously applauded. Among the soloists was Mrs. Grace Nelson, formerly Mrs. T. Stensland. The finest soloist of the evening was the Danish violinist, Henry Bramsen.</p>
   <p>We hope that the last evening saved the whole affair and that this experiment will be repeated a year or two from today but a festival of this kind must be prepared far ahead if it is to be a real success.</p>
