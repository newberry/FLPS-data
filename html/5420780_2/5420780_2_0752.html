   <p>The veteran singer and champion of Danish male choir singing in America, Professor Theodore Elberg, died last Sunday in the Danish Old People's Home in Norwood Park.</p>
   <p>After having finished his education at the University of Copenhagen, Elberg came to America in the eighties, and soon became a leader in singing circles. He directed and instructed a number of singing societies, Danish, Norwegian, and German, and wherever he was in charge, the master's touch was felt. It is chiefly due to him that the singing society Harmonien is what it is today.</p>
