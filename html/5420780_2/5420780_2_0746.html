   <p>The old Danish singing society Hejmdal, on the South side, which has been dormant for a number of years, was revived and reorganized last week with K. R. Knudsen as president, and an initial membership of twenty-two active singers. A committee was appointed to engage a director and plan the society's activities.</p>
