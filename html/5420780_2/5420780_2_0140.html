   <p>A detailed report indicating a frame-up and prejudice in the Scottsboro case has been made by the American Civil Liberties Union, which instigated an investigation by Miss Hollace Ransdall formerly on the staff of the Baltimore Sun and the Economics Library of Columbia University. Miss Ransdall spent considerable time in Alabama interviewing the girls involved in the case, Judge Hawkins, and other officials and citizens in Scottsboro.</p>
   <p>The report is a merciless indictment of justice as meted out to Negroes by the white ruling class in the South, condemning the Scottsboro case as a farce. The report states: "They all wanted the Negroes put to death as quickly as possible in a way that would bring disrepute upon the town. They therefore preferred a sentence of death by a judge to a sentence by the mob, but they desired the same result, and were impatient with anything that slowed up the conviction and death sentence which they all <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>knew was coming regardless of any testimony."</p>
   <p>The report in its detailed analysis of the facts involved in the case, and the economic status of the hegro in the South, continues; as one Southerner in Scottsboro put it, "We white people just couldn't afford to let these 'niggers' go free because of the effect it would have on other 'niggers.'"</p>
   <p>The report concludes: "The trial, such as it was, is over. Interest and passion in the case have cooled. Examining the present status of the accusers and the accused, to see what horrible things have been brought about by this crime, heralded in the Alabama papers as the most heinous ever committed in the state, or the whole country, as a matter of fact, this is what one finds:</p>
   <p>"The convicted criminals, nine terrified, bewildered young negroes, lie miserably in their cells in Kilby prison, while the two girls against whom this most heinous crime was allegedly committed, enjoy excellent <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>health and are delighting in the publicity brought to them. They both told me with great satisfaction that their pictures had been taken and put in the papers, that writers have been after their stories, that they had received money from various sources because of the case.</p>
   <p>"With this contrasting picture in mind, can any person not poisoned with race prejudice still maintain that the Scottsboro trial was fair and just and that nine negro boys deserved execution?</p>
   <p>Backing the defense of the nine boys, a world-wide mass movement is developing on a large scale. Governor Milles of Alabama is reported by the Associated Press to have received 1,678 protests. Most of the messages declare the executions would be wholesale slaughter. Among those sending protests were Albert Einstein and Theodore Dreiser.</p>
   <p>An appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court has automatically suspended the death sentences and the respite probably will last more than three months, since <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Supreme Court will not convene until late in August and the case is not likely to come under consideration by that body for some time.</p>
   <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 69 Fifth Ave., New York City, is handling the defense, together with the International Labor Defense.</p>
