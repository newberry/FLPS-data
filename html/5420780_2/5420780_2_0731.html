   <p>At the One Hundredth N. W. Gades Memorial Concert in Consistory Hall, February 25, the prologue was given by Carl Antonsen and written by Ivar Kirkegaard. It was a very festive and solemn moment when the delightful tunes by organist Geo. Dupont-Hansen thundered out under the lofty and beautiful arches in Consistory Hall to an audience of 1200 people, who had arrived on time. There seemed to be a devout feeling when Ivar Kirkegaard's poetic and musically inspired prologue was recited by Carl Antonsen with a skill and warmth that only he can master. The soft accompaniment of the organ was played by Geo. Dupont-Hansen with themes from Gades' music.</p>
   <p>"Overture to Ossian," a characteristic expression of Gades' art, even though <span class="page-break">2</span>strongly influenced by Mendelssohn and Schuman, has its own profound and noble character, under the direction of Ole Nielsen, found in its proper expression. But this honor he divided with his orchestra.</p>
   <p>Even though he is just recuperating from an operation, and probably has not regained his old force, Holger Pedersen sang Spillemanden's "Vise" (the Musician's Song), beautifully and touching in his soft, genuine Danish tenor. At first, we noticed nervousness, and a few frozen notes in the chorus, but it was not many seconds before a melodious and harmonious chorus sang the well-known tunes right from the heart. The Nordic national spirit was well expressed, and in some places exceptionally so. It gave promise to the concert's star number, "Elverskud," and the promise was well kept, as far as the chorus was concerned. There was a buoyancy, impetus, and force in the songs as they were started with precision and stopped with an exactness that brought out the strong dramatic effect of "Elverskud." It was to Emil Biorn's credit that he had brought so many batons and voices under his own baton, and created one grand chorus out of a multitude of <span class="page-break">3</span>male and female voices. It was a pleasant surprise to hear this splendid chorus, at the same time it was a surprise of another kind that the soloists did not stand on a par with the chorus. The well developed voice of Mrs. Frandsen was by far the best, but cracked in the high notes. The other soloists were very bad, as they did not know their task, to say it mildly. In defense, we know that they had undertaken their work with very short notice, because the previously engaged artist had declined at the last moment.</p>
   <p>Even though the concert was not what it should have been, it was in many ways an interesting presentation of Danish music and songs that brought a tribute to the memory of Niels Wilhelm Gades which would have made the master very happy if he had lived to hear it.</p>
