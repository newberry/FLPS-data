   <p>page 7 column 7....Soren Sorensen came from Denmark to Chicago less than thirty years ago. He was a dairyman before he left Denmark. He now serves 7,000 people and 250 stores daily in Chicago. When he started there were 2,800 other milk dealers in this town. But the milk venders of Chicago have dwindled from 2,800 in 1908 to 160 today. The business is now highly specialized, and the great improvements which have taken place during the recent years to a great extent should be credited to the Danes. Soren Sorensen has been a big factor in developing good service to the common people.</p>
