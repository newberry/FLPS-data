   <p>The Society for the Danish Old People's Home had a special meeting in Lagoni Hall Friday, November 29. One group wanted the society to build at once within the means now at the disposal of the society--that is a home for twenty old people, with ten places free. Another group agreed as to the erection of an old people's home, but they did not want any free places.</p>
   <p>The result of the meeting was a compromise: a home with room for sixteen old persons, with four free places. The home was not to cost over $12,000. The entrance fee was to be $300. Many absent members voted by proxy. The proposal was going to be voted on for final action when some one, who knew the laws of the Society, informed the audience that such action could only be taken by a general meeting called in due time with proper notice to all members. Many were disappointed. The secretary, Mr. Charles Wilde, had already resigned.</p>
