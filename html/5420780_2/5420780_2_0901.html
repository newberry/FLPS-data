   <p>p.2.........As mentioned in an earlier issue of this paper Johnanes V. Jensen's new play will be shown for the first time at Scandia Hall on Sunday, February 1st. Its title is "Defiance," indicating the hard and quarrelsome natures depicted in the play. It is one of the first attempts at realistic dramatic presentation, of life among the Danish farmers, and the play might thus serve to introduce a new era in this field.</p>
   <p>It is worth noting that a dramatist, who, if he so desires, can have his works accepted by the Royal Theatre, gives the Danes of Chicago the first chance.</p>
