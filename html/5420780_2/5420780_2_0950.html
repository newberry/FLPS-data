   <p>p.2.............Attorney Olaf E. Ray returned last week from the millenium celebration in France, in memory of the Norman invasion of that country. Mr. Ray represented the Norwegian-American National Organization "Sons of Norway," and also the Norwegian National League of Chicago. The Norwegian-Americans seem to have reaped much honor and enjoyment through their able representation at the festivities, and while it is still debatable whether the Norman Chief "Ganger"Rolf was a Dane or a Norwegian, it must be admitted that the Norwegians have enjoyed more publicity in connection with this event than the Danes, abroad as well as here at home, where the Danish descendants of the Normans gave no sign of life.</p>
