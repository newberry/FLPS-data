   <p>The American press again writes at length about the Mooney case.</p>
   <p>A Premier to a Prisoner</p>
   <p>American injustice as seen from the outside. Premier Stanning of Denmark sends his personal greeting and sympathy to Tom Mooney, prisoner in San Quentin. This famous European statesman had planned to come to the United States next month to visit the famous prisoner, but affairs of state forced him to postpone his visit.</p>
   <p>However the premier sends his cordial message to the prisoner.</p>
   <p>Yes, isn't it about time for patriotic, civilized Americans to begin to do a little thinking about a brand of American justice that arouses for its victims the sympathy of civilized people in all other parts of the world?</p>
   
   <p>Premiers of great nations do not send their sympathy and respects to prisoners about whose innocence (?) there is any doubt in any reasonable, unprejudiced mind.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, Joseph L. Hefferman, Mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, received an official invitation from the City of Los Angeles, but he answered "as long as Mooney is in prison I will not visit the State of California, and I will do all I can to prevent anyone else from visiting your State. The Mooney case is not only a blot on the record of California, it is a sad chapter in the history of America and has brought shame on the nation. We back East are as much concerned as you are for California."</p>
   <p>Yes, free America's "Dreyfuss."</p>
