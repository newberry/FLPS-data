   <p>p.2....Our countryman, J. E. Hansen, proprietor of one of the largest livery stables in the city, has recently invented and patented an"oscillating double-action draw and force pump." which he is now, in partnership with Mr. Schroder, manufacturing and bringing on the market. By means of an ingenious mechanism, the principle of which reminds one of the workings of the human heart, the pump sucks up water, and compressed air pressure throws it out in a steady stream, which can reach a height of 300 feet. With less expenditure of energy, the pump performs twice as much work as any other pump on the market. It is particularly well suited for use in factories, mines, breweries, on farms, etc., as well as for various household purposes.</p>
