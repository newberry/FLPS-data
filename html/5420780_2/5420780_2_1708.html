   <p>p.4....The picnic on the beautiful grounds of the Old People's Home in Norwood Park took place last Sunday. The weather was excellent, and the two hundred and fifty picnicers, mostly young people, had lots of fun watching and taking part in the various athletic contests; quite valuable prizes were distributed; large quantities of ice cream, beer, coffee and sandwiches were consumed and the event netted the home some $200.</p>
