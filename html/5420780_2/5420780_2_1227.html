   <p>Last Sunday Dr. Max Henius lectured in Dania Hall about the Chicago Public Library.</p>
   <p>This was the first of a series of educational, popular lectures which the society Dania is sponsoring during the winter season. Among other prominent men, who will talk later, is librarian J. C. Bay.</p>
   <p>Dr. Henius' lecture was both interesting and instructive, and was attended by a large and representative audience. However, we take this occasion to suggest that for an event of this kind the public should show the society and the lecturer the courtesy of arriving on time.</p>
   <p>We were much impressed with the work which the library is doing in the poorer neighborhoods, predominantly foreign, enabling the residents to read the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>literature of their own Old Country.</p>
   <p>It is well known that Dr. Henius was instrumental in the establishment of the library branch on W. North Avenue, which has excellent Scandinavian and German departments.</p>
   <p>It is clear that the library is an important factor in the great process of assimilation which is continually taking place in such a city as Chicago.</p>
   <p>The lecture, which was, of course, enthusiastically applauded, was followed by a buffet supper and dancing.</p>
