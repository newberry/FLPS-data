   <p>The Danish Workers' Singing Society's Concert last Saturday was a complete success as regards attendance, quality of performance and the appreciation shown by the audience. To watch Rolf Rammer direct his singers is in itself a real pleasure which even a deaf person could enjoy, for he uses his entire body, head, arms, legs, even his toes for a baton with a vivacity, elegance and technique which are inspiring to the audience as well as to the performers, and which have placed the choir among the first in the city.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a delicious supper and an animated ball, which broke up in the wee hours Sunday morning.</p>
