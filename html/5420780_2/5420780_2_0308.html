   <p>The Finsen Light Institute of America has been incorporated at Chicago with offices at Rooms 23-30, 78 State Street.</p>
   <p>The Danish doctor, Niels R. Finsen of Copenhagen, has used light to heal tuperculosis, cancer, and lupus. Two Chicago doctors, Wellington T. Stewart and John T. Stewart, went to Europe last spring to study this treatment. First they went to Manchester and Salford hospitals where Professor H. G. Brooke, in 1901 had started a Finsen Institute. More than 8,000 patients have been treated and 97% have been healed. Then the American doctors went to Copenhagen to visit Dr. Niels R. Finsen and his assistant, Professor Reyn. The two Stewart brothers bought a machine from Dr. Niels Finsen and the Danish government with a certificate to use the same; this is the first machine of this kind in America.</p>
