   <p>p.4..........Lodge eighteen of Danish Brotherhood, with a membership of 434, last Sunday celebrated the 27th anniversary of its founding. 150 people were present, among which were seen many new faces. All the presidents, with the exception of the Pulmann president, who is sick, attended. Mr. Hartvig Rasmussen presided, and there were many highly interesting speeches. Anton Kvist and others rendered several songs, as did a quartette from the Danish Worker's Singing Society, and all were enthusiastically applauded. A wonderful Brotherhood sentiment was evident, and we have never been better entertained.</p>
