   <p>It was illustrated at the Security League's polyglot banquet last Wednesday, that the United States is more than ever the melting pot of the world, and that present conditions fuse all of these foreign elements together more firmly than ever.</p>
   <p>All of 1,500 tickets for the banquet were reserved in the dining room on the eighteenth floor of the La Salle Hotel, and they were almost evenly divided among the seventy-five nations represented in Chicago, according to their numerical strength.</p>
   <p>For the Danes there were about thirty men and women present, at three or four tables to the left of the speakers' platform, next to a Norwegian and a Polish singing society.</p>
   <p>The $1.50 plate dinner was excellent, and also the patriotic speech by John F. Smulski.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers, was the progressive leader Bainbridge Colby who is now one of President Wilson's advisors, and who read the following telegram from the President:</p>
   <p>"May I offer to this unusual meeting my warmest greetings and express the deep satisfaction it gives me that men of all nationalities and representing so many of the great peoples of the world should come together to give expression of their loyalty to America and the ideals which she represents, and to resolve to support the present administration in the use of the influence and power of the nation.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson"</p>
   <p>The President's wire was received with great enthusiasm and applause, as was usual whenever his name was mentioned. A unanimous resolution was sent him, pledging the loyalty and support of all present.</p>
