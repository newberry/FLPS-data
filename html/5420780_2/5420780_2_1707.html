   <p>The matter was given considerable discussion. Among others, Senator Niels Juul recommended speedy extension even though the money had to be borrowed.</p>
   <p>Architect Sorensen promised to prepare plans for a new, larger home, and as soon as these are submitted, thus giving a more definite basis for discussion and action, another meeting of the society will be called.</p>
