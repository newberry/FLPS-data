   <p>Cooperative dairies have been organized on some of the Governments' irrigation land, and Danish farmers who will go into this business are in demand. There are also good opportunities for general farming, truck-farming, hog-and chicken-raising, etc.</p>
   <p>The Reclamation Service in Washington, D.C., will upon request send pamphlets and all required information and will also put prospective Danish settlers in touch with Danes who are already established on this irrigation project and with whom they may correspond.</p>
