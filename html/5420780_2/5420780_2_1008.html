   <p>We quote the Record Herald:</p>
   <p>"Like the students at the University of Copenhagen on November 3, 1871, we need to turn to Dr. Georg Brandes to open our vision. Whether they be near at hand or far away, the great contemporary influences and ideas of the Old World.</p>
   <p>"He has written many volumes, and has touched nothing without adorning and illuminating it. Not to have read him is not to be certain of fully understanding the vital thought of the nineteenth century and the promise of the twentieth.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Brandes has been a pioneer, a torchbearer, and the first phase of <span class="page-break">2</span>his life was stormy. But for many years he has enjoyed the affection and admiration of innumerable small groups of men and women who love truth, beauty, and moral courage. He comes to us full of years and solid achievements, and in honoring him we honor character, mental power, rare devotion to learning, and unremitting service to the higher civilization that knows neither race nor frontier, neither class nor party. His work has been a work of unification, of socialization, of elevation."</p>
