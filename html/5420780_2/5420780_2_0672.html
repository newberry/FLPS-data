   <p>Playwright Poss Nielsen is inviting the public to an evening of entertainment Sunday, Jan. 27, at 7:30 o'clock, when he will demonstrate the aims and purposes of his, "School of Culture." Poss Nielsen's idea is that dancing is able to develop a person's personality. One of his pupils little Esther Mathiesen is going to demonstrate that effect by dancing "Pas" of the Minuet "Elverhoj." Mrs. Agnes Mathiesen will be at the piano.</p>
   <p>Professor Marinus Poulsen has composed a characteristic melody for Fiskerne by Nolger Drachmann which will be sung by Poss Nielsen. Also he will recite lines from a classic play. The affair will be held in Boyschou's Hall, North and Western Avenues.</p>
