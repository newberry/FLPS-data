   <p>Rasmus Troldahl, who not so long ago was arrested on the charge of embezzling money that was paid him for steamship tickets, has again opened an office of the same kind at the old place, 169 East Harrison Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Troldahl did not intend to defraud anyone; he just got behind in his payments, and a couple of lawyers wanted to get hold of what money was left and his business. But two fine lawyers, Patrick O'Donnell and Johan Waage, got him out of all the trouble and helped him to make a new start.</p>
