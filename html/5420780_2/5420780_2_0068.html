   <p>The following resolution was adopted by the American Association of Foreign Language newspapers, dated May 12, and personally sent to President Wilson by the president, Louis Hammerling:</p>
   <p>To the President of the United States:</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned publishers of American Foreign Language newspapers, circulating among eighteen millions of people, who have left their native lands to enjoy the blessing of citizenship in the United States, knowing full well what is in the hearts of these people, assure you, Mr. President, that they cordially welcome the opportunity now offered them, in common with their fellow Americans, to assist the enlightened citizenship of other nations in establishing more firmly throughout the world the great principles of democracy. They are proud of having contributed in a considerable measure to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial greatness of the United States, the benefits of whose prosperity they have shared. They are anxious to show their gratitude to the land of their adoption, and their complete loyalty to its government by making such sacrifices as may be properly expected at this time from all true patriots. They are willing and eager to offer themselves, according to their qualifications, for military duty, or employment in field and factory, or for other service, with the object of helping as far as they can to uphold your hands in the present crisis. They will cheerfully contribute from their resources in the fullest possible manner to meet the extraordinary financial needs of the government, and in all other ways will earnestly cooperate to maintain the country's honor, and to insure triumph of a cause that is destined to bring about a lasting international peace.</p>
