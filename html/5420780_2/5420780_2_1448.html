   <p>As previously announced, Danes on the South Side are about to erect a new, modern club building.</p>
   <p>The plan originated in Danish Brotherhood Lodge No. 18 but, in order to obtain extensive Danish backing for the undertaking, representatives from all Danish organizations in the district have been invited to serve on the building committee.</p>
   <p>The building will be located on Cottage Grove Avenue, between 61st and 62nd Streets, easily accessible from all parts of the South Side.</p>
   <p>The sale of shares is progressing nicely, and complete architect's drawings, done by the Danish architect C. Nielsen, will be ready next week. Construction is expected to start in the immediate future.</p>
