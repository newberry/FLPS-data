   <p>Miss Inzebora Larsen, daughter of our well known countryman and manufacturer, Mr. L. Larsen, 1194 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, invented and patented a knee-protector. It is a sort of pillow held tight to the knee with elastics to use when washing floors, and can also be used by cement finishers. The latter type is however, made of a much stronger material. Miss Larsen is negotiating with a manufacturer who is interested in buying the patent. Meanwhile, Miss Larsen makes and sells her knee-protector at her father's address.</p>
