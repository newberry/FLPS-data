   <p>On Easter morning the Danish colony awoke to a city-wide excitement; the English-language papers carried big headlines clear across the front page:</p>
   <p>"Duel between Christian Botker, editor of Revyen (The Review), and Edward Petersen, editor of Chicago Posten (The Chicago Post)".</p>
   <p>Soon it was rumored that the duelists, the seconds, and the doctors (one always has a doctor or two at a duel) had been arrested and [would be] indicted.</p>
   <p>The seconds were Anton Kvist and the singer Andreas Frandsen for Botker and Thorvald Sommer and Edward Praem for Peterson.</p>
