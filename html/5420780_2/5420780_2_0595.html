The second annual exhibition is now being held.</p>

   <p>"The Mountains," a painting by Schmidt attracts much attention because of the very atmosphere of the west which the picture brings. Charles E. Hallberg's, "The Atlantic," is the source of much admiration of lovers of the sea. The painting, "First Snow" by Larson, has been the means by which the artist pictures nature in all its beauty in Winter.</p>
