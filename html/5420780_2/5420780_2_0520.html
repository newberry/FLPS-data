   <p>The well-known music publishing concern Clayton F. Summy Co., 64 E. Van Buren St., has just published an edition of the compositions of the Danish composer and music teacher Torvald Frederiksen. These compositions, under the title Fairy Tale Songs, were first published in Copenhagen in 1909 and enjoyed well-deserved success.</p>
   <p>Besides Mr. Frederiksen's music and text, the American edition also contains a translation into English by the well-known writer William Morton Payne, who has been very successful in transforming the simple poetry, preserving in the new language, its appeal to the child's imagination, in conjunction with the well adapted music.</p>
   <p>The collection comprises eight fairy tale songs about "Little Red Riding Hood," three about "The Three Goats" and six about "Hansel and Gretel." All children like them, and they are easy to sing and play.</p>

   <p>This unique musical work should become very popular here, not only among the Danes but also with children of all other nationalities. It might be a good idea to introduce it in the public schools.</p>
