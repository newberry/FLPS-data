   <p>The Chicago Danes, Aage Lowener and Rudolf Krebs, who own steel mills in Copenhagen and in Moscow, have bought one million five hundred thousand dollars worth of machinery and equipment from the Illinois Steel Company. [Translator's note: These two men were Chicagoans, who, at that time, were the sole owners of these enterprises in Copenhagen and Moscow. After the October Revolution they lost their property in Russia, and then became large stockholders in Bethlehem Steel.]</p>
