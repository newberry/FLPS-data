   <p>The Danish ship, "Dannebrog," as previously mentioned in The Review (Revyen.), is now finished. It was built by the Chicago Shipbuilding Company in South Chicago, and was launched at the dockyard at 100th Street and Calumet River.</p>
   <p>It was built much quicker than had been expected in spite of the fact that most of the dockyard workers are on strike, and it seemed likely that the carpenters would lay down their tools in sympathy.</p>
   <p>Everything went smoothly, and about 12 o'clock noon, the Danish flag, which had been bought by J. George Jensen, manager of Danish Hall, was hoisted mid-ship on the large hull which is 262 feet long, and as high as a three story house.</p>
   
   <p>On the pole of the bow, the pennant with the name "Dannebrog" was raised, and on the stern, the Star-Spangled Banner waved in the breeze.</p>
   <p>At the bow, a banner decorated platform was built for the notables and executives from the dockyard. The Danish consul and several well-known Danes, Captain W. Nielse, chief engineer Fabrisius, and Miss Lucille Kortz, a very pretty Chicago girl, who was to christen the ship, sat on the platform. At the given time, all cables were cast off, and blocks moved from under the hull. The ship began to glide slowly, beam first, toward the water, while out little Miss Kortz broke a bottle of champagne on the bow with a cheery "I christen the 'Dannebrog,'" amid great applause from the several thousand visitors and guests.</p>
   <p>The newly christened ship began to glide faster toward the dark waters of the river, while the waves broke high on both shores of the Calumet. Photographers were busy, and reporters from the American dailies took notes.</p>
   <p>In the office of the dockmaster following the launching, wine was served, which also was bought by the manager, Mr. Jensen, from Dania Hall. Consul Falkenstjerne wished the good ship, "Dannebrog," a pleasant journey. Judge Waldemar Bauer proposed three cheers for the Stars and Stripes, and L. M. Rosenbom led the singing of the stirring notes of "Om Dannebrog Jeg Ved."</p>
   <p>Later in the day, the dockmaster treated the guests with an excellent dinner, and in the evening Captain Nielsen gave Smorrebrod (Danish sandwiches) in Dania Hall.</p>
