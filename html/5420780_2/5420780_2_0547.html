   <p>p.4.col.3.......The concert, given by Henry Bramsen, cellist, and Mrs. Marta Sandal, soprano, drew a crowd that was disappointing indeed. Boxes and galeries were filled, but the main floor presented an almost forlorn aspect with so many unoccupied seats.</p>
   <p>The concert was a real treat to lovers of high class music. Mr. Bramsen proved himself a master of the cello, especially in his presentation of Chopine "Nocturne" and "Elverdams" by Popper. The lilting melodies and clear mellow tones of Mr. Bramsen's solos drew round after round of hearty applause. He is well worth hearing many times.</p>
   <p>Marta Sandal, is an artist in a class by herself. Quality and volume of tone combine to make her one of the outstanding sopranos of our day. Each number, whether classical or folk song was so near absolute perfection, that she endeared herself to her audience as few singers have been able to do.</p>
   
   <p>The proceeds of the concert went to the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital. This in itself should have filled the hall to capacity even though lesser artists were offered for the enjoyment of the audience. Future concerts by these artists will, we are certain, be rewarded with far better attendances.</p>
