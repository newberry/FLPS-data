   <p>The new world champion, the Dane, Bech-Olsen, was expected in Chicago Sunday April 1st at 9:30 P.M. Many Chicago Danes went to the Polk St. Station no greet him, but the train aid not arrive until 1 o'clock midnight; so many had gone home when he did arrive. Bech-slsen had changed trains and came to another station. The Danes soon found him and started a celebration at Woer's restaurant. There were many speakers: Edw. Reehoff, A. Wm. Hansen, Viggo Danielsen and Gram. But when the champion sang "Kender Du Danmark" he at once became the special friend of the singers from Harmonien. Bech-Olsen was tired and went to bed at the Palmer House Hotel.</p>
   <p>The banquet in his honor, that was to take place April 4th, was postponed to April 11th.</p>
