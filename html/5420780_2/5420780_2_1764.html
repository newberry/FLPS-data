   <p>The cornerstone of Dania's new building at the corner of Kedzie and Wabansia, was laid Wednesday afternoon during a ceremony attended by a great number of its members.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Christensen, president of Dania and chairman of the building committee, delivered a stirring speech, announcing that a copy of Dania's by-laws and membership list, a copy of the report of its first meeting, on Nov. 23, 1863, together with a copy each of Revyen, The Danish Pioneer, and Chicago-Posten, would be placed in a copper box inside the stone. This was done, whereupon the embryo building received a thundering ovation.</p>
   <p>After the ceremony, refreshments were served in P. Nielsen's hall.</p>
