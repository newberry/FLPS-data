   <p>p.2 col.5... Dania Lodge held a very important special meeting on Saturday, Jan.14th. For a long time they have felt the need of more suitable quarters and the meeting was called to consider this important question. Dania had been offered the spacious old Stensland residence on Evergreen Ave. and altho the price ($8,000) seemed reasonable the majority of the members voted against its purchase. This place was objected to as being inconveniently located and would need extensive alteration to fit the needs of the organization; even so they felt that the ever-increasing membership and widening field of activity would soon outgrow these quarters. A committee was then appointed to investigate other properties and to submit plans for the erection of a lodge hall that would be adequate for the future requirements of a rapidly growing "Dania."</p>
