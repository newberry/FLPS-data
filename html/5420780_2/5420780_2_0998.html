   <p>I love thee, land of Childhood's happy dream. I dwelt in fancy by another shore, Perusing tales of romance, quest and gold That made my heart rejoice, my spirit soan I worshipped fearless men whose simple lives were consecrated to a worthy cause: To fight for freedom, right and happiness. Yet bound in duty to the higher laws.</p>
   <p>I love thee, land of liberty and peace Whose flag was never lowered in disgrace. Here man holds no contempt for fellow man Whatever be his ancestry or race. Brave sons of all the nations of the earth In countless numbers found an open gate And strove for life's fulfillment and success Some failed, some won, led by a kindly fate.</p>
   <p>I love thee, land whose beauty lavishly Is stretched a thousand miles from sea to sea Deep rivers wind their way through fertile lands With boisterous brooks that sing in joyous glee.</p>
   <p>And lifted high against the silent sky Stupendous mountains with eternal snow Reflect their glamour in the silvery lakes. Like mighty temples seated row on row.</p>
   
   <p>I love thee, land now in thy sad ened hour, The torches flicker down, low is the light.</p>
   <p>I would partake in glory and in wealth Now I must share thy burden and thy plight. My goal is not to stab thy wounded heart With bitter words of hatred and of shame, But let me be a son among your own To carry on the glory of your name.</p>
