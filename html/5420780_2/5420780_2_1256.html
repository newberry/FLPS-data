   <p>Dania Hall was packed last night. Dr. Max Henius gave an excellent lecture about the production of beer in the United States. Dr. Henius is a wellk-known expert on this subject. The old Egyptians and the old Scandinavians were good makers of beer, and they loved to drink it. Dr. Henius is president of an American brewing school here in Chicago; at present he is working on a beer with more nourishment and less alcoholic content.</p>
