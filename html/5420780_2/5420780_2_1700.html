   <p>Christmas became a joyous feast for the residents of the Danish Old People's Home, thanks to the new superintendent M. Thorvald Nielsen, the house committee, and the many friends who sent greetings and gifts. The rooms were gayly decorated with flags and green wreaths and of course a beautiful Christmas tree was not missing, so that when coffee and genuine Danish Christmas Cake was served at o'clock, the real Christmas spirit pervaded the home. At 5 o'clock dinner consisting of goose and turkey with all the trimmings, was served, and later on gifts were distributed. Through out the evening fruit, candy and other refreshments were plentiful, and the old people were entertained with speeches, songs and music. A merry Christmas was had by all.</p>
