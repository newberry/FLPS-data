   <p>Our beloved countryman, Mr. Th. Kofold has been very active lately in efforts to establish a cemetery exclusively for Scandinavians. This marvelous idea ought to appeal to every Dane who has a spark of self-esteem.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kofold is selling burial lots for the new Irving Park Blvd. Cemetery and is negotiating with various Danish societies in efforts to make this beautiful cemetery exclusively Scandinavian.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday a group of members of Danish Brotherhoods and Sisterhoods Central Committees went to inspect the cemetery and received a very favorable offer, in fact the offer was so favorable that the plan is almost sure to be realized.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Lodges: "Sons' and Daughters' of Norway"have bought lots for a total amount of $200,000 from Mr. Kofold.</p>

   <p>enterprise which is to be recommended, not alone on account of its national aspects but also as seen from a pure economic point of view.</p>
