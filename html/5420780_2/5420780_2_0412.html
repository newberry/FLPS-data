   <p>The sensation of the day is the flight of Paul O. Stensland, president of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank. His debt to the bank is $1,003,000. But the bank has so much real estate that it will be able to pay the depositors 40-50 if it only can escape the hands of receivers.</p>
   <p>The cause of the fall of Mr. P. O. Stensland was his speculation in real estate. The best asset he has is the Mount Olive Cemetery, which has shown itself to be a gold mine. Most Scandinavians are buried there. But his co-operative store in the brick building on the corner of Carpenter and Milwaukee is bankrupt, and many people who bought shares will lose all. The bank was also used by many Danes. Mr. P. M. Lagoni had $20,000 in the bank. Greenberg and Corydon, $10,000; Martin Ackerman, $1,500; contractor Thisen $10,000 and contractor S. N. Nielsen, $4,000.</p>
