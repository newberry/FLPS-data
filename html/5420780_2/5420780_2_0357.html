   <p>About two years ago, Revyen mentioned that the well-known Danish chemist, A. Franch Philipson, had discovered a disinfectant he named "Tarx." Tarx is produced from coal tar, and appears in a solid form. It can be dissolved in either hot or cold water. The advantage is that this product can be shipped through the mail because of its solid form, which is quite a saving.</p>
   <p>The company which manufactures Tarx has its own factory here in Chicago, and is sold throughout the country, mostly to the farmers. It is used as a Tick eradicator. It is also used as a disinfectant in hospitals, camps, stock yards, railroad cars, etc.</p>
   <p>The company recently made a yearly contract with the Canadian Government to <span class="page-break">\2</span>supply them with Tarx, where it will be used in all government institutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Philipson has patented his discovery in several European countries, also in South America, where it will be used as a stock disinfectant. He has already received quite a number of large orders.</p>
   <p>In order to avoid misunderstanding, it is understood that Tarx is in no way similar to the discovery Philipson made during the War. This was a liquid gas that could kill the population of an entire city in a few minutes. Philipson gave this discovery to the American Government without cost.</p>
