   <p>The Danish Society for a Home for the Azed has had a most satisfactory year as shown by the following report from the president, Mrs. C. H. Ronne:</p>
   <p>"Once again a year has passed by; it has been a good, successful year for the Danish Home for the Aged. All our countrymen have supported the good cause.</p>
   <p>"First of all, in April, the people of the South Side presented a play for the benefit of the Danish Society for a Home for the Aged, which brought us the large amount of more than four hundred dollars. This started the move toward increasing the treasury of the Society, and for this our thanks are going to the South Siders, and also our plea that those people will not forget the old ones at Norwood Park, since their assistance will always be needed.</p>

   <p>"Let me also express my thanks to my associates, Mrs. W. Mogensen, Mrs. W. Nelson, Mrs. Ryberg, and especially Mrs. Stroob, who functioned so well both as secretary and treasurer on the housing committee, and to all those others who did the great and heavy work on the housing committee.</p>
   <p>"The income of the Society for the year was:</p>

   <p>"Under the capable leadership of Mrs. Mogensen the Home has progressed steadily. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison have directed the activities of the Home and they have executed their task to the great satisfaction of the board of directors and of the housing committee.</p>
   <p>"Illness and death have visited the Home, yet not more frequently than one would expect where eighteen old people are living together. One of these was ninety years old on February 8. Three of the residents at the Home have died.....Four new residents have been admitted....and all of these are thriving well.</p>
   <p>"Once again let me express the thanks of the Society to all those who have supported the good undertaking."</p>
