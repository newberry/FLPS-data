   <p>The first evening of the Scandinavian Music Festival was attended by only five hundred persons. The concert took place in Orchestra Hall May 26. The American papers put the blame on "incompetent management". It has been a little hard to get the co-operation of the Swedish singing societies. The different choirs invited to participate had only little to say about the arrangement of the whole festival.</p>
   <p>The Danes dominated the first evening both in the audience and in the united choir. The choir, under the leadership of Joel Mossberg, sang the Danish masterpiece "Volmerslaget". A orchestra of twenty-five men gave a fine concert under the directorship of E. Biorn. Miss Clara Jensen sang several songs by Heise. The singing of the Swedish barytone, Gustaf Holmquist, was excellent, as was that of the primadonna, Mme. Ragna Linue, and the playing of the Swedish-Norwegian violinist, Frederik Frederiksen.</p>
   <p>On the second evening, May 27, there was a better audience.</p>
