   <p>On March 1 the Hejmdal was converted into a stock company. The new company accepted all the duties and obligations which had burdened the former owner. The reason for this change is that a large capital is required to maintain a paper. It is better to have a stock company which will keep the paper going than to close entirely. Mr. Riechel, proprietor of the printing machinery, was willing to take stock for the value of his equipment.</p>
   <p>The paper is in a good financial position now.</p>
   <p>We thank our customers for their generous support. We wish to announce that Mr. Riechel has resigned as editor, but has promised to help us all he can in his spare time. Mr. M. Salmonsen will be the new editor, and will follow the same policy hitherto observed.</p>
