   <p>p.2........Mrs. Jorgensen and Mrs. Neilsen have now opened their new elegantly-equipped saloon at 730 W. North Avenue, where they should have every chance for success.</p>
   <p>The Danes are now well represented in the saloon business along that important part of North Avenue extending from western Avenue to Humboldt Park. On the first corner, the patriarch and master of them all, Peter M. Lagoni; in the next block, the new firm, Jorgensen and Neilsen; on the corner of Rockwell Street, the capable and dignified Peter Christensen, and a little closer to the park, Aslejorus Fossums elegant "Perfecto." In addition to these we have only a block from North Avenue, Peter Friis, who is doing well on Campbell Avenue, and Laurence Iehoy, who has a good beginning on Artesian Avenue.</p>
