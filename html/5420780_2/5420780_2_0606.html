   <p>The Scandinavian Art Exhibit was opened here last Monday by Mayor Gaynor, in the presence of the Scandinavian envoys and consuls and some 1,500 Americans and Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The paintings are causing considerable excitement in American Art circles, due to their originality and because they represent a school which is rather unknown in this country.</p>
   <p>Among the Danes, Willumsen and Hammershoj seemed to be the objects of the most admiring comments.</p>
   <p>Munch and Lund were the favorite Norwegians, causing heated artistic arguments pro and con, while all the Swedish painters from Lorn and Prince Eugen to Hesselbom already are accepted in the "best" artistic society.</p>

   <p>American art collectors and galleries will undoubtedly take advantage of this opportunity to buy representative Scandinavian art, and we hope that the Chicago Art Institute, which already has two Lorns, will see fit to add to its Scandinavian collection. We particularly recommend Willumsen and Lund.</p>
