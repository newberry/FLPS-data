   <p>p.3......Last Sunday completely won the Danes of Chicago. It was his first public appearance in this country, and if we are to judge by this performance, we predict that both he and the Danish-Americans will derive great pleasure from this tour. A large and representative audience filled Wicker Park Hall, when Mr. Fieldstrup introduced himself and delivered a greeting from Denmark.</p>
   <p>The program started with a recitition of Abrahamson's "My Son, if you want to advance in this world, bow!" The wisdom and satire contained in this well known poem was depicted in a masterly manner. In the comedy "A Terrible Girl" Mr. Fieldstrup played the role of Duracher, and his perfect characterization of this comical figure kept the audience in a continous state of enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>After the performance many of the audience were introduced to the popular artist, who himself was anxious to meet as many of his compatriots as possible.</p>
