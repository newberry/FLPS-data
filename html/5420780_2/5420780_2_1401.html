   <p>During the year 1895 there has been much talk about the Hans Christian Andersen monument. It was ready to be put up, but the colony could not agree as to where it should be placed, and there was also money to be raised for a pedestal.</p>
   <p>The Danish vice-consul, C. M. Koedt, had selected his good friend, Mr. [J.] Gelert, a well-known Danish sculptor, for the job of modeling and casting the statue. Mr. Gelert was to be paid $5,000 for his work. He had already been paid $3,000 and, at a banquet, he gave the other $2,000 to the good cause. The casting of the statue had cost $2,000, of which $750 had been paid. The pedestal would cost about $1,000. The colony needed about $2,000 in order to place the statue in any park in Chicago. But the Danish consul in Chicago had promised to give $1,000 whenever the rest of the money was in the bank. So what the colony really had to raise was $1,000.</p>
   <p>A committee for the placing of the statue was formed, consisting of five <span class="page-break">2</span>members, among whom were Henry L. Hertz, M. Salmonsen, and A. W. Rixon. Where should the statue stand? In Humboldt, Lincoln, or Jackson Park? The delegates for the Danish societies in Chicago were asked to raise money for this purpose and to help select the site.</p>
