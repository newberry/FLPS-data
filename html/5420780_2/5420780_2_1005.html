   <p>Yes, our people, the Scandinavian people, probably love Chicago as much as any other nationality does, if not more. From time to time poets write about her in verse, singers sing about her in song. Yes, we all believe that Chicago is beautiful--our Chicago.</p>
   <p>Antoni Thomsen, Chicago's most distinguished Danish poet, writes about Chicago. Kristian Baun writer of excellent prose and poetry, writes about Chicago. Antoni Thomsen has just finished, a poem about our city. We feel that this poem is an example of the talented people whom we have here in "our city". We reprint Thomsen's poem.</p>
   <p>The Song of Chicago</p>
   <p>See her stand in all her splendor</p>
   <p>When the early dawn doth break,</p>
   <p>Brilliant, cheerful, bathed in sunlight</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Fanned by breezes from the lake,</p>
   <p>See her parks and see her highways,</p>
   <p>See her tow'rs against the sky,</p>
   <p>And you'll feel her dauntless spirit,</p>
   <p>And we'll love her, you and I!</p>
   <p>Refrain:</p>
   <p>Hail the City of Chicago,</p>
   <p>Where your home, your future lies!</p>
   <p>From her ever-growing beauty</p>
   <p>Love and fame anew shall rise!</p>
   <p>She shall rise! She shall rise!</p>
   <p>Grand and greater she shall rise!</p>
   <p>Here we stand in strong allegiance</p>
   <p>To our city, to our homes,</p>
   <p>While the marvel of her story</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Over distant oceans roams,</p>
   <p>How she rose from fire and ashes</p>
   <p>Phoenixlike--and oh, behold!</p>
   <p>New and greater--always aiming</p>
   <p>For a higher, vaster goal.</p>
   <p>Refrain</p>
   <p>Hail the City of Chicago,</p>
   <p>Where your home, your future lies!</p>
   <p>From her ever-growing beauty!</p>
   <p>Love and fame anew shall rise!</p>
   <p>She shall rise! She shall rise!</p>
   <p>Grand and greater she shall rise!</p>
