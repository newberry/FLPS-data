   <p>Opera Singer Poul Bay has obtained a position as teacher in music at the Bush Conservatory, a position previously held by the late Clark.

   <p>Most Danes have had a chance to hear Poul Bay's magnificent baritone and when he sings for us again in Kimball Hall on October 22, accompanied by Edgar Nielsen, he can expect a great audience.</p>
