   <p>Carl Nielsen, the architect, defends himself against the criticism of the plans which he submitted to the committee for the building of a Danish Old People's Home. People have found the rooms too small and the whole plan ridiculous. But what do you expect for ten thousand dollars--which is all the committee will spend--and with rooms for only twenty-five old people?</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Chr. Bronnum-Petersen, who has been the president of the finance committee, defends himself in another article. He lost interest when he found out that the whole affair was run by some ladies who seemed to think that they did not owe the colony any statement of accounts, and that the whole thing was their private affair. Nor did he like the fact that there were to be no free rooms for poor old Danes that never had a chance in their life to save the two or three hundred dollars required for admission. If these ladies would make the Old Peoples' Home an affair for the whole Danish colony in Chicago, they <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>would easily get one thousand members, who would gladly pay twenty-five cents per month and thus give the Society a yearly income of three thousand dollars. There must be room for at least fifty persons, and some free rooms, also, and a yearly statement of accounts.</p>
