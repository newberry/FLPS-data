   <p>Let me tell of the Danish-American Athletic Club here in Chicago, my field of activity. We have a club that, from a meager beginning in 1922, now counts 250 adults and 120 children. One hundred and fifty of the adults take active part in gymnastics, while others go in for wrestling, boxing and other forms of athletics. All the children take part in gymnastics, and both grown-ups and children dance the old Danish folk dances. The D.A;A.C. has its own building with a large gym. We have, besides our own annual exhibition at Y.M.C.A.'s, universities, athletic organizations and at Grand View College, Iowa.</p>
