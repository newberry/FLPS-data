   <p>"The only thing that the international war trust has to fear on the score of reduction of profits is the limit of the ability of men, women, and children to keep on paying the ever-increasing per capita tax in the form of higher prices for foodstuff and wearing apparel," says Congressman Clyde H. Tavenner in a recent article on the world-wide war trust. This is certainly a bright prospect for the armor, powder, battleship, and ammunition trusts. But for the taxpayers, the prospects are not so bright.</p>
   <p>If taxpayers of the world want to escape being forced to pay higher taxes until they get so high they simply can not pay them, there is but one thing to do, and that is for the people of all the nations to insist that their governments manufacture their own munitions of war.</p>
   <p>If the millionaire and multimillionaire war-trust magnates cannot make huge profits in supplying armor, guns, powder, and battleships, they will take the same attitude toward the wasting of public funds that the rest of us do.</p>
