   <p>Members of the Harmonien visited the Old People's Home in Norwood Park last Sunday. An ideal weather also tempted a great number of other Danes to make the trip to the home, so that the house committee, and the superintendent and his charming wife, had their hands full. Refreshments were served, and the singers gave a concert program, which the old people enjoyed very much.</p>
