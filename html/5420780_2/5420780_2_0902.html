   <p>This year the Danish colony is going to be blessed with two reviews (Revyen). The first one will take place September 22 in Scandia Hall; it is written by P. V. Rutzou. The second Revy is written by Volkmar Johnsen and will be played at Wicker Park Hall, September 29.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The annual Revy is an old Danish custom and a special form of Danish humor or sarcasm. The Revy is made up of three or four acts with many songs in which fun is made of the main events of the year that passed, and of certain persons that have laid themselves open to ridicule.]</p>
