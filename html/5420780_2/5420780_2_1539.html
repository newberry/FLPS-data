   <p>There has been a rebellion within the Skandinaviske Socialdemokratiske Sygeforening (Scandinavian Social-Democratic Sick Benefit Society). A certain group in the old organization does not consider it radical enough; they all want to join the Industrial Workers of the World. The rebels have had a secret meeting, and are going to organize a society with the same name [i.e., Skandinaviske Socialdemocratiske Sygeforening]. However, as the old society still has the flags and the library, no one cares to take the case to court in order to protect the title of the society.</p>
