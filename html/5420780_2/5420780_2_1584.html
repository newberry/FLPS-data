   <p>The Danish Hospital Company was incorporated last June under the name of Christian Fenger Memorial Hospital. The incorporators are Dr. C. Clemensen, G. T. Magdal. Peter Mortensen, Anton E. Paulsen, A. M. Petersen, and Jens Gregersen. These gentlemen are now preparing plans to be presented to the Danes of Chicago.</p>
   <p>All Danish Societies, lodges, and churches will be invited to join the company, which is to be financed by the sale of sufficient shares to build and maintain a Danish hospital, owned and operated entirely by Danes.</p>
   <p>Such a hospital would stand as a beautiful memorial to our deceased countrymen, and also be of immeasurable value to the Danish Colony. Both Norwegians and Swedes have their own hospitals in Chicago, and there is no reason why we Danes should lag behind. The only reason is that up to now nobody has taken <span class="page-break">2</span>the initiative. But now that we have got a start, the undertaking should receive the energetic support of all Danes, and before long the job should be completed to the honor of our nation.</p>
