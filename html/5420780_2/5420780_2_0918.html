   <p>Folk dances were the main feature at the May festival arranged jointly by the Danish Brotherhood and Sisterhood lodges last Saturday in Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>After a pretty little May Queen, seated in a flower float, had been paraded around the hall, the folk dancers dressed in national costumes, and under the able direction of Mrs. Antoni Thomsen, demonstrated the age-old Danish folk dances, wildly applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>It was altogether a very festive and enjoyable event.</p>
