   <p>Having sensibly criticized a sales tax which, by an example, he proves to be "a poor man's burden," Nathan Hillman proceeds to preach that "what our legislators should do is (to) acquaint themselves with Henry George's marvelous work Progress and Poverty, and the single tax, then we would truly be on our way to economic relief."</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, N.H. neglects to exemplify exactly why and how the kind of taxation he favors, would bring economic relief. The reason is that neither he nor anyone else is able to do so. The grandiose idea of taxing exclusively, or, if you please, confiscating land values, so interestingly and so appealingly advocated in Progress and Poverty, by a sincere and talented crusader for social sanity and justice, was simply amateurish, obsolete, and unfit for practical application when first launched more than fifty years ago. It is still more so today. To the contrary, although basically in line with the viewpoint of Henry George, a quite different mode of "single" taxation is available by way of a uniformly and properly graded surtax on individual income. Referring to the very example presented by N.H. against the sales tax, a surtax applied at say, one per cent on in come between one thousand and two thousand dollars, and one per cent more on each additional thousand dollars income, would answer as follows:</p>

   <p>Instead of just nursing vague theories and wonderful ideals, exclusive or predominant application of the principle of surtaxation on individual incomes, means dealing with facts and conditions, taxation conforming to ability to pay, and fully in line with modern development and general social and economic trends.</p>
