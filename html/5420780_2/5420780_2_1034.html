   <p>It is feared that operatic audiences, however great their love of music, have not had a proper appreciation of what the cellist in the orchestra has to undergo, no matter how he may appear to exert himself. If any coal heaver, with an ear for music, ever envied the cellist because of the apparent relative lightness of this task, he may now know that he himself is the one to be envied.</p>
   <p>An Eastern consulting engineer has figured out that more energy is expended by a cellist in playing "The Evening Star" than is required to shovel four tons of coal. On the 2,960 notes in that composition the cellist expends a pressure of three and a half pounds per note, making a total of 9,415 pounds.</p>
   <p>It is somewhat of a disappointment that the eminent consulting engineer did not figure out the pressure of the entire orchestra in playing the score of <span class="page-break">\2</span>"Tannhauser". If he had done so, a mathematician might have been able to determine how many Wagnerian operas it would take to equal the power of the lever of Archimedes.</p>
   <p>No wonder Richard Wagner exerted such a power on the music world.</p>
