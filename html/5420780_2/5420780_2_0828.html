   <p>The Scandinavian Ladies' Singing Society which we mentioned some time ago is called "Illinois". It has thirty-eight members, and its present director is Kristian Nilsson. The ladies will give their first public concert in Wicker Park Hall April 12. Besides the chorus there will be a piano solo by Mrs. L. A. C. Hansen, a violin solo by Nels Holter, and recitations by Miss Ethel Olson.</p>
