   <p>The Journalists Guild's membership paper for March 1922, which is published in Copenhagen, writes the following:</p>
   <p>"The Danish press in America has an excellent Danish paper at last. We speak of the Danish Times, which is published in Chicago. This paper has been built from the "ruins" of the old Revyen, which was in operation for about twelve years."</p>
   <p>Two sixteen year old boys have sent a story to the Danish Times, which will appear in the next issue. The story is very well done and interesting.</p>
   <p>The boys are: Robert Morse, and Alex Franck-Philipsen, Jr. The latter is the son of A. Franck-Philipsen, former president of this paper.</p>

   <p>The Danish Times will begin a story contest with a large cash prize for the winner. All boys and girls sixteen years old are eligible. The contest will begin with "The Shack," the story submitted by the two boys mentioned above.</p>
