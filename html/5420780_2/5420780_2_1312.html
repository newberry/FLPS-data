   <p>p. 2.. The gymnastic club "Freja" held its 3rd annual dance last Saturday and enjoyed a large and representative attendance of high spirited Danish youth; the sport of dancing was most popular, as was the music by Carl V. Petersen.</p>
   <p>A few wrestling matches furnished additional entertainment. "Freja", full of health and vigor, is now opening its winter season, with "Bull" Olsen and Charles Hanson as instructors in wrestling and boxing, respectively; it is hoped that Mr. John Simonsen will be able to take the job as instructor in gymnastics, if arrangements can be made so that it does not interfere with his work in the same capacity at Trinitatis Youth Society.</p>
