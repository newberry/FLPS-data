   <p>Hejmdal again calls the attention of its readers to its financial crisis and asks them to assist in the drive to raise the $3,000 necessary for the maintenance of this paper. We already have $2,100, but we need the balance. The price of the stock is $10 per share. The payments are fifty per cent down, twenty-five per cent in three months, and the balance in six months. Give us a helping hand; it means so much to every Dane to have his own paper.</p>
   <p>Enclosed you will find a subscription blank which you are to give to your friends.</p>
