   <p>p.2......Since the sale of Dania Hall, Dania has been planning to erect a new building, and a building committee has been active for some time. The latter had decided upon the purchase of two lots, fifty feet front, on North Ave., east of Humboldt Park for $4,000, but the deal did not go through, as the owner changed his mind, insisting that the society buy four lots, 100 feet front, for $7,000.</p>
   <p>In the meantime it had been suggested that Dania invite other Danish societies to cooperate in this building undertaking. Thirteen societies were invited, seven of which were represented at a special meeting last Wednesday.</p>
   <p>There was general agreement as to the need of a modern club building, and that the problem could best be solved by cooperation between all Danish societies. In order to meet all demands such a building would have to be larger and better equipped than Wicker Park Hall, and would cost $75,000 to $100,000. It was finally decided to ask all the societies, which had been invited, to send three <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>delegates each, with reports on the general sentiment within each society to a meeting in Dania's club rooms on the first Friday in September for further discussion of the project.</p>
