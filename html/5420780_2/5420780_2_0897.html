   <p>p.4.........Dania's Dramatic Club opened its season last Sunday, presenting the French farce "The Three Deaf Ones" and Hostrup's eternally young and happy "Intrigues." Two actors are well known from last year, but one had the pleasure of seeing again some players who have been absent for the last few seasons.</p>
   <p>Refreshments and dancing concluded the pleasant evening in "Dania."</p>
