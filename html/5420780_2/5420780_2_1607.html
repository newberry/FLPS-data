   <p>While the Danish Children's Home received $1,600 of the proceeds of last year's tag day, its share this year, when nearly twice as many Danish ladies participated, amounted to $2000. This is good news for the institution on Evergreen Avenue and for all Chicago Danes who take an interest in the home, particularly so for its superintendent, Pastor A. V. Anderson, and for its cashier, C. Petersen, both of whom took an active part in arranging the tag day.</p>
   <p>All the ladies who donated their time and efforts deserve our hearty thanks, and we hope that next year they will also place themselves at the disposal of this good cause.</p>
