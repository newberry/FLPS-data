   <p>Among Jews is a new book, containing sketches by M. Salmonsen, with preface by Dr. Emil G. Hirsh and a copy of an etching by the Danish painter, Carl Block. It was written by a well-known and respected Danish-American, who for many years had charge of the Chicago marriage License Bureau. Mr. M. Salmonsen has published some of his most interesting experiences as a marriage clerk in from the Marriage License Window, which book was a sellout. Recently, Mr. Salmonsen wrote a new book, Among Jews. It is a collection of short stories and sketches about the life, trend of thought, customs and traditions peculiar to the Jewish race, which race, despite persecution and dispersion over a long period of time, has preserved its distinctive features and developed into a powerful factor in modern civilization. In one of the stories, "A Fervent Zionist," a character, named Dr. Frank, gives a synopsis of the rather new feature of Jewry called Zionism, the aims and purposes of which are to unite all Jews and incorporate a Jewish State either in old Palestine or in Argentina.</p>
   
   <p>Most of the stories concern Jews who for some reason or other have left the Old World and established themselves over here. Mr. Salmonsen's presentations bear a stamp of sympathy and deep understanding, coupled with a keen sense of humor, all of which enables him to give the human frailties and shortcomings, peculiar to the Jews, the once over. The closing chapter, "Thirteen at a Dinner Party," is almost classical in its touching simplicity.</p>
   <p>Carl Block's famous etching, "A Jew," adorns the front cover, and no lesser personality than Dr. Emil G. Hirsh has furnished the preface in which he says:</p>
   <p>"The author has looked at Jewish life from within. His own temperament has felt something of the pathos of the life about which he brings us an account. May his narrative help to spread the more profound sympathies which, responding to the unities of human love and labor, are potent factors in cementing the bonds of respect and understanding between the various components of the human family."</p>
   
   <p>The following books by Carl Ewald have been translated from Danish into English by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos and published by Chas. Scribner to Sons Co., New York: My Little Boy; Two Legs; The Spider and Other Tales.</p>
   <p>The Danish author, Carl Ewald, is beginning to be appreciated on the American book markets, in which the above three books appear, excellently translated and nicely bound with original green covers. The press and the public have welcomed Carl Ewald's books in a way so encouraging, that we have reason to expect more of his works, translated and published in the near future.</p>
   <p>My Little Boy contains a collection of sound, delightful sketches of children in daily life; Two Legs is a fairy tale, depicting the creation of man and his victory over the animals. The Spider and Other Tales is a dozen of Ewald's best fairy tales about animals, plants and other nature's phenomena. Any of the three books will be appreciated by little boys or girls probably by the boys in particular, because of the author's daring style, which is high above silly sentimentality. Grown-ups will receive as much pleasure from reading these books as children. Carl Ewald's vivid description of nature is healthy and refreshing reading for anyone.</p>
