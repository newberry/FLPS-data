   <p>Even though the War has caused much hardship for business, such as, high prices and difficulties in getting sufficient labor, poor transportation, etc., we find great activity within the piano factory of Marry C. Bay our countryman, whose office still can be found on Lake Street, while the factory has been moved to Bluffton, Indiana. He employs about 450 workers, and produces a minimum of 350 pianos per month, of which about one-third are players.</p>
   <p>The firm name has been changed from Drachmann to M. C. Bay and Company. Drachmann is still used as the trade-mark on pianos as well as players, and the product is well known throughout the country.</p>

   <p>Next door to the offices part of the old factory is being used as a machine shop, where the pianos are exhibited and the expensive players are operated day and night, to show the different mechanical metal parts in operation.</p>
