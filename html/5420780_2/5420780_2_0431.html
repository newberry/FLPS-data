   <p>Ceylon Soya, as it is used in the old country, is now being introduced to the Chicago market. A short time ago our countryman Mr. Chas. Therkildsen started the manufacture of the product in Brooklyn, and the undertaking was quite a success, due to the superior quality of the Soya. Where he now extends his field of action to Chicago, we sincerely wish him luck. The Chicago distributor is the wholesale firm of Mr. Wm. Morgensen, 557-59 Armitage Avenue.</p>
   <p>Besides the manufacture of Soya, Mr. Therkildsen is introducing a new method for the preservation of eggs. Tests conducted in Denmark has proven that when treated by this method eggs will retain their fresh taste almost indefinitely, and, for any purpose, compare favorably with new laid eggs. The highest prices have been obtained on the English market. In April the method will be demonstrated for a number of Chicago firms. It will also be patented and the patent rights sold to those interested.</p>
