   <p>The society for the Danish Old People's Home met last Wednesday to make a final decision in regard to its building project.</p>
   <p>Architect John C. Christensen's plans for a $25,000 structure, which had been approved by the building committee, after some discussion were adopted by the meeting.</p>
   <p>The new building will have a 116-foot front facing north and a large open sun purch facing south. It will contain twenty-four sleeping and living rooms, and a dining room, kitchen, and pantry. Earlier plans called for a maximum cost of $20,000, but the latest ones were so attractive and impressive that the society could not resist the temptation, reasoning that inasmuch as the original sum had been made available rather easily, it ought to be possible to raise $5,000 more.</p>

   <p>At present the society has at its disposal $20,000, half of which will be set aside as an interest bearing fund. In addition, the building committee has secured pledges to the amount of $2,500 and a similar sum is in prospect.</p>
   <p>The balance will be covered by means of a loan.</p>
   <p>Construction will start in the immediate future.</p>
