   <p>It is easy to say that the army will only be there, but we must not forget that Germans, Frenchmen and Russians say the same. The trouble is that an efficient army must nurse the offensive spirit. A soldier who does not yearn for war is no soldier at all. It is natural that he should want to show his prowess, and his life and all his life's work seem wasted to him if he has no opportunity of doing some practical service. So there will be a party in the country which wishes for war from noble, unselfish motives. Then there will be another group which wishes the same from sordidly selfish motives, and this group will be very rich, very influential.</p>
