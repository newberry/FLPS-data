   <p>Friends of Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Bunck gathered at Hotel Atlantic last Tuesday to celebrate the couple's silver anniversary. There was a banquet and speeches galore, with Mr. "Sam Smiles" as master of ceremonies.</p>
   <p>It is particularly for their work for Danish Old Peoples' Home that Mr. and Mrs. Bunck deserve credit. Mrs. Bunck has been on the Housing Committee for many years, and Mr. Bunck served as president of the Home for three years during which period the membership doubled. He also served on the committee in charge of Danes of Chicago's participation in the World Exhibition in San Francisco, and in many other capacities he has been of service to his countrymen. When Mr. Bunck took the responsibility for a job we could always be sure the work would be done in a most conscientious manner.</p>
   <p>Although the couple had announced they would decline to accept gifts, a few of their closest friends surprised them with a silver cup as thanks and appreciation for years of friendship. From Danish Old Peoples. Home a beautiful bouquet had arrived and was handed over by Mrs. James Henriksen, after she had made a fine speech. From the old <span class="page-break">2</span>people of the Home came a bouquet of roses and a poem by A. Thorsager. Mr. Bunck's employees presented a gigantic bouquet signifying the friendly relation which has always existed between Mr. Bunck and his employees. There were about forty telegrams from such well-wishers as Consul General Beck, Vice-Consul M. Hemmingsen, Halvor Jacobsen, Ivar Kirkegaard, James Madison, Frank Philipson and Andr. J. Nielsen of California, The Danish Pioneer and Danish Times and others.</p>
   <p>Congratulatory songs by Mrs. Chas. Anderson, Anton Kvist and Casino were sung. It was a fine and stylish affair long to be remembered by Mr. and Mrs. Bunck, as well as by those who arranged it and participated in it.</p>
