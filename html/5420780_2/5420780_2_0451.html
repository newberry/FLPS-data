   <p>A Dane in Chicago has invented and patented a stove which gives an even heat and at the same time keeps fresh air in the room by means of a ventilation system. The inventor's name is Winterlichs. His stove has two walls and air space between them, which prevents the top of the stove from becoming red hot, but provides for heating the air. The fresh air goes into the wall space of the stove through a pipe from beneath the floor; the hot air goes out at the top of the stove and circles around the room. The used air is heavier than the hot air; hence it goes to the floor and slips out at an opening in the floor which is connected with the chimney. The draft in the chimney works like a pump and drains the foul air out.</p>
