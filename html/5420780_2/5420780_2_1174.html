   <p>It is with "mixed" feelings one reads through these 191 pages of Mixed Memoirs From a 40-Year Sojourn in Chicago, and one lays them aside with -well, disgust is the best word for it. A more suitable title for the book would be "Loose Talk."</p>
   <p>The book is chiefly filled with "rumors," mostly rumors of the more unsavory kind, but sprinkled in among all these non-essential topics, one finds a few interesting memories of some important persons and events of the period, and quite a number of people receive favorable mention.</p>
   <p>The main objection to the book is that it does not give a true picture of the Danish colony in Chicago during the period in question, and in <span class="page-break">\2</span>fact, this may not have been the purpose of the author; it may sell better the way it is.</p>
   <p>Another objection is that it gives no account of events and conditions of the last 15-20 years.</p>
   <p>The memoirs are certainly "mixed," if this word is to signify a mess of strongly colored stories and lack of coordination and unity.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to find an acceptable excuse for the publishing of these "mixed memories."</p>
