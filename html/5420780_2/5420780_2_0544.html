   <p>p. 2.col.6...The farewell appearance of Mr. Herskind, who for the past several months has scored a continual success in Danish-American theatrical circles, was a triumphal conclusion of his visit in Chicago and surrounding towns.</p>
   <p>Mr. Herskind has shown great artistic ability and an energy and willingness that have won him a prominent place in the esteem of his local compatriots. His farewell audience was the largest turnout that has ever attended a Danish concert in Chicago, a real tribute to a real artist whose program consisted to some extent, of request numbers and encores.</p>
   <p>The program was followed by a tasty lunch and dancing to music by Mrs. Mathiesen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Herskind is scheduled to appear in Troy, N.Y., Philadelphia, Perth Amboy, N.J. and New York City, ere he sails for his home in Denmark.</p>
