   <p>p.2.col.6........Hvalfisken (The Whale) the well known Danish Athletic Club on the South Side celebrated the New Year with a fine banquet in the Walhalla Hall annex. About thirty prominent couples of South Side Danes attended the affair. Mrs. W. Peterson, the "Dania" hostess served while the entertainment of a musical description was furnished by Mrs. Agnes Mathesen.</p>
   <p>The aim of Hvalfisken is to promote sports, especially "hunting and fishing," although after the New Years festival it would not be out of the way to add,"banqueting and entertainment." Mr. Andrew Nielsen, former South Sider acting as toastmaster, soon had the crowd in the best of humor, and speeches by prominent Danes interspersed with the famous wit and satire of the toastmaster made the enjoyable time at the banquet table seem all too short.</p>
   <p>When this was over and sides began to ache from laughter the tables were cleared away and the dance program began. This lasted until the wee hours of the morning.</p>

   <p>We doubt whether there ever has been a more thoroughly enjoyed festival in the history of our Danish-American colony in Chicago.</p>
