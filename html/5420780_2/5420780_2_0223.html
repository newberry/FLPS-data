   <p>Max Henius had the good fortune of being well-born. His parents came from Northern Germany, that part of the world where agriculture and industry flourished in the beginning of the nineteenth century, where modern chemistry was born, and the life of the people followed happy and constructive historical lines. His parents settled in Denmark, in the town of Aalborg. They worked hard to achieve great success. An old town sheltered the childhood of Jacob Riis; so did another old town surround the growth of Max Henius. An old town, a small town, where life is a unit, based on fine traditions and old ideals, which is a blessing to a child and youth. Our friend, Dr. Henius, absorbed these traditions and ideals. He was well named--a brief, open, and clear name, easy to call. He grew up close to the sea, on one side, and to ancient moorlands on the other. There was heatherbloom in his mind and ancient hills in his fancies,--that was the land of the valient Kimbrie tribes; and its saga became part of Max Henius' life, the background of his poetry, his vision.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He left this homeland in his fiery youth, and we may emphasize the fact that the was indeed well-born. According to Danish views, that is a consolation, but still secondary to being well reared. Reared as he was in the free life at two German universities, just about the time when bacteriology began, chemistry took shape, and a realistic philosophy developed. Some view the world through poetry and history, others through science and philosophy. Max Henius had both views. Nowadays you call that humanism. He had a happy youth. He practised its lessons as a man. This is the reason why he never grew old in mind or spirit.</p>
   <p>I met him in May, 1892, when he had only recently emigrated, and had begun his work in practical chemistry here in Chicago. Then, as ever, there was about his person an air of energy and speed. There was fire and will power in his eye. He was a handsome man, quick and ready, and devoted to the biological teachings of Emil Christian Hansen, who had been my own <span class="page-break">\3</span>teacher. Those were the early summer days of a life in which he met with success and gained the courage that upheld him ever.</p>
   <p>He had married well, which, according to Danish views, is the third greatest necessity in life. He had married a bright blond daughter of the Heiberg family, and thus became brother-in-law of one of the most famous scientists of the past generation. We both lived to help in raising a monument in honor of Hansen in the old town of Ribe, Denmark.</p>
   <p>Henius was not a man that would shake hands, and say he was glad to meet you, then go on and forget all about it. He had finely developed sympathies, and he valued and grasped the subtle and seemingly small things in life. He was mentally incorruptible, as much an analyst in his sympathies as he was in his science. He might be--and was-- fond of his friends, but he loved truth still better. They found him so in Denmark when he began his forty years of continuous voyaging across <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Ocean.</p>
   <p>It is considered dangerous to lead a double life. Yet, in a sense, this must be the fate of all emigrants. Their memories point one way, their work another. But to Henius the world did not revolve about Chicago, on one side, and about Denmark on the other. There always was a bridge across the Atlantic.</p>
   <p>His mind was singularly creative. In a few minutes he could analyze a plan and indicate a course of action, but when this had been done, he wanted action--and was, himself, ready for action. As time passed, and he gained experience, he became a capable administrator on generous lines. And yet he wanted to see both ideals, the method and the detail,--and to have a hand in all.</p>
   <p>His voyages and travels, his many occupations and the public matters that enlisted his activities, made of the scientist a grand seigneur, who seemed <span class="page-break">\5</span>to dictate and domineer. But Henius was dominant rather than domineering. He preferred to plan and work rather than dictate. Still, you had to know him at close range to comprehend the modesty he possessed. Among us who are have today, there are some whom he put ahead of himself on many occasions.</p>
   <p>His talents were varied, and they often made him the center of a circle where he would have preferred to step aside. In his summer home up in the heatherclad hills of Jutland, he Droved himself a wise manager and a generous host. On one occasion, he would entertain the King or the Prime Minister, and their suites in his four little rooms, and the next day, he might put on wooden shoes, take a cane in his hand, and walk about the country, talking with the peasants, the housemen, the woodcutters. His sense of humanity was remarkable, his reaction to persons and ideas quick and most winning. President of the Public Library Board in Chicago, Honorary President of Rebild Park and of the American Library in Denmark--I still am with him on our walks in the heather, in wooden shoes and old hats, talking in the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Jutlandish dialect. "No skal a bigot sej Oe hwa a tinkt oi awtes."--(Now I will tell you what I thought about last evening).--No wonder that Mr. Gladstone liked to fell trees and doted on his old hats. He and Henius had much in common. The secret of their lives is partly that they had great ideals, had learned a method of doing things, and chose enlightenment rather than knowledge.</p>
   <p>It would be a Danish discovery if one ever knew what he did not first love. Dr. Henius may not have been a giant among chemists, but he loved to be the head of a model and incorruptible chemical laboratory,--and knew how. Nor did he know botanical geography, but he loved and preserved the heather country, and was one of its population. Nor did he know many books, but he sensed the idea of a well-conducted public library for the enlightenment of the people.</p>
   <p>Modest and generous, he accomplished great things through the help of others. There was about him a singular old-fashioned courtliness and <span class="page-break">\7</span>festivity. Of course, he grew wise as he grew older, but at heart he remained a big child, and like all children, he accepted mankind for what it could contribute. Alone, he was very good company for himself--always dreaming, restlessly forecasting, and sometimes very impatient about sloth, slowness and indifference.</p>
   <p>His energy, his sustained friendliness, his memory of kindness, his will-power, his persuasive and sustained idealism, his respect for persons, and yet his independence of them,--all this was part of his portrait as it stands before me. And so, having mentioned birth, upbringing, and marriage, we come to the last step in the four stages of life. "Well dead is all that matters." This is the last line of Ambrosius Stub's verse on the cycle of life.</p>
   <p>It is not his death, however, that brings us together here. It is the fact that he lived in such a way when he reached old age, the love, which <span class="page-break">\8</span>he gave so generously by work, speech, and example, comes back abundantly from the many friends he served. Happily, he felt its return while still with us. He did not mind being alone, but he never liked loneliness. No bright child can endure it. It was not fear. Nobody was more fearless than Max Henius. He hated to see fear in others. He resented it wherever he saw it, in home or office. Nor need anybody fear him, unless they had been up to some knavery.</p>
   <p>I think Henius was a happy man, because he made others happy. He was bouyant and cheerful, always original, always himself. Dull moments he did not know. We all, or most of us, remember him with deep affection in many moods and states of mind, earnest, joyful, impatient, or angry. If he could speak now, he would ask me to mention some instance in which he failed. I would be glad to accommodate him. He failed completely when he tried to be sly or hide his feelings. Then he was funny.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>I wish to point out that he took life as he found it. In many ways he won his point over fate. We were together when my dear friend, Young E. Allison's death was announced by telegram. I mentioned one of Allison's sayings: "Life is great--all of it." It was early morning, and the skylarks warbled above us. "No," said Henius, "to me, not all of it. It ought not come to an end."</p>
   <p>Let us take leave of him at this point. He regarded the Church as the greatest cultural factor among us, and this remains true. There is no more we can say except that Max Henius forms a separate chapter in the life of every person who had his friendship and was his friend. Thus far, there is no end, memory and love endure. God bless Max Henius, his name, his memory, his work,--his children!</p>
