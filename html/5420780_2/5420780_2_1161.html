   <p>"The attention of the readers of the American Scandinavian Review is drawn to the Scandinavian Union Catalogue, which has recently been brought from the Harvard University Library to the office of the American Scandinavian Foundation in New York. This catalogue, which is of authors only, comprises over sixty-five thousand cards from the Harvard Library, the Library of Congress, and other leading libraries, and enables the Bureau of Information of the Foundation to answer inquiries regarding the location of books by Scandinavian authors in American Libraries. The catalogue may be used by addressing the Librarian, 116 E. 64th Street, New York."</p>
