   <p>The Danish Children's Home, at 1183 North Maplewood Avenue, was recently attacked in the Pioneer by a Mr. C. P. Ditlefsen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ditlefsen maintains that a home run and controlled by a particular denomination has no right to appeal to the public in general, and to the Danish colony in particular, since neither the general public nor the Danish colony has anything to say about the election of officers, and so on.</p>
   <p>He also maintains that religion is stressed too much in the Home, and that the children are not given proper care. The president of the Home is the Reverend Mr. P. Eriksen, 106 Bickerdike Street, and the superintendent is Mrs. Martha Olsen.</p>
   <p>The Home was founded, however, by the Trinitatis Church, and it is open to <span class="page-break">\2</span>all Danish children in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The only result of the attack is that many have visited the Home, and that many men and women who were raised in the Home have protested and have come to its defense.</p>
