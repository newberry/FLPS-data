   <p>Senator Brookhart, who at the present time is journeying in Europe, recommends Denmark's cure for farmer's troubles. Would it work? asks the Chicago Herald and Examiner in a headline of the following article by George W. Hinman:</p>
   <p>"Parley Parker Christensen, of the Farmer-Labor Party, agrees with Mr. Brookhart. So do many others who write articles for magazines. If these persons are right, if the habits and success of Danish farmers really could be transplanted and made universal in America, one of the-greatest problems of this nation's business would be solved offhand. Are these things possible?</p>
   <p>The question is worth-while, because Denmark in her way has done wonders in farming, and this country's agricultural wonders are still to come. It is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>worth-while also because, if we cannot do what Denmark has done, it is important to know the fact at once. Then we shall not waste valuable time on hopeless experiments.</p>
   <p>What Has Denmark Done</p>
   <p>Denmark has done wonders, that is true. Sixty years ago she was a conquered, little country with poor land and an unprosperous population. She had bog and sand in abundance; she had big estates only half cultivated; she had a fierce and half-sunless climate. Much of her soil had been cultivated for a thousand years. She had apparently a worn-out proposition in her agriculture. Yet by the co-operation of her farmers among themselves, by the division of her big estates up to the point where thirty acres are today the average sized farm, and by the combined efforts of government, bankers, and farmers she has become more or less of a marvel in farm prosperity to the larger countries of the worlds. She even supplies great quantities of food to Great Britain, a country eight times her size and fourteen times her population.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>If the United States, in proportion to its size and population, could do what Denmark has done, we would soon be feeding the world. But it is probably because of its size and population that the United States never will be able to use the Brookhart remedy.</p>
   <p>The Population of Chicago</p>
   <p>All Denmark has just about the population of Chicago. All Denmark is just about one-quarter the size of Illinois, one-third the size of New York, one-tenth the size of California. The vast variety of farms, farm produce, and farmers that extend from the granite hills of New Hampshire to the tropical fields of the Imperial Valley are unknown to the tiny kingdom of the Danes.</p>
   <p>If a man wishes to realize the difference in the problems of the two countries, he has only to imagine the ranches of the Great West cut up into thirty, forty, or fifty acre farms of clustering co-operatives, and try to visualize the plight <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of the new-era farmers. Want and hardships would be the common lot. The desert hermits would be no more unfortunate. In fact, upon hundreds of thousands of acres the farmers would no longer be farmers, but they themselves would be desert hermits.</p>
   <p>If the United States could be drained wherever it is wet and be irrigated wherever it is dry; if its one hundred and seven million people could be governed from one city hall as are the three million (?) in Chicago; if their climate, products, and habits could be made uniform as are those of Long Island, or Cook, or Ventura County; if figuratively, they all could be fitted with the Game clothes at the same season of the year and be content, then the thingswould be possible in this country that are possible in little Denmark. Otherwise not.</p>
   <p>Limits of Co-operation</p>
   <p>That in lands like England, Italy, and France the Danish example has not been <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>followed is fair evidence that it cannot be applied to other countries of their sizes. If these countries could do on a large scale, what Denmark has done on her small scale, they would make the effort soon enough for they all are keen for their own prosperity.</p>
   <p>Yet even in England, where the distress of the farmers is much worse than in our own Northwest, it is agreed that the Danish example can be followed to only a limited extent. The orange growers of one state or two may cooperate, as well as the cheesemakers and dairymen of others, the wheat growers or tobacco growers of still others, but to spread a uniform network of general co-operation and state supervision over all food production from Maine to Southern California, in Danish style, would be the colossal experiment of all ages and peoples, outside Russia.</p>
   <p>If such an experiment were to be tried, its success would be a matter of decades. Even in tiny Denmark, the present success is the achievement of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>nearly two generations. Therefore, as a means of relieving the American farmers, it would be no remedy at all in this year 1923, or in any of the ten years to come.</p>
   <p>The day of miracles is not at hand for the farmers, any more than for the rest of us in business."</p>
   <p>So Mr. Hinman seems to come to the conclusion that it would not work. And yet, trying surely could not do much harm, if any.</p>
   <p>The secrets of success for the agriculture of Denmark are:</p>
   <p>1) Cooperation-unity. The farmers help themselves by helping one another. They have carried that idea out in all their agricultural unions. Furthermore, the movement has spread to the towns, where almost everywhere you find co-operative stores. When the Danish farmers buy foreign materials for their farms, for the benefit of their cattle or their fields, they get their goods <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>at home through the purchases of their co-operative unions.</p>
   <p>Of course, the wares can be procured cheaper that way than if each farmer had to buy just for his own use.</p>
   <p>2) Knowledge of agricultural theory. Farming in Denmark is not considered a job for those who are good for nothing else. Instruction is given in several agricultural schools scattered throughout the country. For many years there has been a special royal academy of agriculture in Copenhagen, whose teachers are the leading scientists in their line.</p>
   <p>3) Energy. Energy is necessary for the Danish farmer. Money has never been easily earned by the one who must depend upon the weather as much as upon the quality of his soil and his machinery. His personal efforts mean the most. But energy at least should not be considered any obstacle in the United States.</p>
   <p>The main objection of Mr. Hinman is that co-operation would necessarily be <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>limited if the Danish system was tried in the States. Evidently he is of the opinion that the necessary unity in aim could not be accomplished here. Yet the entire world is the same in this respect. If a man is unwilling to join a new scheme to help his fellow beings, generally he will join, when he is convinced that he can profit by it. Would the Danish system work in the States? Yes, it would work anywhere when done right, but of course it would not improve matters at once. Little Denmark, small as she is, possesses a few good things which she can teach the rest of the world. More and more, countries are realizing this and are asking Denmark for advice. Many Danish dairy people have gone to New Zealand and Australia. And this very summer, on the request of the Japanese government, some of the best Danish farmers have been chosen by the Danish government and have been sent to Japan to establish and supervise Danish model farms in that country.</p>
