   <p>The Society for the Danish Old People's Home had another meeting in Dania on September 4. Ninety men and women were present, but nothing came of all the discussion and voting; not a single proposal was able to get the necessary two-thirds vote. The main discussion was about free room and board for Danes that had not the money to get in. Some were for free rooms and no board, some were for free rooms and free board. Fifty-one voted for the latter and thirty-three for the former. Then the meeting tried to vote for the same thing under another name: For or against free lodging--that is, free room without board; the result was forty-two yes and forty-seven no.</p>
   <p>Finally, Dr. Max Henius proposed that the Society elect an executive committee of seven members, with full authority to act. He thought that the Society, as a group, would never be able to agree.</p>
