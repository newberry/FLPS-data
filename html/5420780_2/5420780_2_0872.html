   <p>The production last Sunday of "Fru Mimi" (Madame Mimi), a satire by Gustav Wied, and of "Glade Ungdom" (Happy Youth), a farce by Werner Nielsen, was quite a success.</p>
   <p>The audience did not appreciate the satire of Gustav Wied as audiences formerly did; are we demanding more, or is perhaps Gustav Wied not the humorist that he is supposed to be?</p>
   <p>Gudrun Jacobsen played the title role of Mimi, a role that has been made famous by Anna Larsen. Our Gudrun portrayed Mimi with genuine feminine temperament and she was adorable in her bright red negligee.</p>
   <p>Orla Juul, the "professional Orla," portrayed the absent-minded professor so naturally that we begin to wonder whether Orla is just as absent-minded in real life.</p>

   <p>In "Happy Youth" Orla Juul portrayed the old libertine; there again he was so natural that--well, maybe his wife should keep an eye on him. The director, Ole Knudsen, is to be congratulated.</p>
