   <p>Jens Jensen has been made General Superintendent of the West Park System. Some years ago, because of politics, Mr. Jensen was discharged from his position as gardener for the System. Now he is getting revenge. The individual park superintendents will be known as assistant superintendents.</p>
   <p>Reporters who called at his residence were told that Mr. Jensen could not say anything as yet. "The whole Park System is rotten," stated Jensen, "and all I can say is that I certainly shall build up the parks and the many boulevards."</p>
   <p>Mr. Jensen was born in Denmark, and was educated there as a florist and landscape gardener. The whole Park Board is enthusiastic about his appointment.</p>
