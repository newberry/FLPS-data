   <p>The presidential diatribe the other evening would have been most appropriate if it had been delivered by a soap-box orator at a street corner, and not by our dignified President as an executive message "on the state of the Union" from the rostrum of Congress, and broadcast the world over. The greater part of it would--and probably will--be used verbally by any "Red" spellbinder, and reprinted approvingly in the Moscow Pravda.</p>
   <p>If, as surmised, the administration "brainspinners" are mainly responsible for this remarkable appeal to mobocracy, they have put another nail in candidate Roosevelt's political coffin, and added to the inevitability of his departure from public office within a year from date.</p>

   <p>Never in the history of America, or the whole world, has there been a President or, for that matter, any other public official, who so persistently has violated the party platform he solemnly accepted; tried to undermine the Constitution he swore to uphold; or has so often spoken and acted in direct contradiction to his pre-election statements and promises--as has President Roosevelt, especially in regard to taxes, government economy, and other matters of sound public expediency.</p>
   <p>Such glaring inconsistencies, before and after, have been documented by hundreds of people, by simply quoting his public campaign utterances. Some of these deadly parallels are now being presented by B. C. Forbes, one of Hearst's chief financial writers, under the heading "Daily Tax Facts," a sample of which is hereby reprinted.</p>
   <p>Upon whom do taxes actually fall? Let Franklin D. Roosevelt answer.</p>

   <p>Flaying Government extravagance when he was candidate for the presidency in 1932, he said:</p>
   <p>"I shall use this position (as President) of high responsibility to discuss up and down the country, in all seasons, at all times, the duty of reducing taxes, of increasing the efficiency of government, of cutting out the underbrush around our Governmental structure, of getting the most public service for every dollar paid by taxation. This I pledge you, and nothing I have said in the campaign transcends in importance this covenant with the taxpayers of this country."</p>
   <p>Then he enunciated these fundamental truths:</p>
   <p>"Taxes are paid by the sweat of every man who labors, because they are a burden on production, and can be paid only by production. If excessive, they are reflected in idle factories, tax-sold farms, and hence, in hordes of hungry people tramping the streets, and seeking jobs in vain."</p>

   <p>Is President Roosevelt living up to the candidate Roosevelt?</p>
