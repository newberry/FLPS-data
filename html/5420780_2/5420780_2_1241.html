   <p>p.4.col.3..........Mrs. Lucinka Hansen's first Chicago appearance in a lecture at Dania Hall drew a full house. All socialist and other Scandinavian organizations were out in force and both speaker and audience were well pleased with the opening number of the proposed series of meetings Mrs. Hansen's subject was "Bread." The condition of the workingman's lot from the cradle to the grave was realistically portrayed, with vigorous emphasis on the tyrany practiced by the selfish capitalistic parasites. The ideals of the Socialist Party were presented in opposition and in a manner so convincing that it is to be regretted that the whole world could not have been gathered to hear this gifted speaker.</p>
   <p>Lectures by Mrs. Hansen are already scheduled for every night during the coming week, including Sunday September 26, at Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>
