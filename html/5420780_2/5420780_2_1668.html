   <p>A short time ago, excavation for the new addition to the Danish Old People's Home in Norwood Park was begun. Mr. Anton Christensen, who has the contract for brickwork, went to the City Hall to get the building permit, but found a new ordinance limited building in Norwood Park to residences, only. However, negotiations resulted in Mr. Christensen getting the permit, and the work is now in full swing. Mr. Jacob Swendsen has the contract for the carpenter work, and other contracts will be signed when necessary arrangements have been made. Bids, excluding brick and carpenter work, will still be considered, and information can be obtained by calling Architect, A.V.Teisen, 4804 North Kedzie Ave.</p>
   <p>As the work progresses, it will be necessary to pay out considerable amounts. Therefore, we appeal to whoever may wish to contribute, to make their contributions, to the secretary of the building committee, Mrs. James Henriksen, 1024 North Lawler Ave.</p>
