   <p>Our well-known author and lecturer, Mr. Olaf Linck has recently been in Chicago on his way West.</p>
   <p>Mr. Linck has been here before and is usually embarked upon some extensive trip. He is a keen observer and an enjoying and reliable writer. He has written two books of his impressions of America: "Danes under the Stars and Strips" and "The Chance over there."</p>
   <p>This time the trip goes to Prime Ridge Indian Reservation, when he, with the permission from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, will reside and study the remnants of the famous Sioux Indian Tripe. Later on he will visit the Indians of the South.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Of his studies he will write a book.</p>
   <p>We wish Mr. Linck success in his undertaking and hope to get a chance to hear him, when he returns.</p>
