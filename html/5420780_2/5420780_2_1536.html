   <p>The new Committee on Housing recently appointed by the Danish Brotherhood Lodge No. 17 did not hesitate to act when an excellent opportunity appeared. Members of the committee are the Messrs. Sophus Mathiesen, Joseph Meyer, P. Boas, Christian Hermansen and Carl Hansen. Last week they obtained the Lodge's approval to purchase the English-Lutheran Church on Hirsch St. and Fairfield Avenue for $3,500 making a down payment of $100.</p>
   <p>They will remodel the building putting a dining-room and janitor's apartment in the basement. The first floor will contain a hall and stage, and the second floor club facilities. The cost of remodeling will exceed the price paid for the building and when the work is completed the investment in the property will amount to some $9,000.</p>
