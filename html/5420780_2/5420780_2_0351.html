   <p>Louis Hansen passed away last Thursday, in his home, at 600 Linden Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hansen, born in Hyllinge, Denmark, in 1843, was eighty years old. He was a carpenter's apprentice for several years and, in 1865, when he was twenty-two years old, he came to America. He landed in Portland, Maine, worked there for sometime and later went to Boston, where he stayed for about a year, finally he came to Chicago. In 1869, he became a partner in the Goodwillies Frame Factory and shortly after the Chicago Fire he became sole owner. Again, three years after the Chicago Fire, the factory burned to the ground, a total loss. He bought a new building on Washington Street where he stayed until 1883, when he moved to Curtis Street. Later the Northwestern Railroad paid him three hundred thousand dollars for the ground. He finally bought sixteen acres at Le Moyne and Kostner Avenues and erected a five-story factory. At times he had over five hundred workers.</p>
