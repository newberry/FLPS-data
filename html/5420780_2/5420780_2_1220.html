   <p>Dr. Georg Brandes came, saw and won not only the Danish Chicago but also the American and international elements of the city who are familiar with his contributions to and his influence in the world of letters. His visit here was a notable event, and the city paid him a hearty tribute. The Danes themselves feted him in a manner which reflected credit on themselves.</p>
   <p>Professor Brandes arrived last Saturday morning and was met at the depot by a delegation of Danes and a large number of photographers and newspaper reporters, who all accompanied him to the Congress Hotel.</p>
   <p>At a reception in the hotel's Elizabethan Room, about one hundred prominent men and women were present, and C. H. Hasselriis in a well-formed address, opening in English but finishing in Danish, welcomed Brandes to Chicago, on behalf of Danish-Americans of the city. Then followed speeches by the editor of The Dial and secretary of the Twentieth Century Club, Mr. William Morton Payne, and by Dr. Sigismund Zeisler, the latter speaking in German, and Mr. Brandes responded in English, Danish, and German.</p>
   <p>After the reception he was a luncheon guest at the Cliff Dwellers Club.</p>
   <p>At 2:30 P.M. he lectured in English at Orchestra Hall on Shakespeare before a distinguished audience, in which were the city's leaders in the world of art and science.</p>
   <p>At night he was the guest of honor at a dinner party in Carl Antonsen's home on Sheridan Road. At 10 o'clock Sunday morning, Danish singers gathered in front of the hotel and serenaded the eminent visitor, who responded with a speech from the balcony and then invited the serenaders into a reception room, where he shock hands with each one, and talked some more about Danes in foreign lands.</p>
   
   <p>In the afternoon he delivered his second and last lecture in Orchestra Hall on the Napoleonic era in Europe. This time he spoke Danish, and a Danish audience filled the hall.</p>
   <p>The same night a banquet in his honor was given in the Auditorium Hotel, where many speakers vied with each other in paying tribute to the great publicist. In his responding speech, Dr. Brandes thanked the city for the fine reception which it had given him, and in expressing his admiration for America, revealed a sincere appreciation of this country's ranking place in world affairs materially as well as spiritually.</p>
   <p>Thus ended his two-day visit, and the memory of it will stay with us for a long time.</p>
