   <p>At the yearly art exhibit at the Art Institute, we find two Danish-Americans represented, the sculptor Carl Christian Mose, who exhibits a group, "Out of Work," which is exceptionally well done, and the painter Holger W. Jensen, who exhibits two pictures, of which "Between Showers" is the best and worthy of honorable mention.</p>
