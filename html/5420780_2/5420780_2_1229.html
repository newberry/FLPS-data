   <p>"Why should a Union Member be a Social Democrat?" This was the topic for a discussion at the meeting of the S. S. S. of 1895, last Friday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Wilde who made the introductory arguments, stated as his opinion that the road to Socialism would of necessity go through the unions, and that the Socialists, therefore, ought to make their ideas and purposes known among unionists, and enter into a spirit of mutual good-will and cooperation.</p>
   <p>The discussion centered about the various reasons why Socialism has been making so little headway in the unions. Mr. William Petersen took a rather radical stand. He had no support for his statements criticizing the union movement in its present form under the leadership of the American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Federation of labor, and suggesting the I. W. W. as the workers' only salvation.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, a resolution was adopted, pointing out the necessity of establishing Socialistic principles in the unions and of fostering a spirit of unity and loyalty within the latter.</p>
