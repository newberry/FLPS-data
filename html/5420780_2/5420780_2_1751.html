   <p>The Society for the Danish Home for the Aged has resolved to hold a so-called "Arabian Night" summer festival at Kolze's Electric Park, Dunning, on Sunday, July 15. In connection with this social the committee on arrangements has decided to arrange for a public vote to serve as a guide for the Society in regard to the question of building a home for the aged. For a long time the question has been under debate, and some definite decision in the matter is needed.</p>
   <p>Every adult visitor at the festival, whether a member of the Society or not, who arrives at the entrance gate before six o'clock, will receive free a printed ballot containing questions concerning the construction or the rental of a building for use as a home; also questions concerning location, conditions for acceptance, acceptance free of charge, expansion of the Society, etc.; all of which questions are requested to be answered in conformity with rules printed on the ballot. The ballots will be deposited in a box prepared for the purpose.</p>

   <p>The ballot box will be sealed and watched by known responsible men whose names will guarantee to the people the honesty and correctness of the voting and its result. The result of the vote will be announced as soon as the ballots have been counted.</p>
   <p>An expression of opinion in this manner by the visitors will indicate the sentiment of those present, and the fact that these people are participating in the festival will testify to their interest in the cause.</p>
