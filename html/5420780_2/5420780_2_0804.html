   <p>The Ladies Singing Society Illinois inaugurated the season last Saturday in Wicker Park Hall. The hot weather, we believe, was partly responsible for the attendance not being so great. There was, however, a decent audience at the beginning of the concert and more people arrived in the course of the evening.</p>
   <p>The program was well arranged and the performance was audibly appreciated. Professor Paulsen being absent on his visit to Denmark, Miss Clara Jensen made her debut as conductor. The admired soprano handled her job almost to perfection. She seemed to be a little nervous at the beginning, but she regained her composure very quickly.</p>
   <p>We are not exaggerating by stating that the Danish Ladies Choir has never sung better that they did in "Erude Farrden I Kardanger," (Bridal Procession in Mardanger) "Sweetest May," and "Fredman's Epistel Number Nine." They <span class="page-break">\2</span>had to give decapo performances every time.</p>
   <p>The Hartmann Lyric Society was also at its best under the direction of Waldemar Poulsen. Mr. Eugene Wack gace an excellent cornet solo accompanied by the orchestra. Mrs. Louise Dainty did well in her imitations of infant scenes. Last, but not least, we nomination Mr. Schmidt's interpretation of "Den Glade Enke" (The Merry Widow) as an outstanding performance. After the concert there was special dancing.</p>
