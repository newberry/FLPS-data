   <p>At the Art Exhibit in the Art Institute, we saw a well executed bust by Carl Mose, 735 East 75th Street. Lorado Taft was Carl's teacher. He helped Mr. Taft on the monument, "The Fountain of Time," at Washington Park.</p>
   <p>We Danes can be proud of this young Danish-American, who has a chance of becoming a second Thorvaldsen.</p>
