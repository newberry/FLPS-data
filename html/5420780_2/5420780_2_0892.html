   <p>In a poetry competition held in connection with the play, sixty-eight songs have been submitted, from which a committee has made a selection; it is thus clear that the competition has been keen. The first prize is five dollars in gold, to be awarded for the poem judged best by the press; two gold medals will be awarded for the second and third best poems. The music for the various songs has been written by Mrs. gnes Mathiesen, and it is said that the melodies are bright and lively.</p>
