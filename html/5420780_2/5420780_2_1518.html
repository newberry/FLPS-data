   <p>p.2.col. 6......The proposed old age benefit plan, presented for consideration by locals of the Danish Brotherhood Society, is in rough water indeed. Members inclined toward idealism are vigorously opposed by hard headed realists. In an article favoring the idea, a Mr. P. Boe suggests that a monthly assessment of 25 per capita be levied and that the annual conventions be discontinued. He states that the savings per year in discontinuing the annual conventions will alone bring in $25,000.00 per year; a real saving.</p>
   <p>Opponents to the plan insist that it is impractical and unnecessary in view of present policies of the order. As far as care of aged members are concerned the opponents say "There is not an old peoples home in the country that will not gladly admit any aged person at whose death they will be the recipients of $500.00</p>
   
   <p>or $1000.00 to be paid them by the Danish Brotherhood as now provided. The institution of an additional benefit fund would simply be an illustration of the old adage, "too many irons in the fire." Many of those who were formerly enthusiastically in favor of the idea are now absolutely opposed to the adoption of the idea. Indications at this time are that the idea will be dropped once and for all.</p>
