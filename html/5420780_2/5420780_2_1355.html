   <p>Friends and Countrymen:</p>
   <p>Several years ago the Danish National Committee of Chicago asked you for contributions for the erection of a memorial commemorating our famous countryman, Jacob A. Riis, after whom one of our Chicago parks has been named. Many gifts came in and for the money collected a bronze-plaque with inscription was bought and inserted in a granite rock which was placed in the park. Unfortunately, during a period of extensive alterations the bronze plaque has been stolen or mislaid, and researches which have been carried on by both the Danish National Committee and the Park Commission have failed to locate the plaque.</p>
   <p>Now, after a year and a half of discussion about the incident, the 30th National Committee has resolved that, inasmuch as the alterations have been completed, it is the duty of Danes in this city and elsewhere to replace the Riis memorial.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>With your co-operation the Danish National Committee hopes to be able to realize this idea and have the memorial ready for unveiling by next spring or early summer. Each and every one of us ought to be proud to contribute to this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>In behalf of the Danish National Committee we hereby extend our greetings and good wishes, as well as a sincere hope to hear from you.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>O.P. Jensen</p>
