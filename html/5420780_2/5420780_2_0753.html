   <p>As expected, Bjorgvin's Hall was not big enough for Harmonien's concert last Saturday, for everybody knows that at such an event they get their money's worth, and then some.</p>
   <p>The director this time was Mr.Emil Biorn, who has been taking Mr. Mossberg's place during the latter's absence, and the change does not seem to have affected the choir adversely at all.</p>
   <p>The introductory and, in our opinion, also the most impressive number, was a composition by Carl Nielsen, Denmark's most prominent composer at the present time, "You Danish Man," which we also remember so well from the Danish student singer's visit here. The ladies' singing society Illinois also sang one of Nielsen's compositions, and it was a real pleasure to listen to the two choirs render their old and many new numbers.</p>

   <p>Dancing finished up the thoroughly enjoyable evening.</p>
