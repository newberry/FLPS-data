   <p>The dedication of the site on which the Danish Building at the San Francisco World's Fair is to be erected turned out to be a great success. The ceremony was performed under perfect California sunshine in the presence of twenty thousand people. A division of three thousand troops passed in review.</p>
   <p>Pastor Jensen offered the opening prayer. Speeches were made by the following: Mr. Moore, president of the Exhibition; Mayor Rolph; Commissioner of State Rowell; General Murray; James Madison, president of the Danish Committee; and the Danish Ambassador, Constantin Brun.</p>
   <p>Pastor Jensen's daughter, Helga, raised the Danish Flag while the American warship "Marblehead" saluted. Silas Christoffersen performed the stunt of lowering the Danish Flag "from heaven" by dropping it from his aeroplane, an accomplishment that was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm.</p>
