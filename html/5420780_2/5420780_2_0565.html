   <p>Volkmar Johnsen's Gypsy System for guitar, which has been used for over ten years, still "remains the most concise, complete, and comprehensive self-instructor". It can now be used for instruction in banjo, mandolin, and violin also. This system saves the beginner who only wants to be able to play a melody a great deal of time. The system and the different instruments can be bought from the publisher, the Gypsy Publishing Company, 491 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
