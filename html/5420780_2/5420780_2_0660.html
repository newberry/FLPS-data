   <p>The play, "Den Kaere Familie," was a great success; it was played in the Garrick Theatre on February 21. A prologue written by the poet, L. C. Nielsen, was well read by Carl Antonsen. Miss Harriet Hertz sang a couple of songs. The best actor was Carl Antonsen as Friherre Claes. Among the other players were: Mrs. Carl Antonsen, who was very nervous at the start; Miss Magna Petersen, Tom Andersen, Alb. Kear, A. M. Petersen, Edw. Petersen, Thv. Sommer, Mr. Didrichsen, Emanuel Johansen, and Miss Gerda Henius. The play was well done and the result was that Chicago saw the greatest theatre crowd of Chicago-Danes that has been seen since the visit of Mrs. Oda Nielsen, a famous Danish actress from Copenhagen.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that Danish-American Association soon will give another play and thus once more set a good example for all Danish amateur-players in Chicago.</p>
