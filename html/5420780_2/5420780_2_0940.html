   <p>The idea of this building originated in San Francisco, December 1909. Several Danish societies on the Pacific coast started to collect money for this purpose. Their aim was to raise $50,000. A stamp with a picture of the proposed building was sold all over the United States in 1,500,000 copies. By January 1, 1914, the committee had on hand $24,924. And on May 15, 1913, the Danish ambassador, C. Brun, dedicated the lot for the Denmark building at the fair grounds.</p>
   <p>A committee was formed in Chicago in 1912 for this purpose, and on October 5, 1913, a play was produced and $586.38 sent to the Francisco committee. The building is to be built under the supervision of Architect Tyge Hvass. Den Danske Pioneer, Omaha, Nebraska has collected $600 during the year of 1914 for the same purpose.</p>
