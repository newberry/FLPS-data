   <p>p.2.col.4...........Ludvig Holberg and Thv. Kofoed, in presenting their opening performance of "Jeppe paa Bjiget" on Sunday October 24, at Bjorgvins Hall set a new record for attendance at this popular place of amusement. The crowd began coming during the afternoon and enjoyed a preliminary program of music and recitations by Mr. and Mrs. Frandeen and Hans Didrichsen.</p>
   <p>By 7:30 P.M. the hall was so filled that it was physically impossible to admit another person and it is estimated that five-hundred were turned away openly disappointed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kofoed as "Jeppe" was perfect in every way and fully justified his reputation as an artist. His audience was brought to both tears and laughter by his charaterization of the simple, lovable old farmer with his trials and tribulation. Mrs. Julie Boas as Mille and Mr. P. Boas as old shoemaker Jacob were somewhat weak in their portrayal of these characters while "Baron" and "Judge" by Andreas Frandsen could not have been more realisticaly portrayed. The Doctor, the Attorney, the Baliff and <span class="page-break">2</span>Magnus were played by Hans Didrichsen, Alf. Rasmussen, Hugo Meyer and Herman Olsen were pleasing in a natural manner leaving no sense of unreality of exaggeration of character.</p>
   <p>Curtain call brought out every member of the cast and Mr. Kofoed was accorded a real ovation. Lunch was served after the play and Mrs. Kofoed's applause for this part of the evening rivaled that accorded "Jeppe" Kofoed himself.</p>
   <p>The play, by the same cast, is to be presented at Walhalla Hall on Sunday, October 31.</p>
