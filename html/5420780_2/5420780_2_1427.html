   <p>It was forty years ago, on January 2, 1882, that the Danish Brotherhood was organized. At that time, a society called "De Danske Vaabenbrodre," consisting of five locals, was flourishing. This organization was reorganized and named "The Danish Brotherhood," with life insurance and sick benefit departments. Now, the total membership is twenty-two thousand, and it is the only representative society outside Denmark. There are only four living charter members left.</p>
   <p>All of us who are members of the Danish Brotherhood and love the organization were present at this anniversary and we were not disappointed, because there was enthusiasm and a very great brotherly feeling to prove that the Brotherhood still lives up to the ideal for which it was organized.</p>
   <p>The affair was held in the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel, where we saw five Danish flags displayed. Consul Baumann and Lady Baumann were there, and also National Treasurer Rolf Rasmussen, from Kenosha; Supreme Trustee John Christensen, from Cincinnati; Trustee Claus Jensen, from Chicago; and ex-President H. Vogt, from Davenport. The remaining members of the Supreme Executive Committee were not present.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Committee, Brother L. A. Aggerbech, opened the meeting. Brother T. J. Vind, who was to have spoken for America, had not arrived, but we had the pleasure of hearing Brother George P. Jensen, our well-known four-minute man. He eulogized young soldier, Bjerrehus, who had just been buried in the forenoon, and spoke with great sympathy about him. He mentioned Eugene Debs, who had just been released from prison, and quoted him, saying, "I am going to war against war."</p>
   <p>The next speaker was John Christensen from Cincinnati. He spoke for our society, and said that after his love for his family, his love for the Brotherhood was next. He gave a talk on the history of the society, and mentioned some interesting figures.</p>
   
   <p>"We lost," he said, "175 members in 1921, but we have gained 900 new members. We have paid out $1555 for relief. Of the 175 members lost, 160 died, and 15 were dropped. Our expenses are $1.25 per member, which is quite different from the Woodmen of the World Society. They pay $4.31 per member. Death benefits paid when a brother's wife died totalled five thousand dollars for the fiscal year."</p>
   <p>"We love Denmark," said Brother Andersen, "not the old Denmark, but the new Denmark which has grown and prospered in this generation."</p>
   <p>After Brother Andersen's speech, we had the pleasure of hearing the Danish artist, Edward Rasmussen, play a few excellent numbers on the violin. After several other interesting speeches, the affair ended with a good old-fashioned Danish dance.</p>
   <p>Another milepost has been passed in the history of the Danish Brotherhood. Let us all help build our society for the pleasure and benefit of our compatriots who have come to the United States.</p>
