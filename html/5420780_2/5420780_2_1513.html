   <p>p.4.col.3.......On Wednesday September 29, the Chicago lodges of the Danish Brotherhood met in joint union at the Hall of D.B.S. Lodge No. 17 to discuss the proposed establishment of an old age benefit fund. Edward Nielsen, president of D.B.S. No. 17, was elected chairman of the meeting at which three distinct plans were presented.</p>
   <p>A lively general discussion followed the reading of the three plans. The only diversion from the main subject was a criticism by one member who bemoaned the idea of having had the question debated in the open forum of the "Review" and other Danish papers. He contended that this was strictly an D.B.S. affair in which the public was not concerned. The argument was quietly ruled 'out of order', on the grounds that the open forum made it impossible for a majority to force a new ruling without giving every interested member of the order an opportunity to consider the idea and express an opinion. So long as the D.B.S. does not have its own, but is using "Revyen"as its organ of publicity and interlodge communication there could, no just criticism be directed in this case.</p>

   <p>All three benefit plans were rejected by a strong majority who neither felt that this change would prove beneficial nor that an additional expense be a burden already adequate for the carrying out of the aims of the order.</p>
   <p>Reports from other sections indicate that, for the present at least, the D.B.S. will abide by the rules which, to date, have proved to work out satisfactorily in every way.</p>
