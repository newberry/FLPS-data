   <p>The Norwegian paper Nordwest, a Democrat paper of Milwaukee, lately made a bad mistake in stating that Hejmdal is a Republican paper. We are neither Republican nor Democratic. We are independent, and we uphold the best man regardless of party. We have recently exposed all the dirty work of the Republican party. We are independent and write our paper in the most honest way. Remember that, Nordwest.</p>
