   <p>Mogens A. Sommer is dead. He was local-preacher, socialist, agitator and journalist. He has crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 10 times. He hated the Lutheran State Church and all ministers, but was very religious; a fact not so well liked by the old socialist leaders, who all were atheists. After the arrest of the leaders in Denmark in 1872 Mr. Sommer, who then was in Chicago, wrote letters to Pio in order that they might hurt him, when they were opened by the police. That this was not the case is not the fault of Mr. Sommer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sommer also hated the Danish King. He was the one that wrote the articles in Den Danske Pioneer, Omaha, Neb., with their fierce attack on the King of Denmark, with the result that the Pioneer for several years could not be sent to Denmark.</p>

   <p>For more than 40 years Mr. Sommer travelled all over the United States where there was a chance to speak to Danes. His last years were spent in Chicago as a homeopathic doctor and druggist. In 1893 he wrote a book about his work and life in Chicago. The book is now very scarce.</p>
