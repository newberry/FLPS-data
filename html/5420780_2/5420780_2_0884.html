   <p>Ibsen's "Ghosts" was presented in Bjorgvin's Hall last Sunday, and the performance was a decided success, which has hardly been equaled in Chicago's Danish-Norwegian theatre.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Borgny Hammer, as director and instructor deserves most of the credit for the excellent acting and the tasteful stage settings.</p>
   <p>She herself played the role of "Mrs. Alving" with artistic strength and feeling, and Mr. Emil Midelfart, as "Oswald," gave a memorable performance. They both reached the artistic climax in the stirring scenes of the third act.</p>
   <p>The other roles were also in good hands. The audience responded with thundering applause, and the actors took the bow several times.</p>

   <p>The performance will be repeated on May 4 in Bjorgin's Hall.</p>
