   <p>Musical director Ole Nielsen's orchestra, twenty men strong, will give a concert followed by a ball in Walhalla Hall tomorrow at 6.30 P.M.</p>
   <p>This is an annual affair which has always been well worth attending, and for which Mr. Nielsen is making the most careful and exacting preparations.</p>
   <p>As usual, several able soloists are on the program, among them the beloved singer Alb Hesselholdt, from Harmoniens's Choir.</p>
   <p>"King" Jensen, Walhalla's popular host, will be in charge of the culinary department.</p>
