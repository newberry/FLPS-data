   <p>Kirkegaardsforeningen (The Cemetery Society) of the Danish Brotherhood held its annual meeting January 4. The Society was formed in October, 1899. It has bought five thousand square feet of ground at Mount Olive Cemetery. Most of this has been sold to members of the Danish Brotherhood in lots of four to six graves.</p>
   <p>The Society is now working for a great monument to the memory of all members of the Brotherhood that rest in this place. P. J. Thornum (Lodge 18) is president; Carl Hansen (Lodge 17), secretary; and Viggo Danielsen (Lodge 35) is one of the three trustees, who are elected for two years.</p>
