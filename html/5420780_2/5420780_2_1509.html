   <p>p.2.col.5... Dania on Sunday, Nov. 21st, celebrated their 47th anniversary with a tasty banquet prepared by the new hostess, Mrs. Fred Nielsen. The food and service more than measured up to the standard maintained by Dania and their meetings and festivals will continue in unsurpassed popularity. Speakers were plentiful among both members and the sister lodge while Mr. P.Hansen was an honored guest bringing greetings all the way from Denver, Col. Knudsen Ericksen's orchestra entertained during the table session and afterwards the tables were cleared and this baby organization lightly danced its way into its 48th year.</p>
