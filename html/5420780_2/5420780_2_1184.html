   <p>Cavling's book about America has already sold 12,000 copies in Denmark.</p>
   <p>(Mr. Cavling was a very well-known Danish journalist, who traveled all over America several months before he wrote his book, which also had a chapter on Chicago. The book was well written and, being the first large book with many pictures, it was widely read at home, and gave to many their first impression of the United States. The book did not meet with any great favor among the Danish-Americans. They thought it was a little too critical towards America.)</p>
