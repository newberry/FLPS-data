   <p>Danish Brotherhood Dannbrog, Lodge Number 140, celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary.</p>
   <p>The Lodge was organized January 13, 1901. On a cold, miserable rainy day a few Danes met in a hall on Cicero Avenue and Kinzie Street, with the intention of organizing a Danish branch of Dannbrog.</p>
   <p>The neighborhood was old and dilapidated, with old wooden sidewalks and unpaved streets. Twenty-six young Danes were seen wading through the mud to the old wreck of a building that housed Thomas Sayle's Hall.</p>
   <p>The first executives consisted of men who today are, except for a few who have died, prominent in the colony.</p>
   <p>They elected A. Stuhr, president; Rolf Rasmussen, vice-president; John <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Schroder, secretary; Andreas Jensen, cashier. The other offices were filled by Henrik Pommerick, Jorgen Nelson, Ivar Nissen, Andreas Juget, and Louis Smith.</p>
   <p>Today the Lodge still has the following charter members: Alfred Nielsen, Peter Aggerbeck, Louis Aggerbeck, Jorgen Nielsen, Ivar Nissen, Hans Winther, John P. Thomsen, Carl Juliussen, Andrew M. Hansen, and Ole Petersen.</p>
   <p>A ladies group was formed in 1925. The following executives were elected and are serving to date: Mrs. Albertine Nielsen, president; Bertha Bring, secretary and cashier.</p>
   <p>The present executives in D. B. S. No. 140 are Nils Borck, ex-president; George Bring, president; Axel Nielsen, vice-president.</p>
