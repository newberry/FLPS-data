   <p>In last Saturday's supplement of the Chicago Examiner, on art and literature, Art Editor Marcus gave Einar Hansen's, "Portrait of Mrs. F," quite a write - up. He writes:</p>
   <p>"I lingered for a long time by Einar Hansen's "Portrait of Mrs. F," and I returned several times. This picture did not get the award, but it did receive a ribbon for honorable mention.</p>
   <p>"I was told by the attendant that this picture had received more public comment than any other picture exhibited.</p>
   <p>"Mrs. F. is a tired, unfortunate figure with red hair, and wearing a white <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dress. A woman overworked, without any hope for the future, probably a miner's wife. There is unusual pathos in the bowed head, and the long, helpless hands. I have seen women like her around the death shaft at the Cherry Mine, after the cave in; I have seen women like her among the people in Shanty Town in Muncie, Indiana, and among the striking oil-workers in Bayonne, New Jersey.</p>
   <p>"Hansen's picture is well done, the sketch is excellent. His picture reminds me of Carl Melcher's "Holland Woman," but the Chicago artist works with simpler subjects."</p>
   <p>The portrait is also reproduced in the Examiner, with the caption "A much talked about portrait."</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>This picture, which received honorable mention in the Chicago Artists' Exhibition at the Art Institute, is, again we repeat, the most talked about picture at the Exhibit. It is a pathetic portrayal of tiredness and helplessness before the Gods of destiny that rule human existence.</p>
   <p>Danes that have not as yet had the opportunity to see this excellent picture, should do so at once.</p>
