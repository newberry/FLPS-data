   <p>The Scandinavian Socialist Club has engaged Miss Emma Goldman, probably the most noted anarchist lecturer and writer in the United States to speak in the club at corner of Noble and Erie Streets, Sunday 10:30 a.m. Most likely Chicago's police force will take ample care that the dangerous lady does not set out to overturn the capitalistic society. There is no entrance fee, and there will be a lively debate after the meeting.</p>
