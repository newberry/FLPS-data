   <p>p.3. Christmas was observed on December 22, at the Danish Old People's Home in Chicago. The board of directors and the house committee were present. A delicious Christmas dinner was served, Christmas hymns were sung, and useful gifts, fruit and candy distributed. The inmates expressed their joy over being thus remembered. The party broke up rather late, after a very pleasant Christmas eve in the cozy home in Norwood Park.</p>
   <p>On behalf of the residents of the home, I wish to thank all the kind givers who remembered them on this occasion.</p>
