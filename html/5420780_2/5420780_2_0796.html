   <p>p.2.col.3......Four Scandinavian Socialist Singing Societies gave a concert at Wicker Park Hall on Sunday May 16. A large and appreciative audience, composed almost entirely of Danish and Norwegian Chicagoan's attended the affair.</p>
   <p>Choruses taking part were, Scandinavian Socialist, Scandinavian Bakers and Scandinavian Workingmen.</p>
   <p>The Workingmen's chorus is the largest and,undoubtedly,the best trained,although the others gave a good account of themselves too. All four choruses are ably directed by the energetic Swedish Socialist, Mr. E. G. Bergun. The entire concert was testimonial of his untiring effort and efficient leadership.</p>
   <p>As guest artists of the program the following were presented:</p>
   <p>The Womens Socialist Chorus and its soloists, Mrs. Volborg Cleven, soprano,and Mrs. Fausta Marilloc, violin, with Miss Lilly Meyer as accompanist. They were warmly welcomed.</p>
