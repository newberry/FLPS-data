   <p>Harmonien, the Danish singing society, is to give a concert at Studebaker Theatre November 10. The object of the concert is to get money for the proposed trip to Denmark in 1903.</p>
   <p>This is the first time that Danish songs and melodies of composers like Heise, Rung, Hartmann, and Schaefer, sung by Danish voices, will be heard in this theatre where so much fine art has been produced. During the World's Fair it was the intention of the Danish United Choir to sing Abt's "Kongedatteren" (The King's Daughter), but two or three months before the concert at the World's Fair it was given up as too hard to sing. This masterpiece is now going to be sung by Harmonien under the able leadership of Kristian Nilsson.</p>
   <p>The soloists will be Miss Harriest M. Hertz, daughter of Henry L. Hertz, who sang for the first time in the Danish colony at the festival for Elith Reumert. She will sing one German and two Danish songs. The other soloist is the violinist <span class="page-break">\2</span>Marinus Paulsen. The Chicago Musical College Orchestra, consisting of fifty ladies, will also play.</p>
