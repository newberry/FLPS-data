   <p>Spegesilden (The Spiced Herring), the Danish painters' fishing and hunting club, made its bow to the public last Saturday with a ball in Humboldt Hall.</p>
   <p>The club, the membership of which is limited to fifteen, had made elaborate preparations, and enjoyed capacity attendance for its first public appearance.</p>
   <p>Everybody had a good time dancing, consuming large quantities of spiced herring, herring salad, etc., and quenching a colassal thirst thus created.</p>
