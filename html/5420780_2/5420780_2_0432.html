   <p>Mr. S. E. Gross, of the Chicago real-estate firm, is giving a free excursion on the Illinois Central Railroad to Dauphin Park, where he has many fine residential lots for sale.</p>
   <p>Many Danes of the South Side were out there Sunday...and bought lots. The location is only twenty-four minutes' ride on the railroad from Randolph Street. The place already has a church, a public school, and many stores.</p>
