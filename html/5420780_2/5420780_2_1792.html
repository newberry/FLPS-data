   <p>It is with the greatest pleasure, that I take this opportunity of thanking you for your donation of $531.83. Your donations of last year amounted to practically one-third of the amount used by the committee during the year, which is a wonderful credit to your organization.</p>
   <p>The needy, who have benefited by your kindness, are many, and by them surely the appreciation is greatest.</p>
   <p>Allow me to extend all good wishes for prosperity to your society and thank you again.</p>
   <p>Sincerely</p>
   <p>The Danish Relief Fund Committee,</p>
   <p>A. C. Nelson.</p>
