   <p>p. 2.. It can certainly be said without any exaggeration that no modern actress has reached the top of her profession quicker than Miss Gerda, Dr. and Mrs. Henius' young, beautiful daughter.</p>
   <p>In the large cities of the East, Boston, Philadelphia, etc. Miss Henius has had an astounding success as the leading lady in "The Round-up." Her company is not coming to Chicago and the new "star" is to be pressented at a number of performances at McVickers Theatre. Her Chicago debut takes place December 18th. Will our young country-woman have the Chicago critics and public at her feet? We don't doubt that she will, and her debut performance is certain to be a most remarkable event.</p>
   <p>It is, of course, of particular interest to Chicago Danes, who remember her from the time when her beautiful voice entertained them at gatherings in the Danish colony, and as many of us as possibly can will wish to be present at McVickers Theatre on the evening of December 18th.</p>
