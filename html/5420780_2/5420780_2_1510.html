   <p>p.4. col.3.... Plans have already been started for the 1910 picnic of all D.B.S.Lodges in Chicago. This summer's picnic was such a success that a favorable vote was taken in each lodge as to whether they were to make the United Picnic an annual affair.</p>
   <p>As the majority of the lodges had voted unanimously for an out of town picnic a committee consisting of C. Nielsen (17) Hartwig Rasmussen (17) and H. Jespersen (140) was appointed to make arrangements regarding location and transportation.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the picnic are to be allotted one-third for the extension of the employment office, one-third to the reserve fund for future picnics and one-third to be equally divided between the lodges taking part in the picnic.</p>
