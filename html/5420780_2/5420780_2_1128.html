   <p>Arbejderen (The Worker), a Socialist paper that for years has been edited in New York for all Scandinavian Socialists in America, has decided to publish a special Danish edition in Chicago. The Board of Directors made this decision by a great majority. The editor of the Chicago edition will be John Glambeck, who for years has been active in the interest of socialism among the Danes on the South Side. An office has been opened at the corner of 63rd and Halsted Streets. The paper is going to start publication in September.</p>
