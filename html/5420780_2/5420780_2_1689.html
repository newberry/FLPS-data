   <p>The society for the Danish Old People's Home held its annual general membership meeting last Wednesday in Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>The president, Mrs. William Nelson read a report on the activities of the home during the year 1913, and on its present status. Evidently everything is running smoothly, and the membership of the society increased by 86.</p>
   <p>The income from various social gatherings and entertainments arranged for money-raising purposes, amounted to $1,135.54; membership fees, $922.50; gifts, $886.62; admission fees to the home, $650; income from visitors to the home, $332.31; interest on capital $1,246.69; Altogether a net income of $5,173.66. Operating expenses amounted to $3,024.</p>
   <p>Four residents of the home died during the year and four new ones were admitted.</p>

   <p>The president thanked everybody who in one way or the other had contributed to the welfare of the home and its residents.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the building fund committee, Lauritz Olesen, reported that so far more than $2,000 had been collected, and expressed confidence that when definite plans be formulated and construction started, more money would be forthcoming.</p>
   <p>The latest proposal of building a number of cottages instead of one large building was discussed, and arguments were presented for and against. The landscape architect Jens Jensen had prepared a sketch, showing how the cottages might be grouped around the administration building and connected with the latter by a closed-in corridor. However, since this plan is new and no definite information in regard to cost and its practical advantage <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is available, it was decided to authorize the president to appoint a committee which is to obtain accurate date, blueprints, and other necessary material. When this is done, another meeting will be called, and a final decision made.</p>
