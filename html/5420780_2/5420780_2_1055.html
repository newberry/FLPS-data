   <p>In a newspaper office, the New Year means no more than anywhere else, but our newspapers go back into the past with its mileposts that denote either success or failure.</p>
   <p>The older members of the colony will remember the humorous paper Ha Ha that was edited by Volkmar Johnson in 1892. It wasn't much of a paper, the contents could easily fill just one page of the Danish Times..... There wasn't much news, but sometimes the "big shots" in the colony would get some very "satirical" publicity.....</p>
   <p>In 1896, Mr. C. Botker bought Ha Ha. The name was later changed to Revyen <span class="page-break">2</span>(The Review).....  Botker did not have an easy job; there was much financial trouble, but nevertheless the Revyen lasted twenty-five years..... His knowledge and ability as a journalist gave the Revyen a good name.</p>
   <p>In 1921, Botker sold the paper to Frank Philipson.</p>
   <p>The name of the paper was then changed again and it became the Dansk Tidende (Danish Times). A stock company was formed which published the newspaper for several years, until 1925, when the stock company dissolved and the newspaper was bought by a partnership.</p>
