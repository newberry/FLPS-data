   <p>The football club Thor was defeated last Sunday by the Western Electric team. As an excuse, it is pointed out that two of the Danish players were painfully hurt and partly disabled early in the game. Besides, the wind, which was against Thor during the first half turned straight about at the second half to favor the Electricians all the time.</p>
   <p>The club is hoping better luck to-morrow, when it will play the Norwegian club Fram, at 3 P.M., at North and 48th Avenues.</p>
