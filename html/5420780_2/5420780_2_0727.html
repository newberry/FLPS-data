   <p>Ole Nielsen's, thirty-piece orchestra gave a concert in Humboldt Park, with a large and varied program, which partly consisted of Scandinavian compositions, such as, "Drommebilleder" (Dream Pictures), " Der Var Engang" (Once Upon a Time), "Champagnegaloppen," and "Per Gynt".</p>
   <p>Tuesday evening, August 21, a concert will be given in Logan Square Park.</p>
   <p>It is so that a desire for Scandinavian music will be created, and it will take its rightful place. These concerts were made possible through the efforts of bank president Hansen, and because director Ole Nielsen is known <span class="page-break">\2</span>to be a musician of the highest quality. We hope that the people of the Northwest Side will respond and show an interest in these concerts, so that they may be made a permanent feature.</p>
