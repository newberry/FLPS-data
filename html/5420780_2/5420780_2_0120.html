   <p>The sales tax is advocated in an editorial in The Daily News as the most effective means of meeting the demands of the unemployed for relief, and passage of such a measure is urged by the special session of the legislature. It is, indeed, surprising that The Daily News should even for a moment endorse such a tax, which has been proven to be a cause of unemployment.</p>
   <p>The levying of taxation which must be paid by industry in order to get a fund for unemployment relief defeats its own end, for such taxation, by interfering with production and exchange, creates unemployment and reduces the demand for goods in other quarters.</p>
   <p>A sales tax increases the price of goods; the purchasing power of the people is less; the stores sell less; the factories will manufacture less, and will <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>need less help. In this way unemployment will increase, thus adding to our relief problem.</p>
   <p>The sales tax is also a poor man's burden. For the purposes of this discussion let us assume that the tax is five per cent. Now let us see who carries the brunt of the tax according to income.</p>

   <p>Under the sales tax, the man with the biggest income pays the lowest percentage, while the man with the smallest income pays the highest.</p>

   <p>Where is the relief for the poor man?</p>
   <p>This writer agrees with The Daily News that a "policy of drift is dangerous." What our legislators should do is acquaint themselves with Henry George's marvelous work, "Progress and Poverty," and the "single tax," then they would truly be on the way to economic relief. This is no time for halfway measures. For eighty years this country has heard the cry of the professional politicians for "temporary" relief. It will only put us in a more inextricable position. The single tax is inevitable, so why shouldn't Illinois lead the way?</p>
