   <p>The literary meeting of the Trinitatis Lutheran Church, held last Friday, drew a large audience in spite of the inclement weather. Reverend Rordam opened the meeting with a lecture on the poet Christian Richardt, after which Mrs. Rordam read several of Richardt's poems, and Mr. Johannes Hendriksen sang two of his songs.</p>
   <p>These literary meetings seem to have won a hearty response from the public, which is informed in advance regarding the authors to be discussed.</p>
   <p>At the coming literary meeting in April, the works of H. C. Hostrup will be discussed, and one act of his play, "Gjenboerne" (The People Across the Street), will be presented.</p>
