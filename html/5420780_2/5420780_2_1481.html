   <p>Dannebrog (The Danish flag) and the Stars and Stripes were waving side by side last Sunday over the new Dania Hall, 1651-53 Kedzie Avenue, which is being acclaimed by everybody who sees it as the finest building in the Humboldt Park district. Its red brick front, with sandstone ornaments, and the green, glazed tile roof, give an artistic and solid impression, and the interior, to the last detail, has been planned with an eye to utility, comfort and beauty. A roomy front hall, flanked by two seperate wardrobes for ladies and men and a ladies' sitting room, leads into the large assembly hall with its high ceiling and up-to-date lighting and ventilating system; it also contains a medium sized stage.</p>
   <p>A large light kitchen, bar and dining room, and a bowling alley are located in the basement, which together with the facilities on the first floor will be available for other societies and organizations that may wish to hire <span class="page-break">2</span>them for assemblies of any kind.</p>
   <p>The clubrooms proper, provided with special entrances, are located on the second floor, which contains a billiard room, card room, library, committee room, a large and a small dining room, rest rooms, and also the caretaker's apartment.</p>
   <p>When everything is decorated and furnished according to plans Dania will have a home in which modern accommodations, comfort and elegance are combined in a genuinely Danish atmosphere.</p>
   <p>The building committee, who together with the able architect Carl Nielsen, has directed the work, consists of P. Christensen, Dania's president, M. Houlberg, Fritz Frantzen, N. Herskind Petersen and C. H. C. Nielsen.</p>
   <p>All work has been done by Danish contractors.</p>

   <p>A pre-opening luncheon was held in the main hall last Sunday, where some 250 Dania members in speeches and in song, expressed their pleasure over the society's new home and their high hopes for its future.</p>
