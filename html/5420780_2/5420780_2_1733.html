   <p>The property in Norwood Park has now been bought by the two trustees, Henry L. Hertz and Mrs. Catherina Toft, with D. M. Frederiksen as legal adviser. The third trustee, Consul [C. H.] Hansen, is at present on a visit to Denmark. The property was bought for $7,500, but the owner, Mr. Fisher, donated $250 to the Home, so the price was really $7,250.</p>
   <p>Two committees will now be formed, one for the furnishing of the house, and one for the admittance of old people to the Home. The Society will also arrange a picnic in Elm Tree Grove August 17.</p>
   <p>Revyen is very proud of having done its share in fighting for the Norwood project, which is sure to prove itself to be the best thing that could happen.</p>
