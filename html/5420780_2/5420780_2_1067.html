   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>You, Kristian Baun, are, without any doubt, the first successful editor of Danish Newspapers in Chicago. The paper is full of interesting news, editorials, and good reading in general. We feel that we now have a permanent Danish newspaper. Good Luck.</p>
   <p>With fraternal greetings,</p>
   <p>Soren Iversen,</p>
   <p>Supreme president,</p>
   <p>Danish Brotherhood of America.</p>
