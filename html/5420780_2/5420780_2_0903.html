   <p>p. 2 col. 2....Henrik Ibsen's new play "Naar vi dode vaagner" was played at Scandia Hall, Sunday, Feb. 11, Practically all seats were taken.</p>
   <p>The play was fine from the beginning to the end; this was a great surprise after having been "used to sippy training, sloven instruction and mediocre plays outside of the annual review and the lighter vaudevilles."</p>
   <p>N. Henriksen, the sculptor, painted some fine decorations. Viking Marine Band played under the direction of Math. Petersen.</p>
   <p>The play had a fine critique in the Chicago Tribune.</p>
