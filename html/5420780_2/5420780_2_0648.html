   <p>"The Havoc," the play which has had such phenomenal success on the American stage, and which was written by the young Danish-American, H. S. Sheldon, will be presented for the first time in Chicago, tomorrow, at the Illinois Theatre. The play, which was reviewed in Revyen some time ago, is a marital drama, depicting a matrimonial triangle, analyzed and dramatized with such excellent pertinence and technique that the young author has been placed, by some critics, on a level with George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen.</p>
   <p>The success enjoyed by "The Havoc" is partly due to the fact that Henry Miller, one of the outstanding dramatic-realistic actors of the American theatre, is playing the leading role, which is so well suited to his particular talent.</p>

   <p>One critic has described the play as " a most diabolically clever and puzzling play, most diabolically well acted."</p>
   <p>Its presentation will be of particular interest to Chicago, where Mr. Sheldon has his home, and, undoubtedly, many Danes will take the opportunity to visit the Illinois Theatre during the next two weeks.</p>
