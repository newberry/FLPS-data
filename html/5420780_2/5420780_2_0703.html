   <p>The Ladies' Singing Society, Illinois, gave a concert in Wicker Park Hall Sunday, May 24. The hall was packed and the audience followed the performance attentively. Illinois was assisted by the Norwegian Ladies' Choir, Oselia, which gave an excellent performance that brought well deserved applause. The Danish Workmen's Singing Society also participated.</p>
   <p>There were violin solos by Miss Aodrewfall and cello solos by Miss Emily Barfield, both of whom performed in a most appealing manner.</p>
   <p>The concert was one for which Illinois deserves credit and honor.</p>
   <p>Next year Illinois will celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary by giving another May concert. We hereby congratulate its ambitious members <span class="page-break">2</span>and wish them all sucess.</p>
