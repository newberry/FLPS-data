   <p>p.2......Editor: Surely you are mistaken when you say that there are a dozen Danish doctors in Chicago. There can hardly be more than half that number.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>

   <p>Editor's Note:</p>
   <p>Here are the names of thirteen Danish doctors in Chicago: Joensen (Nestor), C. Nielsen, John Matzen, Gissing, Roan Paulsen, Clemensen, Dahl, J. Milsen, Rumpf, Hoage, Knud Hartnack, Bechstrom.</p>
   <p>There are probably some more.</p>
