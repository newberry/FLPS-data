   <p>p.2........John Valk, the editor of Nordlyset, (Northern Light) who a few months ago celebrated his 60th birthday, is planning to publish a collection of his Danish and English poems, provided 500 buyers can be pledged beforehand. That should be easy! John Valk is such a characteristic and sympathetic representative of Danish-American Culture and such an excellent poet that his works ought to be enthusiastically received by a much greater number of people than the 500, necessary to cover the publishing expenses.</p>
   <p>Besides Mr. Valk's own works in Danish and English, the issue will contain other beloved poems, translated from English to Danish and from Danish to English; in the latter group are poems by Drachmann, Bjornson, Stuckenberg and others, which have previously appeared in American Publications, and thus made these names known to Americans.</p>
