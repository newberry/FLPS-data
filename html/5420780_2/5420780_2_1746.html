   <p>1. That the committee on laws and the building committee be dismissed.</p>
   <p>2. That all members have the right to vote from the day they join the society.</p>
   <p>3. That a committee on law consisting of five women and four men work out a proposal in three days; that this be mailed to all members, and that a new meeting be called April 10.</p>
