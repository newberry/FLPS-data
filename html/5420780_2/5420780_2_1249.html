   <p>A meeting was held in Danish Young People's Home last Sunday night during which the topic. "The Art of Living" was discussed. The subject discussed at the previous meeting was "Religion and Morals."</p>
   <p>The first speaker last Sunday, Mr. Svend Gjorup, held that we could not depend on our brains alone as a stablizing factor in life; he emphasized it was faith and religious feelings that made life worth living, and the safest values to die on, too, for that matter.</p>
   <p>These points of views were supported by the Reverend Gjorup who functioned as chairman and toastmaster. Two young Norwegians revealed their views as freethinkers, and so did Anarchist Olsen who was so eager to do away with the ministers that he went far beyond the subject. Mr. Carl Jacobsen distinguished between religious faith and human faith, and emphasized the importance of maintaining views of life based on reality and human progress. Mr. C. Madsen held that it was work in particular that made life worth living, and objected to several statements made by the other speakers.</p>
   <p>In two weeks there will be another meeting where, possibly, the same subject will be discussed.</p>
