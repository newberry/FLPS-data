   <p>Magneten ushered in the concert and Ball season last Saturday in Wicker Park Hall, with a program of singing and other entertainment which was greatly enjoyed by the hundreds of Danes which attented the affair.</p>
   <p>We wish to express our admiration for the many excellent voices which the singing society now possesses, and for the perfect technique with which the forty men chorus executes its numbers.</p>
   <p>The four clowns were really funn, and Mrs, Agnes Mathiesen's dance orchestra did a fine job.</p>
