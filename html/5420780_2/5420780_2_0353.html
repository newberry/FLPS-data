   <p>Many years ago, in the days of cable cars on State Street, and horse cars on the South Side, Rasmus Fuglsang started a small moving business on the corner of 58th and State Streets. In 1898, he bought the building, and reorganized his firm as a storage company. Then, when the alley "L" extended its tracks south, it happened that their right of way was the exact center of Fuglsangs' building. What was left was too small so, in 1912, a larger building was built farther south and the new business boomed. One truck after another replaced the horse-drawn vans then in use, storage space became inadequate, and Rasmus had to build again; this time, five stories with forty thousand cubic feet of storage space.</p>
   <p>Fuglsang, came to America in 1894. He belongs to the Masons and D. B. S. No. 35. Good Luck, Rasmus, keep up the good work. We Danish peasants know how!</p>
