   <p>The well known dealer in woolen wear, J. Jensen, has just rented a four-story brick building, 481 Milwaukee Avenue, where he has opened a factory and a warehouse. It is not so many years ago that Mr. Jensen went from house to house and sold his fine goods. Many of the new machines are invented by Mr. Jensen himself. His goods are now sold by Marshall Field &amp; Co.</p>
