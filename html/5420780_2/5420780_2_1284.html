   <p>The Scandinavian-American Athletic Union of Illinois has now been in existence for one year, and observed the occasion last Saturday with a banquet in the "Tavern."</p>
   <p>The organization comprises eight sports clubs with an aggregate membership of 3,000, namely, the Danish-American Athletic Club, the Norwegian clubs, Sleiapner, Norwegian Turners, and Scandia, and the Swedish clubs Eskild, Brage, Sparta, and the Swedish Gymnastic and Athletic Union.</p>
   <p>An elaborate dinner was served, and representatives of the member-clubs addressed the gathering. So did the Danish club's honorary member, "Battling" Nelson, who related a few interesting experiences from his boxing career. Sometime ago he donated a beautiful cup for the "all around championship," for which the clubs will compete this summer.</p>
