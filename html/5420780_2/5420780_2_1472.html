   <p>The bazaar arranged jointly by the Brotherhood and Sisterhood lodges, the profit of which will go to their building fund, opened a week ago Thursday and continued through Sunday.</p>
   <p>The rather disappointing attendance during the first three days was made up for on Sunday, when so many people clamored to get in that the police had to take charge at the door.</p>
   <p>The bazaar did a land office business, and at the end of the day two lamps constituted the left over merchandise. The affair netted from $1,000 to $1,200.</p>
   <p>The ladies singing society Illinois, The Workers Singing Society, Mr. and Mrs. Frandsen, Miss Corydon, and many others took care of the entertainment, so the bazaar was also in that respect a success.</p>
