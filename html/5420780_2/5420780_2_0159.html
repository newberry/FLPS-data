   <p>With laws we shall build a nation says an inscription over the main entrance to the City Hall of Copenhagen. In this country we would come closer to hitting the point if we put it thus: "With laws we will ruin the nation." The greatest lawmakers sometimes turn out to be equally great public enemies. The state of New York has 50,000 laws but would probably do much better with 500.</p>
   <p>A law is - or ought to be - a convenant of the people, and a guide for their common intercourse too sacred to violate. Any one guilty of violation should be regarded as a public enemy and treated accordingly. As it is now any influential person can manage to have a law passed in his favor but contradictory to sound morals, and the consequence is increased disrespect for legislation as a whole.</p>
   <p>Instead of tangling ourselves up in laws studded with unintelligible paragraphs <span class="page-break">\2</span>suitable for interpretations made to order, would it not be better to have a few fundamental laws, and in addition teach people to co-operate in efforts to solve problems? Then probably the sport of evading the law would be less popular. The fact that our courts are influenced by politics makes the situation just that much more complicated.</p>
   <p>Russell Scott, the murderer was acquitted because a physician declared him insane. To be sure, a man with a normal mind, and conscious of the fact that he would subject himself to the death penalty for killing and robbing another person would hardly do so for the sake of a few dollars; but a degenerated individual who has observed criminals go free, even after committing serious crimes, will take a chance on it. Had he known for sure that, if caught, he would have to pay with his life, maybe he would have hesitated.</p>
   <p>The American people are sentimental, it seems, and maybe it is brutal to hang a man for his crimes, but it is necessary. In olden days the process was not even <span class="page-break">\3</span>finished with the hanging. The heads of the criminals were put on sticks and carried around town to terrify "would be" criminals.</p>
   <p>Of course we would not go that far, but one thing is sure, American laws will have to be revised, and it will not do for us to elect any Tom, Dick and Harry to make new ones.</p>
