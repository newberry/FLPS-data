   <p>We hear from Milano, Italy, that Gerda Henius, the opera singer, has become a great success in "Valkyrie," at the La Scala Opera House.</p>
   <p>The newspaper La Provincia li Como, writes: "Gerda Henius gave an impersonation of "Sieglinda" with extremely great intuition in revealing the primitive sentiments that abound in this personage: the sweeping passion, the instinct of motherhood, and of revenge. Some of her impulses (in the duet in Act one; the great scene in Act two; and the cry in the last act) were portrayed with really exceptional and vital strength and conviction. Her splendid vocal resources with brilliant, robust, and well-sustained high notes she adapts splendidly to the difficult part assigned to her and one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>can easily see that long and patient study has given her the control of her voice that she has and shows how this artist has been able to reason out the demands of the music and classic line of the Wagnerian style."</p>
   <p>Gerda Henius, as we all know, is the daughter of Dr. Max Henius. She was born in Chicago but she is able to speak Italian, Danish, and French fluently.</p>
   <p>Her Chicago success was as "Vallentin" in "Faust", for which she received the Ziegfeld Musical College's diamond studded medal. She later appeared in "The Round Up" as "Echo."</p>
   <p>For many years she was the leading lady of the Essanay Film Company in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Chicago, and she appeared in the film "The Song in the Dark."</p>
   <p>She is married to Mr. Carlo Edwards, stage director of the Metropolitan Opera Company. She studied in Rome and in Milano, under maestro Giroldino.</p>
   <p>Some of her recent appearances were: as "Aida" in "Cavalleria Rusticana;" "La Tosco," "La Belle Helene" in "Mephistopheles," and a number of other grand operas.</p>
