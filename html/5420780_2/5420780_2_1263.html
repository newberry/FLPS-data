   <p>Povl Geleff's lecture last Monday evening attracted about three hundred people to Aurora Turner Hall. Mr. Thorsmark introduced Mr. Geleff to the Singing Society International, which sang a few songs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Geleff claimed that the paper Skandinaven had been of great help to him in choosing the material for his lecture. He read an article that Skandinaven had once printed, regarding socialism and communism as one. He contradicted that idea, but said that socialism at the present time is very strong in every part of Europe. He stated that in Denmark ninety-nine out of every hundred laborers were for the socialist doctrine.</p>
