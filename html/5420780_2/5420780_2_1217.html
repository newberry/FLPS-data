   <p>At the International Congress of Women recently held in Washington, D.C. attended by the most prominent women from all over the world, Denmark was adequately represented by Miss Henni Forchhammer.</p>
   <p>Miss Forchhammer has been a leading figure in the feminine world of Denmark for many years. She was president of Danish Women's National Council from 1913 and vice-president of the International Women's Council from 1914.</p>
   <p>For five years she was a member of the Danish delegation to the League of Nations. Miss Forchhammer is known and respected both as an author and as a lecturer. She is a smart woman and a refined personality.</p>
   <p>It is a pleasure for us to announce that Miss Forchhammer will visit Chicago and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that she will give a lecture in St. Ansgar's Church Friday, May 29. Her subject will be: "The League of Nations." We feel sure that many will take pleasure in attending this lecture because Miss Forchhammer is particularly qualified to deal with this subject. Everybody is welcome. Tickets at the entrance, 35c.</p>
